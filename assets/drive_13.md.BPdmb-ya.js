She started working in restaurant business in her early 20s and admitted in Palomar College where she studied theater and art. She took admission in University of Hawaii for higher studies and worked at Hyatt Regency hotel in the Waikiki Beach area where she worked for five years.  Career  Thorn worked at Images International, one of the prestigious art galleries at Hawaii which went out of business during recession of 1990s. When the company went out of business she thought of setting up her own art gallery, and started selling arts in meeting rooms of hotels loaded in a U-haul trailer. In 1998 Ruth-Ann Thorn and her mother Gloria Lee founded a gallery, EC Gallery. Before the inception of EC Gallery, Thorn worked at an art gallery, Images International of Hawaii, in Hyatt Regency hotel in the Waikiki Beach area and this inspired Thorn to open her own Art Gallery. After spending 5 years at Images she wanted to open her own art gallery but couldn't open because she was refused a loan from the bank. In 1998 she opened her first art gallery in La Jolla and closed that and opened one at Fashion Valley in San Diego. In 2002 she opened Crown Thorn Publishing representing unknown artists and bringing them to market. Thereafter she opened several art galleries in different cities of the USA. She opened a 5,000 sq ft gallery in Solana Beach in November 2018. She has been working with the Tribal Council and Cultural Committee for presenting the cultural and historical aspects of the tribes through art.

Since inception Thorn had spread the location of EC Gallery to different localities of USA, now she will bring artist from different regions and plans to host two shows; “Winter Wonderland” in January and “Hearts and Flowers” in February. Thorn started a documentary series, “Art of the City” in 2019 aimed at helping people understand that an art is not just a piece of art, it has a whole story of life experience of the artist. Locale and art are interconnected, and without knowing the locale we can’t understand the theme of the art. When patrons know the artist personally they’ll be able to understand the art in a better way. For this, she has been traveling across the United States interviewing those artists who have resided in a specific city for more than 25 years. In Santa Fe she interviewed Roxanne Swentzell, George Rivera, Raymond Nordwall, and Nocona Burgess. In San Diego, she interviewed prominent artists from diverse backgrounds; James Hubbell, Victor Ochoa, Michael Flohr, and Gloria Lee.

Founded in 1999, the league planned a 2004 season, but was forced to fold due to the 2004 Democratic National Convention, which was being held in Boston. From 1999 to 2002, the league was sponsored by grocery store chain Shaw's. In 2003, footwear and apparel company Reebok became the title sponsor of the league. History The Shaw's Pro Summer League was announced in 1999 as an off-season development league hosted by the Boston Celtics at Clark Athletic Center on the campus of the University of Massachusetts Boston. Along with the Celtics, the league featured the Indiana Pacers, New Jersey Nets, New York Knicks, Philadelphia 76ers, Washington Wizards and Seattle SuperSonics. There was also a select team of members of the 1999 German men's national basketball team. Tickets for the league were $8, which was good for two games. Shaw's, a grocery store chain, gave away 11,000 tickets in conjunction with the United Way of Massachusetts Bay. The Reebok Pro Summer League, formerly the Shaw's Pro Summer League, was held on the campus of the University of Massachusetts Boston (pictured) from 1999 to 2003. In March 2000, the Boston Celtics announced the Shaw's Pro Summer League would return to the University of Massachusetts Boston campus from July 17 to July 24. Between July 18 and July 20 three games were broadcast on ESPN2. During the 2000 season, Shaw's sponsored the Shaw's Cup, which was an award given to the most valuable player in the league. The inaugural award was given to Desmond Mason of the Seattle SuperSonics. He was also named to the 2000 Shaw's Pro Summer League All-Tournament team, along with Shammond Williams, Michael Redd, Jumaine Jones and Jeff Foster. Williams, who also played for Seattle, led the league in scoring with 20.5 points per game, followed by Mason who averaged 18.2 points per game. The two led the SuperSonics to a 5–1 record, which was tied for first place with the Milwaukee Bucks. Philadelphia 76ers player Raja Bell won the 2001 Shaw's Cup, which was given to the league's most valuable player. He averaged 21.4 points per game and shot 61.5 percent from the field. Bell was also named to the Shaw's Pro Summer League All-League team along with teammate Jumaine Jones, Dion Glover of the Atlanta Hawks, Kwame Brown of the Washington Wizards and Joe Johnson of the Boston Celtics. The New Jersey Nets defeated the 76ers, 93–89 for the 2001 league title. The Nets had a 5–1 record. The league's logo in 2002 when the title sponsor was Shaw's grocery store. In 2002, the league featured ten teams—the host Boston Celtics, the Atlanta Hawks, Milwaukee Bucks, Minnesota Timberwolves, New Jersey Nets, New York Knicks, Orlando Magic, Philadelphia 76ers, San Antonio Spurs, and Washington Wizards. The 2002 Shaws Cup, which was awarded to the league's most valuable player, was won by Dion Glover of the Atlanta Hawks. He averaged 17.8 points per game in six games played. The Hawks had a perfect 6–0 record and were crowned league champions. Reebok became the league's title sponsor in 2003. That season, the league went from July 14 to July 20 and was again held at Clark Athletic Center Gymnasium at the University of Massachusetts Boston. NBA TV broadcast nine games from the Reebok Pro Summer League, starting with a July 16 game between the Celtics and San Antonio Spurs. Matt Devlin and Spero Dedes served as the play-by-play announcer and Bill Raftery and Sam Vincent were the color commentator. The league had unique rules that differed from regular season NBA rules. Quarters were limited from 12 to 10 minutes with three minute overtime periods if necessary, no mandatory timeouts (unless the game is broadcast on television), and the foul penalty was seven. No player was eligible to be fouled out, but after a player's sixth foul any subsequent fouls by that player would result in a single technical foul shot. Ten teams competed that year, with the San Antonio Spurs winning the league title with a 6–0 record. The 2004 Democratic National Convention caused a scarcity of lodging in Boston, so the Reebok Pro Summer League scrapped its season and folded into the Las Vegas Summer League. In 2003, John Salmons of the Philadelphia 76ers was named the league's Most Outstanding Player with an average of 19.6 points and 5.8 assists per game. Salmons was also named to the Reebok Pro Summer League First Team with Kedrick Brown and Brandon Hunter of the Boston Celtics, Devin Brown of the San Antonio Spurs and Donny Marshall of the New Jersey Nets. The second team consisted of Juan Dixon of the Washington Wizards, T.J. Ford of the Milwaukee Bucks, Marcus Banks of the Boston Celtics, Brian Scalabrine of the New Jersey Nets and Carlos Boozer of the Cleveland Cavaliers. The league planned to continue in 2004, but that year's Democratic National Convention was being held in Boston, and as a result hotel rooms were scarce. Warren LeGarie invited the Reebok Pro Summer League teams—the Boston Celtics, Cleveland Cavaliers, Denver Nuggets, Phoenix Suns, and Washington Wizards—to play in his upstart league, the Las Vegas Summer League. The league is now owned and run by the National Basketball Association. =Notable players=Rafer Alston (2000) *Chucky Atkins (1999) *Tony Battie (1999–2000) *Raja Bell (2001) *Steve Blake (2003) *Mark Blount (2000) *Carlos Boozer (2003) *Kwame Brown (2001–03) *Rick Brunson (1999–2001) *Speedy Claxton (2001) *Jason Collins (2002) *Samuel Dalembert (2001, 2003) *Boris Diaw (2003) *Dan Dickau (2002–03) *Juan Dixon (2002–03) *Pervis Ellison (1999) *Maurice Evans (2002) *T.J.

These treebanks are openly accessible and available. Core applications are automated text processing in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and research into natural language syntax and grammar, especially within linguistic typology. The project's primary aim is to achieve cross-linguistic consistency of annotation, while still permitting language-specific extensions when necessary. The annotation scheme has it roots in three related projects: Stanford Dependencies, Google universal part-of-speech tags,, and the Interset interlingua for morphosyntactic tagsets. The UD annotation scheme uses a representation in the form of dependency trees as opposed to a phrase structure trees. At the present time (February 2019), there are just over 100 treebanks of more than 70 languages available in the UD inventory. Dependency structures The UD annotation scheme produces syntactic analyses of sentences in terms of the dependencies of dependency grammar. Each dependency is characterized in terms of a syntactic function, which is shown using a label on the dependency edge. For example:The three example analyses that appear in this section have been taken from the UD webpage here, examples 3, 21, and 23. First UD picture This analysis shows that she, him, and a note are dependents of the left. The pronoun she is identified as a nominal subject (nsubj), the pronoun him as an indirect object (iobj) and the noun phrase a note as a direct object (obj)  there is a further dependency that connects a to note, although it is not shown. A second example: UD picture 2 This analysis identifies it as the subject (nsubj), is as the copula (cop), and for as a case marker (case), all of which are shown as dependents of the root word her, which is a pronoun. The next example includes an expletive and an oblique object: UD picture 3 This analysis identifies there as an expletive (expl), food as a nominal subject (nsubj), kitchen as an oblique object (obl), and in as a case marker (case)  there is also a dependency connecting the to kitchen, but it is not shown. Note that the copula is in this case is positioned as the root of the sentence, a fact that is contrary to how the copula is analyzed in the second example just above, where it is positioned as a dependent of the root. The examples of UD annotation just provided can of course give only an impression of the nature of the UD project and its annotation scheme. The emphasis for UD is on producing cross-linguistically consistent dependency analyses in order to facilitate structural parallelism across diverse languages. To this end, UD uses a universal POS tagset for all languages  although a given language does not have to make use of each tag. More specific information can be added to each word by means of a free morpho- syntactic feature set. The universal labels of dependency links can be specified with secondary relations, which are indicated as a secondary label behind a colon, e.g. nsubj:pass, following the \\"universal:extension\\" format. Function words Within the dependency grammar community, the UD annotation scheme is controversial. The main bone of contention concerns the analysis of function words. UD chooses to subordinate function words to content words,The choice was led by Nivre (2015). a practice that is contrary to most works in the tradition of dependency grammar.The controversy surrounding UD and the status of function words in dependency grammar in general are discussed at length in Osborne & Gerdes (2019). To briefly illustrate this controversy, UD would produce the following structural analysis of the sentence given: Fourth UD picture, illustrates analysis of function words This example is taken from the article here.The structure is (1b) in Osborne & Gerdes (2019) article. An alternative convention for showing dependencies is now used, different from the convention above. Since the syntactic functions are not important for the point at hand, they are excluded from this structural analysis. What is important is the manner in which this UD analysis subordinates the auxiliary verb will to the content verb say, the preposition to to the pronoun you, the subordinator that to the content verb likes, and the particle to to the content verb swim. A more traditional dependency grammar analysis of this sentence, one that is motivated more by syntactic considerations than by semantic ones, looks like this:This structure is (1c) in Osborne & Gerdes (2019) article. UD picture 5 This traditional analysis subordinates the content verb say to the auxiliary verb will, the pronoun you to the preposition to, the content verb likes to the subordinator that, and the content verb swim to the participle to.

It was built in 1647 and became operational in 1649 as part of the construction of a line of forts to control access to Lisbon, which stretched from Cabo da Roca on the Atlantic coast to the Belém Tower near Lisbon. The fort is well preserved, following its original design, and is considered one of the most attractive examples of maritime military architecture on the Portuguse coast. It presently serves as the headquarters of the Associação Portuguesa dos Amigos dos Castelos (Portuguese association of friends of castles). History During the Portuguese Restoration War, King John IV of Portugal identified the need to strengthen Lisbon's defences in the face of attacks by the Spanish navy. In 1647 he ordered construction of a fort at Caxias to improve the defence of the right bank of the Tagus by making possible crossfire with the Fort of Nossa Senhora do Vale (Our Lady of the Valley) to the east, now demolished, and the Fort of Giribita to the west, thus reinforcing the major Fort of São Julião da Barra to the west. António Luís de Meneses, 1st Marquis of Marialva, was given responsibility for the work. Built on a rocky outcrop into the river estuary, the Fort of São Bruno (taking its name from a nearby convent) is in the shape of a star around a raised central square. Following a Mannerist style, it was built with batteries targeted at both the estuary and towards the land, together with rectangular bartizans on the front corners. The entrance to the interior is through a large arched gate, on which was placed the shield of Portugal, with the date 1647. It was equipped with cannon in 1649. A military inspection carried out in 1735 reported that the fort was deactivated and all its artillery had been destroyed. It also stated that at least one of the lower batteries had been invaded by sand. Some repairs took place in 1751 and the fort seems to have emerged relatively unscathed from the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Throughout the 18th century the fort was deactivated on several occasions and was reported on one occasion to be occupied by farmers. However, it was again in operation during the Spanish-Portuguese War of 1762–1763, being armed with 16 cannon. View of the fort from the east King Miguel I used the fort in 1831 for target practice, using its artillery to aim at barges moored in the middle of the Tagus for that purpose. These were the only occasions on which artillery has been fired from the fort. With the end of the Portuguese Civil War the fort was once again deactivated. After that it ceased to be used for military purposes and in 1888 was leased to a private individual for nine years. In 1902 it was handed back to the Government and in 1903 occupied by the Guarda Fiscal, the Portuguese Customs and Excise department, to guard against smuggling. The Guarda Fiscal was responsible for it until 1946, although in 1941 it was used as a sailing centre by the Mocidade Portuguesa, a youth organization of the right-wing Estado Novo Government. A well-supported campaign in 1999-2000 for the restoration of the fort and improvements to the surrounding area led to significant work being carried out by the Oeiras municipality.

If both the validation score and the training score converge to a value that is too low with increasing size of the training set, it will not benefit much from more training data. The machine learning curve is useful for many purposes including comparing different algorithms, choosing model parameters during design, adjusting optimization to improve convergence, and determining the amount of data used for training.

It was published between 1891 and 1938. History The first edition of the paper was published on 29 September 1891 with the subtitle \\"journal quotidien de Toulouse et du Sud-Ouest\\" (daily newspaper of Toulouse and the South-West). Subsequent subtitles were \\"organe quotidien de défense sociale et religieuse\\" (daily organ for social and religious defense) and \\"organe régional de redressement national, de défense religieuse et de progrès social\\" (regional organ for national recovery, religious defense and social progress). From its inception, L'Express du Midi was right-wing and royalist. Its first directors were a group of aristocrats from the Haute-Garonne (the counts of Suffren, Palaminy, and Adhémar), and it often published lengthy extracts from articles by Charles Maurras who was the principal philosopher of Action Française, a right-wing monarchist political movement. The paper claimed the upholding of Roman Catholic values to be part of its mission, but its approach was not always looked upon with favour by Catholic prelates. In 1893 L'Express absorbed Le Nouvelliste du Tarn, a daily newspaper based in the department of Tarn and established in 1880. In 1914 it absorbed Le Ralliement et le Courrier de Tarn-et-Garonne, a daily paper also based in Tarn and established in 1904, and that same year took over the subscriptions to La Voix du peuple, an organ of the Union Conservatrice party in Gers. Between 1909 and 1914 the paper also published an edition for the Hautes-Pyrénées region entitled L'Action pyrénéenne. L'Express ceased publication after its issue of 18 January 1938. On that day its front page featured articles on the Japanese seizure of Kiautschou, the Spanish Civil War, and the resignation of Léon Blum as Vice- Premier of France as well as a lengthy article on the paper's history and its farewell by Armand Praviel. It re-emerged two days later as La Garonne with the same address (25 rue Roquelaine, Toulouse), a new proprietor, and René Séguy as its editor. Its front page featured lengthy articles by Séguy and by Abel Bonnard on the newly launched paper's future direction and purpose. La Garonne ceased publication on 20 August 1944.

It has cliffs, hills, dunes, and small caves. When the tide is in there are two beaches, which merge into one, when the tide is out. There is a small tidal island roughly 15 meters from the shore, called Rough Island. The area is undeveloped with no direct road access, and significant traffic issues reported during August 2020. Access to the beach is possible only via a route across private land, and an increase in visitors during 2018 reportedly prompted a local landowner to post a notice about access concerns. The beach is not suitable for swimming. Etymology The official name of the beach, Boyeeghter Strand, derives from the Irish Trá Bhá Íochtair meaning the strand of the lower (or northern) bay. The common name of the beach, Murder Hole Beach, is rumoured to originate from the 1800s, when a young woman reputedly fell from a cliff near the beach. Other reports suggest that the name is derived from how the dangerous currents make swimming perilous.

In 2005, she won an International Scholarship of the American Association of University Women (AAUW). In 2009, Leinarte became full professor at Vilnius University.  Career  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Leinarte became actively involved in the promotion of women's rights and gender equality. Leinarte and her colleague are the first academics to have founded a non-governmental organization for women in Lithuania. The same organization, \\"Praeities Pėdos\\" (Traces of the Past), is also among the first Lithuanian organizations to introduce the notion of \\"women victims of trafficking\\".

The Lithuanian Family in its European Context, 1800-1914. Marriage, Divorce and Flexible Communities thumb The book investigates marriage and divorce in Lithuania in the period from 1800 to 1914 focusing on the interaction between authorized marital behaviour and independent individual choices. Lithuania was incorporated into Russia in 1795 and was part of the Tsarist Empire until 1918. How did then under often very restrictive laws and policies – manorial rights and serfdom up to 1861, pervasive role of the Catholic Church and absence of civil marriage and divorce, in addition to deep rooted customary practices - women and men manage to normalize and solve the problems of their family life? The book reveals that it was possible through the adoption of unofficial, and often illegal, solutions. Women and men at all levels of the nineteenth-century Lithuanian society employed unsanctioned marital behavior, such as cohabitation, bigamy and levirate, among others, in order to respond to the external obstacles that had an impact on their family life, including transmission of inheritance and household structure. The book asks if the history of cohabitation followed different paths in Western and Eastern Europe? Was cohabitation in Western Europe caused by inability to meet the costs of a wedding, while in Eastern Europe cohabiting couples could not comply with the exigencies of official marriage law?

Adopting and Remembering Soviet Reality. Life Stories of Lithuanian Women, 1945–1970 Following the Second World War, Soviet ideology gained exceptional power over historical memory in the newly incorporated Baltic States – Lithuania included. There, the Soviets erased collective memory by renaming cities and streets, transforming peasant farms into Soviet kolkhozes, and passing off Soviet rituals for Lithuanian national traditions. Not only did the Socialist State change the toponomy and geography of pre-war Lithuania, it also strove to shape the values, beliefs and identities of the Lithuanian people. Though the regime was doomed, its influence on the subjective experience was substantial. Adopting and Remembering Soviet Reality: Life Stories of Lithuanian Women, 1945–1970 consists of ten interviews and two introductory essays: “Conducting Interviews in the Post-Soviet Space” and “Women, Work, and Family in Soviet Lithuania”. The book recounts the experiences of Lithuanian women in the postwar years, during the so-called “Khrushchev Thaw” and the beginning of the “Stagnation Era”. It explores the strategies these women used to reconcile the demands of work and family, as well as their perceptions of gender roles, marriage and romantic love in Soviet society. Reviews: Diana T.

It has been suggested that there may be cold seeps in this region.  Purpose  A marine protected area is defined by the IUCN as \\"A clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values\\". The specific purpose of this MPA is to protect remnants of untrawled rocky habitat.  Extent  This is an offshore MPA in the 250 m to 400 m depth range about 80 nautical miles west of Papendorp on the coast of Namaqualand. The water column, seabed and subsoil are protected by the MPA. = Boundaries = The boundaries of the MPA are: * Northern boundary: A S31°10.000' E16°15.000' to B S31°10.000' E16°25.000' * Eastern boundary: B S31°10.000' E16°25.000' to C S32°0.000' E16°45.000' * Southern boundary: C S32°0.000' E16°45.000' to D S32°0.000' E16°35.000' * Western boundary: D S32°0.000' E16°35.000' to A S31°10.000' E16°15.000' = Zonation = The whole protected area is zoned as a controlled area.  Management  The marine protected areas of South Africa are the responsibility of the national government, which has management agreements with a variety of MPA management authorities, which manage the MPAs with funding from the SA Government through the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA). The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is responsible for issuing permits, quotas and law enforcement.  Use   Geography  = Climate = = Seasonal variations in sea conditions =  Ecology  Marine ecoregions of the South African Exclusive Economic Zone: Benguela Bank Marine Protected Area is in the Southeast Atlantic ecoregion The MPA is in the warm temperate Southeast Atlantic ecoregion to the west of the continental shelf which extends northwards to the Orange River. There are some species endemic to South Africa in this region. Three major habitats exist in the sea in this region, two of them distinguished by the nature of the substrate. The substrate, or base material, is important in that it provides a base to which an organism can anchor itself, which is vitally important for those organisms which need to stay in one particular kind of place. Rocky reefs provide a firm fixed substrate for the attachment of plants and animals. Sedimentary bottoms are a relatively unstable substrate and cannot anchor kelp or many of the other benthic organisms. Finally there is open water, above the substrate and clear of the kelp forest, where the organisms must drift or swim. Mixed habitats are also frequently found, which are a combination of those mentioned above. Rocky reefs There are rocky reefs and mixed rocky and sandy bottoms. For many marine organisms the substrate is another type of marine organism, and it is common for several layers to co-exist. The type of rock of the reef is of some importance, as it influences the range of possibilities for the local topography, which in turn influences the range of habitats provided, and therefore the diversity of inhabitants. Sandstone and other sedimentary rocks erode and weather very differently, and depending on the direction of dip and strike, and steepness of the dip, may produce reefs which are relatively flat to very high profile and full of small crevices. These features may be at varying angles to the shoreline and wave fronts. There are fewer large holes, tunnels and crevices in sandstone reefs, but often many deep but low near- horizontal crevices. Sediment bottoms (including silt, mud, sand, shelly, pebble and gravel bottoms) Sedimentary bottoms at first glance appear to be fairly barren areas, as they lack the stability to support many of the spectacular reef based species, and the variety of large organisms is relatively low. The sediment may be moved around by water action, to a greater or lesser degree depending on weather conditions and exposure of the area. This means that sessile organisms must be specifically adapted to areas of relatively loose substrate to thrive in them, and the variety of species found on an unconsolidated sedimentary bottom will depend on all these factors. Sedimentary bottoms have one important compensation for their instability, animals can burrow into the sediment and move up and down within its layers, which can provide feeding opportunities and protection from predation. Other species can dig themselves holes in which to shelter, or may feed by filtering water drawn through the tunnel, or by extending body parts adapted to this function into the water above the sand. The open sea The pelagic water column is the major part of the living space at sea. This is the water between the surface and the top of the benthic zone, where living organisms swim, float or drift, and the food chain starts with phytoplankton, the mostly microscopic photosynthetic organisms that convert the energy of sunlight into organic material which feeds nearly everything else, directly or indirectly. In temperate seas there are distinct seasonal cycles of phytoplankton growth, based on the available nutrients and the available sunlight. Either can be a limiting factor. Phytoplankton tend to thrive where there is plenty of light, and they themselves are a major factor in restricting light penetration to greater depths, so the photosynthetic zone tends to be shallower in areas of high productivity. Zooplankton feed on the phytoplankton, and are in turn eaten by larger animals. The larger pelagic animals are generally faster moving and more mobile, giving them the option of changing depth to feed or to avoid predation, and to move to other places in search of a better food supply. = Marine species diversity =  Animals   Endemism  The MPA is in the cool temperate Southeastern Atlantic ecoregion to the west of the continental shelf which extends northwards to the Orange River.

The tower, serving as office space and as a hotel, is located at 22 Rothschild Boulevard, Tel Aviv, on the corner of Nachalat Binyamin street. Built from 2010 to 2014, the tower was constructed on the plot which previously was the location of the Beit ZIM building, which was destroyed in a fire in the year 1966.  Before the construction of Rothschild 22 Tower  Beit ZIM in the early 1960s In 1958, Zim Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM) constructed Beit ZIM, a five-story office building for designed by the architect Dov Karmi. The building contained offices for ZIM, Dizengoff Trading, Dizengoff West Africa, Yachin Hakal Israel, Gmul, Alda, Astraco, Scandinavian Airlines, and other companies. In February 1966 the building was severely damaged in a large conflagration, which led to the decision to completely destroy the building due to safety considerations. The plot of land, now empty, was nicknamed \\"The ZIM pit\\" (). In 1981, Bank Mizrahi acquired the plot from ZIM in order to build its central headquarters. The bank planned to lay the building's cornerstone in April 1986; however a week before the expected date the Bejski Commission published its conclusions regarding the 1983 Israel bank stock crisis including a call for the bank's CEO to resign. Following this development the bank decided to indefinitely postpone the construction. In August 1997 the bank planned to construct a 18-story tower on the plot to serve as its offices. In order to do so, the Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality required the bank to buy an old house for the purpose of historic preservation as a condition in order to receive a zoning permit. In that month, the bank bought the historic building Beit Naparsteg from the businessman Zadik Bino for approximately 4.5 million USD, after which it received a building permit. The bank only begun the building process in 2001, and after digging the foundations the bank's management changed its mind and decided to instead move its offices to the Moshe Aviv Tower in Ramat Gan; following this building was halted.  Construction and population of the tower  In October 2006, Bank Mizrahi sold the plot to the Russian-French- Israeli businessman Arcadi Gaydamak together with four other buildings intended for preservation in the area, in exchange for 26 million USD. In June 2008 Gaydamak sold the plot and the buildings to Aviv Group & Co. in exchange for 135 million ILS. In August 2008 the Aviv Group sold the historic Beit Naparsteg building on Rothschild Boulevard 48 to the Jewish-Canadian billionaire Gerry Schwartz for 28 ILS. In May 2009 the Tel Aviv city council approved the Aviv Group's request to build 8 additional floors in the tower which had already been approved to be built to the height of 21 stories. In June 2010 the building of Rothschild 22 Tower commenced, on the area which had until then served as a temporary parking lot. In May 2013 the \\"LR\\" Group led by Roi Ben Ami and Ami Lustig joined as a partner in the project of building the Rothschild 22 Tower, and in 2014 its construction was completed and its floors were rented out. In April 2014, the hotel chain Fattal rented floors 2 through 10 of the tower (9 floors total) and founded \\"Hotel Rothschild 22\\", which contains about 155 rooms. The first floor hosts the restaurant Galeria 22 which serves as a cafeteria for the hotel's guests in the morning, and later in the day serves as a branch of the chain Aroma. The 11-th floor was rented by the accounting firm kartax, and the 12-th floor was rented by the Regus company. In July 2014, Autodesk Israel rented floors 14 through 17 (4 floors total), in February 2015 ClicksMob rented the 18-th floor the 19-th floor of the tower was rented by Israel Discount Capital Markets and Investments Inc., and the 20th floor was rented by Ram Dekel Law Offices. In September 2014, Facebook Israel rented the 21 through 24th floors (4 floors total), and in December 2014 it moved its offices into the tower. In April 2015 the venture capital firm Magma Ventures rented the 25th floor of the tower; Magma Ventures had previously invested in Onavo Mobile (affiliated with Facebook Israel). In May 2015 the organization \\"Startup Nation Central\\" rented the 13th, 26th, and 27th floors of the tower. The tower contains six elevators of which two are transparent. It contains seven underground parking levels. The lobby on the building's ground floor is officially a public space for the use of the public, and this is in fact the only air conditioned and roofed public square in Israel. \\"The Rothschild 22 Lobby Liberation Front\\" Entrance to the Rothschild 22 lobby In August 2017 it was first reported on TheMarker that the lobby of Rothschild 22 Tower is an open public space, which was hidden from the public. As a sign of protest against the alleged censorship perpetrated by Facebook Israel, one of the primary resident companies in the tower, the protest movement \\"The Rothschild 22 Lobby Liberation Front\\" () coalesced. This movement included members such as the administrators of the Mizbala blog which was blocked from Facebook and the activists of the Ba'im LaBankaim protest whose Facebook page was removed, and social activists such as Dori Ben Israel and Barak Cohen. Since August 2017 the movement began public and media activities in the lobby of the tower which it believed must be \\"liberated\\". Video clips recorded in the lobby were viewed hundreds of thousands of times and were livestreamed on Facebook. As an act of protest against the blocking of the Mizbala page on Facebook, in August 2017 Dori Ben Israel moved the offices of the Mizbala blog to the lobby in the tower. Despite efforts to prevent it, in September 2017 the movement held a public screening of the movie \\"Facebookistan\\" in the tower's lobby. Over 150 attendees came to the event, including many police officers. In October 2017 the Members of Knesset Ayman Odeh and Dov Khenin were photographed in the tower's lobby, and they called upon the public to come. In December 2017, Dov Ben Israel and Barak Cohen were chosen among the People of the Year by Time Out Tel Aviv magazine, partially because of their activities in the movement of the Rothschild 22 lobby.

The River Styles Framework is based on the science of fluvial geomorphology. Each river type is called a \\"River Style\\" and its name is constructed following a consistent naming convention. The River Styles Framework provides an open-ended process for interpreting rivers rather than fitting them into pre-existing categories. The River Styles Framework is designed to provide a scientific basis for river management. It was developed by researchers at Macquarie University. History The River Styles Framework was developed by Gary Brierley and Kirstie Fryirs at Macquarie University. The first peer reviewed paper on River Styles was published in 2000. Initial research that helped to develop the River Styles Framework was funded by Land & Water Australia and New South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation.  Stages of the River Styles Framework  The River Styles Framework has four stages of analysis, which provide a framework to describe river character, explain how the river behaves and predict how a river may adjust its form in the future. The following overview of the stages is sourced from the book,\\"Geomorphology and River Management: Application of the River Styles Framework\\". = Stage 1 = Stage 1 provides a baseline survey of a river's character and behaviour. Steps in Stage 1 include: # Analysis of the catchment setting and controls on river morphology # Mapping River Styles across the catchment # Interpretation of the controls on river character and behaviour and the downstream pattern of River Styles in a catchment. = Stage 2 = Stage 2 assesses and explains geomorphic river condition throughout a catchment. River condition is a determination of environmental quality pertaining to a river's geomorphology. Steps in Stage 2 include: # Determination of a River Style's ability to adjust its geomorphology # Assessment of the River Style's evolutionary history in order to identify if a river has changed irreversibly # Determination and explanation of the geomorphic condition of the section of river being assessed. = Stage 3 = Stage 3 determines the potential for a river to 'recover', or improve in condition. Steps in Stage 3 include: # Determination of the trajectory of a river's geomorphic adjustment (how it has adjusted in the past and how it might change in the future) # Assessment of the potential for a river to recover and assessment of factors limiting recovery. = Stage 4 = Stage 4 uses information from Stages 1 to 3 to identify 'target conditions' for a River Style as a goal toward which river rehabilitation (or restoration) can work. Steps in Stage 4 include: # Identification of target conditions for river rehabilitation and level of intervention required to reach target conditions # Prioritisation of river management efforts based on geomorphic river condition and potential for the river to recover # Monitoring and auditing of adjustments to geomorphic river condition.  Applications and uses of the River Styles Framework  The River Styles Framework has been used to support river management in Australia, New Zealand, United States and Brazil. In Australia, the Department of Industry (New South Wales) used the River Styles Framework as a key component in developing the River Condition Index (RCI) as a tool to assess river value, risk to river value and to monitor changes in river condition over time. The River Styles Framework also contributes to the method for determining 'High Ecological Value Aquatic Ecosystems' (HEVAE) as part of the Australian National Water Initiative. In the United States, The River Styles Framework formed part of the protocol for the Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program (CHaMP) developed for the Columbia River Basin. The CHaMP protocol used River Styles to help with comparing river types, predicting fish habitat suitability and prioritising river conservation and rehabilitation activities. A cost-benefit analysis completed by Land & Water Australia found that the River Styles Framework had a benefit-to-cost ratio of 28:1 and had contributed a net value of $40 million (AUD) in 2010.  Training and accreditation  An accreditation framework has been developed for use of the River Styles Framework to ensure quality control. There are two levels of accreditation: 'Provisional' and 'Accredited'. 'Provisional' practitioners have undertaken a River Styles Short Course and have passed the associated assessment tasks. 'Provisional' practitioners may undertake assessments of River Styles under the supervision of a fully accredited practitioner. Full accreditation is gained following successful completion of a River Styles Short Course and completion of a satisfactory River Styles Report. 'Accredited' practitioners may undertake River Styles assessments unsupervised and may also supervise 'Provisional' practitioners.

Most of the text is a description of 42 asanas accompanied by 95 photographs of Krishnamacharya and his students executing the poses. There is a brief account of practices other than asanas, which form just one of the eight limbs of classical yoga, that Krishnamacharya \\"did not instruct his students to practice\\". The yoga scholar Mark Singleton notes that the book is almost legendary among Pattabhi Jois's students, though \\"very few have actually seen it\\". Singleton notes, too, that the book was \\"experimental\\". The yoga scholar Norman Sjoman criticises the book's \\"padded academic bibliography\\" full of irrelevant works, and the perfunctory and ill-informed coverage of yoga practices other than asanas, while another yoga scholar, Elliott Goldberg, comments that the photographs serve to demystify the asanas of their spiritual content, and that Krishnamacharya was falsely claiming an ancient origin for his dynamic vinyasa system of yoga. Context The Maharaja of Mysore sponsored the book, which had been intended to be the first of a series. 1906 painting by K. Keshavayya Hatha yoga, the medieval practice which used asanas (yoga postures) and other practices such as shatkarmas (purifications) to gain moksha, spiritual liberation, was despised and in decline by the start of the 20th century. Western gymnastics such as Niels Bukh's Primary Gymnastics became popular in India, partly as a result of Hindu nationalism which sought to show Indian men as strong. At the same time, yoga in various forms was being popularised in the West by advocates such as Vivekananda (without asanas), Yogananda, and Yogendra. The yoga teacher T.K.V. Desikachar, one of Krishnamacharya's sons, explained that his father had intended to write a series of books on yoga, of which this was to have been the first, but the death of his sponsor the Maharaja of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, in 1940 caused the series to be abandoned. He stated that his father had decided to cover practices (shatkarmas, purifications) such as neti and dhauti \\"which he himself did not recommend\\". He noted that the asanas in the book are described in \\"vinyasa krama\\", which was the way Krishnamacharya taught yoga to children in the Mysore palace. Other practices which he strongly endorsed like pranayama and meditation were to be topics of later books and were therefore not covered. Krishnamacharya's disciple and biographer A. G. Mohan states that the book was written \\"in three nights\\" according to Krishnamacharya's wife, at the behest of the Maharaja. Mohan notes without comment that the book covers yoga practices other than asanas that Krishnamacharya \\"did not instruct his students to practice\\". Book =Publication and translation= Yoga Makaranda was published in the Kannada language by the Madurai C.M.V. Press in 1934. A Tamil edition appeared in 1938. An English translation by Lakshmi and Nandini Ranganathan was published in India in 2006, and released by them as a free download. A different English translation by Krishnamacharya's grandson Kausthub Desikachar and son T.K.V. Desikachar was published in paperback in 2011 and online in 2013. =Contents= The book is introduced with a discussion of why yoga should be practised, the chakras (elements of the subtle body on which yoga is said to operate), pratyahara, dharana and dhyana (elements of Patanjalis's yoga), and who \\"has the authority to practise Yoga\\", which in Krishnamacharya's view is \\"everyone\\". It discusses the elements of yoga, starting with yamas and niyamas, warning that \\"sleep, laziness and disease\\" are obstacles to becoming \\"an adept yogi\\". The book then describes where to practise yoga, recommending \\"a place with plenty of water, a fertile place, a place where there is a bank of a holy river, where there are no crowds, a clean solitary place — such places are superior.\\" It gives a description of the purifications (which it calls shatkriyas) and seals (mudras). The bulk of the book is taken up with a description of 42 asanas. =Approach= Each asana is described with some paragraphs of instructions, and illustrated with one or more photographs. The student is instructed how to stand, and which limbs should be straight. For many poses, the claimed medical benefits are then described, without adduced evidence. The term vinyasa is used with the meaning of \\"stage in the execution of an asana\\". For example, Sarvangasana is introduced with the words \\"This has 12 vinyasas [stages]. The 8th vinyasa is the asana sthiti [the actual pose].\\" =Illustrations= There are four photographs of Krishnamacharya's Yogasala showing the hall and students. The chapter on asanas is illustrated with 95 monochrome photographs, each of an individual performing the named pose. Many are of Krishnamacharya himself; others are of his students, including T. R. S. Sharma as a boy, or of Keshavamurthy, stated by Elliott Goldberg to be his favourite student, who performs difficult poses such as Durvasasana (standing with one leg behind the neck). Some poses, such as Krishnamacharya demonstrating Mayurasana, are on a tiger skin. =Nomenclature= Krishnamacharya names the asanas, in Sanskrit, by the parts of the body and the stretches involved. For example \\"Adhomukha Uttanasana\\" means \\"Face Down Extended Stretch Pose\\", while \\"Supta Utthita Dakshinapada Janusirsasana\\" is \\"Reclining Extended Right Foot Head to Knee Pose\\"; a glossary of Sanskrit is provided in the text. Reception Yoga Makaranda is said to be almost legendary among Pattabhi Jois's students. The yoga scholar Mark Singleton notes that the book \\"has quasi-legendary status among contemporary [Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga] students of Pattabhi Jois [though] very few have actually seen it\\". He quotes the original introduction by V. Subhramananya Iyer, which called the book \\"a result of the many tests conducted under the special orders of the Maharaja of Mysore\\", in other words that the book \\"was intended to be, and in practice was, experimental (his italics)\\". Singleton observes that the book called for the asanas to be held for long periods (3 to 15 minutes), arguing that the rapid sequences inherited by his pupil Pattabhi Jois were a special case, even then. The yoga scholar Norman Sjoman is critical of the book's perfunctory treatment of both academic requirements and yogic practices other than asanas. He comments that Krishnamacharya's list of sources \\"reveals his relation to tradition\\", but is \\"a padded academic bibliography with works referred to that have nothing to do with the tradition he is teaching in\\". The list includes for instance the well-known hatha yoga texts, the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, the Gheranda Samhita and the Sritattvanidhi as well as the Yoga Upanishads. Sjoman gives as an example the recommendations for vajroli mudra which call for \\"a glass rod to be inserted into the urethra [of the penis] an inch at a time. His recommendations show that he has most certainly not experimented with this himself in the manner he recommends.\\" Elliott Goldberg calls this image from Yoga Makaranda of Krishnamacharya with his students performing asanas in the Mysore palace \\"showy\\" and \\"eye-catching\\" rather than spiritual. The yoga scholar Elliott Goldberg comments that the photographs of Krishnamacharya's schoolboy pupils in the poses \\"don't truly capture yogins using their body as a tool for spiritual development either. In fact, the photos demystify whatever spirituality may obtain to the exercises.\\" He adds that the group photographs are \\"showy ... eye-catching tricks\\", with boys in familiar asanas but arranged in a pyramid. The vinyasa system of yoga, too, was in Goldberg's view \\"spectacularly different\\" from anything practised in India at the time; he is dismissive of Krishnamacharya's \\"spurious claim for the ancient origin of Vinyasa yoga\\", citing Singleton's analysis in Yoga Body of its origins in Surya Namaskar, suggesting \\"self-aggrandizement and self- protection\\" as the motives. Despite all this, Goldberg states that Krishnamacharya's main interest in yoga was to nourish spirituality (adhyatmika krama), quoting his words in Yoga Makaranda: \\"Once you stop the oscillating nature of mind, you can reach the level[s] of dhyana, nididhyasanam, and samadhi [the highest levels of Patanjali's eight-limbed yoga]\\" and through that you can see the atma[n]. He notes that Krishnamacharya was following the traditional interpretation of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, that the eight limbs formed a sequence of steps.

In order to eliminate the contraband trade in the north and the northwest parts of the island, the Spanish monarch Felipe III sent an order to the then-governor of Hispaniola, Antonio de Osorio, to depopulate those parts of the island (by force if necessary) and to relocate the inhabitants to the vicinity of Santo Domingo in the southeast of the island. The Devastations were carried out between 1605 and 1606.Academic study by Rafal ReichertFrank Moya Pons, Historia de la República Dominicana History In 1604, the King of Spain, Philip III, observing the growing lack of Crown control in the north and western parts of Hispaniola, granted Governor Antonio de Osorio and Archbishop Agustín Dávila y Padilla the power to take whatever action they deemed prudent in order to stop the incursion of foreign contraband as well as contact between Catholic subjects of the Crown and heretics. The origin of the problem was that the residents of Puerto Plata, Montecristi, Bayajá and Yaguana traded their products (especially cured meat and hides) with the French, the English and the Dutch, and received contraband goods in return. This traffic had been carrying on from the middle of the 16th century and kept growing year by year. The king's order forced the officials to carry out the depopulation of the regions in which smuggling was rampant, so that the Crown’s subjects could be moved to a location closer to the capital of the island, Santo Domingo. When the people of the northwest first heard about this order, the town councils began to raise petitions in which they requested the abolition of the measure. However, Governor Osorio, who upon the death of the archbishop Dávila y Padilla had to face the situation alone, decided to comply with the letter of the royal ordinance. In mid- February 1605, royal representatives left for the northern part of Hispaniola to proclaim that the people of the area would be forgiven crimes committed against the Spanish Crown resulting from the practice of trafficking with foreigners and heretics, but only under one condition: that they would collect all their personal belongings, slaves, cattle and other property, and move to the southeast, to locations pre-determined by the royal authorities of Santo Domingo. (Some officials of the Spanish audiencia tried to suppress the royal order, since their own smuggling interests would also be affected.) The population of the north resisted and Osorio had to ask for reinforcements to comply with the royal order. The help came from the governor of Puerto Rico, Sancho Ochoa de Castro, who in September of that same year 1605 sent an infantry company to Santo Domingo to help out the forces of Hispaniola. The contingent, composed of 159 soldiers under the command of Captain Francisco Ferrecuelo, went to the north of the island, where the orders of Osorio were forcibly imposed, and the residents of the region obliged to abandon their farms and homesteads. In order to achieve their objective, the soldiers destroyed sugar plantations, burned huts, ranches, haciendas and churches, and dismantled everything that the villagers needed to live in those places. The main depopulated areas were Puerto Plata, Montecristi, Bayajá and Yaguana. At the end of January 1606, Antonio de Osorio wrote to the king, communicating that the devastation had ended and that he only needed to go through the herds of cattle of the north, and those of Santiago, San Juan and Azua. The process was however delayed until the middle of the year. Eventually, the governor established a border that stretched from Azua in the south all the way to the north coast, and prohibited the Hispanic inhabitants from crossing it. The inhabitants of Bayajá and Yaguana were concentrated in a new town that received the name of Bayaguana, and the inhabitants of Montecristi and Puerto Plata were relocated to Monte Plata. In any event, the governor's operation failed to stop smuggling in the region. The destruction of about 120 herds of cattle, which totaled more than 100,000 cattle, cows, pigs and horses, proved to be disastrous, since only 15% of the cattle could be moved to new locations, while the rest were abandoned. Within a short time, these herds turned wild. Moreover, the destruction of the mills and trapiches accelerated the decline of the sugar industry which, added to the loss of livestock and plantations of cane and ginger, increased poverty on the island and removed Santo Domingo to the margins of colonial trade. The depopulation of the northwestern part of Hispaniola was taken advantage of by black slaves who, fleeing from their masters, settled in that region. Runaway slaves came not only from the island itself, but also from neighboring Cuba and Puerto Rico. Likewise, the evacuation of half of Hispaniola did not cause this territory to be forgotten, as the Crown had wished, but rather it fell upon the mercy of foreigners who benefitted greatly from the cattle and other fruits of the land left behind by the Spaniards. Finally, the misery that was generated after the Osorio Devastations also affected the tax revenues of the colony, to the point that these were no longer enough to cover bureaucratic expenses nor the maintenance of the armed forces in Santo Domingo. Similarity to Florida expedition It is interesting to note that a similar situation occurred in Florida. In the middle of 1601, King Philip III, observing the difficulties in maintaining the sparse population of Spanish settlers in the face of continued attacks by the native Indians (and also noticing the limited amount of agricultural and livestock production), ordered the governor of Havana, Juan Maldonado Barnuevo, to send an expedition northwards. The expedition, composed of soldiers and friars under the command of Captain Don Fernando de Valdés, was to perform an inspection and determine the cost to the Crown of maintaining the province. Although the expedition found places in Florida that could have been better utilized for colonial establishments, the Captain warned that the abandonment of San Agustín could harm Spain to the benefit of her enemies. Finally, the combined efforts of Fernando de Valdés and other officials such as Alonso de las Alas, Bartolomé de Argüelles, Juan Menéndez Marques and the friars who accompanied the expedition (who believed that the Indians of Florida provided bountiful opportunities for conversion to Christianity) proved to be successful in averting the abandonment of Florida. The Osorio Devastations signified the beginning of the strengthening of the Hispanic military presence in Hispaniola, since, to put the order into practice, the support of 159 soldiers from the garrison of San Juan was requested from Puerto Rico. The terrible economic impact of the royal order eventually caused a change in the financing of Hispaniola, transferring it from the viceroyalty of New Spain to that of viceroyalty of Peru. However, from the 1680s onwards, the growing threat of buccaneers as well as that of French forces meant that Hispaniola and Cuba became major recipients of economic resources from New Spain, primarily for military purposes. Historians conclude that the Devastations of Osorio constituted an error that brought no benefits to the colonists nor to the Spanish Crown. Instead, it left the economy of the island in a state of crisis and stagnation that lasted several decades. In addition, it presented an opportunity for foreigners and enemies of Spain to settle the abandoned territory, who later formed the French colony of Saint Domingue. From the 18th century, thanks to its productive sugar and coffee plantations, it became one of the strongest economies of the Caribbean and the principal colony of France.

Because D'Amato wanted to stay unaccredited as director, the directorial credit in the Italian version reads \\"Romano Gastaldi\\" - a pseudonym of Romano Scandariato (who acted as assistant director in this film)  and in the English version \\"Ralph Zucker.\\" As cinematographer, D'Amato is credited under his birth name Aristide Massaccesi. Synopsis The film's narrative frame is introduced in the title credits with a group of monks running away from their Father Superior to visit a convent of nuns. While the younger friars get to be with the more attractive nuns, the Father Superior is caught and taken in by an old and lecherous nun. The main part of the film is taken up by three episodes, between which is a short vignette that shows the monks and the nuns before and after their trysts. In the first episode (), an old husband leaves his young wife for a business trip, and his wife uses his absence to invite a young sculptor to have sex. When her husband's sister unexpectedly arrives, she too has sex with the sculptor. In the second episode (), a young priest falls in love with a young wife during confession, during which she seduces him. She then lets him pay for sexual favours. Having finally tired of him, she tells her brutish husband of his advances, who squeezes the priest's penis with the lid of a chest in a such a way that the priest is forced to castrate himself with a knife. In the final episode (), a young man successfully infiltrates the household of a rich merchant and his sexually unfulfilled wife by disguising himself as a maid. When the husband finds out about \\"her\\" penis, he nonetheless lets \\"her\\" stay and even orders \\"her\\" to sleep with his wife. He has found out that the offspring of hermaphrodites is always male. The frame story is resumed at the end of the third episode. The situation is now reversed: The monks are walking back to their own monastery, slowly and worn out, while their Father Superior walks behind and spurs them on. Since he thought it unfair that he never gets the younger nuns, he made them have sex with the old and lecherous nun.

In Germany, the film was distributed theatrically by Mercator under the title Hemmungslos der Lust verfallen. In Great Britain, it was passed uncut with a run time of 75 minutes and 50 seconds under the title More Filthy Canterbury Tales. Critical reception In 1999, Marco Giusti called it \\"a cruel decameron, and erotically much more daring than usual\\" (). In 2004, Gordiano Lupi called the film \\"entertaining, well written, erotic in the right amount\\" (). Lupi highlighted Franco Salina's theme song that plays during the opening and end credits and starts with the lyrics, (translation: \\"Father, father, father superior, defend our hearts from sin...\\"). Its melody returns throughout the film. In his 2015 monograph on Joe D'Amato, Sébastien Gayraud saw a thematic link between the self-castration in the film's second episode and the ending of D'Amato's later film Sesso nero.

Since it influences to what extent newly acquired information overrides old information, it metaphorically represents the speed at which a machine learning model \\"learns\\". In the adaptive control literature, the learning rate is commonly referred to as gain. In setting a learning rate, there is a trade-off between the rate of convergence and overshooting. While the descent direction is usually determined from the gradient of the loss function, the learning rate determines how big a step is taken in that direction. A too high learning rate will make the learning jump over minima but a too low learning rate will either take too long to converge or get stuck in an undesirable local minimum. In order to achieve faster convergence, prevent oscillations and getting stuck in undesirable local minima the learning rate is often varied during training either in accordance to a learning rate schedule or by using an adaptive learning rate. The learning rate and its adjustments may also differ per parameter, in which case it is a diagonal matrix that can be interpreted as an approximation to the inverse of the Hessian matrix in Newton's method. The learning rate is related to the step length determined by inexact line search in quasi-Newton methods and related optimization algorithms.  Learning rate schedule  A learning rate schedule changes the learning rate during learning and is most often changed between epochs/iterations. This is mainly done with two parameters: decay and momentum . There are many different learning rate schedules but the most common are time-based, step-based and exponential. Decay serves to settle the learning in a nice place and avoid oscillations, a situation that may arise when a too high constant learning rate makes the learning jump back and forth over a minima, and is controlled by a hyperparameter. Momentum is analogous to a ball rolling down a hill; we want the ball to settle at the lowest point of the hill (corresponding to the lowest error). Momentum both speeds up the learning (increasing the learning rate) when the error cost gradient is heading in the same direction for a long time and also avoids local minima by 'rolling over' small bumps. Momentum is controlled by a hyper parameter analogous to a ball's mass which must be chosen manually—too high and the ball will roll over minima which we wish to find, too low and it will not fulfil its purpose. The formula for factoring in the momentum is more complex than for decay but is most often built in with deep learning libraries such as Keras. Time-based learning schedules alter the learning rate depending on the learning rate of the previous time iteration. Factoring in the decay the mathematical formula for the learning rate is: \\\\eta_{n+1} = \\\\frac{\\\\eta_n }{1+dn} where \\\\eta is the learning rate, d is a decay parameter and n is the iteration step. Step-based learning schedules changes the learning rate according to some pre defined steps. The decay application formula is here defined as: \\\\eta_{n} = \\\\eta_0d^{floor(\\\\frac{1+n}{r})} where \\\\eta_{n} is the learning rate at iteration n, \\\\eta_0 is the initial learning rate, d is how much the learning rate should change at each drop (0.5 corresponds to a halving) and r corresponds to the droprate, or how often the rate should be dropped (10 corresponds to a drop every 10 iterations). The floor function here drops the value of its input to 0 for all values smaller than 1. Exponential learning schedules are similar to step-based but instead of steps a decreasing exponential function is used. The mathematical formula for factoring in the decay is: \\\\eta_{n} = \\\\eta_0e^{-dn} where d is a decay parameter. Adaptive learning rate The issue with learning rate schedules is that they all depend on hyperparameters that must be manually chosen for each given learning session and may vary greatly depending on the problem at hand or the model used. To combat this there are many different types of adaptive gradient descent algorithms such as Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, Adam which are generally built into deep learning libraries such as Keras.

With a membership of some 50,000, it was one of the largest Danish women's organizations up to the First World War. Politically neutral, it had chapters throughout the country. With a view to making Denmark's neutrality more convincing, it sensitized politicians to the need for more effective armed forces while encouraging men to take renewed interest in defence. In 1913, a collection from its membership provided funding for ammunition and uniforms for the voluntary shooting corps. After women had obtained voting rights in 1915, it was decided future progress on defence should be based on their political involvement. The organization was therefore dissolved in 1921. Leading figures included Charlotte Norrie, founder and president 1907–15, Agnes Slott-Møller, president 1915–17, and Kirsten Langkilde, president 1917–19. Mathilde Malling and Johanne Münter were also active members of the organization. Given the continued support for the aims of the organization south of the new Danish border in Southern Jutland, on the initiative of Ellen Bjerre, Julie Ramsing and Dagmar Schmiegelow, in 1921 a new organization was created as Danske Kvinders Slesvigske Forening (Danish Women's Scheswig Association).

There is scholarly consensus that illegal immigrants commit less crime than natives. Quote: \\"most studies have shown that illegal immigrants tend to commit less crime than the native born\\" Sanctuary cities—which adopt policies designed to avoid prosecuting people solely for being in the country illegally—have no statistically meaningful impact on crime, and may reduce the crime rate. Research suggests that immigration enforcement has no impact on crime rates.  Research  = Relationship between immigration status and crime = Entering the US without documented permission from the US government is a crime. According to some empirical evidence that disregarded illegal immigration as a crime, immigrants (including illegal immigrants) were otherwise less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens in the United States. Quote: \\"most studies have shown that undocumented immigrants tend to commit less crime than the native born\\" A 2018 study found that undocumented immigration to the United States did not increase violent crime rates. A 2017 study found that \\"Increased undocumented immigration was significantly associated with reductions in drug arrests, drug overdose deaths, and DUI arrests, net of other factors.\\" A 2017 study found that California's extension of driving licenses to unauthorized immigrants \\"did not increase the total number of accidents or the occurrence of fatal accidents, but it did reduce the likelihood of hit and run accidents, thereby improving traffic safety and reducing costs for California drivers ... providing unauthorized immigrants with access to driver's licenses can create positive externalities for the communities in which they live.\\" A 2018 study in the American Economic Journal: Economic Policy found that by restricting the employment opportunities for unauthorized immigrants, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) likely caused an increase in crime rates. A 2018 PLOS One study estimated that the undocumented immigrant population in the United States was 22 million, approximately twice as large as the estimate derived from the United States Census Bureau's figures. An author of the study notes that this has implications for the relationship between undocumented immigration and crime, suggesting that the crime rate among undocumented immigrants is significantly lower than previously estimated: \\"You have the same number of crimes but now spread over twice as many people as was believed before, which right away means that the crime rate among undocumented immigrants is essentially half whatever was previously believed.\\" According to analysis of the 2010 United States Census, \\"immigrants to the United States are significantly less likely than native-born citizens to be incarcerated. The authors found that 1.6 percent of immigrant males age 18-39 are incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born... The divide was even sharper when the authors examined the incarceration rate among immigrant men the authors believe likely to be undocumented — specifically less-educated men from El Salvador and Guatemala between age 18-29. ... According to the analysis, these likely undocumented immigrants had an incarceration rate of 1.7 percent, compared with 10.7 percent for native-born men without a high school diploma\\". A 2018 study found no evidence that apprehensions of undocumented immigrants in districts in the United States reduced crime rates. A 2020 study found that native-born US citizens are incarcerated at higher rates for homicide in Texas than undocumented immigrants. According to immigration analyst Alex Nowrasteh, and criminologist Barry Latzer, Texas is the only state that tracks illegal immigrants by the specific crime committed. Homicide data are regarded as more accurate than data on other crimes because \\"a much higher proportion of murders are solved.\\" The Texas data for 2016 showed that the rate of murder convictions in 2016 was 3.2 per 100,000 native- born Americans, 0.9 for every 100,000 legal immigrants and 1.8 per 100,000 illegal immigrants. =Others= A 2016 study of an effort to reduce crime in North Carolina by identifying and deporting illegal immigrants showed no correlation between increased deportation enforcement and local crime rates.Forrester, Andrew, and Alex Nowrasteh. Do Immigration Enforcement Programs Reduce Crime?: Evidence from the 287(g) Program in North Carolina. Cato Institute, 2018, www.jstor.org/stable/resrep16983. Procedures Individuals who are in the United States illegally and who have been convicted of crimes are eligible to be deported under federal law. Research suggests that immigration enforcement has no impact on crime rates. =Sanctuary cities= Crimes committed by illegal immigrants who had previously been arrested or convicted of crimes have been a focus of particular attention. Sanctuary cities—which adopt policies designed to avoid prosecuting people solely for being in the country illegally—have no statistically meaningful impact on crime, and may reduce the crime rate. Discussion has been particularly intense when an illegal alien has been arrested for a minor offense and is known to be in the country illegally is released because the jurisdiction where he was arrested is a sanctuary city that limits police cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE,) and goes on to commit a new crime. Examples include the 2018 Tulare County shootings, where the suspect had previously served time in American prisons and been deported twice before being arrested on a misdemeanor and released under California Sanctuary Law SB54 the day before he killed two and wounded seven in a spree shooting.  Laws and regulations  = Special Order 40 (1979) = Special Order 40 is a directive issued jointly by the Los Angeles City Council and the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) under Chief Daryl Gates and the Los Angeles City Council in 1979 prohibiting officers of the LAPD officers from questioning individuals for the sole purpose of whether they were in the United States legally. The Special Order was the center of controversy following the 2008 Murder of Jamiel Shaw II by a perpetrator who was a member of the 18th Street gang and an illegal immigrant to the United States. An effort to put a repeal measure on the ballot in 2009 failed. Police Commissioner William Bratton successfully opposed rescinding the Special Order. = Arizona SB 1070 (2010) = The Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act (Arizona SB 1070,) was enacted by the Arizona legislature in 2010 as a response to broad public dislike of illegal immigration among Arizona voters, and by a widespread belief that a great deal of crime was being committed by illegal immigrants that persisted despite a scholarly consensus that illegal immigrants commit proportionately fewer crimes than American citizens. Public support for the bill was driven by the March 2010 murder of Arizona rancher Robert Krentz. =Texas Senate Bill 4 (2017)= Texas Senate Bill 4 was enacted in 2017 to block municipalities in Texas form becoming sanctuary cities, that is, to prevent local authorities from refusing to cooperate with federal authorities in enforcing immigration laws by directing police and court officials not to question persons accused of crimes about their immigration status and to ignore requests by federal authorities to hold individuals who are in the country illegally and have been arrested for minor crimes for deportation. Texas Senate Bill 4 also allows police officers to check the immigration status of those they detain if they choose.  Political debate  =“Trump Hypothesis” and 2016 Presidential election= During his presidential campaign Donald Trump asserted that the immigrants are responsible for higher levels of violent and drug-related crime in the United States. A 2016 study was undertaken to test this hypothesis, specifically with regard to immigrants from Mexico. According to the study, \\"Results largely contradict the Trump Hypothesis: no evidence links Mexican or undocumented Mexican immigrants specifically to violent or drug-related crime.\\" In July 2015, Donald Trump invited what he terms Angel Families, families who have had a member killed by an illegal immigrant to meet with him. Some had lost relatives in road accidents, others were shot or stabbed, but all had family members who died due to actions taken by what Trump describes as people who never should have been in the U.S. in the first place. The Remembrance Project, a nonprofit that works to draw attention to the victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants, helped the campaign locate families of victims. During the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, a political advertisement showing mugshots of illegal immigrants who committed violent crimes in the U.S. alternate with footage of candidate Jeb Bush saying, \\"Yeah, they broke the law, but it's not a felony.... It's an act of love,\\" is regarded as having played a role in Bush's withdrawal from the race. At a May 2016 campaign rally, Trump told an audience that illegal immigrants “Raped, sodomized and killed\\" Americans. Jamiel Shaw, Sr., the father of a high school student murdered by an illegal immigrant in 2008, became a spokesman for the Trump campaign. = Presidency = During his Presidency, Donald Trump has repeatedly asserted that crimes committed by illegal immigrants to the United States make the construction of a wall along the U. S. - Mexico border an urgent necessity. Trump's assertions about crimes committed by illegal immigrants were regularly shown to be inaccurate. =2018 midterm election= \\"One Nation,\\" a political nonprofit supporting Republican candidates produced, an ad showing a masked, knife-wielding man with a voice saying, “We need tough immigration enforcement to keep dangerous criminals out.” Other ads criticized sanctuary cities, something Matt Gorman, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that many Americans oppose.

On Morning Joe, he criticized Donald Trump as president, with a focus especially on what he labeled bad foreign policy in regards largely to North Korea and Russia. On April 15, 2019, Weld officially announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination during an appearance on The Lead with Jake Tapper. Weld's campaign was managed by Jennifer Horn, the former chair of the New Hampshire Republican State Committee and also includes Stuart Stevens, a top strategist for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. On March 18, 2020, Weld suspended his campaign. Political positions =Abortion= In May 2019, Weld described himself as \\"the most pro-choice person you’re ever going to meet.\\" He said that recent abortion laws passed by states, such as Alabama's Human Life Protection Act, left him feeling \\"terrible\\". As governor of Massachusetts, Weld introduced a bill increasing ease of access to abortion in the state. In the 1990s, he publicly fought for removing anti-abortion language from the Republican Party platform, despite opposition from social conservatives. =Drugs= Weld believes that drug use should not be a criminal offense. Weld has also called for federal decriminalization of marijuana and the lowering of the drinking age. =LGBT rights= Weld has been a consistent supporter of LGBT rights, and the right to same-sex marriage. =Economy= Weld has described himself as fiscally conservative, with goals of reducing spending and balancing the budget. For this reason, he has been described as a \\"classic conservative\\". He has proposed to drastically reduce military spending, withdraw American forces from foreign engagements, and refocus American politics on domestic issues primarily. =Education= Weld has been a supporter of charter schools, having established the first twenty-five Massachusetts charter schools as governor. =Environment= Weld challenged Trump on the issue of climate disruption, saying that he had made no effort to combat the effects of global warming. \\"We've got the polar ice cap that's going to melt with devastating consequences if we don’t get carbon out of the atmosphere,\\" Weld told \\"America's Newsroom,\\" noting that he would plan ahead for an \\"environmental catastrophe.\\"GOP primary challenger Bill Weld: Trump doing nothing to stop climate 'catastrophe', Fox News, Joshua Nelson, February 11, 2020.

Weld noted that choosing a secret vote about impeachment is an option available to the Senate, and that former Senator Jeff Flake suggested that a secret vote in the process could shield senators effectively from adverse political reactions by the \\"Trump base\\", thereby freeing them to vote for conviction. Weld estimated that under those circumstances, 30 to 35 votes to convict would be attained easily and that only 20 were needed. 2020 campaign developments = February 2020 =February 3: Weld wins 1.3% of the votes in the Iowa caucuses and one delegate to the Republican National Convention. *February 11: Weld wins 9.1% of the votes in the New Hampshire primary. = March 2020 = March 3: Weld wins 10.1% of the votes in the Vermont Primary, his best performance of any state. * March 3: Weld wins 1.52% of the vote in Alabama Primary. *March 18: Weld suspends his campaign.

Ward gained admission to Harrow school, where he excelled in arts, was an arts scholar and won every art prize for the duration of his time there. He trained at Chelsea College of Art and subsequently gained a Bachelor's Degree in Art and art history at Goldsmiths, University of London. His early exhibitions took place at the Nicholas Lusher Fine Art in Hamilton, Bermuda, before going on to complete a masters at Winchester School of Art and later presenting exhibitions at the Burnaby Gallery in Bermuda and at Tatistcheff's Fifth Avenue gallery in New York. In 2004, he became part of the International Fundraising Committee of the British Red Cross, for who he raised funds. Other works have included \\"Faces From The Dark\\" (2016). Early life Henry Liam Ward was born in 1971 in Colchester, Essex. His father, Martyn Ward, a High Court Judge in England and later a puisne judge in Bermuda and his mother (from Bermuda), encouraged him in arts by introducing him to Rembrandt and how the eyes of subjects in Rembrandt's paintings followed the viewer around the room. Other inspirational artists have included particularly Gustave Courbet and Edouard Manet. He was also inspired by the house he spent his early childhood in. The house, on the Essex-Suffolk border, was designed by a contemporary architect and based on Frank Lloyd Wright’s design Fallingwater. Ward completed his early education between 1984 and 1989 at Harrow School, where he took lessons in the history of art, in addition to life model drawing. He became a Harrow School Art Scholar, winning every art prize for the duration of his attendance there, while at the same time earning a reputation for which his parents were once informed that their son \\"was the naughtiest boy at Harrow since Winston Churchill\\". After graduating from Harrow, Ward completed his foundation training at the Chelsea College of Art in 1992 and subsequently in 1985 he gained a Bachelor's Degree in Art and art history at Goldsmiths College, where Damien Hirst and Fiona Rae also launched their careers. Early work In 1994–1995, Ward presented two exhibitions at the Nicholas Lusher Fine Art in Hamilton, Bermuda, which later established itself as the Lusher Gallery LLC in New York. These works were created at his mother's home in Suffolk, following the deaths of his father and best friend. In 1996, he completed his masters in \\"Contemporary Art Theory\\" at Winchester School of Art, with his thesis on the \\"history of contemporary figurative painting practice, as evidenced in the work of Eric Fischl and the California Arts Movement\\". Later in 1996, Ward presented an exhibition at the Burnaby Gallery in Bermuda. His work entitled Mick earned him the Royal Institute of Oil Painters Winsor and Newton Art Prize and he subsequently moved to New York where he continued his studies of Chuck Close, Eric Fischl, and Cindy Sherman. He set up a studio in the artists neighbourhood of Williamsburg where he was able to network with other artists. By the age of 28 he had presented exhibitions at Tatistcheff's Fifth Avenue gallery in New York. The British Red Cross An avid supporter of the British Red Cross, Ward has been part of its International Fundraising Committee, set up in 2004. He has helped raise funds for the charity and curated a number of exhibitions during his time with them. The 'Finger-Assisted' Nephrectomy of Professor Nadey Hakim In 2010, Ward was selected to be an exhibitor at the BP Portrait Awards at the National Portrait Gallery with his painting The 'Finger-Assisted' Nephrectomy of Professor Nadey Hakim, which he based on Rembrandt's The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp (1632). It was the largest portrait in the exhibition in its 30-year history of the Award. It then toured with the intention of one day being exhibited at the International Museum of Surgical Science in Chicago. In 2012, Sandy Nairne, director of the National Portrait Gallery, included the painting in his book 500 Portraits: 25 Years of The BP Portrait Award. Portrait of Queen Elizabeth II Ward was commissioned by the British Red Cross to paint a portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II to celebrate her 60-year tenure as the longest-serving patron of the British Red Cross. After taking photographs of the Queen during a two-hour sitting at Windsor Castle, he carried out the work in secret in his converted garage in Burlington. He was influenced by past royal portrait painters including Anthony van Dyck and Sir Joshua Reynolds. The painting, titled \\"Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II with the founder of the British Red Cross Henri Dunant\\" was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle in October 2016. Ward was congratulated by Premier of Bermuda, Michael Dunkley. Other works and exhibitions Ward's painting Bermuda Man (1999), is on display at the Bermuda National Gallery. In 2006, his work was included with the Harrow School alumni in \\"A Celebration of Art from Harrow School in London\\", held at Christie's.

He is credited with modernising the House of Lords Library as head librarian from 1977–91. Early life and education Morgan was born in Chelsea, London, the son of novelists Charles Langbridge Morgan and Hilda Vaughan. His paternal grandfather was engineer Sir Charles Langbridge Morgan. He was the younger brother of Shirley Paget, Marchioness of Anglesey (1924–2017). He and his sister grew up in Notting Hill until the Second World War, when, fearing a Nazi invasion after the Dunkirk, they moved with their mother to America. He spent two years at Phillips Academy in Andover, before returning home in 1942 to finish his schooling at Eton. From 1944–47, Morgan was a member of the Grenadier Guards, rising to the rank of captain and serving in postwar Germany. He read history at Brasenose College, Oxford, earning an MA. Career After leaving Oxford, Morgan worked as a photographer for society magazine Tatler while studying for the bar exam. In 1951, he began what he thought was a temporary job working in the House of Commons Library, Palace of Westminster. He spent 12 years there before moving to the House of Lords Library, which was badly in need of updating. He took over as head librarian following a report by a working group, led by David Eccles, 1st Viscount Eccles, that recommended creating a research service, hiring qualified librarians for the first time, acquiring updated books, and \\"dipping a toe in information technology.\\" Between 1977 and his retirement, Morgan transformed the Lords library at a time when the composition of the House of Lords was evolving. He oversaw its modernisation \\"from a parliamentary backwater\\" and \\"gentleman\\"s reading library\\" into a \\"hi-tech source of information for the increasing number of expert, working life peers.\\" Morgan recruited a research staff and began the massive project of transferring the library's index of some 120,000 books from cars to microfiche. He continued to improve the library as technology advanced. In 1978, the library was equipped with its first two computer terminals and a Prestel machine. When he retired in 1991, the library's entire catalogue was online and had started subscribing to online databases. Morgan was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1991 New Year Honours. Personal life From 1951–65, Morgan was married to Catherine Harriet Waterfield, with whom he had a son and daughter, James and Lucie, and two sons, Luke and Piers, who predeceased him. He married secondly American Susan Vogel Marrian in 1965,England & Wales, Civil Registration Marriage Index, 1916-2005 and had another son, Tobias. He suffered three strokes before dying in 2018, aged 91.

The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is responsible for issuing permits, quotas and law enforcement.  Use   Geography  = Climate = = Seasonal variations in sea conditions =  Ecology  Marine ecoregions of the South African Exclusive Economic Zone: uThukela Banks Marine Protected Area is in the ???? ecoregion The MPA is in the warm temperate Agulhas inshore marine bioregion to the east of Cape Point which extends eastwards to the Mbashe River. There are a moderate proportion of species endemic to South Africa along this coastline. Three major habitats exist in the sea in this region, two of them distinguished by the nature of the substrate. The substrate, or base material, is important in that it provides a base to which an organism can anchor itself, which is vitally important for those organisms which need to stay in one particular kind of place. Rocky shores and reefs provide a firm fixed substrate for the attachment of plants and animals. Sandy beaches and sedimentary bottoms are a relatively unstable substrate and cannot anchor many of the larger benthic organisms. Finally there is open water, above the substrate and clear of the kelp forest, where the organisms must drift or swim. Mixed habitats are also frequently found, which are a combination of those mentioned above. Rocky reefs There are rocky reefs and mixed rocky and sandy bottoms. For many marine organisms the substrate is another type of marine organism, and it is common for several layers to co-exist. The type of rock of the reef is of some importance, as it influences the range of possibilities for the local topography, which in turn influences the range of habitats provided, and therefore the diversity of inhabitants. Sandstone and other sedimentary rocks erode and weather very differently, and depending on the direction of dip and strike, and steepness of the dip, may produce reefs which are relatively flat to very high profile and full of small crevices. These features may be at varying angles to the shoreline and wave fronts. There are fewer large holes, tunnels and crevices in sandstone reefs, but often many deep but low near-horizontal crevices. Sedimentary bottoms (including silt, mud, sand, shelly, pebble and gravel bottoms) Sediment bottoms at first glance appear to be fairly barren areas, as they lack the stability to support many of the spectacular reef based species, and the variety of large organisms is relatively low. The sediment may be moved around by water action, to a greater or lesser degree depending on weather conditions and exposure of the area. This means that sessile organisms must be specifically adapted to areas of relatively loose substrate to thrive in them, and the variety of species found on a sediment bottom will depend on all these factors. Unconsolidated sediment bottoms have one important compensation for their instability, animals can burrow into the sand and move up and down within its layers, which can provide feeding opportunities and protection from predation. Other species can dig themselves holes in which to shelter, or may feed by filtering water drawn through the tunnel, or by extending body parts adapted to this function into the water above the sand. The open sea The pelagic water column is the major part of the living space at sea. This is the water between the surface and the top of the benthic zone, where living organisms swim, float or drift, and the food chain starts with phytoplankton, the mostly microscopic photosynthetic organisms that convert the energy of sunlight into organic material which feeds nearly everything else, directly or indirectly. In temperate seas there are distinct seasonal cycles of phytoplankton growth, based on the available nutrients and the available sunlight. Either can be a limiting factor. Phytoplankton tend to thrive where there is plenty of light, and they themselves are a major factor in restricting light penetration to greater depths, so the photosynthetic zone tends to be shallower in areas of high productivity. Zooplankton feed on the phytoplankton, and are in turn eaten by larger animals. The larger pelagic animals are generally faster moving and more mobile, giving them the option of changing depth to feed or to avoid predation, and to move to other places in search of a better food supply. = Marine species diversity = The MPA includes nursery areas and spawning grounds of commercially important fish and shark species.

In the following days, rescuers managed to save 43 people, while 16 bodies were recovered in the nearby waters. The investigation conducted by the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee concluded that the main cause of the accident was the crew's decision to continue to Ambon despite deteriorating weather conditions. While it was en route to Ambon, the speedboat that the ferry was tugging suddenly struck the stern of the ferry. After failing to stop the resulting leak, the Captain instructed the passengers and crews to abandon the ferry. Sinking MV Wahai Star departed Namrole Harbour on Buru Island at 09.00 a.m local time. A speedboat, which was used to carry the passengers to the ferry, was tugged along the route. At 20:00 p.m local time, as it was travelling to Ambon, weather conditions began to deteriorate. Heavy winds blew from the southeast and waves reaching 3 meters in height struck the ferry. Crew members suddenly heard a loud impact on the stern of the ferry. A quick examination revealed that the impact was caused by the tugged speedboat. The force of the impact caused a leak in the engine compartment. Crew members tried to pump the water out of the ferry, but were forced to use buckets instead due to the sub-optimal functioning of the pump. At 21:30 p.m, the Captain of MV Wahai Star ordered the crew members to distribute life-jackets to the passengers and to issue a distress call to local authorities. This distress call was not replied to. All attempts to drain the water proved unsuccessful and the engine compartment flooded, causing the lighting of the ferry to fail. The ferry was repeatedly struck by waves reaching 3–4 meters high, causing the ferry to lose its stability. It began to list to its port side. At 22:00 p.m, the Captain ordered all passengers and crew to abandon the ferry. Search and rescue The vessel that managed to reach the site first was a tanker ship that was passing by. Several hours after the sinking, rescuers managed to save 23 passengers from the sea. They were taken to Ambon, the provincial capital of Maluku. 2 bodies were also recovered. The rescue effort was hampered by bad weather. On 14 July, as many as 5 ships were deployed. The death toll then rose to 15 as more bodies were recovered. An additional 2 survivors were found. In total, rescuers managed to save 43 people, while 16 bodies were recovered. Another 15 people were declared as missing and presumed dead. Passengers and crews There were conflicting reports on the number of passengers and crew on board. Initially, between 60-100 people were reported to be on board. It was later revised to 60. The administrator of the local harbour stated that a total of 42 people were on the ferry. However, the search and rescue team reported that more than 61 people, including those who died in the sinking, had been evacuated from the sea. The final report, published by the NTSC, indicated that there were more than 60 passengers and crew on board, but did not specify an exact number. Investigation Prior to the ferry's departure, ground officials had issued warnings not to travel to the waters around Ambon Island due to the deteriorating weather conditions. Officials suspected that the crew of the ferry ignored the warnings. The official final report finally concluded that the sinking was caused by the high waves that had been produced by the adverse weather conditions in the area. The high waves moved the tugged speedboat to the stern of the ferry, causing a powerful impact. The impact was powerful enough to cause a leak. Because the draining efforts were unsuccessful, the ferry flooded and capsized.

It was registered as a monument historique on 4 May 1925. History The old castle of Mauléon originated in the 11th century, when the viscounty of Soule was formed, as a motte-and-bailey castle erected on a hill, simply composed of a wooden tower, flanked by a farmyard, all protected by a palisade surrounded by a moat. In 1261, the English king who held the title of Viscount, decided to assert his authority, especially militarily, through a châtelain, paid by him. Between 1272 and 1287, Edward I, concerned with the quality of his strongholds, imposed repairs and strengthening of the castle fortifications. This work was continued in 1319 and 1374 by later châtelains. After vain attempts to capture the castle from England, and sometimes temporarily successful attempts (as between 1295 and 1307), Gaston IV, Count of Foix, favouring the King of France, initiated in 1449 the reconquest of Guyenne by taking Mauléon. When he died on the battlefield in 1472, the castle, as well as the whole of Soule, became permanently attached to France. It suffered new, but short-lived, attacks in 1523 by the Prince of Orange and the Lord of Luxe. In the second half of the 16th century, the castle suffered during the French Wars of Religion and it was burned on this occasion. In 1642, by order of Louis XIII, the castle was demolished. In 1648, a partial reconstruction was organized but the castle was finally abandoned. Under the French Revolution, it was used as a prison, a function it kept for years. In 1831, the Minister of War refused its restoration although it housed a garrison until 1870, when the town becomes the owner. The old castle of Mauléon is a registered historic monument by decree of 4 May 1925. Description SourceLeaflet given to visitors to the castle The castle is built on top of a hill dominating the town in front of the Matalon hill (439 m). It has the shape of a pentagon oriented north-east south-west. In front of the castle, two flat spaces are located at each end and probably housed homes in the Middle Ages. The southwestern one is now overgrown. The castle is accessed on the north-east side by an outcrop, a stone bridge with three arches and formerly a small drawbridge. Most of the buildings are on this north-east side. They consist of small rooms that housed a small garrison. The walls are enhanced by the construction of the castle on a hill. They are not crenellated. They are reinforced by three corner towers. They are pierced with loopholes for the artillery, especially on the town side. In the castle courtyard are: * The very narrow entrance to the dungeons at the foot of the buildings * A deep well to reach the water table * To the southwest, the almost-levelled ruins of the medieval keep, destroyed in the 18th century. The drawbridge has been removed (including the lifting chains) and replaced by planks. Cinema Le Monde vivant, directed by Eugène Green, was shot at the Château de Mauléon.

national parliament of Spain. It is located in the Spanish Navy Square, in the center of the City of Madrid. History The building was built in the 16th century and was the home of a Saint Augustine Order school called Incarnation School or Doña María de Aragón School. The school was one of the most outstanding institutions of the capital, and its church contained several masterpieces of El Greco, today in the Prado Museum. In 1814 and between 1820 and 1823 the palace was the home of the Cortes of Cádiz, the first official parliament of Spain. With the approval of the Royal Statute of 1834, the Cortes Generales was established as a bicameral parliament with the Chamber of Peers as the upper house. The Chambers of Peers moved to the palace in 1835 and with many name and powers changes, this palace continued serving as the home of the upper house of the Cortes until 1923. During the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923-1930), the Cortes were dissolved and was created the National Consultative Assembly which had its home in the Palacio de las Cortes. With the arrival of the Second Republic, the unicameral parliament established its home at the Palacio de las Cortes and the constitutional debates were held at the Palacio de Cristal del Retiro. During the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, the palace was the home of the National Council of the Movement, a pseudo Senate controlled by Franco. With the return of democracy in 1977, the Senate was restored in its original home and, along with the Congress of Deputies, wrote the democratic Constitution of 1978.

Early life Beaver was born in Hampstead, London in 1932, the first of five children of Virginia (nee Virginia Maxwell Ayrton, daughter of Maxwell Ayrton) and Courtenay Theobald, the architect (Maxwell Ayrton's practice partner, as well as son-in-law). The Ayrton family originated in Yorkshire, though Tessa Theobald descended from a branch long-resident in Cheshire. Her forebear Edward Ayrton was mayor of Ripon in 1760, and laid the foundations for the family's subsequent prominence. Beaver studied at the Slade School of Art, achieving her Diploma in Fine Art in 1953. She studied etching for a year afterwards with John Buckland-Wright. Career  Her career began, under her birth name of Tessa Theobald, as an illustrator and designer of book jackets. She became the art editor of children's books at Oxford University Press and later at Thomas Nelson. She is also known for her painting and etching. Following her marriage to Harold Beaver, the couple took up a post in Kenya. There, she travelled extensively around the country, developing her knowledge of woodblock printing. On her return to UK, she taught printmaking at Mid-Warwickshire College. In 1989 she was commissioned to create a set of prints to mark Birmingham's centenary. In 2014 a large exhibition of her work at Leamington Spa Art Gallery & Museum was accompanied by major monograph on her work My Craft or Sullen Art (). She exhibited at international exhibitions of printmaking in Brazil, China, Poland, Italy and Netherlands. Beaver's prints have been shown at the Society of Wood Engravers, the Royal Society of Painters, Etchers and Engravers, the Royal Academy Summer Exhibitions. She has held solo shows at the University of Warwick, the Lantern Gallery in Manchester, St. Michael's Gallery in Derby, the Quadrangle Gallery in Oxford and the Mignon Gallery in Bath. She was a prize winner at the 5th Seoul International Print Biennale in South Korea.  Personal life  She married Harold Beaver on 12 October 1957.

Not shown is the holder for glass plate photos. The parallactic instrument of Kapteyn is a measuring instrument created by the Dutch astronomer Jacobus Kapteyn around 1886. Using this instrument, Kapteyn analyzed over 1,700 glass plate photos of stars seen from the southern hemisphere.van der Kruit, P. C. (2015) Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn, Born Investigator of the Heavens. Springer, Switzerland (p.176-182, j 204 (citing Wessel Krul), 217, h 496) This research contributed to the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung, a star catalogue containing 454,875 entries. Together with the measurements of stars seen from the northern hemisphere (the Bonner Durchmusterung) the measurements of Kapteyn formed a complete star catalogue with a scope and accuracy that was impressive for its time. The instrument is currently located in the collection of the University Museum of Groningen.Coimbra Group, 2017, information gathered on 15-2-2019  Origin  Since Kapteyn lacked an observatory of his own in Groningen, he used a homemade instrument for the analysis of glass plate photos of stars, made by his colleague David Gill in Cape Town. Kapteyn built the instrument with several parts from other (measuring) instruments. Although Kapteyn called it a ‘parallactic instrument’, the instrument is not related to the parallax effect. The name may come from the chassis of the instrument, which is originally from an instrument with a 'parallactic mount'.Boomsma, C. (interview with Jan Waling Huisman) (2013) Schatten van Kapteyn. UK online magazine  Use  A drawing of the instrument of Kapteyn. A photo of the instrument of Kapteyn and its accompanying glass plate holder. The distribution of the glass plate photos over the sky. The plates overlap at the edges. Three researchers were needed to perform measurements with the instrument, each with their own task: # Aiming the lens at a star, estimating the diameter of the star, and reading the declination. # Reading the right ascension using a small microscope. # Writing down the results, as told to him by the other researchers.Gill D., Kapteyn J.C. (1875) Cape Photographic Durchmusterung To use the instrument, the researcher must look through the ocular (part J), and aim the lens (H) at a glass plate photo (see drawing). The distance between the center point of the instrument and the plate to be measured must be the same distance as the focal length of the telescope that was used to take the photos (in the case of Gill's photos: . By rotating the right axis (B) the researcher can aim the lens at a star of interest. The researcher can read the position of the star on the wheel (D) below the right axis (B). Similarly, parts A and C can be used to determine the right ascension. Part L is no longer on the instrument. Using this smaller telescope the researcher could correctly position the instrument in relation to the glass plate photo. For each position on the sky, Kapteyn used two photos (each made on a different night). He placed these photos in sequence (with approximately 1 millimeter of space in between), with one being slightly displaced. This allowed him to easily distinguish stars from dust particles on the glass plate.  Use by Kapteyn  Kapteyn and his staff members analyzed the first photo (aimed at the south pole) on October 28, 1886 and the final photo (aimed at 85° declination) on June 9, 1887. They used in the instrument in a laboratory of Dirk Huizinga, a professor in physiology who made two of his rooms available to them. Kapteyn and his staff members analyzed the glass plate photos in duplicate and darkened the room to get a better view of details in the photos.Sawerthal, H. (1889) Notes on visits to some continental observatories. Obs, 12, 344–349. Kapteyn and his staff performed some repeat measurements in 1892, 1896, 1897 and 1892. Kapteyn and Gill published their Durchmusterung in three volumes that together formed the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung: declination zones -18° to -37° (1896), -38° to -52° (1897) and -53° to -89° (1900). = Influence on the private life of Kapteyn = Working with the instrument had a significant impact on the health and private life of Kapteyn. Kapteyn often felt pain in his eyes and stomach and became easily agitated due to the intense labor. After completing one of the last measurements, Kapteyn wrote to Gill: \\"...- and the truth is that I find my patience nearly exhausted\\", with which he referred to the analysis for the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung. Additionally, Kapteyn wrote about working on the Durchmusterung: \\"There is a sort of fate that which makes me do my life long just what I want to do least of all.\\" = Prisoners = The British astronomer Arthur Stanley Eddington claimed that prisoners were part of the staff of Kapteyn that worked with his instrument. However, this fact is deemed implausible, since prisoners only performed relatively simple tasks in this time period and because this fact was never brought up in any correspondence with Kapteyn.  Impact  The publication of the measurements performed with the instrument of Kapteyn marked a major breakthrough for Kapteyn in the field of astronomy. In 1901 Kapteyn was the first Dutchman to receive a golden medal from the British Royal Astronomical Society. Kapteyn had been a member of this organisation since 1892. Furthermore, working with the instrument may have inspired the theories of Kapteyn about the shape of the Milky Way. Kapteyn first discussed these theories in 1891 during a rectorial speech.van Berkel, K. (2017) Universiteit van het Noorden Deel 2 1876-1945. Uitgeverij verloren. p.68 The American astronomer Simon Newcomb praised Kapteyn and his work: \\"This work [the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung] of Kapteyn offers a remarkable example of the spirit which animates the born investigator of the heavens.\\"Newcomb, S. (1901) The Stars: A study of the Universe. New York : Putnam. Jacob Halm remarked that the results of the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung had an accuracy comparable to that of the results of the northern hemisphere.Halm, J. (1918) On the Magnitudes of the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 78, Issue 3, P.199–212 The astronomer Henry Sawerthal, who visited the laboratory of Kapteyn in 1889, described the results as \\"...sufficient in the present instance to give results more accurate than those of the Northern Durchmusterung, a remark which not only applies to positions, but to magnitude (also).\\"Sawerthal, H.

Brown was involved in art education, developing curriculum that challenged the typical mimetic approach of teaching in favor of more individual creativity. The focus of Brown's life was her career as an educator, but she was also a prolific artist in her own right. She made illustrations for African American publications such as The Brownie's Book and Crisis magazine. She was also a painter and printmaker. Her prints are included in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of art and the Art Institute of Chicago.  Personal life  Hilda Rue Wilkinson Brown was born in Washington D.C in 1894. Brown is the only one of five grandchildren to have remained in Washington, D.C., where her great-grandmother first moved after being freed from slavery in 1835. In 1929 she married a physician named Schley Brown, and in 1937 the two purchased a brownstone on 237 Rhode Island Avenue in LeDroit Park. This neighborhood would become the subject of many of Brown's paintings. Because of its proximity to local schools, LeDroit Park attracted black educators and scholars, fostering a community of intellectuals. One such community member was the renowned African American writer Langston Hughes, who lived in LeDroit Park in the 1920s. Although he left before Brown moved to the neighborhood, she was acquainted with his family. Brown spent summers at her second home in Oak Bluffs, Martha's Vineyard until 1980. At the time, Oak Bluffs was a popular vacation destination among upper and middle class African Americans, making Brown a part of both this local community and the one in LeDroit Park. In her spare time she enjoyed gardening and making pottery and clay sculptures. According to her niece, Brown had learned how to sculpt and make pottery when she attended Columbia University, and would gift these objects to friends or use them herself to decorate her home. A sociable woman, Brown was also a member of the Coo Coos, a local chapter of the social organization The Girl Friends, a social club for African American women. Hilda Wilkinson Brown and Schley Brown did not have children of their own, but they were very close to Hilda's maternal niece, artist Lilian Thomas Burwell. Schley Brown was named Burwell's godfather when he and Hilda married. Burwell attended Pratt Institute, a university in Brooklyn, New York, on a scholarship. Hilda and Schley Brown financially supported Burwell's education by paying the portion of her tuition that was not covered by the scholarship, and by purchasing her art supplies. Burwell's parents had concerns about how she could achieve financial stability in the unpredictable art world, but Brown persuaded them to allow Burwell to continue her passion by suggesting she teach art. Lilian Thomas Burwell guest curated Hilda Wilkinson Brown's posthumous retrospective at the Howard University Gallery in 1983. Burwell has reflected on her aunt's life and career in articles for Washington History and The International Review of African American Art. At the end of her life Brown became legally blind, leaving her bedridden until the time of her passing. She died of congestive heart failure in 1981 at the age of 86 in her home in Washington, D.C.  Education  Hilda Wilkinson Brown graduated high school from Miner Normal School, which was later renamed Miner Teacher's College and absorbed by the University of the District of Columbia. According to her niece, Brown also attended M Street High School, but the amount of time she spent here is not specified. She earned her Bachelor's in Education at Howard University and her Masters from Columbia University. She also studied at Cooper Union, The National Academy of Design and the Art Students League in New York City.  Career  = Miner Normal School = In 1923, after graduating from Cooper Union in New York City, Brown started her first teaching job at her alma mater—Miner Normal School in Washington D.C. There she coordinated a two-year art history, design and fine arts curriculum and eventually chaired the department. In 1929 she integrated fine art and industrial arts into the school's teacher training program. From 1932 until her retirement in 1961, Brown created set and costume designs for the school's theater productions, created graphics for the school, and designed its seal. She was an assistant professor at the time of her retirement. = Public schools = While she was heavily invested in Miner Normal School, Brown also worked with public schools throughout Washington D.C. In 1933 she introduced the \\"modern\\" approach to art education in segregated Negro schools, which championed individual creativity rather than the mimetic approach to teaching art that was usually taught. She lectured at Howard University and other schools throughout Washington D.C. on African art heritage, art in interior design, and art education for elementary school teachers. = Other = Brown was on the first board of directors of the Barnett Aven Collection, a private collection which was one of the first to show work by black artists.  Artistic career  Hilda Wilkinson Brown was a highly skilled painter and printmaker, but she was aware of the restrictions being a woman in her era placed on her art making. Lilian Thomas Burwell recalls that Brown felt women's domestic responsibilities prevented them from making art as full- heartedly and self-centeredly as male artists. While Brown recognized the limitations this posed to her and other female artists' chances of recognition, she was passionate about domestic work and teaching, and was unwilling to compromise these passions to advance her artistic career. Brown kept only a small number of lithographs and sketches, most of which are artist's proofs. The graphite drawing Oak Bluffs in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago and the lithograph The Family in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art are rare in that they survive. To further complicate a full understanding of her artistic output, most of her pieces are undated and unsigned. A painting titled Third Street was found behind a furnace in Brown's basement after her death. This seeming disregard for her art attests to both her high standards and the fact that she was not seeking recognition as an artist. Although Brown's paintings indicate talent, Burwell has suggested that Brown may have seen art making as a mere hobby. = Painting = Brown's oil paintings reflect an interest in the community and familiar settings around her. She painted still lifes, portraits and neighborhood scenes within LeDroit Park. During her summers in Martha's Vineyard the artist painted local landscapes in watercolor.  University Neighborhood  University Neighborhood was painted from a window at Miner Normal School looking east toward McMillan Reservoir. Brown rendered the route she took walking to and from work each day in an abstract form. It is not an exact painting of the street. Rather, Brown selected particular buildings and omitted others, rendering the path in geometric fragments.  Side Street  Side Street was painted from an elevated deck outside of the artist's kitchen. This painting shows the street, looking north toward Third and T street. The actual layout of the road is abstracted to prioritize an interesting composition over geographical accuracy.  Langston or Young Man Studying  Sometimes titled Langston, Young Man Studying is a portrait of Langston Hughes. For a brief period in the 1920s, Langston Hughes lived in Hilda Wilkinson Brown's neighborhood with his family. It is unknown if he actually sat for the portrait. The image was owned by the Howard University Gallery of Art at one time.  Portrait of a Girl  The subject of this painting is unknown, although the likeness of the hair style and chin, and the intense stare suggests it may be a self-portrait.  Ada  This painting of a women at work in a kitchen reflects the artist's sensitivity toward domestic labor as the artist herself enjoyed spending time in her kitchen preparing meals for others. = Commercial illustration and printmaking = For a short time Brown created prints and illustrations for significant African American publications. In the 1920s she worked as a main commercial illustrator for The Brownies' Book, a magazine for African American children edited by W.E.B. DuBois and Jesse Redmond. Hilda Wilkinson Brown and Lucille Rogers designed the cover for the June, 1920 cover of The Crisis, another African American publication founded by DuBois. In 1940 she made six linoleum block prints for the first edition of E. Franklin Frazier's book The Negro Family in the United States. The author, her brother-in-law, wrote in her copy that her work \\"made evident what (he) tried to write\\". = Style = Even Brown's artistic production reflects her passion for education. In a review of her exhibition at Howard University Gallery, Paul Richard of the Washington Post said \\"hers are images that teach.\\" Curator of the National Museum of American Art Merry Forester wrote that Brown \\"grappled with the problems of Fauvism, Cubism and Expressionism,\\" reflected the influence of Realism, Precisionism and Conceptualism, and that \\"she worked in a style that only few in her time were courageous enough to use.\\"  Selected exhibitions Exhibited at Howard University Gallery of Art, 1932. *Exhibited in the First Annual Metropolitan State Art Contest at the United States National Museum (now the National Gallery of Art), 1936. *Ada was exhibited at the Exhibition of Fine Arts Productions by American Negroes in the Hall of Negro Life at the Texas Centennial, 1936. *Exhibited in Art of the American Negro at Howard University, 1937. *Still Life with Tulips was exhibited at Howard University Gallery of Art in 1940. *Hilda Wilkinson Brown: A Washington Artist Rediscovered.

Breccia's artistic works explore the human being with a hermeneutic approach (in the sense of the modern hermenutic philosophy, Jaspers, Heidegger, Gadamer) and engage in a variety of philosophical themes. Breccia's oeuvre consists of oil paintings, pencil and oil pastel drawings, 7 books, 10 short stories and numerous other works. Breccia has held around 80 one-man shows all over the world. Education and Early life Pier Augusto Breccia was born in Trento, in North-Eastern Italy, on April 12, 1943. His father's family had originated from a small Umbrian village, Porano, in Central Italy, to where his mother, Elsa Faini from Trento, had moved towards the end of WW II. Pier Augusto's parents were both clinicians: Elsa was a chief operation theatre nurse, and his father Angelo was a surgeon. When Pier Augusto was five, his family moved from Porano to Rome, where Pier Augusto spent most of his life. Breccia attended the senior high school “Liceo Classico Giulio Cesare” in Rome, where he developed his lifelong love of humanities. His learning was precocious at a young age: at fourteen he studied Dante’s Divine Comedy, unaided, whose allegoric representations fascinated the young Pier Augusto for their artistic value. Soon afterwards, he discovered the Classics and translated Sophocles' “Antigone” and “Prometheus Bound” by Aeschylus, from Ancient Greek to Italian in blank hendecasyllabics. Still in his adolescence, he also translated Plato's “Dialogues”, which introduced him to Socrates, one of his great teachers. At the age of eighteen, Breccia graduated from high school with top marks. Although his knowledge of classics was extensive and had grown far beyond that of a student of his age, his chosen career was a contrast to this background. In 1961, he embarked on a career in science and followed his father's footsteps. He enrolled in the medical school at the newly inaugurated Catholic University of Rome (Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore), and in July 1967, in reward for an outstanding academic performance, he was selected to receive the first Medical Degree of the new school with highest marks and honours. Medical life After graduating \\"cum laude\\", Breccia was awarded a scholarship to continue his studies, and specialized in Urology, General Surgery and later in Cardiovascular Surgery. He also began practising at the Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic in Rome. Breccia married Maria Antonietta Vinciguerra in 1969, and by 1971 his two children were born. During the early seventies, his commitment to surgery took him to Stockholm, where he worked in the Centre of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery at the Karolinska Institute under the supervision of Viking Björk. Whilst Breccia's work in Sweden in the early seventies kept him away from his family, he continued to work at the Catholic University in Rome in the Gemelli Hospital, where in 1979 he became Associate Professor and clinical lecturer in General Surgery. During the 1970s, he completed over one thousand open-heart operations and published more than fifty papers in medical journals. A turning point: from the bistoury to a pencil Rifugio d'amore, pencil on paper, Pier Auggusto Breccia, 1979 It was in 1977 during a summer holiday, when, Pier Augusto discovered an unknown skill for drawing and fascinated by his new-found talent, in the following two years, Breccia practiced drawing, which yet remained nothing more than a hobby. However, in 1979, after the death of his father Angelo, his drawing talent found a creative expression . The deep interest in Classics of his youth, matured by his human experience of fifteen years of medical life, re-emerged anew. In the following two years, he prepared his ‘opera prima’, Oltreomega (Beyond Omega), a book of drawings and philosophical thoughts, presented in October 1981 by the Italian critic and poet Cesare Vivaldi, the Director of the Fine Art Academy of Rome. The work was received with critical and public acclaim. Pier Augusto Breccia and Emilio Greco. Exhibition: \\"Oltreomega\\", Galleria Maitani, Orvieto, 1981 Between 1981 and 1983, Breccia held a number of exhibitions in Italy and abroad (‘Choral Monologue’, ‘The concrete shapes of the non-existent’, ‘The Semantics of Silence’), and his new involvement as an artist became so absorbing that, in August 1983, Breccia took a leave of absence from his medical position. During the next two years, his artistic style, which Breccia called \\"ideomorphic\\", became more defined, as well as his aesthetic philosophy, which he presented in his 1984 book, “L’Eterno Mortale”. He resigned his position as a surgeon in 1985, when he had two consecutive exhibitions in New York, in the Gucci Gallery and the Arras Gallery. His new career, which Breccia felt more as a “mission” , developed rapidly and as he resigned as a surgeon, he moved to New York where he spent most of his time between 1985-96. During this period, he had exhibitions throughout the United States, in New York, Columbus, Santa Fe, Miami and Houston. Pier Augusto Breccia and Pope John Paul II, Rome, 1985 From the very beginning of his journey as an artist, Breccia was extremely prolific. His first ten years of artistic production and philosophic reflections were presented in his 1992 book, “Animus-Anima”,P.A. BRECCIA, Animus-anima, Vita e Pensiero, Milano 1992 a monumental work, “densely reasoned and rigidly philosophic” which includes 500 images of his paintings and reveals with great lucidity the theoretical postulates of Ideomorphism. In 1996, Breccia moved back to Rome, from where he exhibited throughout Italy (Palazzo dei Papi, Viterbo,1997; Vittoriano, Rome, 2002; Palazzo Ziino, Palermo, 2004; Palazzo dei Sette, Orvieto, 2000 and 2007; Palazzo Venezia, Rome, 2007; Rocca Paolina, Perugia, 2010; Fortezza, Montepulciano, 2012) and throughout Europe (Zurich, Brussels, Nice, Montecarlo and Saint Petersburg). In 1996, Breccia wrote \\"The Other Book\\",P.A. BRECCIA, The Other Book, Di renzo, Rome 1996 which includes more than a hundred unpublished images from 1991 to 1999 and visionary short stories, critical self reflections and other reflections on the meaning of art and life. In 1999, he wrote “The suspended language of the Self-consciousness” and in 2004 he published “Introduction to Hermeneutic Painting”,P.A. BRECCIA, Introduction to Hermeneutic Painting, 2004 his art Manifesto. On November 17, 2017, two weeks after his last exhibition in Trento, Breccia suffered a heart attack (a third one from 1998) in his studio in Rome; he was taken to the Gemelli Hospital, the same where, forty years earlier, he had devoted himself as a heart surgeon. On Monday, November 20, 2017, Pier Augusto Breccia died at the age of seventy-four. Throughout his career as an artist, Breccia held around 80 solo exhibitions, and produced works purchased by collectors all over the world. Pier Augusto Breccia. Exhibition: \\"Hermeneutic Painting\\", Manege Museum, Saint Petersburg, 2011. Reason and imagination: “the thinking space” Pier Augusto Breccia painting \\"Tornado\\" (oil on canvas) in his studio in Rome, 2014 Space is perhaps the most distinctive element in Breccia's paintings. Two interwoven aspects characterise it. Firstly, a paradoxical sense of space, as the space looks purely rational and purely arbitrary at the same time; “The prospective is apparently precise yet elusive.”(Cesare VivaldiP.A. BRECCIA, Oltreomega, 1981, p.9) This paradox of space is omnipresent in Breccia's canvases and has echoes in the contrast between the technical rigour of the lines, colours, chiaroscuro, and the unreality or impossibility of those elements. “Everything is neatly defined and everything is unlikely; the human anatomy is arbitrary yet detailed”. (Cesare Vivaldi, “Oltreomega”, p. 9). However, if reason repeatedly suspends itself and collapses in Breccia's space, the sense of harmony and balance, which characterises all of his works, lets the imagination enter into the space without any agonies. The imagination perceives the harmony or rather the perfect balance, where everything is and goes as it should ‘for some reason’, but not for ‘an exact one’. Thus, the space subjected to reason from what is incomprehensible, immeasurable, and impossible becomes an in-comprehensible and in-possible place, that is, comprehensible and possible from within, or to use Breccia's words: “thinking space”. Forms, colours and light: de-objectification \\"Il luogo e l'altrove\\", Pier Augusto Breccia. Oil on canvas, cm70X100, 2010 Breccia's canvases are intensely populated by “objects”, all apparently located at the ‘right place’ not for one objective reason (i.e. the correct Cartesian three- dimensional metric) but by a harmonious balance of forms and colours. Yet, Breccia's objects have very little or no objectivity left, as they are deconstructed into essential forms/colours or become “space itself” or “something other than itself”. This process of de-objectification transforms objects into languages, signs or “ciphers” (as defined by Karl Jaspers) open to endless and free interpretations. The use of the light and the chiaroscuro parallels that of the space and the perspective in the multitude of paradoxes. Never in Breccia's paintings one can find a well-defined source of light; yet the chiaroscuro seems perfectly executed and the abundance of light is such that even the distinctive starry night skies are bright (Breccia's painting techniques manipulates the texture of the paint to produce light by reflecting or absorbing the physical light). The absence of a light source from within the space of the canvas contributes to ‘clean’ the space of any emotional content. One could say that Breccia's paintings \`do not have a mood’. This means that the paintings do not establish private connections with the viewer, who might have, or who might be experiencing some particular mood. Furthermore, whilst an objective light would guide towards a particular point of the canvas and suggest a particular (subjective) point of view, or obscure what the artist senses as unknown or mysterious, the diffused brightness of Breccia's paintings leaves the viewer free from the subjective vision of the artist. If, generally, light is associated with what is rationally comprehensible, such as the “light of reason”, in Breccia's space everything appears both bright and mysterious. On one hand, the painting invites the viewer to explore the space with the eye of reason, yet on the other hand, the painting evokes the mystery with full brightness, as an opening towards all possible reasons and metrics of space. When the works of Breccia go under the lens of pure reason, reason itself ends up evaporating in a cloud of paradoxes, making the immeasurable incomprehensible and renewing the mystery. And it is precisely the immunity of mystery to the assaults of reason, that triggers the one very emotion that Breccia's paintings evoke: “wonder”. Hermeneutic painting \\"Art box\\", Pier Augusto Breccia. Oil on canvas, cm100X70, 2006 Breccia has used the term “Hermeneutic art” to describe his position as an artist in his manifesto “Introduction to Hermeneutic Painting” (2004). “Hermeneutic art” refers to the creative process of the artist who: Hermeneutic painting does not illustrate emotions or propose meanings, concepts, visions or what we already know of our self. The hermeneutic artist as well as the viewer can find in art an ontological value, simply put by Breccia: Thus, like a scientist such as an astronomer, who points his telescope towards an unknown part of the sky to reveal new stars or other celestial bodies, hermeneutic art is a way to know, where the ‘object’ of knowledge is the subject itself. Somewhat like the astronomer's telescope, the hermeneutic artwork is open on “one side to the endless otherness of being or God, and on the other side to the personal consciousness of the ‘I’.”(Introduction to Hermeneutic Painting, 2004). In this context, the language of art has an extremely empowering task:  References  = Citations = = Bibliography =   * External links *free books on itunes *The educational path of Ideomorphism 1943 births 2017 deaths 20th-century Italian artists 20th- century Italian painters ","title":"Pier Augusto Breccia"},{"id":"59972282","text":"Ted 'Leather' McFadden (1880-1949) was an Australian professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1900s and 1910s.

She is one of the founders of the Mizrahi feminist movement, and one of the leading theorists of Mizrahi feminism.  Biography  Dahan Kalev was born in Morocco and immigrated to Israel with her parents when she was a toddler in 1949. After their immigration, they were housed in the \\"Sha'ar Aliyah\\" immigrant camp. From there they moved to Pardes Hanna, Tiberias and Holon, and when she was ten they moved to Jerusalem. She completed her bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees at the Hebrew University in the Department of Political Science. Her master's thesis was on the subject of \\"Intellectuals in Politics\\". She received her PhD in 1992. Her dissertation title was \\"Self-Organizing System: Wadi Salib and the Black Panthers - Implications for Israeli Society.\\" This was the first study to be conducted on the events of Wadi Salib and the connection between Wadi Salib and the Black Panthers protests. The study dealt with the mechanisms of discrimination by state institutions toward Mizrahim. Its major conclusions included the great missed opportunity of the State of Israel to accommodate protest as a democratic act. Parts of the research were published as articles by the Israel Democracy Institute, the Yad Ben Zvi Institute and in the Van Leer Institute publications. Her article \\"Mizrahi Feminism - Between East and West\\" deals with the growth of the Mizrahi feminist in Israel. Another article written by Dahan Kalev is \\"You're so pretty, you do not look Moroccan\\", which was translated into several languages, and is taught in postcolonial programs in Israel and abroad. Dahan Kalev is a researcher of political thought, feminist theory, the interplay between gender and politics, globalization and postcolonialism. She was a research fellow at the Institute for the Study of Ideology of the Department of Political Science and International Relations at Oxford University and was a visiting professor at Somerville College. She founded and served as the head of the Gender Studies Program at Ben Gurion University and lectures at the Social and Economics College. She is a member of the National Press Council, the Public Committee for Education in Israel, served as an adviser to the IDF and the Municipality of Be'er Sheva on women's issues. She is a member of the board of directors of the human rights organization B'Tselem, and on the steering committee of the Yitzhak Rabin Center for Israel Studies. She is a founder and executive committee member of the Alternative Information Center and a member of the board of the Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow Coalition. Dahan Kalev is a recipient of the Women Creating Change award (2000), and was on the nominations committee of the Nobel Prize in 2004. In 1994, Dahan Kalev was one of the Mizrahi feminists who disrupted the 10th Feminist Conference in Givat Haviva, in protest of the exclusion of Mizrahi women from the centers of power in the feminist movement by Ashkenazi women, and the refusal to include their issues in the movement. This event is considered the birth of the Mizrahi feminist movement, and Dahan Kalev became one of the founders of the Mizrahi feminist organization Ahoti - for Women in Israel, and a leading theorist, introducing Mizrahi feminism into academic frameworks.

Dobson grew up in Ealing. He was educated at Clifton College in Bristol and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. During the Second World War, he served in The Middlesex Regiment and was mentioned in dispatches, rising to the rank of lieutenant. Career In 1947, Dobson became assistant to House of Lords Library librarian Charles Travis Clay, who had been in the post since 1914. Under Clay's guidance, Dobson compiled an edition of the Oxfordshire Protestation Returns 1641–1642, published in 1955, and organised the legal collections. However, Dobson lacked passion for statistics and historical research, far preferring the literary world. Following Clay's retirement in 1956, Dobson succeeded him and maintained the library largely as his predecessors had, with the library acquiring about 250 titles per year. At this time, there was little impetus for modernisation of library standards. Dobson's main interest was in the acquisition of rare and historical volumes, and grew the library's collection of works from the reigns of Henry VIII through William III of England and Mary. In 1960, he and Earl Spencer edited Letters of David Garrick and Georgiana Countess Spencer, 1759–1779. He was described in The Times as: He retired in 1977 as the need for drastic change became apparent, owing to technology advances and the growing numbers of life peers who had larger research demands than their hereditary counterparts. He was succeeded by Roger Morgan, who saw the library through a period of modern transformation of increasing digitisation, from 1977–91. In 1964, he became a member of the Roxburghe Club for bibliophiles. He had a considerable private collection of books and was an enthusiast of Victorian bindings. Dobson was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1976 New Year Honours. In 1941, he married Helen Broughton Turner, and had a son and a daughter.

After this she held positions as assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (1970–1971) and Pennsylvania State University (1969–1975). In 1975, she qualified as professor at the University of Ulm, becoming the first female professor in geometry (at the chair of number theory and probability theory). She worked there until her retirement in 2002. Kalmbach's research deals with manifolds, lattice theory and quantum structures. She was involved in developing the field of quantum structures in the 1990s. Her current research project is MINT-Wigris. In addition to her research career, Kalmbach invented in 1985 the talent program in STEM subjects (called MINT in Germany)., Part of this is the yearly mathematics competition at the University of Ulm. From this, pupils were selected to attend a mathematics summer school with teaching in computer science, chemistry, physics and where they were introduced to university mathematics. She was a founder of European Women in Mathematics, and a member and chair of the Emmy Noether Verein which supports female mathematicians. Kalmbach now lives in Bad Wörishofen.

Health premiums rose by 23% in the first 10 months of 2018. It is expected that health premiums will reach an all-time high of billion (US$ billion) for the year. Ping An Insurance, the China Life Insurance Company, New China Life Insurance and China Pacific Insurance Company are the biggest players with 42% total market share in 2017. Out-of- pocket expenses are around a third of the total Chinese health spending. History = New Rural Co-operative Medical Scheme (2002–present) = As the old Rural Co-operative Medical Scheme (RCMS) ended, the need for affordable healthcare became urgent in rural China. The New Rural Co-operative Medical Care Scheme (NRCMS) was established to overhaul the healthcare system, particularly intended to make it more affordable for the rural poor.Dib, Hassan H., Pan, Xilong, and Zhang, Han. (2008). Evaluation of the new rural cooperative medical system in China: is it working or not? International Journal for Equity of Health, 7–17. The NRCMS was initially outlined in Decisions on the strengthening of the rural health system issued in 2002 by CCP Central Committee, the highest decision-making authority in China. Pilots started in 2003, followed by fast expansion. By 2008, more than 90% of total population was enrolled in NRCMS. In 2016, China's government decided to merge NRCMS with Urban Residents Basic Medical Scheme (URBMS) to create a universal basic medical scheme. NRCMS is a voluntary insurance scheme subsidized by local and central government. NRCMS differs from RCMS in the following perspectives: Administration and risk-pooling is set at county level, much higher than NRCMS's village level. Funds of NRCMS are provided by local and central government (for poorer regions) together, which contrasts with the old RCMS that was almost completely funded by the Chinese government and extended universally across all parts of China.Wagstaff, Adam, Magnus, Jun, Gao, Ling, Xu, and Juncheng, Qian. (2009). Extending health insurance to the rural population: An impact evaluation of China's new cooperative medical scheme. Journal of Health Economics, 1, 1–19 NRCMS covers expense in all level public healthcare facilities, though the rate varies by regions and by type of facilities, while RCMS provided access to the barefoot doctors only. The World Health Organization (WHO) summarized the success of NRCMS: the NRCMS rapidly expanded, with an increasing service bundle. It provided better access to higher quality service, and partly controlled medical costs. NRCMS is appropriate and convenient for China's enormous number of migrant workers who used to have limited access to healthcare. In 2015, NRCMS spent billion (US$45 billion) on 670 million participants and 1.653 billion instances of medical service, with the average of (US$67.25) per capita. However, there are some difficulties that undermine the scheme's effectiveness in reducing out-of- pocket medical costs. To begin with, the benefit package of NRCMS is mostly limited to catastrophic and inpatient care. While these costs are covered, most outpatient visits requires substantial individual payment. Secondly, the reimbursement rate varies across level of healthcare facilities, increasing the cost of high-level hospital visit. The details of the NRCMS show that patients benefit most from the NRCMS at a local level. If patients go to a small hospital or clinic in their local town, the scheme will cover from 70–80% of their bill, but if they go to a county one, the percentage of the cost being covered falls to about 60%, and if they need specialist help in a large modern city hospital, they have to bear most of the cost themselves, as the scheme would cover only about 30% of the bill. Furthermore, a fee-for service structure in the healthcare system provides incentives for healthcare providers to prescribe medicine or perform treatment in excess than is necessary to treat the patient. In addition, NRCMS reduces the actual cost of a medical service, but patients prefer to purchase more medical services in response to the reduced cost, offsetting the benefits of NRCMS. Those who are poor or in poorer regions benefit less from NRCMS, causing inequality. = Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (1999–present) = Before 1978, urban residents are covered by Labor Insurance and Government Insurance which demanded small out-of-pocket payments. After then Chinese economic reforms, the cost of healthcare in China rose rapidly. Many urban employees lost their healthcare insurance due to reforms in state-owned-enterprises. As a result, urban areas saw a rising need for access to affordable healthcare. In 1997, the CCP Central Committee and China State Council issued universal healthcare reform guidelines, an important part of which is to establish medical scheme in urban areas. Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance and Urban Residents Basic Medical Insurance was created to cover healthcare expense for urban working residents and non-working residents respectively. In 1998, Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) was introduced to provide healthcare access to urban working and retired employees in public and private sectors as well. The UEBMI is administered at municipal level, higher than NRCMS. The UEBMI is funded by 8% deductions from employees' wages; of which 6% are paid by employers and 2% by employees, however these rates can vary by municipality. It differs from other types of insurance schemes in that UEBMI is mandatory. In 2014, roughly 283 million were enrolled, contributing billion, per capita (US$12.97 billion in total, US$45.83 per capita), with an expenditure of billion, per capita (US$10.8 billion in total, US$38.19 per capita). = Urban Residents Basic Medical Insurance (2007–present) = In 2007, Urban Residents Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) started to provide healthcare access to urban residents that are not covered by UEBMI: children, students in schools, colleges and universities and other non-working urban residents. URBMI was firstly piloted in 2007, and became nationwide in 2010. In 2015, 376 million urban residents (over 95%) took part in URBMI. URBMI is a government-subsidized, household-level voluntary medical insurance, administered at municipal level. The URBMI is funded mainly on individual contributions ( for adults; 2008 pilot), and partly government contributions (at least per capita). Additional government contributions are given to undeveloped central and western regions, and poor or disabled individuals. Research showed that URBMI helped improve healthcare utilization and residents' health conditions, especially for low-income residents. Studies also suggested that URBMI was a step towards a universal healthcare system.

It is the only member of the monotypic genus Mysticellus, the mysterious narrow-mouthed frogs. It is endemic to the Western Ghats of India, where it is only known from Wayanad District in northern Kerala state. Taxonomic evidence indicates that its closest relatives are the Micryletta frogs of Southeast Asia. Etymology The genus name, Mysticellus, is a masculine noun derived from the Latin mysticus (meaning \\"mysterious\\") + ellus (a diminutive), highlighting the ability of this small frog to remain out of sight despite its occurrence in wayside areas surrounding human settlements. The species name, franki, is a Latin genitive honoring evolutionary biologist professor Franky Bossuyt of Vrije Universiteit Brussel, recognizing his role in global amphibian research and education, and particularly for his contribution to the study of Indian amphibians. Behavior This species is only visible during the first two days of monsoon showers, when it tends to congregate in temporary water puddles including in abandoned roadside quarries, which was where the type specimens were discovered. During courtship, the male tends to raise the hind part of its body, displaying a pair of black \\"false eyes\\" or eyespots. This action is also performed when individuals are disturbed, indicating that they may also be used to ward off predators. After 4 or 5 days, all adult frogs disappear from the breeding site, leaving just the eggs.

The Anta das Pedras Grandes (Dolmen of large stones) is a late-Neolithic (between 4500 and 2000 BC) site located in Casal Nova in the parish of Caneças, in the Odivelas municipality, in the Lisbon District of Portugal. It was classified as a National Monument in 1944. Excavations in the early 21st century suggest that it was originally built as a dolmen or single-chamber megalithic tomb, consisting of a polygonal long chamber with eight supporting stones about 3 metres tall, and a short access corridor. There are traces of a tumulus, and human bones have been discovered. Excavations in the surrounding area also identified many flint chippings, suggesting that the area was used for the production of flint items. The site was first identified in 1880 by the Portuguese archaeologist Carlos Ribeiro (1813-1882). It is the only surviving dolmen in the immediate area although several were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Nevertheless it has suffered considerably from the use of stones by farmers and for construction. The Anta das Pedras Grandes now forms the centrepiece of a small urban park, which was officially opened in late 2018. The remaining stones, which had all fallen, were lifted, to provide a clearer impression of the original architecture of the megalith.

He is an activist in opposition of the current government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In 1996, he took on a directorial role as the chief organizer of The Youth Organization of the Party of the Iranian Nation (Persian: سازمان جوانان حزب ملت ایران), an aspiring group of budding activists within the Party of the Iranian Nation, working closely with his close friends, Parvaneh Eskandari, and Dariush Forouhar, the founder of the Party of the Iranian Nation. Forouhar and Eskandari would eventually become victims of the “chain murders of Iran”. After the untimely assassination of his friend and mentor, SaeBashirtashed led the Youth Organization of the Party of the Iranian Nation to a series of protests against the Islamic Republic of Iran, forcing the regime to eventually admit responsibility for the “chain murders of Iran”. The Youth Organization of the Party of the Iranian Nation also played a pivotal role in the Iranian Student Protests of July 1999. Once the police started making arrests, Bashirtash managed to evade the authorities, escaping to Turkey. Eventually, he rejoined his wife, Darya Safai, after she was released temporarily on bail. The two then fled to Belgium.  Early life  Saeed Bashirtsah was born in Tehran in 1965. After the Iranian revolution, when he turned 19, he moved to Belgium to pursue a degree in dentistry. After graduation, he was offered numerous opportunities for success in dentistry, but he determined it was best to return to Iran. There, he focused on his work as a political activist with the Youth Organization of the Party of the Iranian Nation, while continuing his dental practice, pro bono, in the poorer neighbourhoods of Iran.  Life in exile  After escaping to Belgium through Turkey, Bashirtash began working independently of the Party of the Iranian Nation on dismantling the Islamic regime. He wrote numerous articles for the opposition, and took to public speaking, most notably RoubeRou (Manoto), RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty, and Voice of America. In addition to his political activism, Saeed also operates three dental clinics in Belgium with his wife Darya Safai.  Political views  Bashirtash believes the continuation of the Islamic republic is a threat to Iran as a nation-state, and the political stability of the region. He concludes that a progressive revolution against the Islamic Regime by the Iranian people, and building a secular democracy, will guarantee separation of religion and state, as well as equal rights for all Iranian citizens.

He was second in command, leading the Covenanters' horse on the left at Rullion Green in 1666. One source says he led the main attack \\"in which being unsuccessful, a rout ensued, but he managed to escape, along with William Veitch, a preacher, who afterwards wrote an account of the affair, and lived to be minister of Peebles.\\" He also fought at Bothwell Bridge in 1679. In the year 1667 his whole fortune was forfeited for his being in the Pentland Hills insurrection. For the space of sixteen years thereafter, notwithstanding all the efforts made to find him, he remained undiscovered. He is recorded as spending some of the time in hiding in Ireland. Imprisonment About the month of February 1682, he was taken prisoner and carried to Edinburgh, where, on 7 April that same year, he was sentenced to be executed. This sentence, however, by the interest of friends, was commuted into perpetual imprisonment in the Bass, to which he was sent on the 13th of May. He there remained close prisoner for five years. Release Through the testimony of physicians that he was in a dying condition, he was liberated by the Council, upon giving bond that as soon as he recovered he would return to that place of confinement. But the Revolution taking place next year freed him from this obligation. He lived at his own house at Newholm some years after that memorable event, and died in peace in the 88th year of his age.

She was a teacher, a choreographer, and a Prima Ballerina in the Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet. Family’s theatrical history Daria’s grandfather was the actor Julian Nizhankivsky (Юліян Нижанківський) 1838 - 91, an actor in the Ruska Besida Theater founded in 1864 in Lviv. He acted in the theatre’s premier production of \\"Marusya\\" that year. Her father, Ambrosi, Julian’s son, followed in his father’s footsteps and became an actor. After Daria’s mother, Genia, married her father, she joined him for a life on the stage, touring the cities, towns, and villages of Ukraine. The actors sewed their own costumes and helped build the sets for their performances. Education At the age of eight, Daria joined the ballet school of Oksana Suchoverska (Оксана Суховерська). She studied ballet with Oksana for ten years. After graduating, she went to Prague to continue to work on her dance, alongside the ballerina Mia Slavenska. Being the same age, the young women became friends. When Mia left for Paris in 1937, Daria returned to Lviv in late 1938, and for a time she studied with Prof. Buri, and ballet masters A. Falishevsky and V. Pereyaslavets. Principal dancer In the summer of 1939, Daria became a principal dancer of the Lviv Opera and Ballet Theater. Here, she worked with ballet-master Yevhen Dmytrovych Vihilov (Євген Дмитрович Вігільов) who worked from 1941-1944 at the Lviv Opera House. \\"The traditions of the romantic epoch and academic ballet were preserved predominantly in the opera theater ballet troupe performances. It was considered to be the leading one in the region (with ballet-masters - S.Falishevski, A.Fortunato, A.Romanovski, M.Statkevich).\\" Daria's first onstage experience here was in the opera Aida by Giuseppe Verdi, not as a dancer but as a Nubian slave, holding a large papier-mâché palm leaf over the ruler. A ballet interlude would be added in the opera afterwards. During her years as principal dancer, some of the operas that included ballets in which she danced were: La traviata by Giuseppe Verdi, Il Trovatore by Giuseppe Verdi, Carmen by Georges Bizet, Tosca by Giacomo Puccini, Madama Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini, I Pagliacci by Ruggero Leoncavallo, The Bartered Bride by Bedřich Smetana, and Faust by Charles Gounod. Daria became the leading ballerina in ballets: Odette in Swan Lake by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky , Dulcinea in Don Quixote by Ludwig Minkus, Swanhilda in Coppélia by Léo Delibes, Taï-Choa in The Red Poppy by Reinhold Glière, Anitra in Peer Gynt by Edvard Grieg, and others. Post-war In the spring of 1944, Daria along with a group from the Lviv opera, packed and headed west for Germany before the Soviet army's arrival. She met her husband in a displaced persons' camp in Austria, and they married. She taught dance to the children of the camp. Her \\"Ukrainian Dance Knot\\" was performed by Ukrainian children at the International Festival of 1945 in Innsbruck. In the spring of 1950, Daria, along with her husband Taras Snihurowycz, emigrated to Canada and settled in Winnipeg. Canada Ukrainian immigrant theatre had been flourishing since the turn of the century in Winnipeg. Now, the post-war generation prepared to make their contribution. On July 23, 1950, Daria participated in a concert with other Ukrainian artists newly arrived from Europe, as part of the Renaissance theater: I. Turkevich-Martynets, G. Manko, A. Stepniak, I. Fedyshin and L. Levyts'ka.

Biography = Before the murders = The exact date and place of birth of Korneev is unknown (it is known that in 1968 he was 38 years old). He was distinguished by great physical strength and worked as a circus performer, juggling heavy weights and receiving ovations at the stage. At one point, however, he tore a tendon, abruptly ending his circus career. Despite this, Korneev still desired fame and was looking for ways to stay in the spotlight. He began to write in Moscow newspaper announcements' want ads. Three women immediately responded to the announcements - Irina Schelkunova, Natalya Delyagina and Yulia Trofimova, the youngest being the 18-year-old Natalya. As a child, she lived with her stepmother Galina, as her father had died when she was 13. After that, Galina kept Natalya in sexual slavery: she asked local men to help her with the housework, soldered her stepdaughter with alcohol and made her have sex with the men who provided the services. Natalya felt a great sense of shame and hated her stepmother, but did not tell anyone about her position, being completely under Galina's control. When she turned 18, Natalya responded to the acquaintanceship announcement left by Korneev. Another woman, Yulia Trofimova, was divorced and with one daughter, Oksana, from her ex-husband. Trofimova was happy in her relationship with Korneev, considering him her protector. = Murders = In 1968, Korneev lived in the city of Voskresensk, Moscow Oblast, cohabiting with the three women. He was unable to find a job, thus experiencing a growing sense of disappointment in his life. Eventually, Irina Schelkunova was impregnated by her roommate and began demanding him to marry her. Korneev was annoyed by her constant pestering about a wedding, and after another such conversation he strangled Schelkunova with a wire. At the time of her death, she was in the 20th week of pregnancy. The murderer then dragged the body onto the roof of an industrial building and dropped it onto a parked bus. The driver was having lunch at the time, and upon entering the bus, he failed to notice that there was a female body on the roof. Schelkunova's corpse fell on the asphalt at the next bus stop. The man tried to help her, but realized that she was dead. The suffocation marks were very rough, indicating she had been strangled with a wire or thick cord. Detectives became interested from where Schelkunova's corpse had fallen on the roof, with the driver explaining that he had had lunch near the industrial building that day. Traces from the corpse's dragging were found near the building, and it was possible to establish the victim's identity only a week after the body's discovery. Schelkunova's mother said that her daughter often looked for acquaintance announcements in newspapers. In her house, investigators found several such ads. According to one of them, Sergei Poganovsky, an employee of the USSR Ministry of Culture, was identified, presenting himself as \\"Svyatoslav\\" in the announcement. When the criminal investigation officer Alexey Morozov came to him, Poganovsky's dog attacked the operative. Morozov shot the dog and detained Sergei. It turned out that the detainee made secret dating ads unbeknownst to his wife, had sex with the responding women and then threw them. Poganovsky had no credible alibi in Schelkunova's murder. Shortly after the arrest of Poganovsky, Boris Korneev committed the second murder. After Natalya Delyagina told him that her stepmother Galina had abused her, he strangled the latter and tied her corpse to a construction car. The same strangulation marks were found on Delyagina's neck as those on the murdered Irina Schelkunova. An extremely large quantity of alcohol was found in the victim's blood, indicating that the perpetrator had forced her to drink it. Upon learning that Galina had sexually exploited her stepdaughter, the investigators suggested the possibility that Natalya's lover could be the killer. She herself told the authorities that he might have committed another murder, but refused to give his name, as Natalya considered her stepmother's killer a hero. An operative, Sgt. Yury Markelov, was put on duty in Natalya's house to catch the criminal. One night, Korneev came to the house and, upon seeing the operative, he strangled Markelov, despite the fact that the sergeant had training in boxing. After that, the maniac then kidnapped and subsequently strangled Natalya. Her disappearance was announced in the All-Union search, and her body was soon found by a couple on a phosphogypsum mountain. The murderer explained his long absence to Yulia Trofimova by claiming that he had gone to the neighbouring region to look for work. He began to torture Oksana, Yulia's daughter, chaining her to an iron weight and forcing her to do push-ups. Once Oksana's father, Petr, came to visit Yulia, he learned that his daughter was being abused and decided to investigate. As a result, he was strangled by Korneev and had his corpse hidden in a ravine. Oksana told her mother directly that she suspected Boris of killing her father. After that, Korneev came at night to Trofimova's house, covered in phosphorus and glowing in the dark, in an effort to intimidate Yulia and Oksana. Yulia sent her daughter to her grandmother and called the police. Hearing this, Boris beat up and tied his partner. Then the maniac called the grandmother, and when Oksana picked up, he told her the following: = Attack on Oksana Trofimova and death = Oksana decided not to call the police, fearing that in that case Boris would kill her mother, but instead turned towards her friend and classmate, Nikolay. They went to the designated place, armed with a hammer and a knife. Korneev took his wire, but Oksana then stabbed him in the chest. The offender stayed on his feet, but then received a blow from the hammer on the head by Nikolay. Withstanding this hit as well, Korneev hit Nikolay, making him stagger to the nearest tree. However, Boris then fell on the ground. He survived, despite the huge amounts of blood loss, and was hospitalized. He was declared insane and was sent to a closed psychiatric hospital. A few weeks after his hospitalization, Korneev was strangled by his roommates. Nikolay was also hospitalized and underwent several operations. After prolonged treatment, he was initially confined to a wheelchair, but soon one of his legs began to move. Oksana forced him to train, and he was able to re-learn to walk on his own. After that, they got married and had children together.

Early life and education Clay was born at Rastrick House in Rastrick, near Halifax, Yorkshire, the younger son of historian and genealogist John William Clay and his wife, Alice Caroline Pilleau. His mother was the daughter of Colonel Henry Pilleau and descended from Pezé Pilleau, the notable Huguenot silversmith. His only brother, Lionel Pilleau Clay, was killed in action in 1918 in the First World War. He was educated at Harrow School, earning a scholarship for mathematics at Balliol College, Oxford in 1904. After gaining only second-class honours in mathematical moderations, he was able to keep his scholarship but read history. Under the tutelage of Henry William Carless Davis and Arthur Lionel Smith, he took first-class honours in modern history in 1908. Career Clay became assistant secretary to the Marquess of Crewe, first at the Colonial Office and then at the India Office. After Sir Edmund Gosse retired in 1914, Lord Crewe, at that time Leader of the House of Lords, recommended Clay as an Assistant Librarian at House of Lords Library. Shortly afterward, he was commissioned into the Royal Devon Yeomanry and sent to France. He rose to the rank of major and was twice mentioned in dispatches. He succeeded as librarian in 1922, and served more than three decades in the post while continuing to pursue his passion for genealogy and antiquities, earning a reputation for his expertise in both art and archaeology. He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (FSA) for 65 years and vice-president of the society in 1934–38. He also served as honorary vice- president of the Royal Historical Society. He was a member of the Huguenot Society and the Harleian Society as well as the Roxburgh Club for bibliophiles. In 1943, Clay was awarded an honorary DLitt[Doctorate of Letters] from the University of Leeds. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, civil division, in the 1944 New Year Honours. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy elected in 1950. Following his retirement, he was knighted in the 1957 Birthday Honours. Personal life In 1913, Clay married the Hon. Alice Violet Robson (1892–1972), daughter of Liberal MP and Attorney General William Snowdon Robson, Baron Robson. She was a life-long Liberal. They had three daughters: Rachel Maxwell-Hyslop (1914–2011), a prominent archaeologist; Dr Diana Franklin Laurenson (1920–1977), who defended her doctoral thesis at the London School of Economics in 1960 and taught at the London Polytechnic; and Rosemary Travis Howarth (1924–2009) who studied and subsequently worked at the Courtauld Institute of Art. All three daughters married and there were eight grandchildren and 14 great grandchildren. Sir Charles Travis Clay died in Little Tew, Oxfordshire, in 1978.

However, the precise impact, nature, and extent of the FLN's aid to African Independence Movements remains highly debated. That being said, the FLN's involvement is said to have been direct and indirect. For example, it directly aided Mozambique, helping to train soldiers from FRELIMO, the Mozambique Liberation Front, in Algeria. In fact, it estimated by the CIA to have trained approximately 200 FRELIMO fighters in 1964. It indirectly inspired and aided the study of post- Colonialism in Africa. For example, the FLN inspired Amilcar Cabral, a national liberation theorist from Guinea-Bissau. Algeria gained independence from France in 1962 with the help of the FLN, and consequently, served as an example of successful and violent liberation from a colonial power for a number of African and Latin American countries. Nonetheless, the National Liberation Front of Algeria's motivations remain a point of contention. On one hand, its motivations are thought to stem from a need to control the distribution of world power, particularly in Africa, which at the time was thought to have been split between\\"moderate\\" and more \\"revolutionary\\" paths for independence. On the other hand, the motivations of the National Liberation Front of Algeria are thought to have been inspired by Gamal Abdel Nasser's pan-Arabist movement within the Arab World, encouraging its greater pan-African vision. However, Algeria's influence infiltrated not just the political, but ideological realm as well. Many Algerian elites of the FLN called for a shift from \\"economic and political exploitation,\\" to \\"economic sufficiency and political dignity\\" in all of Africa.  FRELIMO and the FLN  The Mozambique Liberation Front, also known as FRELIMO, adopted armed struggle against its Portuguese colonizers. However, in order to adopt armed struggle, it needed arms. The Front de Libération Nationale of Algeria is accredited with having provided weapons to national liberation groups, such as FRELIMO, in the 1960s. Yet, how long and what exactly the Front de Liberation Nationale sent to its African counterparts remains widely unknown. Eventually, Algerian instructors within the FLN shifted their focus on violent modes of resisting colonialism, to ideological political agendas. As a result, it was able to consolidate its progressive alliance with organizations like FRELIMO throughout the African continent Nonetheless, the Algerian FLN is accused with having failed with regards to leaving long-standing political and ideological impressions on FRELIMO. Unlike the FLN, FRELIMO was able to consolidate its party ideology, all the while creating and solidifying its political institutions in Mozambique. That being said, FRELIMO was able to establish itself within the society and politics of Mozambique. Therefore, it is difficult to minimize the influence of the FLN on the rise of a Marxist regime in newly post-colonial Mozambique.  Guinea-Bissau and the FLN  Amilcar Cabral is a revolutionary, post-colonial theorist from Guinea-Bissau, who attempted to theorize African liberation movements in the new context of post-colonial Algeria. With regards to the effects of the FLN's intellectual influence, its elites pushed for African unity based upon the shared colonial experience, in the context of a newly post-colonial Algeria However, Africa was torn between both \\"moderate\\" and \\"revolutionary\\" paths to independence from colonial powers. After it switched to an agenda focused on political ideology, the new policy of the FLN was to sway \\"moderate\\" Africa unto a new found \\"political consciousness.\\" Shortly before, the Algerian War of Independence served as a reminder to all, of the violence and horrors of colonialism and national liberation wars. Consequently, a number of post- colonial scholars argue that African national liberation movements that were anti-colonial and anti-imperialist were inspired by the FLN in Algeria. With this in mind, Amilcar Cabral was heavily influenced by Frantz Fanon, a post- colonial scholar, known to have famously authored The Wretched of the Earth, a book which was heavily influenced by his time fighting against French Colonial rule during Algerian War of Independence. In close quarters with soldiers from the FLN, the ideologies and practices of the FLN heavily influenced Fanon's work, which in turn influenced that of Amilcar Cabral, who wrote in response to Fanon.

The group was initially composed of mainly young journalists, and later added communication professionals, most of them being men and Parisians. Some of its members are accused of coordinated and grouped harassment, mainly of women but also of men. An antisemitic dimension was also noted. The Ligue's main actions took place online on social networks, in particular Twitter. The alleged victims were harassed both online and over the phone, allegedly because of their gender, physical appearance, religion or ethnicity, and sexual orientation, as well as their professional competencies. Members of the group even turned up at their victims' workplaces. The scandal was reported in the media on February 8, 2019, when Checknews, a fact-checking service of the French newspaper Libération, published an article about the Ligue du LOL. A dozen victims were interviewed, and denounced the mobbing behavior of certain members of the Ligue du LOL and their audiences on Twitter. Some of those identified as harassers experienced professional, but not legal, consequences, due to the fact that in many cases the statute of limitations had expired. Context The \\"Ligue du LOL\\" is the name of a private Facebook group created in 2009 by journalist , which was made up of approximately fifteen men and two or three women. Over time the Ligue du LOL grew to approximately 20 to 40 persons, mainly early users of Twitter, most of whom worked in communication, journalism, web, and advertising. According to Libération, in 2019 the group numbered around 30. After the scandal erupted in February 2019, group members defended the Facebook page by claiming that it allowed them to exchange findings on the web and to share jokes and advice. Group member Henri Michel stated that this page was intended to allow participants to make jokes that could not have been made in public. He admitted that the page also included an \\"observatory of Twitter personalities\\", where jokes were made about certain Twitter users. He commented that the these Twitter users became a sort of \\"obsession of certain group members\\". A subset of the Ligue du LOL members are accused of harassing other users of Twitter, either individually or as a group, using public and anonymous accounts. Many of the alleged victims are women, like (journalist), Florence Desruol (UMP activist), Capucine Piot (bloger), (activist and author), , (journalist), Lucile Bellan (journalist), Aïcha Kottman (news critic), as well as men like Cyprien (youtuber), Matthias Jambon-Puillet (author), Thomas Messias (journalist), and (politician). Lancar was mocked for his presumed homosexuality: a Ligue du LOL member put his photo on a fly swatter (the French word for fly swatter, \\"tapette\\", is also a derogatory term for a gay man), at a time when he was leading the Jeunes Populaires group. He was referred to by members of the Ligue as the \\"tapette Lancar\\". Several victims claimed they had alerted the employers of members of the Ligue who were involved in harassment. For instance, Johan Hufnagel who was a co-founder of Slate and thus Vincent Glad's manager, was reportedly informed about the group's activities. Exposure = Earlier attempts = An initial attempt to denounce the behavior of the Ligue was made in 2010 when a letter was written to be sent to several managing editors. This letter was leaked to the members of the Ligue, who published it on Twitter and mocked it, minimizing its importance. At the time Twitter was not widely used and the implicated journalists were not well known. The story attracted little attention. A 2010 tweet from Aurore Bergé stated that she \\"did not give a damn\\" about the letter. In 2019, Bergé, now a member of parliament, condemned the acts of harassment and claimed that she had no memory of the letter. This letter is nonetheless among the most discussed subjects related to the Ligue du LOL. According to journalist Christophe Colinet, who co-signed it, the belated publicity given to the letter has re-launched the online harassment. Florence Desurol attempted to complain about the Ligue to Slate and to Gilles Klein from Arrêt sur Image at the beginning of 2010, after receiving an insulting message from Alexandre Hervaud. Klein then informed Laurent Joffrin of Libération, where Hervaud was employed. Alexandre Hervaud publicly satirized the incident and faced no apparent consequences. The first visible disclosures of the group's activities came from an article on the French feminist blog Crêpe Georgette by Valérie Rey-Robert in 2014. In May 2018, journalist Alexandre Léchenet, professor at the ESJ in Lille published a blog post describing his realization that his own behavior might have been problematic. Léchenet said he never belonged to the Ligue, but he was accused of participating in the homophobic harassment of Benjamin Lancar. = Public disclosure on February 8, 2019 = On February 8, 2019, journalist Robin Andraca from Checknews published an article on the Ligue. He was alerted to the story by a contact calling himself \\"Jean\\", who was reacting to an article published on February 3, 2019 in Le vent se lève that featured Vincent Glad. The article concerned the patronizing way the media treated the subject of the Yellow vests movement, and prompted reactions on Twitter. Andraca started his investigation by confronting Alexandre Hervaud, manager of the web department Libération, based on a comment from Hervaud on a tweet from Slate journalist Thomas Messias. Hervaud admitted that he was a member of the Ligue. Consequences Some of the female journalists targeted by the Ligue left journalism due to the bullying. Eight of the members of the Ligue, notably Glad and Hervaud, were suspended from their positions or stepped down. The French government announced new laws to make social media platforms pull hateful posts.

This policy was initiated in February 1972 and remained until the end of Acheampong's regime in 1978. Operation Feed Yourself aimed to increase levels of food crops produced in Ghana for domestic consumption. Ideologically, the program was an attempt toward self-sufficiency. Ultimately, Operation Feed Yourself failed to improve domestic food conditions in Ghana as local food crops remained scarce and price levels on these remained high.  Background  = Colonial Background = Ghana became a recognized, independent country in 1957. While under the colonial rule of Great Britain, Ghana's agricultural structure was engineered to produce lucrative crops (palm oil in the 19th century and cocoa in the 20th century) for the profit of the British mainland. Because living conditions in Ghana were harsh on Europeans, settler-agriculture was not a significant presence and instead Ghanaian agriculture under British rule relied primarily on peasants. Peasant populations in Ghana willingly collaborated with a system of export-oriented agriculture in exchange for the compensation provided by British rule. As a result, Ghana's agricultural system leading up to Operation Feed Yourself was export-oriented and produced crops tailored for European rather than domestic tastes. = Kofi Busia Regime (1969-72) = Kofi Abreba Busia's regime as Prime Minister immediately preceded the regime of Ignatius Kutu Acheampong and Operation Feed Yourself. Busia's removal from office at the hands of Acheampong was strongly motivated by Ghana's economic performance under Busia. Busia's regime produced a decline in per capita production and per capita income without a proposed plan in response. Busia was also heavily reliant on aid from western countries, characteristic which was despised by Acheampong who hinged his regime on self- reliance.  Goals  The primary goal of Operation Feed Yourself was to increase the volume and diversity of agriculture intended for domestic consumption in Ghana. Specifically, the program's first \\"Five Year Plan\\" set as a goal 6% annual growth in agricultural output. Ghana had produced an annual growth rate in agricultural output of 2.6% between 1969 and 1972, therefore reaching 6% would require achieving a 3.4% annual growth soon after the program's initiation. This growth in agriculture would also have significant effects on employment levels. The Acheampong government projected an increase of 0.8 million in the amount of farmers nationwide by the year 1990. Additionally, the program projected gains in GDP contributed by agriculture from 1,800 million cedis at the start of the program to 2,600 million cedis by 1990. Ideologically, the goal of Operation Feed Yourself was self-reliance, an uplift of Ghana by its own people.  Program Structure  = Zones = With the intent to maximize crop production, Operation Feed Yourself divided Ghana's territory into 9 zones and assigned to each zone the production of the crops most profitably grown there. The zones and crop assignments were as follows: _Eastern Region:_ cassava, maize, plantains, sugarcane, tea, avocado, citrus, and yams. _Central region:_ maize, yams, cassava, plantain, rice, pineapple, and sugarcane. _Western Region:_ plantain, palm oil, bananas, rice, and coconut. _Ashanti Region:_ plantain, maize, soya bean, and yams. _Brong Ahafo:_ tomatoes, plantain, maize, yams groundnuts, rice, and soya beans. _Greater Accra:_ maize, cassava, vegetables, rice, watermelons, and cashew. _Volta Region:_ cassava, rice, maize, and yams. _Northern and Upper Regions:_ rice, yams, guinea corn, maize, groundnut, millet, and rice. = Administrative Structure = Operation Feed Yourself was a program within Ghana's Ministry of Agriculture. The program's structure included components at the national and regional levels. At the national level, the principal agent leading Operation Feed Yourself was the Commissioner of Agriculture, who oversaw the entire program. Much of the program's implementation was carried out through the National Operations Committee, which was composed of departments specializing in food production and distribution: The Department of Agricultural Economy, the Department of Fisheries, the Seed Multiplication Unit, the Crop Production Unit and the Agricultural Mechanization Unit. The National Operations Committee had am important agent for the execution of its plans in the Program Control Executive, who issued all instructions within Operation Feed Yourself. At the regional level, the principal position was the Regional Commissioner. There was one Regional Commissioner for each of the nine regions. Regional Commissioners each led a Regional Agricultural Committee, which received directives from the National Operations Committee and the Program Control Executive. Underneath Regional Agricultural Committees were Regional Agricultural Coordinators, who supervised the distribution of information to farmers at the regional level. The actual distributor of information and primary source of contact for farmers was the District Agricultural Officer. = Additional State Production Agencies Involved = Additionally, the following state agencies were charged with actual production and distribution: State Farms Corporation, Food Production Corporation, Settlement Division, Food Distribution Corporation, Grains and Legumes Development Board, State Fishing Corporation, Cotton Development Board, Pomazde Poultry Enterprise.  Methods  = Outreach = Operation Feed Yourself sought to increase the amount of citizens working towards crop growth, and therefore, the Acheampong government made significant outreach efforts. These efforts included programming and propaganda on television and radio promoting agriculture. Additionally, the government employed its ties with institutions such as universities, the military, and prisons to encourage the creation of agricultural production units within each. = Government Collectivization = The Acheampong government created a system for collecting, transporting, storing and trading crops within the country. The purposes of this system were to ensure the existence of a buyer for crops cultivated in rural areas, and to provide a means for these food products to reach urban areas. For example, agencies such as Meat Marketing Board, State Fishing Corporation and Food Distribution Corporation purchased crops from farmers and sold them at discounted prices to urban-dwellers. = Subsidized Tools and Tax Exemptions = In an effort to motivate increased agricultural production, the government subsidized the price of seeds and fertilizers, as well as farming tools such as hoes and cutlasses. Additionally, the government removed taxes on the import of agricultural machinery. The government also provided tax exemptions for income from cocoa specifically, and more generally, for farms within their first five years of operation. = Loans from Banks = Institutions such as the National Investment Bank and African Development Bank became involved with Operation Feed Yourself by providing credit for loans to a diverse array of Ghanaians. The AFB especially facilitated loans for non-farmers who were willing to become involved in agriculture, as well as owners of large parcels of farmable land. Initially, the AFB had stricter requirements for peasant farmers to receive loans, but eventually requirements for these were also lightened.  Results  Operation Feed Yourself is considered a failure as the program began to falter by the mid-1970s. Signs of failure included general public discontent, a reduction in target acreage planted, domestic food products continuing to be expensive and the expansion of Ghana's budget deficit from 190 million cedis in 1972 to 807 million cedis in 1977. The amount of urban residents who adopted agricultural enterprise also dwindled compared to the start of the program, likely due to perceived problems in infrastructure within the countryside (e.g lack of access to clean drinking water, electricity and good roads). By 1977, intervention by International Food Aid was needed in order to mitigate food shortages in Ghana. = Problems with collectivization = Operation Feed Yourself intended to increase accessibility and affordability of domestic food crops and in order to achieve this, the government sought to collect crops from rural farms, store them and transport them into cities. These operations were met with obstacles such as inaccessibility to many farms for government vehicles caused by poor-quality roads, insufficient storage facilities or storage facilities lacking conditions for proper food preservation, and pricing policies and rates that were not properly researched or updated by agencies such as the Meat Marketing Board. The combination of these three factors resulted in large amounts of spoiled food items and prices on food crops that were unaffordable to the average worker. = Mismanagement of state funds and corruption = Operation Feed Yourself saw government subsidies and loans be granted to large-scale farmers especially. A significant issue became when these funds were u for personal expenditures instead of crop growth. Activities which mismanaged funds included paying-off old debts and were identified by the African Development Bank as reason for discontinuing loans. Additionally, owners of large farms held close ties with bureaucratic actors (some were the same actors) and were able to benefit from resources at the government's disposal at much higher rates than peasants, who composed a large majority of the farming workforce. = Bureaucratic roadblocks = The organizational structure of Operation Feed Yourself included a large bureaucracy, and many bureaucratic bodies did not prioritize small-scale and peasant farmers in the distribution of farming resources aimed toward agricultural production. These conditions combined to create several bureaucratic roadblocks for small-scale farmers. These roadblocks included requirements for documentation of land ownership in order to receive a loan from the African Development Bank, which was difficult to obtain when much rural land in Ghana was communally owned and allocated by chiefs. There also existed acreage requirements for cultivatable lands in order to secure a loan. These requirements were accompanied by difficulties in attaining documentation, which entailed travel to the capital city of Accra. = Premature reprioritization for export crops = Operation Feed Yourself also saw many farmers who received government benefits depart from crop production for domestic use towards export crops. These farmers justified their abandonment of domestic efforts for more lucrative export- oriented agriculture based on the Ghanaian government declaring Operation Feed Yourself a success after its first two years. Because large-scale farmers were prioritized for the distribution of state resources by the government over small-scale farmers, their abandonment of efforts to grow crops for domestic use left Ghana stranded during a time of food shortages.  Legacy  On May 6, 2017, President of the Ghana National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (NCCI) publicly suggested that the chamber consider reigniting Operation Feed Yourself a way to address food security issues as well as national employment levels. One year later, on October 3, 2017, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture published a plan for the implementation of a new program titled Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ), a program inspired by Operation Feed Yourself. Planting for Food and Jobs was created on a premise that foods such as maize, rice and sorghum are insufficiently produced in Ghana, producing losses in potential GDP help to the country. Solutions that the program puts forth include government subsidies of high quality seeds and fertilizers, education regarding effective farming practices and the strengthening of connections between farmers and potential buyers of crops both in the public and private spheres. The program will cost the government $717,548,101 USD over 4 years (2017-2020) and the structure is divided into a national, regional and district level.

From Utrera in the region of Andalusia, Spain, she worked as a fruit and vegetable vendor. Luna was an example of the nascent Republican feminism. A Republican and an anarchist, she was concerned about injustices committed by the agrarian oligarchy. From her stall, she encouraged others in her community to make their voices heard and be politically active. When the Second Republic was proclaimed, she took to the streets of Utrera to with a Republican flag. After the July 1936 military uprising in Seville, events quickly reached her hometown and sent Luna into hiding with her family. While later escaping, she decided to return because of her husband's poor health. Luna was subsequently captured and tortured, and paraded through town. She was then executed on 18 September 1936. In 2019, a lookout near Parque del Muro in her home town of Utrera in Andalusia was renamed in Luna's honor.  Background  Luna was from Utrera in the region of Andalusia, Spain. She was known as \\"La Luna\\". Luna was born on 31 August 1888 at Calle Resolana, 29 in Utrera at three in the morning. Her father was Antonio Luna, a shoe maker. Her mother was María Dolores Alcázar. Luna was the youngest of several children. Her older siblings were Francisco, Antonio, Pastora, Rafael and Manuel. Her first marriage was to Antonio Romero García on 7 September 1912. The couple had four children, Ildefonso, Rafael, Dolores Romero Luna and Antonio, of which three survived to adulthood. Romero died on 5 December 1918. Luna remarried on 20 February 1928 to Francisco Peña López. In 1935, she was living at Calle Salvador Serguí, 29 (now Cristo de los Afligidos) with her husband, a man who was probably a son of Peña's first married named Rafael Peña Espejo, and nine children. Six of the children were from her second marriage. They were Dolores, Camelia, Rosario Peña Luna, Francisco, José and Libertad Peña Luna. Luna lived in a hut near Cortijo de Ulloa in the Andalusian countryside with her family. She sold fruits and vegetables in Utrera at Plaza de Abastos. She traveled to Seville three times a week to buy fruits and vegetables to resell. She was able to support her family because of her work as a fruit and vegetable vendor. One of her children, Rosario Peña Luna, continued to live in Utrera until she died at the age of 84 in the 2010s. Her daughter Dalia eventually escaped to a Republican area before finally settling in Mallemort, France.  Activism and death by Francoist forces  Luna was an \\"example of the nascent Republican feminism.\\" Women like Luna, who were politically active in the Second Republic, had their hair forcibly cut, were forced to drink castor oil, and many times were raped and killed by Nationalist forces. Records show 477 women faced this punishment at the hand's of Franco's forces in Andalusia. For feminists like Luna, the Republic was transformational when it came to women's rights. Nationalist forces represented a return to the old, to patriarchy where men controlled all aspects of women's lives, and where women were forced to stay in the home. Luna was a Republican and an anarchist. As an activist, she was concerned about injustices committed by the agrarian oligarchy. While working at her stall in the market, Luna talked to many people in her town. She encouraged them to be politically active and make their voices heard. She encouraged them to protest. She was labeled by the Franco's forces as being an \\"individual of dubious morals\\". When the Second Republic was declared in April 1931, Luna was excited, taking to the street to wave the flag of the Republic and take part in a celebration in Utrera organized by local Republicans and socialists. After the Republic was announced, Luna continued in her work and went on raising her children. She also hosted meetings of the local branch of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT-AIT). They discussed their political ideas and union activities during these meetings. They also talked about fighting illiteracy, but never talked about committing acts of violence against their political opponents. She also hosted two weddings in her hut in Cortijo de Ulloa in this period. One marriage involve local CNT Committee member Cristóbal Torres Gil. Another marriage was between Manuel Martínez Cordones and Concepción Soria Martínez. A coup d'état took place on 18 July 1931 in Seville. The fallout of this event quickly reached Utrera where a worker was shot and killed by the Guardia Civil. Luna had a residence on Calle de la Fuente in Utrera at the time. The shooting caused Luna to return to her hut, which she had been renting out at the time. Two of her children stayed behind. Dalia remained in the city as a volunteer nurse attached to Casa de Socorro. Rafael joined Republican militiamen in the city. Following the fall of Utrera to Queipo de Llano's forces on 26 July, Dalia returned to her mother. Meanwhile, her son Rafael fled to the Consolacion area. Luna, and her children Dalia and Alfonso were terrified of what was happening, eventually seeking refuge at the hacienda of a friend who worked as a foreman. Remaining was risky as coup plotters were seeking Luna. To protect her children, Peña and Luna left them behind and escape from Utrera and towards Palmar de Troya. Meanwhile, Luna was able to verify that Nationalist forces had burned down their home. In their exodus, they were joined by the Esponida brothers and an older man nicknamed, \\"El Menudo.\\" In exodus, they toured the local area to assess the situation. Determining things were going badly, they decided to head to the mountains of Cádiz to join up with Republican forces in the Republican controlled Málaga. Peña's health was poor, and he was unable to keep up with the party. Before they could head to Málaga, Luna returned with Peña to Utrera. She left her daughter with the party under the care of Menudo. The plan was for Dalia was to join Republican forces. Dalia would eventually be captured by Nationalist forces. Returning turned out to be a bad decision, as Luna was immediately arrested and put into the local prison. The reason for her arrest was displaying a flag of the Second Republic in the street. The prison was located at the Town Hall, in what is now Altozano but was called Plaza de la República. While she was imprisoned, half her head was shaved and her remaining hair was plaited with purple, red and yellow bows. Shortly before her death, she was dragged through town by a horse and marched through the center of Utrera several times. She was accompanied by two guards. She was shot by Nationalist forces at dawn on 18 September 1936 while standing against a wall near the gate of Utrera's municipal cemetery. They left her body there until the end of they day before burying it in a common grave. One of the reason Nationalists wanted Luna dead was so her death would send a message to other activists, to discourage them from speaking out. They had watched her for months before they took Utrera. Luna was survived by Peña, who was arrested at the same time. Peña was beaten repeatedly, with one of his daughters being forced to clean his wounds between beatings.  Honors  In 2019, a lookout near Parque del Muro in her home town of Utrera in Andalusia was renamed in her honor. She was chosen because she was \\"a brave and courageous woman, capable of sacrificing her life for ideas that she firmly believed in.\\" The movement to get a street named after her was spearheaded by one of her granddaughters, Rosario Ruiz Peña. The street is located near where she lived.

He served as seneschal of Saintonge (1371–72) and seneschal of Aquitaine (1385–89). His descendants became French lords. He is called John Harpeden I or John Harpeden the Elder to distinguish him from his son, Jean Harpedenne II. Seneschal of Saintonge (1371–72) Harpeden was the seneschal of Saintonge during the Aquitanian lieutenancy of the king's son, John of Gaunt, in 1370–71. When the lieutenant was returning to England in September 1371, he left the castle of La Roche-sur-Yon in the joint possession of John Harpeden, Thomas Percy and Renaud de Vivonne. They agreed to pay for its upkeep out of their own revenues and to render an annual rent of 500 marks to the Edward, Duke of Aquitaine, which they could raise from the forfeitures of traitors and the profits of raiding French territory. Harpeden was still seneschal of Saintonge on behalf of the Duke of Aquitaine in June 1372. When the flotilla of the Earl of Pembroke was blockaded in La Rochelle by a Castilian fleet, he worked through the night of 22/23 June to procure reinforcements. He managed to gather some Gascon men-at-arms from nearby garrisons and commandeered four barges. He also sent messengers to the Captal de Buch and Thomas Felton urging them to send reinforcements as well. The men of La Rochelle, however, refused to provide their ships. He reached Pembroke's ships shortly before dawn. In the ensuing battle, the English were defeated and Harpeden was captured. Harpeden was only released from captivity in 1378. According to a rumour, certainly apocryphal, he was granted his freedom because he had volunteered to defend the divinity of Christ in single combat against two \\"Ethiopian\\" heathens. Seneschal of Aquitaine (1385–89) Harpeden returned to France in 1385, being appointed seneschal of Aquitaine (or Gascony) by Richard II on 1 March 1385. He replaced William le Scrope. Unlike Scrope was forced to rely entirely on local revenues, receiving no money from the Exchequer for the defence of the province. According to a report from the Duke of Berry's councillors in Toulouse, Harpeden went on the offensive early against the French. The Anglo-Gascon free companies were given free rein and increased their raids dramatically. The Durforts under Gaillard II, who would later serve as seneschal himself, attacked the Agenais with 500 men-at-arms in coordination with Harpeden's diplomacy. The seneschal negotiated with the lords of the Agenais to induce them into English allegiance. He even distributed circular letters throughout the province enjoining submission to Richard II. By the fall of 1386, he had established control over most of the Agenais and Quercy. When the French went on the offensive late in the summer of 1387, Harpeden organized the simultaneous defence of the Gironde from a royal invasion and the Agenais from the Count of Armagnac. Harpeden's successor, John Trailly, was named on 25 June 1389. Marriage and issue Harpeden married firstly Katherine, daughter of Guy Senechal of Morthemer and Radégonde Bechet. It is not known whether there was any issue from this marriage. In the 1360s, Harpeden married, as his second wife, Jeanne, daughter of Olivier IV de Clisson and Jeanne de Belleville and thus a younger sister of Olivier V. She had inherited some land on the death of her father in 1343. His son was raised in the household of Olivier V as a Poitevin. It is unlikely that father and son ever saw each other again after 1372. When Harpeden returned to France in 1385, his son was a courtier at the court of Charles VI.

In the spring of 1640, Francesc de Tamarit was imprisoned accused of not providing cams and accommodation to the army. Insurrectioned peasants entered Barcelona on May 22 and released it. On June 7 of the same year, in the Corpus of Blood, groups of reapers entered the city again and the Viceroy of Catalonia Dalmau de Queralt was murdered. In September, the army of Philip IV led by Pedro Fajardo, Marquess of Los Vélez occupied Tortosa in December and, after the battle of Cambrils, the city of Tarragona, moving towards Barcelona. Francesc de Vilaplana with two companies of Catalan cavalry and one of French not included in the surrender of Tarragona, watches the progress of the army of Los Vélez across the Penedès. The Franco-Catalans decided to face the Spanish in Martorell, which became the headquarters of Catalan army after Roger de Bossost, Baron of Espenan, surrendered Tarragona and fled with his troops to France. Four days before the battle, the Junta de Braços (States-General) of the Principality of Catalonia, presided over by the President of the Generalitat, Pau Claris, proclaimed the Catalan Republic under the protection of France. Battle Pedro Fajardo de Zúñiga and Requesens, Marquis de los Vélez sent a large contingent of troops on January 20 by Gelida and Castellví de Rosanes, in order to cut the possible retreat of the Catalan troops by the right bank of the Llobregat. But these troops were repulsed by the miquelets commanded by Dídac de Vergós. The 21, the bulk of the Spanish royal army with infantry led by the Marquis de San Jorge, arrived to the Llobregat, provoking the retreat of the Catalan army from Martorell, who crossed the Pont del Diable (Devil's Bridge) while being covered by French artillery, so as not to be isolated. The Spanish entered the city provoking a new massacre. The mayor of Martorell was murdered when wearing the insignia of his charge, he tried to avoid the rampage. According to what appears, the Marquis de Los Vélez considered the Martorellencs doubly treacherous, to the King and to himself, because Martorell was a city under his lordship. When the Castilian cavalry led by the Marquis de Torrecuso crossed the Llobregat, the Catalans had to withdraw to Barcelona. The rout of Martorell, with the presence of the Spanish army at the gates of Barcelona, pushed the Catalans to proclaim Louis XIII Count of Barcelona on January 23, which sent an army in Catalonia to support his new subjects. However three days later, at the battle of Montjuïc, near Barcelona, on December 26 the Catalan and French armies defeated the Spanish troops. Bibliography Hernández, F. Xavier.

Properties  SERINC5 is a protein belonging to the serine incorporator (SERINC) family, in the predicted membrane proteins class. It is believed that SERINC5 proteins help incorporate serine into certain lipid bilayer membranes; however, scientists are unsure of their primary function and physiology. Of the five proteins in the human SERINC family, their topologies are strikingly similar. Approximately 17% of amino acids are shared amongst these proteins. = C-terminal Transmembrane Domain = SERINC proteins have about 10 to 11 transmembrane domains. For SERINC5 to localize itself to the plasma membrane to inhibit infectivity by viruses, an extra c-terminal transmembrane domain is required. This extra transmembrane domain allows the protein to express itself stably.  Antagonistic Relationships  leftleftNef, glycoGag, and S2 viral proteins are located throughout HIV-1 virions that aid in the facilitation of retrovirus release. When present, SERINC5, in the absence of certain virulence factors, prohibits HIV retrovirus particles from fusing to the cell membrane and incorporating their genetic information into target cells. Because SERINC5 is primarily localized via the plasma membrane, and attaches to vesicles carrying virus particles, the restriction factor has the ability to greatly decrease viral infectivity in the early stages of infection. It has been observed in past experiments that the highest SERINC5 concentration, regardless the expression of Nef, decreased infectivity approximately 250-fold. Although poorly understood, it is believed that Nef is a primary cause for the destruction of SERINC5 and other restriction factors. When in the presence of virulence factors, specifically Nef, both SERINC5 and CD4 cells are downregulated through lysosomal degradation via the AP-2 endocytic pathway. This causes rapid infectivity, and an increase in viral load.

This metric has its foundations in graph theory and combines methods of text mining and social network analysis. The Semantic Brand Score was developed based on the conceptualizations of brand equity proposed by Keller and Aaker. These well-known models inspired the measurement of a different construct on textual data: brand importance. Brand equity is traditionally assessed through a series of models, which are often based on the administration of questionnaires to consumers or, for example, on financial evaluations. By contrast, the Semantic Brand Score is calculated on texts that potentially represent spontaneous expressions of different stakeholders: they are not subjected to direct interviews, thus reducing possible cognitive biases. The metric can be calculated, for example, by analyzing newspaper articles, consumer dialogue on online forums, or posts published on social media.  Definition and calculation  = Pre-processing = The calculation of the Semantic Brand Score requires that the analyzed texts are preliminarily transformed into networks of words, i.e. graphs in which each node represents a word. Links between words are given by their co- occurrence within a given range, or within a sentence. A pre-processing of natural language is advisable to clean up texts, for example by removing stopwords and word affixes (stemming). Consider for example the following network, obtained from the pre-processing of the sentence \\"The dawn is the appearance of light - usually golden, pink or purple - before sunrise.\\". 500x500px Semantic Brand Score, which measures brand importance, results from the standardized sum of its components: prevalence, diversity and connectivity. = Prevalence = This dimension measures the frequency of use of a brand name, i.e. the number of times a brand is directly mentioned. Prevalence is linked to the concept of brand awareness, with the idea that a brand that appears more often in a text is more familiar to that text authors. Similarly, the fact that a brand name is frequently mentioned increases its recognition and recall, for those who read it. = Diversity = This dimension measures the diversity of the words associated with a brand. These are textual associations (and not mental ones as in the brand image theorized by Keller), i.e. the words that are most frequently used in conjunction with a certain brand. Calculation is obtained by means of the degree centrality indicator, which corresponds to the degree of the node representing the brand. Alternatively, it was suggested to calculate diversity through the measure of distinctivness centrality, which gives more value to less redundant brand associations. The idea is that many distinctive textual associations make the discourse around a brand more informative, leading to greater brand strength and importance. = Connectivity = This last dimension measures the level of connectivity of a brand with respect to general discourse, i.e. its ability to act as a bridge between other words (nodes) in the network. Ideally it represents the brokerage power of a brand, i.e. its ability to link different words, groups of words, or topics. Calculation is based on the metric of weighted betweenness centrality. = Semantic Brand Score = The Semantic Brand Score is the standardized sum of prevalence, diversity and connectivity. The three components are all important and only together they represent the full construct of brand importance. Consider for example the case where a brand is frequently mentioned, but in a repetitive way with many posts having the same phrase \\"InventedCola is the best drink of all time\\". Prevalence in this case would be high, but diversity would be low. On the other hand, a brand frequently mentioned in a heterogeneous context would have both high prevalence and diversity. However, connectivity may still be low if the brand is discussed only as a niche of a wider discourse. When a brand is in-between different topics - it is important and acts as an intermediary for the whole context - then its connectivity is also high. The \\"InventedCola\\" brand could be central in one discourse (e.g. soft drinks) and peripheral in another (e.g. bar cocktails). Some tutorials for the calculation of the metric using the Python programming language can be found online. = Sentiment of textual brand associations = The informativeness of brand importance can be complemented by comparing its value with that of brand associations sentiment. The fact that a brand is frequently mentioned, even in diverse contexts, and is at the heart of a discourse, defines its importance. However, it may be useful to understand whether the feelings and opinions associated with it are positive or negative.  Use cases  = Not only \\"brands\\" = The Semantic Brand Score can be used to measure the importance of any word, or set of words; it is therefore not limited to the analysis of brands in a strict sense. By \\"brand\\" one can also intend the name of a politician, or a set of words that represent a concept (for example, the concept of \\"innovation\\" or a corporate core value). = Use cases = The measure was used to evaluate the transition dynamics that occur when a new brand replaces an old one. The Semantic Brand Score is also useful to relate the importance of a brand to that of its competitors, or to analyze importance time trends of a single brand. In some applications, the measures obtained have also proved useful for forecasting purposes; for example, in the political scenario, a link has been found between brand importance of candidate names in online press and election outcomes. There are no limits on the text sources that can be analyzed: newspaper articles, emails, posts on online forums, blogs and social media, open text fields of interviews administered to consumers, etc.. The measure also works with different languages.

On October 21, 1914, Mewa Singh murdered a Canadian immigration inspector, W. C. Hopkinson, a political act of violence for which he was executed. In the eyes of Sikh Canadians, Mewa Singh's assassination of Hopkinson was a display of martyrdom, one which they commemorate annually.  Early life  Mewa Singh was born in 1881 in the village of Lopoke which is located in Ajnala Tehsil of Amritsar district in Punjab, India. He was the son of Nand Singh Aulakh and had one brother who was named Dewa Singh.  Vancouver, British Columbia  Similar to other migrants, Mewa Singh came to British Columbia, Canada in 1906 in search of a better livelihood. Singh was one of over 5000 Punjabi men who arrived in Canada in the three years before 1908, the date when the Canadian government passed the Continuous Journey Regulation to prohibit further immigration from India. Once Singh arrived, he joined the community of Punjabi labourers in British Columbia, finding employment working on the green chain of Fraser Mills in New Westminster near Vancouver. Whilst living there, Mewa Singh came into contact with Sikh community leaders such as Bhag Singh Bhikhiwind and Balwant Singh Khurdpur of the Khalsa Diwan Society Vancouver. In coordination with them, he became involved in the fundraising for the construction of the first Gurdwara, or Sikh temple, in Vancouver and North America. After the inauguration of this first Gurdwara in January 1908, Mewa Singh was initiated as a Khalsa Sikh and he maintained an active role in the upkeep of the newly built Gurdwara. In addition to this maintenance role, he also served as a granthi, or scripture reader.  Ghadr Party involvement and first arrest  As a member of the small Punjabi community in Vancouver, Mewa Singh became familiar with people on both sides of the political barrier dividing local Sikhs. On one side, there was the Ghadar Party activists, and on the other, a handful of informants reporting to W.C. Hopkinson and the Vancouver immigration department. Through his connections with Balwant Singh, a fellow mill worker and granthi in the Vancouver Sikh Temple, and Bhag Singh, president of the Gurdwara management committee, Mewa Singh began working with the Ghadar Party. Formed by Indians living in North America, the Ghadar Party was a movement founded in April 1913 that sought to undertake an armed struggle to gain India independence from British rule. During the period of 1908-1918, Canadian immigration officials in Vancouver played an integral role in the surveillance of Indian nationalists in North America. At the centre of this surveillance effort was W.C. Hopkinson, an immigration inspector, who established a network of moles within the city’s nascent Punjabi community. Hopkinson hired these informants to garner information about political activists who were perceived as a threat to British rule in India. In a statement made to Hopkinson in June 1914, an informant, Bela Singh Jian, reported that Mewa Singh, who was acting as a messenger, offered him $500 and a ticket to India or a piece of real estate in exchange for Jian stopping his collaboration with the immigration office. A month later, on July 16, 1914, Mewa Singh joined three other Ghadarites – Bhag Singh, Balwant Singh, and Harnam Singh – who crossed the border at Sumas to meet Taraknath Das, a Bengali activist, and to purchase weapons to give to the passengers of the Komagata Maru. At the time, the passengers had lost their case in the Appeal Court of British Columbia and had agreed to leave Canada. However, the passengers refused to depart until the Canadian government had allocated provisions for their return across the Pacific. While the ship was still in the harbour, three of the aforementioned men entered a hardware store in Sumas and purchased several firearms (two semi-automatic pistols and two revolvers) along with ammunition. Shortly after, Mewa Singh, who had crossed the border ahead of his group, was apprehended by a provincial constable for avoiding the regular check point by attempting to go through the woods. When he was arrested, Mewa Singh was found with two concealed revolvers and 300 rounds of ammunition. The other members of the group were detained by American officials, but were eventually released two weeks later without charges against them. As the only one arrested by Canadian authorities, Mewa Singh was facing up to ten years in prison on the charges of trafficking weapons and carrying concealed firearms. He was approached by W.C. Hopkinson and immigration agent Malcolm Reid to provide evidence that would incriminate the other members of his party, and in turn, help build their case for Ghadar Party involvement with the Komagata Maru. Ultimately, Mewa Singh complied, and in the statement he gave to Hopkinson and Reid, he acknowledged the following: (1) He went on the cross-border trip with the other men by chance and was never in their full confidence; (2) they purchased four revolvers; (3) Balwant Singh paid for the firearms; (4) and, according to his knowledge, the weapons were bought with the intent of convoying them to the Komagata Maru. Although Hopkinson and Reid deemed his statement unsatisfactory, Mewa Singh was not considered a major player and was released on August 7, 1914 after paying a $50 fine with the help of the Vancouver Sikh Gurdwara.  Murder of W.C. Hopkinson  = Events preceding the murder = In the months following the return of the Komagata Maru to India in April 1914, the immigration officers in Vancouver faced backlash from the local Sikh community, whose members made headlines both as victims and as perpetrators. During this time, Bela Singh Jian - one of W.C. Hopkinson’s chief informants - became convinced that the Sikh Ghadarites in Vancouver would target him for being a spy within the community. The sudden deaths of two other Immigration Department informants – Harnam Singh Gahal and Arjan Singh – seemed to confirm Bela Singh’s suspicions. On September 5, 1914, Bela Singh entered the Vancouver Gurdwara for the funeral of Arjan Singh. In response to the perceived murder of his colleagues, and under abetment of Hopkinson, Bela Singh opened fire within the Gurdwara and murdered two Sikhs. Bhag Singh Bhikhiwind, the president of the Gurdwara management committee and an anticolonial leader, was one of the two Sikhs that Bela Singh shot dead. According to testimony from Balwant Singh, the presiding granthi at the time, Mewa Singh was at the Vancouver Gurdwara when the shooting occurred and was performing kirtan. After the shooting, Bela Singh called the police and was subsequently arrested. At the police station, Bela Singh claimed that he fired in self-defense. The other witnesses—who were friends of Bela Singh—corroborated his story. = Shooting and arrest = On October 21, 1914, Bela Singh, charged with murder, was tried in the Provincial Court House of British Columbia. His plan to plead self-defense hinged on proving that there had been prior threats against his life. For this to work, he required testimony from Hopkinson, who could demonstrate that Bela Singh's life had been constantly threatened. However, while Hopkinson was waiting by the courtroom door, he was approached by a group of Sikhs, which included Mewa Singh. As they got closer, Mewa Singh marched up to Hopkinson, pulled out a revolver, and opened fire on him. In total, Mewa Singh shot five bullets into Hopkinson’s body. After witnessing the shooting, several court employees surrounded Mewa Singh and demanded that he turn over his firearms. Mewa Singh did not resist arrest, and as the head janitor stripped him of his weapons, he said “I shoot. I go to station.\\" As a result of Hopkinson’s murder, Bela Singh’s trial was immediately postponed, and the trial of Mewa Singh took its place. = Murder trial and execution = As the historian Hugh M. Johnston writes, the speed at which the BC legal system processed the case of Mewa Singh had no precedent in modern Canada. Mewa Singh’s trial was held on October 21 and lasted only one hour and forty minutes. Without hesitation, Mewa Singh pleaded guilty and took absolute responsibility for the murder of W. C. Hopkinson. Furthermore, Mewa Singh claimed he had killed Hopkinson to defend the sanctity and honor of his religion, which had been desecrated by the shooting at the Vancouver Gurdwara. Singh argued that inspectors Hopkinson and Reid were behind Bela Singh’s act of extreme violence. When questioned, Singh also spoke of his previous interactions with Hopkinson in his first arrest at the U.S border in July, 1914. According to Singh, Hopkinson had pressured him to provide evidence to implicate the Shore Committee - a group of Vancouver Sikhs offering provisions and support to the Komagata Maru passengers. Additionally, Mewa Singh stated that Hopkinson tried to force him to testify in defense of Bela Singh earlier that month. Mewa Singh’s sentiments can be summed up in this excerpt from his translated court statement: “You, as Christians, would you think there was any more good left in your church if you saw people shot down, and killed in it, and you would not put up with it, because it would be bringing yourselves to a Nation that is dead, to tolerate such conduct, and it is better for a Sikh to die than to bring such disgrace and ill-treatment in the temple. It is far better to die than to live.”Funeral Procession of Mewa Singh, 1915.At Mewa Singh’s request, Edward Montague Woods, his court appointed lawyer, called no witnesses and conducted no cross-examination. Yet, Woods attempted to help Mewa Singh by appealing to the Minister of Justice in Ottawa, advocating for Mewa Singh’s sentence to be commuted. Ultimately, Woods' efforts were futile and Mewa Singh was sentenced to death by hanging. On January 11, 1915, approximately 400 Sikhs gathered outside the New Westminster jail, where Mewa Singh was executed. After he was hanged, Mewa Singh’s body was turned over to the crowd of Sikhs in attendance. From there, the procession of nearly 400 carried the body for three kilometres until they arrived at Fraser Mills, where they had received permission to cremate Mewa Singh’s body. = Aftermath = Neither the police nor the Vancouver Immigration officials believed that Mewa Singh acted alone. Although officials believed there to be a larger plan behind the murder, the Immigration Department was unable to make a compelling case to support these suspicions. However, officials still arrested several members of the Shore Committee (nearly all of them Ghadrite) with the charge of inciting Mewa Singh to murder Hopkinson. Later authorities dropped these charges for lack of evidence. A year after Mewa Singh was hanged, on January 11, 1916, he was acknowledged and eulogized in Ghadar Party literature. On the second anniversary, in 1917, Vancouver Sikhs congregated for several days at the Gurdwara by Fraser Mills, the location of Mewa Singh’s cremation. In the following year, the number of Sikh attendees grew to five hundred, even though there were only about seven hundred Sikhs in BC.  Contemporary memory and legacy  = Annual commemoration = Painted portrait of Mewa Singh that is displayed in the Langar Hall (or dining hall) of the Khalsa Diwan Society Ross Street Gurdwara For the Sikh community of Vancouver, Mewa Singh is a martyr and his martyrdom is celebrated every year in the Khalsa Diwan Society’s Gurdwara on Ross Street. Also, this occasion is marked and celebrated by other Sikh temples across Canada, and in the United States as well. In Sikh circles, Mewa Singh is often referred to with the honorific title \\"Bhai\\" (or \\"brother\\"), which is accorded to those Sikhs who have distinguished themselves in their deeds for the community. In 2015, the 100th anniversary of Mewa Singh’s martyrdom was commemorated by the Prof. Mohan Singh Memorial Foundation. Taking place at the old British Columbia jail site in New Westminster at 7:45 AM - the same location and time of Mewa Singh’s execution – members of the Sikh community paid tribute and respect to Mewa Singh for his sacrifice and contributions to the Ghadar Party. = Bhai Mewa Singh Primary School = In 2019, SAF International, a Canadian NGO that provides aid to individuals across India, visited Mewa Singh's ancestral village of Lopoke. Upon seeing the village's primary school in such disrepair, SAF announced plans to rebuild and rename the primary school in his name.https://children.safinternational.org/product/LOPOKESCHOOL/bhai-mewa- singh-punjab-school The project, which is supported by the Gurdwara Sahib Sukh Sagar in British Columbia, Canada, began construction in early 2020. Once completed, the school will feature brand new SMART classrooms, a water reservoir, access to solar power, and a plaque that honors Mewa Singh's legacy and tells his story. = Calls for posthumous exoneration = A profile of Mewa Singh displayed by the Khalsa Diwan Society Gurdwara in their Komagata Maru Museum.Members of the Sikh community of Vancouver, such as Gurpreet Singh, the founder of the monthly magazine Radical Desi, have called upon the Canadian government to absolve Mewa Singh of criminal charges. A petition for this cause appeared on Change.org following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's exoneration of six Chilcotin chiefs who were executed by the colonial government of Canada over 150 years ago. Gurpreet Singh, who started the petition, argues that Mewa Singh's murder of W.C. Hopkinson was a political act of aggression that was in response to the wider institutional racism against South Asian immigrants in Canada. Similarly, at the centenary of Mewa Singh’s martyrdom, Sahib Singh Thind, the president of the Prof. Mohan Singh Memorial foundation, called for Mewa Singh's name to be disassociated from any criminal connection within the legal system of Canada and the relevant historical literature. =The Undocumented Trial of William C. Hopkinson= Written and directed by Paneet Singh, The Undocumented Trial of William C. Hopkinson, is a play that was put on in the Vancouver Art Gallery as part of the 2018 Monsoon Festival of Performing Arts. It was the first major artistic and theatrical production to revisit and re-envision the assassination of W.C. Hopkinson and the trial of Mewa Singh. As playwright Paneet Singh explained, The Undocumented Trial of William C. Hopkinson is a forum that seeks to insert Mewa Singh's story into the mainstream by recounting the events that led to the shooting, and the social conditions that made his martyrdom inevitable. Importantly, the play was performed at the same venue where the original trial took place on October 21, 1914.  External Links  Confession of Mewa Singh (Canada and India volume 2, 1916).

Jacobs is known for his 1950's and 1960's reportage photographs of New York City street scenes and for his portraits of celebrities and other notable personalities. He also had a successful career as a freelance commercial photographer. In the 1970s, he and his wife Eleanor popularized Earth Shoes, a countercultural symbol of the decade, through their Earth Shoe company. Early life Jacobs began working as a mink-cutter at his father's fur business in Manhattan's Garment District at the age of 12. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx. He photographed the 1939 New York World's Fair with a Brownie box camera for the student newspaper. Jacobs enlisted in the U.S. Army and served in the Signal Corps in Europe during World War II. Career =Photographer= With an interest in photography since high school, Jacobs applied to a photography class conducted by Lisette Model at The New School. Model reviewed his black-and-white portfolio and asked his profession. He replied, \\"I am a furrier.\\" She told him, \\"You are not. You are a photographer.\\" After studying with Model, Jacobs joined a class taught by Sid Grossman in 1953. In 1960, he studied carbon print color processing with Sy Kattelson and installed color lab equipment into his own darkroom. At the age of 30, Jacobs began a career as a freelance commercial photographer. Through his work with advertising agencies, he photographed campaigns for Campbell's Soup, Tareyton Cigarettes, IBM, Pan Am, Johnson & Johnson, and others. His editorial photographs were published in magazines including Fortune, Esquire, Harper's Bazaar, McCall's, and Eros. Jacobs received more than 50 Art Directors' awards for his advertising work. Jacobs was one of ten photographers featured in Style in Photography in Photography Annual 1963, edited by Bruce Downes. According to Deschin, \\"Jacobs' portfolio of posterlike effects in manipulated images of unrealistic color provides an excitingly novel example of a successful stylistic device.\\" Jacobs is most well known for his 1950's and 1960's reportage photographs of New York City street scenes and for his portraits of notable subjects including Louis Armstrong, Gloria Swanson, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Salvador Dali, Eartha Kitt, Robert F. Kennedy, Sammy Davis Jr., and Billie Holiday. Jacobs' photographs are in the permanent collection of New York City's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and were included in the iconic Edward Steichen curated MoMA photography exhibitions The Family of Man (January 24 – May 8, 1955) and 70 Photographers Look at New York (November 27, 1957 – April 15, 1958). Jacobs first one-man photography exhibition was held in 1955 at Roy DeCarava's A Photographer's Gallery in the Upper West Side of New York City. According to New York Times photography critic Jacob Deschin, the exhibition primarily focused on \\"close- up characterizations of people in varied situations of ordinary living\\" but Jacobs also added \\"a new element, represented in a group of vacation landscapes and seascapes that reveal a fresh, unsuspected side to this photographer's talents.\\" Jacobs had solo and retrospective exhibitions at the Limelight Gallery (1961, Greenwich Village), Walker Art Center (1963, Minneapolis), Washington Irving Gallery (1978, New York City), Oliver Wolcott Library (1990, Litchfield, Connecticut), National Arts Club (1990, New York City), Hotchkiss School Tremaine Art Gallery (2006, Lakeville, Connecticut), and the Litchfield Historical Society (2016, Litchfield, Connecticut). Jacobs' work was also included in the 2007 exhibition, \\"Lisette Model and Her Successors,\\" at the Aperture Gallery in New York City. In 2006, Pointed Leaf Press published My New York, a monograph of Jacobs' New York City street photographs. One of Jacobs' photographs is currently on view in the exhibition \\"Women on View: Aesthetics of Desire in Advertising\\" at Galerie 36 in Berlin. =Filmmaking= In the 1960s, Jacobs branched into filmmaking. He co-wrote and co-produced Aroused (1966), directed by Anton Holden. Jacobs directed, co- wrote, and co-produced his second film, The Minx (1969), which starred Jan Sterling and featured an original soundtrack by The Cyrkle. Both films were financially successful, but he left the business to concentrate on Earth Shoes. =Earth Shoes= In 1970, Jacobs and his wife Eleanor founded the Earth Shoe company to sell a negative heel shoe (the heel was lower than the toe) designed by Anna Kalsø they had discovered while traveling in Copenhagen, Denmark the previous year. Officially opening on April 22, 1970, the first Earth Day, the Jacobs' dubbed the footwear Earth Shoes. The shoes quickly became a popular countercultural symbol of the 1970s. The company expanded to 123 stores to sell the shoes, boots, and sandals, all with the negative heel design, across the United States, Canada, and Europe. By 1976 sales had grown to $14 million, but the company dissolved in 1977. =Later life= After the Earth Shoe company closed, Jacobs relocated with his family to Litchfield, Connecticut and taught photography at Litchfield's Forman School. Jacobs died on March 17, 1993 in Torrington, Connecticut. Personal life Jacobs married his wife Eleanor (\\"Ellie\\") in 1955. They had two daughters, Susan and Laura.

Early life He was born at Tain, Ross-shire, in the beginning of 1628 to \\"honest parents- native highlanders somewhat above the vulgar rank\\".https://archive.org/stream/fastiecclesiaesc00scot/fastiecclesiaesc00scot_djvu.txt He was educated at Tain grammar school, then studied Divinity at Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he proceeded to the degree of M.A. in 1650 In 1654 he received license, and became chaplain to John, earl of Sutherland at Dunrobin. On 24 October 1654 he was ordained minister of Kiltearn, a parish six miles from Dingwall, on the shore of Cromarty Firth, and entered on the discharge of his duties with great ardour. He had also been called to Golspie. Activities while deposed In the controversy between the resolutionists and protesters, then at its height, he sided warmly with the protesters, and was in consequence deposed in 1661 by the synod of Ross. Hog then retired to Knockoudie in Auldearn, Nairn, where he continued to preach and dispense the sacraments, and memorable communions were observed in a sheltered hollow of the Hills of the Arstill, known as \\"Hog's Strype.\\". In July 1668 he was delated by the Bishop of Moray for preaching in his own house and ‘keeping conventicles.’ For these offences he was imprisoned for some time in Forres, but was at length liberated at the intercession of the Earl of Tweeddale, upon giving bail to appear when called on. Not having, however, desisted from preaching, ‘letters of intercommuning’ were on 6 August 1675 issued against him, forbidding all persons to harbour or help him in any way. Arrest and sentence Sketch of the Bass Rock including position of Thomas Hog's cell In January 1677 he voluntarily surrendered to the Earl of Moray, was removed to Edinburgh Tolbooth and sent to the Bass Rock, where he became seriously ill. An Edinburgh physician who was called to see him, petitioned the council for his release, to which some of the members were disposed, but Archbishop Sharp stated \\"the prisoner did and was in a capacity to do more hurt to their interests sitting in his elbow chair than twenty others could, and if the justice of God was pursuing him to take him off the stage, the clemency of the Government should not interpose to hinder it.\\" He was accordingly confined more closely than before. On hearing his sentence he exclaimed in bed, \\"It was as severe as if Satan himself had penned it.\\" King says about the incident: \\"he became so sickly that his physician and the lay lords of the council urged his liberation ;when, in place of release, he was, on the motion of Sharpe, backed by the other prelates, thrown into the lowest vault of that dreary and filthy prison. Here, however, instead of perishing, as was probably expected, he recovered, to the astonishment of friends and enemies. In aftertimes, when the archbishop happened to be mentioned in his presence with disapprobation, he used to say, \\"Commend me to him for a good physician.\\"\\" On 9 October 1677 he was brought back to the Tolbooth, but was again returned to the Bass until set at liberty with others in July 1679, giving bond for 10,000 merks to appear before the Council when called but forbidden to go beyond ‘the bounds of Kintyre’. He remained unmolested till 8 November 1683 when he was charged before the Scottish privy council with keeping ‘house conventicles.’ As he refused to answer the charge, it was held as confessed, and he was fined in five thousand merks. Having decided to quit the country he petitioned to that effect and was enjoined to depart within forty-eight hours. So he was banished from Scotland on 28 March 1684. Flight to Holland He lived for a year in Berwick-upon-Tweed and in 1685 found his way to London, intending to sail to Carolina, but he was apprehended on suspicion of being concerned in the Rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth. He was released in 1685, and fled to Holland, where the Prince of Orange made him one of his chaplains. He returned to Scotland early in 1688, and being restored by Act of Parliament, 25 April 1690, was a member of Assembly that year. He was restored to the parish of Kiltearn, as he is said to have predicted thirty years before would be the case. He was preparing to remove to London, but died after a long and painful sickness, 4 January 1692. At his own request was buried underneath the threshold of his church door, with this inscription over the remains: ‘This stone shall bear witness against the parishioners of Kiltearn if they bring an ungodly minister in here.’ The plaque is dated 1940 and is not original, but is thought to replicate an earlier inscription. A commemorative slab was placed in the parish church and the Hog Memorial Church was erected in the village of Evanton. Family He married after 12 April 1656, the sister of John Hay of Inshock and Park, cadet of Errol (she died without children).

The still active collective has held group exhibitions in several galleries and community spaces across Chicago with a changing line-up of members throughout their over-30-year history. The mission of the group was to create a network of support for black women artists and provide opportunities for them to exhibit their work. Outside of the collective, each member of Sapphire and Crystals holds an independent practice in a wide array of mediums.  History  Sapphire and Crystals emerged during a period of many other feminist groups and artist collectives in Chicago during the 1970s and 1980s. The early planning for Sapphire and Crystals began with conversations between Marva Lee Pitchford-Jolly and Felicia Grant Preston in 1986 as response to the dissolution of the artists' former collective, Mud People's Black Women’s Resource Sharing Workshop. The name of the collective was inspired by the strength and beauty of the sapphire gemstone, as well as the negative \\"Sapphire\\" stereotype used against strong-willed black women, and the spiritual and healing properties crystals.  List of Members  There have been over 40 members throughout Sapphire and Crystal's history, with some participating continually since the beginning and others only showing with the collective for one exhibition.

Biography  Karl Stengel was born in 1925 in Neusatz, when the Austro-Hungarian Empire was crumbling. He was already passionate about drawing in his childhood and was also very gifted at sport. Stengel was a Russian prisoner of war during the Second World War and after this, he was unable to pursue his love of sport. However, his passion for drawing does accompany him in the Soviet lager and when an officer sees him drawing with a piece of coal on a sack of cement, he is asked to do his portrait and to paint other officers too. This is his \\"first exhibition\\". Back in Hungary it is difficult for the son of a bourgeois family to enter the art academy and it is difficult to express one's creativity and individuality when socialist realism imposes itself in every form of expression. In 1956, when Soviet tanks arrived, he fled to Munich, Germany, where he remains for most of his life. It is here in Munich where he attends the Academy of Art and later becomes an art teacher. He dedicated his whole life to painting and drawing and also spent time in Tuscany, where he died on 25 June 2017.  Style and technique  Stengel’s ‘German’ formation and his solid figurative preparation comes to the forefront in his works on paper. While in his larger canvases, generally acrylics on canvas, his art focuses on basic emotions: brightly coloured rectangles that appear to stand out against the canvas hovering above the surface, shimmering and wide-ranging blocks of colour. A principle of figuration emerges and then develops with the typical Stengelian figure, a human silhouette that stands out on an imaginary theatrical backdrop. A man without meaning in front of the world stage. The same silhouette also appears in many oil pastels on paper. The works in the music series are influenced by composers or musicians that Stengel listened to in his studio while he painted. Here the works are clearly abstract, yet one can sometimes still see suggestions of musical scores.

She was the first female director of the museum. Personal life El Saddik was born in 1950 in the Nile Delta region of Egypt. During the Suez Crisis, her family moved to Cairo. She studied archaeology at Cairo University, and later completed a PhD at the University of Vienna. She lived and worked in Cologne, Germany for 15 years, during which time she met her husband, an Egyptian who works as a pharmacist. They married in 1989, and have two children. Her sister has been the State Secretary for the Ministry of Water. Career Originally El Saddik wanted to be a journalist, due to her interest in the Six-Day War and Yom Kippur War. She became interested in archaeology after a trip to Thebes and the Aswan Dam. She has provided historical tours to world leaders including Margaret Thatcher, Jimmy Carter, and Helmut Schmidt, as well as former Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat. At the age of 27, El Saddik went to work for the Tutankhamun exhibition in New Orleans, United States. From 2004 to 2010 she was Director General of Cairo's Egyptian Museum. She was the museum's first female director. As director, El Saddik says that she received numerous politically motivated bids for funding for the museum. El Saddik claimed that the museum created a daily income of around one million Egyptian pounds, but most of this money was transferred to the central government rather than being spent there. In her book Protecting Pharaoh's Treasures, El Saddik said that she had predicted the Egyptian revolution of 2011, saying that she had believed it would be similar to the Tunisian Revolution. In October 2010, she was chosen by then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak to select artefacts for an exhibition in Rome. Her choices were later rejected. She was forced into leaving her role at the museum in December 2010, as she had reached retirement age. During the 2011 Egyptian revolution, El Saddik witnessed the looting of the Egyptian Museum and Memphis Museum. She blamed the incident on police officers and guardians of the museum. After the revolution, El Saddik expressed concern over the preservation of Egyptian historical artefacts.

Morphology Species of Pseudaxine are ectoparasites that affect their host by attaching themselves as larvae on the gills of the fish and grow into adult stage. This larval stage is called oncomiracidium, and is characterized as free swimming and ciliated. The clamps are distributed along one margin of the haptor. Pseudaxine resemble Axine in having a single row of 20 – 30 clamps on one side of the body. However, it differs from Axine in having their hooks situated at the posterior end of the clamp row.Kearn, G.C., 2005. Leeches, Lice and Lampreys: A Natural History of Skin and Gill Parasites.

His cartoons found prominence from the mid-1970s, featuring in many exhibits, books and newspapers. Life and career The eldest of four children, Huskinson was born at Langar Hall to the first-class cricketer Geoffrey Huskinson, Sr. and his wife, Carmen Imogen de las Casas, who was the daughter of a Spanish nobleman from Cuba. He began to lose his hearing aged ten, shortly before attending Ampleforth College. It was his deteriorating hearing that sparked his interest in drawing. Unable to concentrate in class, he began doodling on his desk. After leaving Ampleforth, he was offered places at Slade School of Fine Art and the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art, but accepted a place at Edinburgh College of Art. His time there was brief, with Huskinson moving to New Zealand where he worked on a sheep station until 1955. He returned to England, where he bought a farm in Lincolnshire. Huskinson played a first-class cricket match for the Free Foresters against Oxford University at Oxford in 1959. He had little success in what was his only foray into first-class cricket, scoring 3 runs in the Free Foresters first-innings before being dismissed by David Russell, while in their second-innings he was dismissed by David Sayer for 7 runs. He married Judith Chadfield in 1961, with the couple having three sons. During this period he worked for Aveling-Barford as their representative in Africa and the Middle East, before leaving in 1967 when the company was taken over by British Leyland. He took up art once more in the mid-1970s, initially specialising in portraiture and sculpting. He later exhibited some cartoons he had drawn, and decided to focus as a cartoonist after they sold out within 30 minutes. He exhibited across the world between 1980 and 2007, and was regularly selling over 3,000 prints a year. His illustrations filled a number of books, most prominently those about horse racing and cookery. His wife died in 2007, with Huskinson briefly marrying Sue Ward, who ran his dealing network. In 2014, he moved to Menorca to live by the golf course at Son Parc, where he died in March 2018. Family His great-grandfather was Thomas Bayley, the Member of Parliament for Chesterfield. His sister, Imogen Skirving, was killed in a road accident in 2016 when she came to visit Huskinson in Menorca.

History The gallery was a cooperative, started by 20 women who were frustrated by the lack of opportunities for female artists in Chicago, and opened in the same month as the ARC Gallery, another Chicago women’s cooperative. Artmesia was named after Artemisia Gentileschi, an Italian 17th-century artist and painter whose best work was first attributed to her father. From 1973 to 2003, Artemisia exhibited local, national, and international artists, supporting the careers of over 150 women artists and their mentees. The gallery was an active site for exhibitions, lectures, discussions, artist exchanges, and meetings. In 1975, the gallery was home to the first meeting of what would later become the Chicago Artist Coalition. The gallery closed in 2003. Lynne Warren, a curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, suggested that women had become less drawn to a women's cooperative. Programs As due-paying members of the cooperative, each member was granted a show annually in the gallery's exhibition space, and participated in monthly meetings to plan and execute the program. Members and applicants, guest artists, and educational programs were selected by the gallery's membership, which ranged from 10 to 20 members. Artemisia Gallery created a video library of interviews from female artists and critics, and established a learning resource center which made information about the role of women in contemporary art available to the public through periodicals, slides, and videotapes. In addition, the gallery also provided a speaker's bureau which offered a mentorship program, and launched a public education pilot program to both promote the role of women in art, and to strengthen links between art and education.

It opened in 1926 and closed in 1946, following the introduction of the Loi Marthe Richard, which abolished brothels in France. It was located on the corner of the rue de la Magdeleine and rue Bacquenoi. The prestige of the Palais Oriental rivalled that of Paris's most luxurious maison closes, the One-Two-Two and Le Chabanais. Overview Work on the Palais Oriental started in 1924 and the establishment first opened its doors on 15 April 1925. Like many other French brothels of the time it had an Oriental theme. The building itself drew heavily from Moorish architecture, looking like an Arab fortress, and the interior was adorned with mosaics and hand-painted frescos. On the ground floor was the main reception room. This was open to the public with no obligation to use the other services of the brothel. Cabaret shows were produced for the entertainment of patrons. The room had a well stocked 25m bar. It is reputed that the patrons consumed more Champagne here than in the rest of the bars and restaurants in Reims combined. Also on the ground floor was a Moorish lounge where the 30 or so women, known as petits cœurs à louer (little hearts for rent), awaited clients. A grand staircase took the women and clients up to the 7 small salons, each one having a different oriental theme. Amongst the clients were politicians, Princes, Maharajas, and celebrities of the day. After WW2, following campaigning by ex- prostitute Marthe Richard, a law was passed outlawing brothels in France. As a consequence of this, the Palais Oriental closed on 30 September 1946. The building was demolished and a garage built on the site. Legacy The only surviving parts of the brothel building are a floor mosaic and a small back door. In 2009, researcher Nicole Canet published Maisons closes, 1860-1946: bordels de femmes, bordels d'hommes, of the brothels featured in the book, the Palais Oriental was the only one outside Paris.

According to a Global Gender Gap Index report published in 2018, it would take 135 years to close the gender gap in Africa and nearly 153 years to close the gap in North Africa. There are competing theories about the cause of gender inequality in Africa, but scholars suggest its genesis is in slaveryHistory of Africa and colonialism.  History  Scholars point to the colonial legacy of African underdevelopment to explain gender inequality and female disempowerment. When Europeans settled in Uganda it caused a century-long transformation of Kampala which led to a gender Kuznets curve. African men were educated and employed in the white-collar (high-status) economy built by the Europeans. Women, on the other hand, were slower to obtain education and employment in the white-collar economy. This disparity contributed to the gender inequality gap in the early pre-colonial period, however, the gender gap gradually decreased during the late colonial era. Economist believed the gender gap may have been rooted in indigenous social norms. Less-educated women often worked in traditional, informal economies rather than formal work. Consequently, they were subjected to marital gender inequality in comparison to women who worked in the formal economies created by Europeans. Literature often characterized African women as subservient to their fathers and husbands. But in pre-colonial Africa, women were queen-mothers, queen-sisters; princesses, chiefs and holders of offices and villages, occasional warriors, and in one well known case, the Lovedu, the supreme monarch. Women in post-colonial Africa, on the other hand, were not always protected from certain abuses because they no longer held societal or political power. Many scholars believe African women became virtually voiceless, unable to gain economic and educational equality.  Gender Roles in Pre-colonial and Post-colonial Africa  Women in pre-colonial Africa held positions of prominence; except where Islam was predominant. They played critical roles socially and economically, and contributed to the family by processing food, weaving, making pottery, and cooking. African households were ruled by a patrilineal system where men were the heads of the household and women managed the younger family members. But outside of the home many women were involved in trade. Yoruban women, for example, were the central figures in long-distance trade. They amassed enormous wealth and held prominent titles. A successful Yoruba woman might hold the chieftaincy title of iyalode; which meant she had great privilege and power. = Pre-Colonial Africa = In the pre-colonial era, women were also politically active. They governed the home; which was a very important role with significant power. Because power and privilege was based on age and gender, elder women had a voice in many important issues concerning the family and community. Private and public activities were so commingled that the power and privilege women held in the home was often mirrored in public. Some literature details how women used the production of food to gain respect, and in turn, they used that respect to dominate the children and influence the men in their lives. Religious women prayed to the gods and spirits for power and influence. Image of Queen Mother from Akan (Ghana). Men controlled the activities outside of the household and could bestow titles on women. For example, queen-mother, a prestigious title among the Edo and Yoruba, could be given to the king's mother or another free woman with notable status. The queen mother officiated meetings and had subordinate title-holders assisting her. Some Yoruba and Hausa legends recall when women held the title of king. Legendary figures like Moremi of Ile-Ife, Amina of Zaria of Ondo, and Daura were notable queens. = Post-Colonial Africa = In the 20th century, women lost their influence and power when patriarchy and colonialism changed gender relations. The role of female chiefs decreased as male chiefs negotiated with British colonial powers in the oversight of taxes and governance. Nigerian men and European firms dominated the distribution of rubber, cocoa, groundnuts (peanuts), and palm oil, as the economy became more and more dependent on cash crops for exports. This pushed women into the background where they were forced into the informal economy. The custom land-tenure systems that once provided women with access to land was exchanged for land commercialization which favored those with access to wealth earned from the sale of cash crops. Moreover, the European- style education system in post-colonial Africa favored boys over girls.  Gender Inequalities in the 21st Century  Analysts and scholars contend the global movements to improve the livelihood of women in the West, and those living in urban cities, have not benefitted women in Sub-Saharan Africa. To close the gender gap in Africa, the issues women face must become part of the global discussions. According to published reports, Sub-Saharan Africa is among the world's most gender-unequal regions. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), reports “perceptions, attitudes, and historic gender roles” prevent women from accessing health care and education and contributes to disproportionate levels of family responsibility, job segregation, and sexual violence. = Educational Inequalities = Image of primary school aged girls in Africa. Theoretically, the inequality between boys and girls starts in primary school and widens throughout the educational process. Over the past decade, Africa registered the highest relative increase in primary education in total enrollment among regions. Girls, however, were enrolled at lower rates. In 2000, Sub-Saharan Africa reported 23 million girls were not enrolled in primary school, an increase of 3 million from a decade earlier when 20 million were not enrolled. Policy reforms in countries such as Benin, Botswana, the Gambia, Guinea, Lesotho, Mauritania and Namibia made notable improvements in enrollment for girls. For example, in Benin, the gender gap decreased from 32% to 22% due to media campaigns that emphasized to parents the necessity of enrolling girls in primary school. Benin also reduced school fees for primary school aged girls living in rural areas. According to the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) the enrollment for girls enrolled increased relative to boys when the number of female teachers increased. UNESCO reported that an effective tool to close the gender parity was to balance gender among teachers. Mauritania employed this strategy to close the gender gap in primary schools from 13% to 4% between 1990 and 2000. Guinea's strategy was to make girl's education a national priority. In the early 1990s, the government launched programs to build latrines, introduced reproductive care for pregnant students, distributed free textbooks, and increased the number of female teachers. By 2000, Guinea more than doubled the enrollment of girls in school and boys’ attendance increased by 80%. But regionally, Africa still has fewer female teachers, in general. Between 1990 and 2000, adult literacy rates improved in Africa by 20%. The female illiteracy rates are much higher than the regional average; which is 50%. In Burkina Faso the female literacy is 82%, in Sierra Leone it is 79%, and in Benin and Ethiopia it is 77%. = Economic Inequalities = Analysts believe the biggest obstacle to gender inequality in Africa is wealth accumulation. According to the World Bank, 37% of women in the region have a bank account, compared to 48% of men. These percentages are low for both genders but the gap has widened for women over the past several years.  Access to wealth  For women to escape poverty, analysts believe they need access to development policies that would place more emphasis on their contributions to the economy. Women contribute significantly to the population but their labour participation is not fully accounted for because it is often derived from informal agricultural farming. Similarly, any work inside the home is not accounted for because it is not considered to be an economic activity. At the macro level, gender inequality is also costly. The UNDP reports countries in Sub-Saharan Africa lose approximately $95 billion annually because women are not integrated into the national economy. When impoverished women are unable to contribute socially, economic growth is stagnated. Some women farmers do have access to financial resources, leading analysts to conclude financial empowerment would increase female participation in community decision-making and combat social marginalization, which would improve the overall family's well-being. Case studies show women who manage household finances are less likely to have children die from malnutrition. According to the UNDP, one of the most significant changes needed would be commitments from financial institutions to offer products that meet the needs of women, which would give more women access to financial resources. By creating specific loan programs for crops that are traditionally grown by female farmers – such as groundnuts or sunflowers, financial institutions would encourage female leadership in farmers’ cooperatives, and support markets where women sell their harvests. At current rates of financial inclusion, it would take the world more than 200 years to achieve gender parity globally, but analysts believe if governments, international actors, and the financial industry devise and sustain more gender-focused policies, the gender inequality gap would shorten more quickly.

Oil theft in Nigeria is facilitated by the pragmatic co-operation between security forces, militia organizations, the local population, and oil company employees who use a variety of methods to steal oil from the multinational oil corporations that are stationed within the country. Currently, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Statoil, Shell, and Agip are the five largest multinational oil companies present in Nigeria. Due to the lack of federal oversight and a large network of corruption, oil theft is primarily cellular rather than hierarchical and requires frequent collaboration between a variety of random players depending on the level of oil theft being committed. Each group maintains a specific role in the oil theft trade in Nigeria. These key players use methods such as hot-tapping and cold-tapping to perform oil bunkering and steal thousands of barrels of oil per day from established oil pipelines. In addition to stealing oil from the pipelines, oil theft can also occur during the transportation of the crude oil product to the oil shipping terminals for export. Muhammadu Buhari's administration’s attempt to reduce corruption within the government through the targeting of suspected facilitators of oil theft has led to an increase in violence within the country. For example, the creation of the Niger Delta Avengers militant organization occurred after Buhari prosecuted the leader of a local militia group, Government Ekpemupolo, for his role in the practice of oil theft in the Niger Delta region. Consequently, Ekpemupolo and the Niger Delta Avengers have proceeded to sabotage multinational oil corporation pipelines. In addition to the violence associated with the Niger Delta Avengers, oil spilled from these sabotage operations and the illegal refinery practices committed by the local population have led to the severe pollution of the environment. Given that almost 83 percent of total exports revenue come from the petroleum products revenue in Nigeria, the political and military elite have sought ways to consolidate their control of the oil trade. This monopoly over the oil trade has prompted many local villagers to commit small-scale oil theft and to pursue the illegal refinery of stolen crude oil as means of entering into this unofficial economy.  Definition  In terms of an orthodox definition and in the context of Nigeria, \\"oil theft\\" is constituted as the illegal appropriation of refined oil or crude oil from the various multinational oil companies that are positioned in the country through the process of oil bunkering. This includes the theft, diversion, and smuggling of petroleum products. Refined oil products refer to crude oil that has been refined through a variety of treatment processes to become ready to burn energy. Although estimates of how much oil is stolen per day in Nigeria vary, the British think tank Chatham House reports that over 100,000 barrels of oil were estimated to be stolen per day. According to OPEC, Nigeria is estimated to produce over one and a half million barrels of oil per day.  Methods of oil theft  Hot-tapping and cold-tapping are extremely sophisticated methods of oil theft and are primarily used in large-scale operations during the crude oil stage. Terminal and vehicle transportation theft involves the re- appropriation of both crude and refined oil products from storage facilities during the process of export transportation. =Hot-tapping= During the process of hot-tapping, an illegal secondary pipeline belonging to oil theft criminals is attached to a high-pressure primary pipeline belonging to a multinational corporation. After this breach is successful, oil is diverted from the primary pipeline into mobile oil bunkering facilities that are attached to the secondary pipeline. By gradually withdrawing small amounts of oil, the primary pipeline is able to function at an almost normal pressure and can remain undetected by oil corporation officials. Although a gradual amount must be withdrawn, the pressure within a pipeline is substantial enough for a transport barge to be filled with thousands of metric tons of oil within a few hours. Hot-tapping is considered to be extremely dangerous and complex. =Cold-tapping= In the process of cold-tapping, a portion of a pipeline is blown up and a secondary pipeline is attached to the shut-down primary pipeline. After the primary pipeline is repaired, the existence of the secondary pipeline's access to the oil flow is unknown since the overall pipeline pressure will not fluctuate. Cold-tapping is considered to be less dangerous. =Terminal and vehicle transportation theft= Although oil theft is common during the initial stages of the oil production process, theft is rampant at the port terminals where crude and refined oil products await shipment to international locations and during the transportation of oil products from corporate facilities. In export terminal theft, administrative collusion and security force corruption facilitate the siphoning of oil shipment reserves into criminal fuel trucks. In turn, these fuel trucks are used to transport illegal oil products for sale in neighboring African countries where the price for oil is substantially higher than the subsidized rates in Nigeria. Since oil corporations do not have oil meters at the source of production and since they are only present at export facilities, there is a lack of oversight into managing the initial value of oil that was produced by the multinational oil corporations.  Participants  Oil theft in Nigeria requires the effective collaboration between a variety of participants and the maintenance of their individual functions which are essential to committing theft. This collaboration and interaction is entirely situational and takes on a certain complexity depending on the level of oil theft that is being committed. In most instances of large-scale and illegal oil bunkering, corrupt resident oil authority officials allow for the successful tapping of oil pipelines. Subsequently, the Nigerian security forces or militant organizations offer guided escorts for the transportation of stolen refined or crude oil products. These products are eventually sold to neighboring African countries where the price of oil is much higher or to other international bidders. With regards to the general population, most Nigerian citizens in the Niger Delta who are participants in the oil theft trade assist in the illegal refinery of stolen crude oil products and sell them at black markets in local villages. = Military and security forces = Since the presidency of Ibrahim Babangida from 1986 to 1993 and his appointment of officials to supervise the oil producing sectors, the Nigerian military has maintained extensive control over the crude oil trade. The military personnel and Joint-Task Force members that are involved in the illegal oil trade primarily serve as armed escorts for the stolen petroleum products during large-scale operations and gather the intelligence that is necessary for avoiding government probes in the region. In addition to providing security for the illegal trade, the Nigerian navy is frequently active in seizing transportation vessels that are suspected of containing stolen petroleum products. However, in these operations, Nigerian security forces have often been accused of facilitating the disappearance of captured vessels and the reappropriated sale of seized products to foreign markets. Similarly to facilitating the oil theft trade, Nigerian military officials often pursue oil bunkering allegations against fellow servicemen as means of absorbing sectors of the oil trade and strengthening individual positions in the region. For example, in 2007, then Chief of Naval Staff Ganiyu Adekeye reported that a large group of retired military personnel were suspected of facilitating the disappearance of captured vessels. Although there is credible evidence for a variety of participants in the illegal oil trade in Nigeria, the Nigerian government's lack of prosecution before Buhari's administration suggests that corruption is extensive and high- reaching. = Militant organizations = According to former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo, militant organizations have often been used by “political godfathers” in the oil sector regions to cause disturbances in regional stability. Consequently, these disturbances give the political elite the opportunity to implement methods of oil theft under more loose supervision by the government. Given that over 50 percent of Nigeria’s total population is designated as impoverished by the World Bank, the incentives for joining local gangs and militant organizations that work under these political elite are credible. These groups primarily serve as armed escorts for the property of the political elite or function as the sabotage mechanism that is necessary for cold-tapping operations. A prime example of militant organizations and their role in political violence is the contemporary existence of the Niger Delta Avengers. Currently, the Buhari administration has pursued anti- corruption policies and has undertaken a variety of probings of Nigeria’s political elite for their involvement in the oil theft trade. However, Buhari’s attempts to remove corruption from the government has caused backlash from the variety of political elite that he has pursued with criminal prosecution. Previous to the Buhari administration’s incumbency, former Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan awarded a maritime security contract to Government Ekpomupolo and his militant security firm. Ekpomupolo and his militant organization were considered to be extremely corrupt and were designated as the primary facilitators of the oil theft trade in the Niger Delta region. However, after the Buhari administration took power in 2015, Buhari voided the maritime contract and indicted Ekpomupolo on forty counts of fraud. Ekpomupolo went into hiding and the Niger Delta Avengers began to initiate a series of sabotage campaigns against the Chevron oil structures with the Niger Delta region in 2016. Due to the large success of the Niger Delta Avengers operations, Nigeria’s annual output of crude oil decreased from its potential capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day to 1.4 million barrels per day. As a consequence of the high influx of oil pipeline sabotage in the Niger Delta, oil spills have “devastated mangroves, contaminated soil and groundwater, destroyed the fish habitat, and posed a serious threat to public health.” = Resident oil company authorities = The complexities and dangers involved with oil theft methods such as hot-tapping and cold-tapping provide that expert knowledge is necessary for successfully implementing these measures. Consequently, resident oil company authorities from the multinational oil corporations stationed in the oil sector regions of Nigeria hold an influential role in facilitating oil theft at the crude oil stage. In addition to providing technical expertise and managing oil withdrawal operations, oil experts offer inside knowledge on the schedule of corporate inspection operations on the pipelines. This is critical for ensuring that illegal secondary pipelines stay intact and that the location of fueling operations are not revealed to Nigerian security forces and multinational corporate authorities. = Local population = The general population that surrounds the variety of oil pipelines throughout Nigeria often facilitates the local creation and sale of illegally refined oil products as means of alleviating their impoverished condition. Although it is common in the Nigerian population to use small-scale oil tapping to obtain a collection of crude oil reserves, their lack of technical expertise and the refinement of acquired crude oil reserves in rudimentary bush refineries have contributed significantly to the development of pollution in Nigeria. In addition to oil pipeline leakages from small-scale tapping, the JTF's anti-refinery and illegal oil market operations have led to the uncontrolled destruction of illegal crude oil reserves. Given the simple construction of bush refineries and their placement in isolated locations, all efforts by the JTF to mitigate the illegal refinement of oil products have largely been futile. In September 2018, the unemployment rate in Nigeria had reached up to 23%. Consequently, in tandem with the high unemployment rate, the pollution of waterways and the contamination of local fish populations have forced many young Nigerians to partake in oil theft and illegal refinery activities.  Future  Although there is considerable acknowledgement of the extensive involvement of a wide group of participants in the Nigerian oil theft trade, the network of protection that the Nigerian political elite and security forces provide to lower-level participants perpetuates the existence of the trade. In addition, the profitability of crude oil products and the lack of government oversight in the supervision of the vast oil pipeline fields serve as incentives for Nigerian officials and members of the local population to partake in the sale of stolen petroleum products. Similarly, the lack of social welfare in Nigeria, the high poverty rate, and poor governance are elements that foster a positive environment for oil theft operations. Given the development of the Niger Delta Avengers and Buhari's failure to remove corruption from the Nigerian government, large-scale political corruption serves as the protective mechanism that allows efforts in oil theft to persist.

This tour was not only political but also a social commentary connecting Brazil and Angola through music as well as through pop-culture. Brazilian performers were invited to tour Angola, performing as an act of solidarity to the communist party during the Angolan Civil War. The tour took place in the cities Luanda, Lobito, and Benguela. All of the more than 60 performers and artists supported the MPLA in their fight for independence; many singing about anti-colonial struggles through Semba. Map indicating where Angola and Brazil are located  Brazil- Angola relations  Brazilian performers intended to connect Afro-Brazilians to their African ancestry and inspire a conversation about the African diaspora through Semba and pop-culture. Afro-Latinos were some of the first in Brazil to \\"rediscover\\" Africa, focusing on the cultural diffusion from the transatlantic slave trade. Angolan civilians at the time were also reclaiming their cultural autonomy, describing their nationalist sentiments as Angolanidade. The Kalunga Project was able to provide an avenue for Brazilian supporters to express their sentiments while still connecting with Angolans as part of a community through diaspora. It is said that more than half of the African people who were transported to Brazil from Angola were from Luanda, making the Angolanidade movement that much stronger. Part of connecting to Angola was through Samba, a popular style of dance in both Brazil and Angola. = Semba = Reputable school in Brazil practicing Semba Brazilian dance is strongly connected to Angolan roots. Semba originated in Angola, but was brought to Brazil by African people during the transatlantic slave trade. Semba, known as Samba in Brazil, currently plays a large role, with many reputable schools of Samba showcasing their talents each year at Carnaval. Samba can be traced back because of its patterns in Semba, specifically with the “Umbigada” component. Umbigada is when a dancer interacts with another dancer through an expression of naval touching that can be translated as a belly bump. Musicians that were part of the Kalunga Project played mainly semba music with lyrics that advocated for workers' rights, communism, and freedom. This use of semba music was a way to reconnect their Afro-Latinx roots to Angola. Maracatu dance that uses the term 'Kalunga' otherwise known as 'Calunga'.  Origin of the name 'Kalunga Project'  The name Kalunga was considered by the main producer of the project, Fernando Faro. He had remembered the term in reference to Maracatu dolls Mario de Andrade referenced in his essay “Sorcery Music in Brazil”. However, upon conferring with a colleague from Luanda, he realized that the term ‘Kalunga’ actually represents love, death, and the sea.  Artists involved with the 'Kalunga Project'  Chico Buarque was an artist from the 1970s who used his music to spotlight issues of the government and to advocate for the working class. In certain songs such as “construção”, he talks about the problems of the working class and of the despair that follows. It was because of his activism through music and his beliefs on freedom and communism that he was invited to lead the project to Angola. He along with other artists aimed to create a connection between Angola and Brazil through music, culture, and solidarity. Another musician, Martinho da Vila, spoke about his experiences when traveling through Angola. He gave a speech while at his first venue, in which he said “I am Brazilian and I am realizing my great dream, which is to tread on this African soil. I was very moved to be here in Angola, perhaps the land of my great- grandparents. There in Brazil today marks the 150th anniversary of our independence. I hope, when I come back here, to find a country also free.” The concerts they had were wildly successful and when it came time for the audience to leave they stalled as long as they could, prompting repression and imprisonment from the Portuguese police (PIDE). According to Martinho, the concerts allegedly inspired many of the audience, especially seeing people residing in Brazil who desired for the people in Angola to have freedom from colonial powers. This incendiary message was a large reason that the government censured many of these musicians and their trip to Angola. This was a time during the cold war in which the government of Brazil condemned the trip and officially chose not to recognize it for fear of backlash. Other artists included Edu Lobo, Dorival Caymmi, Clara Nunes, Rui Guerra, and Fernando Faro.

Under the 2014 Constitution, Article 94, Egypt is established as a state ruled by the law. In Article 95, the Constitution establishes that punishment is determined by the laws of the land. The Penal Code is the supreme legal document concerning crime and punishment. The code was widely influenced by France, and continuously shaped by the British legal system. The most recent version of the Penal Code is from 1937.  History  The origins of the Egyptian penal code date back to the period of time known as the Pharaonic Era or Ancient Egypt. During this era, justice and the law were key elements of society. The powers in the justice system were assigned by the king and followed a hierarchy. In the Pharaonic Era, common law and judicial precedent were main sources of criminal law and procedure with the presence of some written law. A set of rules and laws that had historical relevance in the development of the Egyptian criminal law and procedure was the Code of Hammurabi, created in 1754 BCE by the Babylonian King, Hammurabi. This code relied heavily on the principles of revenge, and used the idea of \\"self-protection\\" as justification for retaliation and punishment. A final historical aspect that shaped the Egyptian Penal Code is the presence of Sharia Law (Islamic Law.) Sharia Law was and still is widely used across Arab countries as a method of criminal law. After many decades, Egypt abandoned Islamic law and replaced it with positive law. The following are important codes that represent majorbro changes leading to the adoption and use of the current penal code. = Othman Penal Code of 1858 = Egypt was under the rule of the Ottoman Empire from 1517 to 1867. The empire decided to create a new penal code after observing the passing of the French Penal Code of 1810. The French Code of 1810 was a source, but the code of 1858 was most closely adapted from the French Penal Code of 1832. The code of 1858 is relevant because it started the separation between religion and the law. Sharia law (Islamic law) was abandoned and the new penal code moved to a more legal frame. In the code, there are notable differences, the first pages presents a rough classification of different types of crimes and their punishments, something that has not been seen before. The Othman Penal Code of 1858 was widely used by Arab Countries under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. This penal code remained as the guide for criminal law until almost the end of the empire. Additionally, it served as a foundation for the creation of new penal codes in Arab Countries including Egypt. = Egyptian Penal Code of 1904 = Even before Egypt separated from the Ottoman Empire and became an independent state, it had already started passing its own laws and procedures. Egypt continuously developed new laws and adjustments to the legal system including the penal code. The element that led to criminal law reform was the creation of mixed courts. Mixed courts had shared jurisdiction on civil and criminal matters. French influence and their legal reform in 1883 pushed criminal law reform in Egypt. In 1904, a new penal code with extensive was put in place. It drew from past codes and codes from other countries. The new code specified criminal law and criminal procedure for the Arab Republic of Egypt. = The Egypt Draft Penal Code of 1919 = The draft of the Penal Code of 1919 came to life following the orders of Lord Kitchener. A first commission reviewed the code currently in place, which was the Penal Code of 1904. A second commission was in charge of drafting the changes. Although changes were intended to be made starting in 1914, those were not possible given the circumstances of World War I. The changes made to the code were widely influenced by the comparative analysis with other codes from different countries including India, Italy, and Switzerland. The motivation behind the changes was modernization and to fix existing errors. The original penal code was based on the French Code of 1883. Given the growing influence of Great Britain, the commission decided to adept the code closer in line with English Criminal Law. The draft was divided into four parts dealing with different types of offenses, and it increased the number of articles. The code was available in French, English, and Arabic. A prominent change in the code was the abolition of the minimum penalties and advocacy to change death penalty judgments to corrective sentences. Although the code was never officially published, the changes made on the draft are reflected on the current penal code. = Egyptian Penal Code of 1937 (Current Version) = After years of reforms, amendments and changes, in August of 1937, the parliament of Egypt voted and passed the Egyptian Penal Code of 1937, which has been continuously amended and still remains in place. This penal code heavily relies on the principle of legality. This means that the law is the highest ranking authority regarding any criminal issues. The penal code becomes the most important guide in dealing with criminal acts and punishment. This penal code is divided in four broad sections called \\"Books\\" which have subdivisions that address specific topics. The code is addressed in terms of articles that explain all the provisions in detail. The code explains jurisdiction in terms of people, location, and courts. This means which people are subject of the rule of the code, where can their crimes be prosecuted, and which courts are in charge of specific issues and matters. The code explains types of crimes and their category. The penal code also explains the procedure of prosecution of crimes.  Structure  The Penal Code in Egypt is divided into four broad books, subsequently divided into different parts and overall contains a total of 395 Articles. It also includes an order from the prime minister and deputy from 1992. A general outline of the code is as follows: * Book One: General Provisions  Part 1: General Rules  Part 2: Types of Crimes  Part 3: Penalties  Part 4: Complicity of Several Person In One Crime  Part 5: Attempt  Part 6: Criminal Agreements  Part 7: Recidivism  Part 8: Conditional Execution of Rulings  Part 9: Permissibility Causes And Penalty Preventives  Part 10: Juvenile Delinquent  Part 11: Remission of Sentence And Comprehensive Remission * Book Two: Felonies and Misdemeanors Prejudicial to The Public Interest And Their Penalties.

Criminal law is a branch of law used by a country to determine punishment for those committing acts that the state deems detrimental for the wellness of society. The Egyptian penal code is not the only source of criminal law; other sources include the bills passed by the legislature, the judiciary, the executive, and scholars. The purpose of the state is to protect its citizenry. Based on that principle, the state has the right to punish those who commit acts that negatively affect society and in doing so violate the law. Criminal law determines which acts are considered unacceptable and their respective punishments. The underlying purpose of punishment is deterrence. This works as a mechanism of prevention from future actions by the people. Criminal law started as a way to maintain peace between groups of people. Throughout history, it evolved and shaped in different forms. In some periods of time it was understood as a form of vengeance and retaliation. Later, it evolved as a form to fix problems in society. Most recently, it has been accepted as a mechanism to make amends and bring peace. Currently, criminal law has evolved into a form of protection for the citizenry and as a way to maintain the peace of the state. In Egypt, criminal law has gone through a similar pattern of development. Egypt is different from other parts of the world due to its location as a meeting point between the West and East.

The work-up for diagnosis is complex and the condition can be over-diagnosed. People diagnosed with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (WAIHA) caused by immunoglobulin G (IgG) may also have a high number of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. These antibodies are active at room temperature, but are believed to be harmless since they are not the main antibodies responsible for WAIHA. However, studies revealed the existence of a few cases of WAIHA that may also carry cold agglutinin antibodies that are active at the environment where the temperatures is generally equal to or warmer than 30 °C (86 °F). Such coexistence suggests a diagnosis of the mixed (warm- and cold-antibody) autoimmune hemolytic anemia abbreviated as MAIHA. Mixed warm and cold AIHA runs a chronic course with severe intermittent exacerbations, such as serious anemia, and is treated by blood transfusion. Successful therapeutic options for the treatment of hemolysis associated with mixed AIHA are limited but increasing. In the past, there were two obvious sources of error regarding the diagnosis of AIHA. First, patients with w-AIHA can produce low-titer, low-thermal amplitude CA of no clinical significance.

It sought to end ongoing conflict and had far-reaching implications for regional peace. The Luanda Agreement became a baseline for peace accords in Africa and is viewed favorably by outside entities, such as the United Nations and the European Union.  History  The agreement was signed in 2002 between the governments of Uganda and the DRC. It established a ceasefire and normalized relations between the two countries. Prior to this agreement, the two countries experienced prolonged periods of armed conflict. While this agreement sought to rebuild regional stability, it is questionable as to whether lasting peace/reconstruction followed. The conflict in the Congo has been called the \\"center of Africa's world war\\". While DRC gained independence in the 1960s, it was accompanied by civil war. The initial conflict was brief, but a longer and bloodier struggle followed. In 1997, the First Congo War began, followed by the Second Congo War in 1998. Several other African countries became involved.  Relations between Uganda and the DRC  The relationship between Uganda and the DRC was plagued by violence for decades. Uganda has been plundering the DRC of valuable minerals since the 1990s. The relationship is complicated by the ADF, a rebel group that attacked Western Uganda from the early 1990s well into the 2000s. Uganda President Yoweri Museveni blamed the DRC and the UN for the group's continued existence.  International Court of Justice  The Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement was a peace treaty to end the Second Congo War. All military operations were to halt and actions were to be taken to show respect for human rights and reconcile the relations among Angola, DRC, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe) in 1999. The International Court of Justice deemed this agreement a modus operandi rather than a legally binding agreement. The ICJ's treatment of the agreement is thought to have broader implications, because \\"the ICJ's authority in the interpretation of international law is likely to influence the perception of the parties to armed conflicts with regard to legal nature and effects of peace agreements...it threatens to undermine the crucial role of peace agreements in the resolution of armed conflicts.\\" The interpretation of the Lusaka agreement thereby set a precedent that undermined the legal authority of the Luanda Agreement. The Luanda Agreement is a bilateral agreement that directly alters the terms of the Lusaka Agreement. However, both agreements call for the explicit consent of the DRC to allow Ugandan troops on their land. This then led to multiple disputes within the ICJ between Uganda and the DRC. In 1999, the DRC filed three claims asserting that Uganda violated international laws: Uganda filed three counter claims: (1) the DRC used force against Uganda, (2) the DRC allowed attacks on Ugandan diplomatic premises and personnel in Kinshasa in violation of the law of diplomatic protection and (3) the DRC violated the 1999 Lusaka Agreement. The court ruled that Uganda had violated DRC's territorial integrity and that Uganda was an occupying power, but granted Uganda's argument that the DRC had violated Ugandan diplomatic protection.  Reaction  The European Union issued a statement applauding the Luanda Agreement as a mechanism to aid peace efforts. However, the EU also recognized that the continued fighting among the Congolese people as a reason for Uganda to continue to protect people through its presence.

Biography  Born in Madrid circa 1937, to a humble family, son of a butcher (father) and a greengrocer (mother), Matanzo managed a butcher's shop. A member of People's Alliance since 1977 he was elected to the City Council of Madrid for the first time in the 1983 municipal election. Re-elected in the 1987 election, after the 1989 successful motion of no confidence against the then Mayor, Juan Barranco, who was replaced by Agustín Rodríguez Sahagún, Matanzo became the city councillor responsible for the Centro District. During a controversial rule, he became singularly known by his authoritarian measures; closing down stores and launching razzias against street vending.; Matanzo was sacked from the municipal government board by the Mayor José María Álvarez del Manzano in 1993, after a clash with the Culture's councillor Pedro Ortiz, since Matanzo had decreed the shutting of the Teatro Alfil, as it was the premises where a theatrical play, Cabaret Castizo, was being aired since 5 January. The Eduardo Fuente's play, starred in three characters: a talking bear, an arbutus, and a sheriff (performed by Chete Lera) making the later a parody out of Matanzo.; ; He was replaced as responsible for the Centro District by María Antonia Suárez. After two years in political ostracism, during which he was degraded to the (unmeaningful) role of \\"Mayor's provisions consultant\\", Matanzo left the People's Party in 1995. Matanzo would then get involved in several political initiatives: he joined the Dr. Alfonso Cabezas's Platform of the Independents of Spain (PIE) in 1995, running first in the PIE list for the May 1995 municipal election. In 1997 he became a member of the national council of the Spanish Democratic Party (PADE), led by the also former PP politician Juan Ramón Calero. He ran again as candidate in the 1999 municipal election, leading the list of the far-right Alianza por la Unidad Nacional, founded by Ricardo Sáenz de Ynestrillas. He died on 5 March 2017 in Pozuelo de Alarcón.  Matanzo in popular culture  Matanzo is mentioned by one of the characters of the 'Historias del Kronen novel (upon which the 1995 namesake film is based on).

Biography Tseitlin graduated from Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1901, where he studied with Leopold Auer. He then went to study with Eugène Ysaÿe in Brussels, and worked as a concertmaister in Orchestre Collone in Paris before returning to Russia in 1906. There in Moscow he first worked as an orchestra leader in Zimin Opera, and from 1908 till 1917 as a concertmaster in Serge Koussevitzky’s symphony orchestra. From 1918 to 1920 he taught at the Institute of Music and Drama, and from 1920 until the end of his life he was a professor and later a head of one of the violin departments at Moscow Conservatory. It was on Tseitlin’s initiative that Persimfans, the first ever symphony orchestra without a conductor, was formed. Tseitlin carefully selected instrumentalists for the new orchestra. The first desk of the first violins consisted of Tseitlin himself as a concertmaister and Abram Yampolsky as his deputy. The first desk of the second violins was represented by Dmitri Tsyganov (of the Beethoven Quartet) and Konstantin G. Mostras. This orchestra played an important role in Moscow's musical life during the group’s existence from 1922 to 1932. The soloists performed with Persimfans included Sergei Prokofiev, Joseph Szigeti, Vladimir Horowitz and Carlo Zecchi. The orchestra published its own monthly magazine. In the late-1940s early-1950s Tseitlin suffered a devastating effect of the Russian antisemitic campaign, when he was stripped of his head of the department status and wasn't given new students for the last few years of his conservatory tenure. As a teacher, Tseitlin raised a number of famous violinists. His students included Mark Zatulovsky, Boris Fishman, Avet Ter-Gabrielyan, Boris Belenky, Alexei Gorokhov, Samuil Furer and Boris Goldstein.

The series follows a cantankerous, aging demon slayer who has nothing left to lose. Burdened by his “Chosen One” status and backed by a team of specialists he can't relate to, Gary struggles to keep interest in the Earth-saving duty he never asked for and doesn't want. The first season is directed by Mark Little and Louis Solis, and is primarily written by Little and Stephanie Kaliner. The voice cast includes Little as Gary, Kayla Lorette as Leslie, Kyle Dooley as Hanley, Marito Lopez as Marito, and Miguel Rivas in various roles.  Premise  The series opens on aging Gary as he chases what he thinks is his last demon. After a disappointing failed capture resulting in him injuring an innocent homeless boy, Gary returns to the Demon Ministry to attend his own retirement party - his second retirement party in thirty years since Chosen One status is only meant to last fifteen years. Shortly after an underwhelming retirement speech his boss, Leslie, reveals to him that they've once again failed to find his replacement, and she asks him to serve one more term as Chosen One - which would mean fighting until he turns 60. The show revolves around Gary's adventures in demon hunting while also dealing with the frustration of being unable to retire.  Production  = Improvisation = Improvisation plays a heavy role in recording the show, and the final product is a marriage of the script and improvisation. The creative team has said that they include as many improvisers in recording as possible. = Animation = Animation director Louis Solis has said that the team used Flash to animate the show, saying that it provides the best way to capture the improvisational spirit of the show.

He is full professor at the Polytechnical Institute of Bordeaux. In 2003 he founded the Institut de Cognitique and directed it for six years. In 2009 he founded the Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Cognitique ENSC, a French national engineering school and a research center in applied cognitive sciences and cognitive technology. Early career Claverie obtained his PhD in human neurosciences in 1983 at the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon (France) and received two HDR (Accreditation to supervise researches) in 1987, as Doctor es sciences and as Doctor es letters and human and social sciences at the University of Bordeaux II. He is a graduate of Psychology with a license in General Psychology (1978), a diploma in advanced studies in Psychological sciences and education (1980) obtained at the University of Bordeaux II. He holds a master's degree in clinical and pathological psychology oriented towards neuropsychology and is the director of a university diploma of medicine specialization in neuropsychological sciences at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Bordeaux. He was appointed university professor by decree on September 1, 1992 (decree of February 1, 1993, p.2050), and he acceded to the academic position of exceptional class on 2011. Career He is a Senior Research Scientist at IMS, a CNRS laboratory (UMR-5218) located at Bordeaux University. He is known for his work in cognitive psychophysiology during the first part of his career as Medicine professor at the University of Bordeaux II. During his tenure as Director of ENSC, he became known for his work on explainable AI and on Human enhancement. Claverie is a senior member of the Maison des Sciences de l’Homme d’Aquitaine MSHA. He is the author or co-author of more than 100 scientific papers (1980-today), chapters and books. He has been the director of 16 PhD theses and has given more than 40 scientific and public guest lectures and conferences. He became a senior expert for cognitive sciences and interdisciplinary research for the French Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research and Innovation. He collaborates with industry groups in the aerospace industry. His current research focuses on augmented collaborative work and on the human dimension of AI enhancement in human-machine teaming. Ideas and theoretical positions Bernard Claverie advocates a “humanistic approach” to cognitive technologies. In particular, he sets Artificial Intelligence in an evolutionary perspective as an extra-corporal extension of human cognition, that is a mere enhancement instrument. He opposes the idea of possible future autonomy for machines. His work on intra-cerebral psychophysiology has convinced him that the idea of a simple connection between technology and thought, without the brain as a biological interface was inconsistent. Inspired by Nicholas Agar, he recently developed an inventory of ethical positions in augmentation technology, organized into sealed compartments ('individual health', 'progress for humanity', 'sustainable environment', 'post-liberal position for the future'). Each of these categories is then modulated by a continuum of positions, i.e. neo-lludism, regulation, “laissez-faire”, liberal, market-oriented approach, the defense of any of these positions leading to dogmatism, thorough misunderstandings and conflicts with those in favor of another one. Inspired by his own academic background, deeply influenced by (French-origin) structuralism and cybernetics, he promotes a scientific and reasonable constructivism for the future of humanity. Bernard Claverie has supervised some twenty doctoral theses on psychology, cognitive sciences, and neuroscience engineering. Selected works Claverie, B., Le Bars, D., Zavialoff, N., Dantzer, R.

AppSheet was acquired by Google in January 2020.Ron Miller, \\"Google acquires AppSheet to bring no-code development to Google Cloud\\", TechCrunch, January 14, 2020 Platform The AppSheet platform allows users to create mobile apps from cloud-based spreadsheets and databases. Apps can also be created directly as an add-on from spreadsheet platforms like Google Sheets. The platform is available from both a self-service model and a corporate licensing model for larger organizations with more governance, data analytics, and performance options. Compared to low-code development platforms which allow developers to develop with faster iteration cycles, AppSheet is a no-code platform which allows business users familiar with basic spreadsheet and database operations to build apps. AppSheet compatible data sources include: * Google Sheets * Google Forms * Microsoft Excel on Office 365 * Microsoft Excel on Dropbox * Microsoft Excel on Box (company) * Smartsheet * Salesforce * DreamFactory * Microsoft SQL Server * MySQL * PostgreSQL * Amazon DynamoDB Features AppSheet Platform = Data Capture = AppSheet apps capture data in the form of images, signatures, geolocation, barcodes, and NFC. Data is automatically synced to the cloud-based, or users can opt to manually sync the data at any time. Common uses for data capture include field or equipment inspections, safety inspections, reporting, and inventory management. = Data Collaboration = Synced, shared data allows users to collaborate across mobile or desktop devices. Workflow rules can also be used to trigger notifications or work-based assignments where appropriate. Offline access is also possible as data storage is localized to the device and synced upon internet connectivity returns. = Data Display = AppSheet data can be displayed in graphical and interactive formats. Common data views include tables, forms, maps, charts, calendars, and dashboards. Each app can hold multiple views consisting of data from various sources. = Declarative Programming Model = AppSheet's platform allows users to declare the logic of the app's activity in order to customize the app's user experience rather than use traditional code. This level of abstraction essentially trades a granular level of customization that would be available through hard code for increased efficiency, scalability, and security that would be available through a declarative model. Security Data is stored on a user's device and the user's existing cloud-based storage system. When users sync their app, changes they make are sent to the AppSheet web service over an encrypted protocol (HTTPS). AppSheet then applies the changes to the backend spreadsheet (on Google Drive, Dropbox, etc). The latest version of the spreadsheet or database is read (from Google Drive, Dropbox, etc) and sent back to the mobile app. AppSheet's platform is also verified as SOC2 compliant. History AppSheet was originally founded by Praveen Seshadri in March 2014 after several months of developing the product at his home in Seattle, Washington. In 2015, AppSheet received seed funding from New Enterprise Associates. In 2018, AppSheet was recognized by TiE as a Tie50 award recipient recognizing innovative tech startups. In 2018, AppSheet launched SPEC, a natural-language programming tool allowing non-coders to build apps by asking users in plain English what they want to build.

Recommendations  The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations for gestational weight gain are based on body mass index (BMI) of women prior to pregnancy. However, early first trimester BMI appears to be a valid proxy for pre-conception BMI. BMI is split up into four categories: underweight (<18.5 kg/m^2), normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m^2), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m^2), and obese (≥30.0 kg/m^2). The IOM has recommended the ranges of weight gain to be 12.5–18 kg, 11.5–16 kg, 7-11.5 kg, and 5–9 kg respectively. That is, the smaller the BMI pre pregnancy, the more weight a woman is expected to gain during her pregnancy.  Contributing factors  Excessive GWG has been shown to adversely affect maternal and baby health postpartum. Only a little over a quarter of women have adequate GWG, meaning that their weight gain during pregnancy falls within the IOM recommended range. A little less than a quarter of women have inadequate GWG. However, excessive GWG is the most prevalent occurring in around half of pregnant women. = Pre-pregnancy BMI = Having a higher BMI pre-pregnancy may leave you at a greater risk for excessive gestational weight gain and ultimately for cardio-metabolic diseases prenatally and postpartum. = Food access = Food security is defined as consistent access, geographically or financially, to sufficient, nutritious, and affordable food and has been theorized to be a cause of excess gestational weight gain. Women that only have access to fast food, for example, would be considered to be \\"lower food security\\", and these women might be more likely to suffer from excess gestational weight gain because the food available is cheap, but high in calories. Having access to affordable and nutritious food has been linked to a lesser risk of impaired glucose tolerance. which is related to excess gestational weight gain. It is not uncommon for there to be a correlation between socioeconomic status and food security; that is, women of low socioeconomic status have been reported to have low food security, particularly in terms of the affordability of nutritious food. Some women of low socioeconomic status claim that they feel pressure to eat more during pregnancy out of the fear that they are not providing their babies with enough food. With low food security, these women would consume high calorie food in significant quantities, potentially leading to excess gestational weight gain. There seems to be a negative correlation between food security and excess gestational weight gain that is sometimes related to socioeconomic status. = Expectations = Overweight and obese women are significantly more likely to expect excessive gestational weight gain compared with normal-weight women, and women who report expecting to gain excessively are three times more likely to actually gain excessively than those who expect to gain within the guidelines. = Income = Regardless of a relation to food security, having a low income might also predispose women to excess gestational weight gain, yet the reasoning is unclear. One possibility is related to stress. Financial stress has been shown to be positively correlated with levels of CRP postpartum, a stress hormone associated with weight gain most likely because people eat increasingly unhealthy when stressed. Women with a higher monthly budget for food may have a healthier gestational weight gain, while those with less money allocated for food may be more likely to experience excessive gestational weight gain. However, the opposite may also be true: wealthier women may be more likely to suffer from excess gestational weight gain. Women in wealthy communities have been reported to have higher postpartum weight retention than those in more poverty, and since women who have excessive gestational weight gain are more likely to retain weight postpartum women in less poverty might be more likely to have excess gestational weight gain. This suggests that a greater household income does not necessarily provide protection against excess gestational weight gain. = Race/ethnicity = Race/ethnicity is an important variable to take into account when discussing gestational weight gain because women of racial/ethnic minorities demonstrate disproportionately higher obesity levels than non-Hispanic white women. The IOM guidelines were created from data mostly consisting of white women, and thus may not be an appropriate measure for women of other races/ethnicities. African American women in general may have higher postpartum cardio-metabolic risk and more excess gestational weight gain than Latina women, who in turn have more than white women. However, this is not always the case. One study reported that although African American women are more likely to be overweight or obese pre-pregnancy, they were less likely to have excessive weight gain than white women in one study. = Poverty = Even though in many areas in the United States, there has been a decline in inequality on the basis of race/ethnicity, there still exists disproportionate social stratification. Racial/ethnic minorities, such as blacks and Latinos, are more likely to be found in neighborhoods high in poverty. African American women in poverty have been seen to have significantly higher postpartum cardio-metabolic risk than wealthier African American women, which could be partially related to these impoverished women having excess gestational weight gain. White women in poverty, on the other hand, had excess gestational weight gain and higher postpartum cardio-metabolic risk than the white women with higher incomes. This was also true for Latina women in poverty compared to those wealthier. The information regarding how race/ethnicity affects experience of excess gestational weight gain can be related to poverty levels, and the data available is limited and variable.

Description In September 1975 a bomb exploded in her classroom. A few days before the coup, in February 1976, Hansen's house blew up with another bomb. At the end of 1976,while she was at home with her three children and another person,Eduardo Carafa who was an engineer, and came there for legal works. the Army stopped her car while she wants to go out with her family early in the morning. They were taken in assault cars. They were left her three children in the yard. The oldest was 10 years old at that time. At the Police Headquarters they entered through San Lorenzo Street, and the Fiat that brought it turned left, until it reached the corner of Dorrego. She was bandaged, taken to a place in the clandestine detention center of the Information Service Where she heard crafa's screamed and his torture who was released after 20 days with broken ribs and her eyes damaged by the electric prod. Olga was questioned among others, the police inspector Rosario Agustín Feced and José Rubén Lofiego (known as the blind man), who was the one who armed the information. They put her in a hallway. She spent several days in that place, where she constantly listened to how she was tortured. A few days later, after several interrogations, they went to the basement. At that moment they released her sight. Her eyes burned, because the bandages had been made with posters that were painted with lime. =Solidarity between peers= The women who were there receive it, help it, clean it, contain it. Among others were Ana Maria Ferrari, Graciela Villarreal, Roxana Colombo and Adriana Koatz. They took Ana Ferrari every night, they put her up, a Sergeant Vergara was looking for her and they tortured her, the oppressors were particularly angry with Ferrari. Graciela Villarreal was also terribly tortured. Adriana Koatz, was a student of chemical engineering and was a member of the Peronist University Youth when she was arrested on October 21, 1976 and taken to the Information Service. From there she suffered a string of blows, tortures, vexations. She recalls that she shared captivity in the basement with Ester Fernández, Graciela Villarreal, Ana María Ferrari, Olga Cabrera Hansen, among others. Among men she remembers Pérez Risso and Piccolo. She was then referred to Villa Devoto where her father gave her the news that her sister Edith Graciela Koatz had been murdered along with her husband Palmiro Labrador Pérez. After a massive transfer of female detainees to the prisons of Devoto and of men to Coronda, few remained in the basement of the Jefatura. They took them to the Warden. Olga is there until September 1977, without seeing the light or leaving. =The visit of the International Red Cross= It happened in February 1977. When the delegation began to ask, Olga could not contain herself. Everyone was silent but she could not and said everything: \\"No judge knows I'm here, and this is two blocks from the courthouse, we do not see the sun, we do not have visitors, here we just torture and kill people.\\" Afterwards, they told him that he could have left at that moment, but for everything he had said he was going to stay two more years. So it was. Testimony In 2010 began in the Federal Courts, the second oral and public trial for crimes against humanity committed during the last military civic dictatorship in the area of the Great Rosary, in the case known as Diaz Bessone (ex \\"Causa Feced).DIAZ BESSONE The case \\"Díaz Bessone\\" has as imputed a soldier and five civilians, who are accused of carrying out the repression in the clandestine center of the Information section of the Police Headquarters, considered the most important that worked in the city. in the cause are the former commander of the Second Army Corps, Ramón Díaz Bessone, and former policemen Rubén Lofiego, Mario Marcote, Ramón Vergara, José Scortechini and Ricardo Chomicky, the heart of the repressive apparatus that acted under the orders of the deceased former head of the Rosario Police, Agustín Feced. In November 2010, Olga testified in front of the Federal Oral Court: she was not another witness, but someone who embodies the very history of the cause that investigates State terrorism in the region. He recalled that the then chaplain of the police, Eugenio Zitelli, defended the torture in front of detainees. In general, they had all been raped, since it was a systematic practice of the detention center and he recalled that some of the compañeras who were Catholic, asked for spiritual assistance, were frightened by what the priest told them. He justified torture as something to obtain information, but the violation if it outraged him, said that it was immoral. In January 1977, the door opened and María Inés Luchetti de Bettanín arrived with a newborn baby, for whom neither I even had clothes. Among the detainees they made an improvised trousseau with pieces of their own clothes. In addition to pointing to Feced and Lofiego, Olga remembered the presence of Ramón Rito Vergara, aka the Sergeant, in the basement of the SI. In a train to unveil the network of complicities, he mentioned the close relations between his official defender, Laura Cosidoy and Major Fernando Soria, in charge of the war council simulacra in the Second Army Corps Command. One of the most shocking moments was when she told of a detainee, María de la Encarnación García del Villar de Tapia, who had been terribly tortured. She herself told him a dialogue between Lofiego and Feced when they threw her to the side, after the torments. \\"He saw commander, how women have a degree of tolerance,\\" El Ciego told his superior. He also remembered the Swift workers, among whom there were three pregnant women. From Luisa Marciani, she said she was 40 years old, she was full term and she felt very bad. Despite the pressure of the detainees, they delayed their attention. Gladis, the daughter of Luisa, 18, who had been tortured to the point of smashing her heels, was also detained there. \\"The warders come, they call her daughter and they say to her: 'Your mom died and the baby is dead too, do not even think about crying.' That was Tita's death.\\" In another eloquent passage of his statement, he described how repression operated on the workers. For example, a whole section of Fader workers was brought in, they were beaten terribly. Some went to Coronda and others ran, but chastened. There were combined actions with Somisa entrepreneurs. He recalled how companies changed the credentials of their workers, updated the photos, and it was those same credentials that led the task forces to kidnap them. The witness also saw the detainees Perez Risso and Piccolo, very hurt. \\"Pérez Risso had a broken arm, and Piccolo had a hole in his head,\\" he said. Activity in the legal field Olga Cabrera Hansen is one of the people who worked most, from the legal field, for the reconstruction of what happened in the Information Service of the Rosario police during the dictatorship, the place where the clandestine detention center was set up largest in the province of Santa Fe and where she was detained. When she was released, in 1978, she was not paralyzed. She approached the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights and began to tie things together, relate relatives of the disappeared with former detainees, to reconstruct the courses in what she called yesterday \\"that sinister puzzle\\". Together with her colleague, Delia Rodríguez Araya, they investigated complaints and gave form to the Feced case, which began in January 1984 in the provincial courts. Until 1979, when she started working at APDH, the agencies limited themselves to receiving requests from relatives and processing habeas corpus that always had negative results. One day, the witness was with Delia, and three young women arrived asking about their sister, María Sol Pérez Losada. \\"Did she suffer from the kidneys?\\" Olga asked. It was like that, then, she told them to go to Buenos Aires to talk to two detainees who had been with her. \\"With that anecdotal fact the entire chain of denunciations began,\\" the lawyer recalled yesterday.

Distinguished Lawyer of the city of Rosario In November 2016, on the premises of the City Council of Rosario, she was declared \\"Distinguished Lawyer of the city of Rosario by Olga Cabrera Hansen, in honor of her vast unwavering career and invaluable contribution in the field of law, striving for the fundamental guarantees of people in any situation and place, actively participating as an advocate for the causes of Humanity carried out in the city of Rosario and their contribution in the CONADEP in the Never More dedicated chapter to the province of Santa Fe and in particular to the city of Rosario\\".9 She was accompanied by her three children, Julián, Amarai and Martín Cochero. Thanking her, after remembering her husband, a comrade in struggle who was also imprisoned and had to carry out an internal exile, and to remember the suffering her children went through, she assured that the struggle for human rights and justice is still \\"not finished.\\" Who else?

All of them were detained by the military dictatorship. Theirs are only five voices among many others, but they have the double peculiarity of expressing the harsh reality of the forced disappearance of people while it was suffered by women, while arming a referential web where the same names of victims are crossed and victimizers, beginning the clarification of the destinies of the disappeared and the responsibilities of their murderers and torturers. > The crimes they narrate happened a few meters from where we heard them, > almost flush with the tiles, sitting or lying on the floor, with the city > and the trees around.

Liebesny (eds.), Law in the Middle East, Vol. 1: Origin and Development of Islamic Law (Middle East Institute, 1955), p. 204. The office or territory of a nāẓir is a nazirate.E.g., Abd al-Ghaffar Muhammad Ahmad, Shaykhs and Followers: Political Struggle in the Rufaʿa al-Hoi Nazirate in the Sudan (Khartoum University Press, 1974). According to al-Qābisī, writing in the tenth century, the pagan ruler of Tadmakka appointed a superintendent, which al-Qābisī calls a nāẓir, from among the Muslims living in his land to oversee them. This was probably a common arrangement in the Sahara and Sahel regions.Michael Brett (1983), \\"Islam and Trade in the Bilād al-Sūdān, Tenth–Eleventh Century A.D.\\", The Journal of African History, 24 (4), 431–40 . The title was used in Egypt for the heads of government departments and agencies before it adopted a modern cabinet system. It was synonymous with inspector, supervisor or controller.See Maya Shatzmiller, Labour in the Medieval Islamic World (Brill, 1994), pp. 155–57, for a list of such positions in the 15th century. In Egypt it may also be used for the directors or managers of commercial enterprises.Richard Hill, A Biographical Dictionary of the Sudan (Frank Cass, 1967), p. xiii. In the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, the title nāẓir al-khuṭṭ was used for the official in charge of a subdivision of a district. Usually he was a tribal head. Nāẓir ʿumūm was a traditional and usually hereditary Sudanese title for the head of a tribal confederation. It was only infrequently recognised by the Anglo- Egyptian government, but it was used for lower-level salaried officials in the Jazīra. As a traditional Sudanese title, nāẓir may be an Arabic rendering of the originally Funj titles mānjil and manfona. One of the nāẓir's duties was to administer uncultivated land (qifār) within the tribal homeland (dār).Jay Spaulding (1979), \\"Farmers, Herdsmen and the State in Rainland Sinnār\\", The Journal of African History, 20 (3), 329–47 .

In his time he was renowned as a legal scholar, teaching students who came from all around Europe. Posthumously, he was well known for his innovative comparative survey, Rerum memorabilium, iam olim deperditarum, that brought attention to the loss of knowledge since the ancient world. Biography Panciroli was born in Reggio Emilia on 17 April 1523, son of the jurist Alberto Panciroli. In his youth he received a humanist classical education and in 1540 he went to Ferrara to study law. He graduated on the 25 October 1547 and held a teaching position in Padua. In 1570 he moved to Turin to teach. He was patronized by the Duke of Savoy, Emmanuel Philibert, teaching in civil law and receiving a very healthy salary of 1000 scudi. Panciroli distinguished himself by introducing his humanistic and historical knowledge into the study of jurisprudence. Near the end of his life he was requested by Pope Gregory XIV and Clement VIII to be the auditor of the Rota, though he refused. Panciroli published many works in his lifetime and many of his unpublished manuscripts, such as the Rerum memorabilium, circulated widely in Europe and became very influential. Aside from the Rerum memorabilium, Panciroli's was an influential and ambitious early history of classical and medieval jurisprudence. Though it was not entirely accurate, it was the most complete history available to a scholar at the time and became very influential in legal circles. Panciroli died in Padova on 5 March 1599. He had a solemn and well attended public funeral. His nephew, Ottavio, wrote a short biography of him in 1637. Rerum memorabilium, iam olim deperditarum The Rerum memorabilium was first commissioned by Panciroli's patron, Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, who commissioned it to show (in Panciroli's words from the book's dedication) \\"the majesty and grandeur, the glory and greatness of [...] the whole universe [...] versed in those secrets\\".:A4 The Rerum memorabilium was first written in Italian, though it wasn't published in its original language until 1612. It was first published and translated into Latin by Panciroli's student, Heinrich Salmuth, in 1599 and 1602. In this version it received most attention, being that Latin was the lingua franca of Europe at the time. The book spread rapidly through Europe. It was translated into French in 1617 by Pierre de la Noue, partially translated into English by Henry Peacham in 1638, and later fully translated in 1715. The Rerum memorabilium attempted to catalogue the wisdom and knowledge that had been lost from ancient civilisations which Panciroli named deperdita (things lost). Notably, this survey focused on (in its deperdita) subjects in natural philosophy, alchemy and medicine that had been lost since from the ancient world, focusing less on immaterial philosophical, institutional and, religious ideas that had been lost. This had a great influential on Renaissance writers as it inspired a rebirth of study into classical works of technology and science, rediscovering this deperdita, in opposition to the Medieval focus on ancient philosophy. According to historian of science Vera Keller, this inspired Renaissance writers like Francis Bacon, Jakob Bornitz and Thomas Hobbes into the study of study desiderata (things wanted) such as immortality and universal language  with much of Pancirola's deperdita appearing on popular seventeenth-century 'wish-lists' of desiderata.

It's part of the Bow Range, which is a sub-range of the Canadian Rockies. The nearest higher peak is Eiffel Peak, to the southwest. Mount Temple is situated immediately northeast of Pinnacle Mountain, with Sentinel Pass as the low point between the two. History The peak was named in 1894 by Walter Wilcox because of large pinnacles on the mountain near Sentinel Pass. by Walter. Wilcox Wilcox wrote of the pinnacles in his 1896 book, \\"Camping in the Canadian Rockies\\": \\"The limestone strata of this mountain were nearly perfectly horizontal, and had been sculptured by rain and frost into an endless variety of minarets, spires, and pinnacles. These, crowning the summits of ridges and slopes with ever changing angles, as though they represented alternating walls and roofs of some great cathedral, all contributed to give this mountain, with its elegant contours and outlines, the most artistically perfect assemblage of forms that nature can offer throughout the range of mountain architecture. On the north side of this mountain, as though, here, nature had striven to outdo herself, there rose from the middle slopes a number of graceful spires or pinnacles, perhaps 200 or 300 feet in height, slender and tapering, which, having escaped the irresistible force of moving glaciers and destructive earthquakes, through the duration of thousands of years, while the elements continued their slow but constant work of disintegration and dissolution, now presented these strange monuments of an ageless past.\\" Three previous attempts had been unsuccessful before the first ascent was made in 1909 by J. W. A. Hickson, with Edward Feuz Jr. and Rudolph Aemmer as guides. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1952 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Like other mountains in Banff Park, Pinnacle Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. The Grand Sentinel is the largest of the pinnacles located on the mountain. This quartzite tower rises 120 metres above the scree slopes on the Paradise Valley side of Sentinel Pass. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Pinnacle Mountain is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20°C with wind chill factors below −30°C.

He graduated from Edinburgh on 27 July 1663. He was licensed to preach the gospel in the year 1673. He was a tutor to the family of George, the Laird of Dunglass of that ilk. He was ordained by presbytery for the adherents in the parish of St. Ninians in 1673. He was elected a schoolmaster to Culross by the magistrates. This led to them being summoned before the Privy Council in 1677. Retreat to Holland After this, the fury of the persecution drove him to Holland for shelter at two different times. Arrest He returned from his second retreat to that country in 1680, and was apprehended about November 1681 in his own house at Borrowstounness, whence he was carried to Blackness Castle the first night, and the next day to the tolbooth of Edinburgh. There he continued a close prisoner till early in the year 1683, when by the orders of the Council he was carried to the Bass Rock for keeping conventicles, for disorderly ordination, and for refusing to engage to live orderly in future. He entered this dungeon in February, 1683; preaching at conventicles was his only crime. Potter was imprisoned in Edinburgh and on the Bass Rock and was only released on 17 March 1685 under Act of Banishment thereby leaving the kingdom. However after remaining quiet at home he gained the liberty granted by King James VII which relieved him from the necessity of obeying the sentence. On release After the Glorious Revolution, he was first minister of Bo'ness from 7 December 1687, and then of Dunblane Cathedral 1692; he was also a member of the assembly that year. He died in 1718 sometime between 28 October and 25 November aged 76. The New Statistical Account lists him as being called to Ecclesmachan in 1693 before he was called to Dunblane. He had a son, Michael, who was first minister at Kippen, and afterwards in 1740 succeeded Mr John Simpson as Professor of Divinity in the University of Glasgow, but did not long fill that chair, having died in November 1743. His granddaughter married James Baine, of the Relief Church.

Of Māori descent, he identified with the Ngāti Mihi and Ngati Kahungunu iwi (tribe). He was born in Frasertown, near Wairoa, Hawkes Bay. Church Missionary Society (CMS) In 1844 James Hamlin, of the Church Missionary Society (CMS), was ordained a deacon and sent to Wairoa. The chiefs of Te Wai- roa district, Pitiera Kopu and Paora Te Apatu, choose Huata to be their leader in the worship of Christianity. From 1856 he attended the Waerenga-a-hika school at the mission of the CMS which had been established by the Rev. William Williams. On 22 September 1861 he was ordained as a deacon by Bishop Williams and he was assigned to the Diocese of Waiapu. He undertook theological study at St. Stephen’s College in Auckland. On 25 September 1864 he was ordained as a priest. He worked as the assistant to the Rev. Hamlin until 1864, then he became the principal minister at Wairoa. In 1865 there were fourteen clergymen - six European and eight Māori - in the Diocese of Waiapu. The Māori were: at Tokomaru, Matiaha Pahewa; at Wairoa, Tamihana Huata; at Turanga, Hare Tawhaa; at Waiapu, Rota Waitoa, Raniera Kawhia and Mohi Turei; at Table Cape, Watene Moeka; at Maketu, Ihaia Te Ahu.

The all-day concert, called Música por Venezuela: Ayuda y Libertad (), was organized by Richard Branson and Bruno Ocampo, and featured over thirty of the best known Latin American artists from nine countries. The concert's slogan was, \\"Let the stars shine for all\\". Venezuela Live Aid's charity page said, \\"Not that long ago, [Venezuela] was the wealthiest country in South America. Now it is facing the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere.\\" The purpose of the concert was to raise money and to pressure Nicolás Maduro to \\"open Venezuela's border so humanitarian aid stockpiled on Venezuela's borders can finally reach those millions who need it the most\\". Donations of US$2.5 million were raised online in the first four days after the concert. The concert was entirely funded through donations, artists performed without charge, and the event itself was free. The concert was livestreamed on the Internet, with the aim to raise funds via website donations. The only webpage authorized for donations was the official website at www.VenezuelaAidLive.com.  Background  El Tiempo explaining the shortages Shortages in Venezuela have occurred since the presidency of Hugo Chávez, with the country experiencing a scarcity rate of 24.7% in 2007. Venezuela has also been suffering a socioeconomic crisis under Nicolás Maduro, as rampant crime, hyperinflation and shortages diminished the quality of life since 2010.   Beginning in 2015, the Maduro government rejected offers of aid, stating that there was no humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and that such claims were only used to justify foreign intervention; his refusal of aid worsened the situation.  The National Assembly of Venezuela declared a \\"health humanitarian crisis\\" in January 2016, given the \\"serious shortage of medicines, medical supplies and deterioration of humanitarian infrastructure\\", asking Maduro's government to \\"guarantee immediate access to (...) essential medicines\\". Near the end of 2018—before the Venezuelan presidential crisis when Juan Guaidó swore an oath to serve as interim president—the Maduro government said aid from other countries would be coordinated through the UN. Reuters reported concerns that the UN funding would be lost to corruption in Maduro's government. After the 2019 presidential crisis, Maduro continued to refuse aid, saying that Venezuela was not a country of \\"beggars\\". Guaidó made bringing humanitarian aid to the hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who could die if aid does not arrive a priority. Cúcuta has become the hub and focal point of the humanitarian aid crisis in Venezuela; in addition to being the site of the concert, it was the main border crossing point for thousands of Venezuelans fleeing their country in the Venezuela–Colombia migrant crisis, and the location where most of the aid was stockpiled. Images of the Tienditas Bridge, joining Colombia and Venezuela at Cúcuta, have come to symbolize the crisis because the \\"Venezuelan government blocked it with shipping containers\\". Due to the migrant crisis, the bridge was never opened after its 2016 completion, and was previously closed with fences and concrete block. Purpose Branson in May 2010 Branson and his friend, Colombian businessman Bruno Ocampo, spoke of Venezuela and their passion for human rights in December 2018. Six weeks later, Branson wrote to Ocampo, inquiring about ways to help Venezuela, and by 30 January, they had made contact with interim president Guaidó and his mentor Leopoldo López. Branson announced on 14 February 2019 that his inspiration to organize the benefit concert was Guaidó and Lopez asking for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Venezuela. The concert was held only three weeks after the four men spoke. Branson said the event was held to raise money for aid in Venezuela, to pressure the government of Nicolás Maduro to allow the humanitarian aid funded by various nations and stored in Cúcuta to be distributed within Venezuela, and to raise awareness of the crisis in Venezuela. He criticized Maduro's regime for refusing aid. The concert's Spanish website listed five general groups in Venezuela which the concert aimed to help: children who go hungry every day, grandparents left to die in the streets due to lack of welfare, parents who work hard and still can't provide, young people unjustly persecuted, and humanity deserving a life in peace. A press release from Venezuela Aid Live said that all money donated to the cause would be given in humanitarian aid to the people of Venezuela. Branson asked for donations to reach \\"$100 million dollars in 60 days\\". The concert was livestreamed on the Internet, with the aim to raise additional funds via website donations. Organizers said the concert was entirely funded through donations, artists were not compensated for performing, and the concert was free. Branson advertised that the concert would be \\"a beautiful concert\\", featuring a \\"fantastic line-up of top Latin American and global artists\\", that would be live-streamed around the world. The Spanish website of the concert featured the story of a young man who watched his mother suffer in pain from cancer, with a highlighted statement that 50% of cancer patients in Venezuela receive no treatment. Organization The concert was modelled after The Concert for Bangladesh and Live Aid. It took place in Cúcuta, a Colombian city near the border with Venezuela, from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. It was originally planned to be held on the San Martín Roundabout, a short distance from the Simon Bolivar International Bridge, but the location was changed to the Tienditas Bridge. Colombian producers were businessmen Ricardo Leyva, and brothers Fernán and Bruno Ocampo. Leyva, who owns a marketing company called Sistole, was brought to the project by Bruno Ocampo, who had never previously organized a concert, and Leyva said they made it a priority to \\"guarantee world class content, with great sound and great production\\". Leyva hired Persival and Árbol Naranja, production companies with experience at producing music concerts. A rotating stage high with 11 sound towers and 400 tons of equipment were installed on the bridge. The rotating stage allowed one musician to be preparing during another's performance. Support for setting up live streaming was provided by YouTube, and WK Entertainment got streaming rights cleared. At least 1,800 local police provided security, and hospital services were on alert. The aircraft flying in musicians and producers were quickly cleared through airports by Colombia, and a civic holiday was declared for the city of Cúcuta on the day of the concert. There were 1,300 journalists accredited to work the event (800 Colombian and 500 international); 1,800 people did logistical work, and 800 volunteers helped as well. = Attendance = Organizers said the space could accommodate up to 500,000 people, while they hoped for about 250,000. The Los Angeles Times and National Radio of Colombia estimated there were more than 200,000 present. Colombia's English-language newspaper and Billboard reported 300,000 or more. Concert organizers said the attendance was 370,000, as reported by CNN en Español. Juan Guaidó defied the restriction imposed by the Maduro administration on him leaving Venezuela, and showed up at the concert. In a move that tested Maduro's authority, he was met by Colombian president Iván Duque, and welcomed by a crowd chanting, \\"Juan arrived!\\" Duque, Chilean president Sebastián Piñera, Paraguayan president Mario Abdo Benítez, and Luis Almagro, Secretary General of the Organization of American States attended. Piñera said he was at the concert to demonstrate solidarity with the people of Venezuela, to help them recover democracy under the leadership of Guaidó, and to support the collection and distribution of humanitarian aid. He described the Maduro government as lacking in respect for human rights and undemocratic, and said that \\"Maduro is part of the problem, not the solution.\\" Benítez expressed confidence that the people of Venezuela, for resisting tyranny, would go down in history, adding that a free Venezuela was close. Juanes, one of the performers, commented that \\"Music and art will always be fundamental in building peace in any society. The world’s atmosphere is more tense now. There’s less innocence and more information online. The presence of the presidents, in a way, changed the humanitarian slant and made it different.\\" = Financial = With a goal to raise US$100 million in 60 days from 22 February, in the first four days, US$2.5 million was raised online, with donations to be accepted through 22 April. Facebook expedited their process for setting up non-profit status, to help get donations in quickly. Ocampo explained that credit card processing was not fully in place at the time of the concert, and that credit card penetration in Latin American is low, but that other donation methods were put in place after the concert. Some musicians were flown to the concert, but none charged to perform; total costs for artists was US$60,000 and the overall cost of the concert was under US$600,000. The main donors were Argos, Betcris and WeSend.  Performers  Most of the 31 performers were Venezuelan and Colombian; they were joined by artists from Argentina, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Spain, Sweden and the United States. Branson joined some on stage. Caterina Valentino, Erika de la Vega, George Harris, Lele Pons, Luis Chataing, , Patricia Velásquez, and Patricia Zavala (all Venezuelans) were announcers, as were , Hannah Stocking, and Juanpa Zurita. Performing artists were: Venezuelan musician Franco de Vita said that he had been told that there was so much interest from musicians that there was no more room and he could not be included; he said it was unfortunate that he was unable to participate, but he encouraged people to donate. The Venezuela Live Aid organization issued a press release, in which they apologized for not being able to accommodate all of the artists who wanted to participate, asked for their understanding, and said they hoped to do more benefit concerts in the future.  Performances During his performance, Bosé said, \\"Enough oppression already. The people shout, united today for their freedom”. He directed comments at Maduro, saying Venezuelans wanted him out now, that he \\"should be captured and accused of crimes against humanity\\", and reminding Maduro that Venezuela does not belong to him and his narcos. He also directed comments at the United Nations Michelle Bachelet, telling her to \\"move your buttocks\\" to come and personally see the situation in Venezuela. He was criticized for his offensive tone and later apologized, saying instead that Bachelet should \\"raise her voice\\". Rubio expressed pride to be present, and thanked Venezuelans for \\"believing that change is possible\\", while Dangond said it was an honor to be able to contribute. Torres said, \\"We are artists united without any political flag and we are here to help the people who need it. It is important to never lower your arms.\\" After Torres performance, Mexican motivational speaker Daniel Habif took the stage to give what Milenio called the \\"most moving moment of the concert\\". Complete text of speech at Infobae. He said \\"this situation is not the death of Venezuela, rather its birth before the world\\". Speaking to a crowd he brought to tears, he said, \\"You, Nicolás [Maduro], rotted before you matured\\", and \\"faith has been activated as a cannon\\". Baute called it a \\"magical day to build bridges of hope ... We want and we demand free elections now\\", adding: \\"We are not only here to open the humanitarian channel, but because tomorrow we will be free.\\" In an emotional moment that brought the crowd to cheers, Nacho began to speak about union, reconciliation and forgiveness, then invited Chyno (Chino) to the stage; they were reunited in support of Venezuela for the first time in two years, since their enmity and separation as the successful duo of Chino & Nacho.  Reception  Colombian singer Shakira shared support for the event Juan Guaidó showed his support to every artist that confirmed their presentation at the Aid Live concert. On the other hand, he characterized the announcement of Maduro's rival concert as a bad joke, saying, \\"... to mock the Venezuelan's people's needs in this way, you have to be very cynical\\" to take Venezuelan food to Colombia during Venezuela's humanitarian crisis. Rolling Stone magazine said the musical production \\"left much to be desired due to technical difficulties, issues with instruments, the overuse of backing tracks and the crowd being excessively far from the stage\\", while acknowledging that Branson had succeeded in bringing world attention to the effort. One of the coordinators involved in the attempts to bring aid shipments into Venezuela, Vladimir Torres, stated that the concert was a \\"beautiful mistake\\"; the Miami Herald reported that less than one percent of the concert goers stayed to help bring aid through the border the day after the concert, and many volunteers who attended were physically drained by the day-long concert. Roger Waters made statements and released a video on Twitter opposing the Venezuela Aid Live concert. He said: \\"The Red Cross and the U.N., unequivocally agree, don’t politicize aid. Leave the Venezuelan people alone to exercise their legal right to self determination.\\" In the video, he says the concert \\"has nothing to do with humanitarian aid at all. It has to do with Richard Branson … having bought the U.S. saying, ‘We have decided to take over Venezuela, for whatever our reasons may be.’ Do we really want Venezuela to turn in to another Iraq or Syria or Libya? I don't and neither do the Venezuelan people.\\" Argentina's Clarín newspaper said earlier in the month that Waters called Venezuela a \\"true democracy\\", and was criticized by his fans for his stance. Branson responded that Waters is one of the few musicians in the world who does not know, with respect to Venezuela, what he is talking about. Branson expanded: \\"He says that it's a democracy, people are not suffering, and it's just not true. Anybody who knows anything about Venezuela should know that that is a load of a rubbish and Venezuelans need help.\\" Colombian singer Juanes, one of the Aid Live performers, was asked what he thought of Waters' statements, and replied that, while he is a great fan of Waters, Waters \\"does not have any idea what is going on in Venezuela. No idea. Him, Sean Penn and everyone who has talked that way, have no idea what they are talking about.\\" Juanes said he joined the Venezuela Aid Live concert \\"to give voice to Venezuelans and what is happening there ... [to] recover their freedom\\". Colombian singer Shakira shared support for the event, stating \\"I join this initiative for the Venezuelan people who are going through one of the most difficult moments in their history, we can not allow the struggle of some politicians and the interests of a few to be above the needs of people\\". Shakira also called for the entry of aid in Venezuela and promoted donations for the event. In an article entitled \\"Eight memorable phrases of Venezuela Aid Live\\" (), National Radio of Colombia (RNC) said that concert-goers enjoyed a sunny day with no significant inconveniences, and highlighted the inspirational words of Carlos Baute twice, Miguel Bosé, Silvestre Dangond, Paulina Rubio, and Diego Torres, in addition to the words of Wendy Villamizar and the speech by motivational speaker Daniel Habif. Use of funds raised Funds raised were to be used for \\"sustainable, effective and transparent\\" humanitarian aid for Venezuela, according to the organizers. The organizers stated that funds would be split between Venezuela and Colombian refugees in Venezuela, and that they would not deliver money to any government or political organization. PricewaterhouseCoopers published a 2020 report on the allocation of funds, stating that no abnormalities were found.  Maduro response  = Alternative concert = A food box provided by CLAP The Maduro government responded by saying it would hold a rival concert on the Venezuelan side of the border at the Simón Bolívar International Bridge on 22 and 23 February, with a proposed slogan of \\"Nothing for war, hands off Venezuela\\". A little more than one day before the planned event, United Socialist Party of Venezuela politician Darío Vivas announced that the location would be changed, and that the event would be held instead at the opposite end of the same bridge as the Venezuela Aid Live Concert, about away. Vivas said, \\"What they do on the other side of the border is their problem ... We will defend our territory.\\" Information Minister Jorge Rodríguez said free medical attention would be given to Colombians and Venezuelans at the event. He also said the government would distribute 20,000 boxes of subsidized food from the Local Committees for Supply and Production (CLAP)—a program from which, according to the Attorney General Luisa Ortega Díaz, Maduro personally profits—to the poor residents of Cúcuta. Estimates of attendance ranged from 1,000 to 2,500 people. Argentine rock band Bersuit Vergarabat took part in the concert, saying \\"Venezuela libre! [Donald] Trump, go away, nobody wants you here!\\" Venezuelan heavy metal rocker also participated. Two days before the concert, the only participant confirmed was Paul Gillman. La Patilla reported that all other singers proposed had turned down the invitation to perform. César Pérez Rossi of Venezuela's Serenata Guayanesa was reported by NTN24 saying that \\"it is totally false that we are going to be in this concert.\\" Colombia's National Radio reported that Las Chicas del Can from the Dominican Republic said statements that they would participate were \\"fake news\\", and asked that their fans spread word on social media to deny the claim. A spokesperson for Colombia's Grupo Niche was reported by LA FM Colombian radio station to have denied the invitation to present, expressing concern about the humanitarian situation in Venezuela. Puerto Rican musician refused a contract to participate in the Maduro concert, saying that he was fortunate to not need the money and that his dignity was more important to him than money, and saying on Instagram that he was \\"not political ... but he is human\\". According to Venezuela al Dia, González' rejection of the contract, saying he does not need the money, was an indication that Venezuela's money was being used to fund the concert; the Venezuela Aid Live Branson concert was funded by donations. Venezuelan musicians gave a quick and emphatic \\"no\\" to the proposal that they participate in the Maduro concert, although La Patilla said they have supported Maduro in the past. Omar Enrique, a Venezuelan singer who according to NTN24 was denied entry into Colombia a few weeks before the concert because of alleged ties to chavismo, rejected what he called United States' \\"military intervention\\" and regretted that other commitments kept him from participating. Pink Floyd's Roger Waters afterwards dedicated a video of him singing \\"We shall overcome\\" () to the Maduro concert. = Censorship and disruption= The day before the Venezuela Aid Live concert, the Colombian government expelled from Cúcuta five agents of Venezuela's internal security and intelligence service, SEBIN, who Colombia said were in the country on an \\"irregular\\" status. A Colombian immigration official said, \\"We are not going to permit foreign citizens entry to our country to affect the social order and peace.\\" According to El Universal, Colombian immigration official, Christian Krüger Sarmiento, said the government of Maduro had a \\"manifest interest\\" in affecting our \\"national security in the face of the events that are about to take place\\". During the Venezuela Aid Live concert, NatGeo and Antena 3 were removed from cable and satellite TV providers in Venezuela for broadcasting the event. During the performances, YouTube was also blocked for users of CANTV, the main internet provider in Venezuela.

Early life and education  James-Chakraborty grew up in Chesapeake Bay. In 1966 she attended Chestertown Elementary, where she was in the first year of desegregation. She spent three semester at a boarding school in New England, where she spent time in a library designed by Louis Kahn. She remained friends with her elementary school teacher, Mrs Wilson, until her death at the age of ninety-one. She earned her bachelor's degree at Yale University in 1982. She earned an MA and PhD at the University of Pennsylvania in 1990. She moved to the University of Minnesota School of Architecture as an Assistant Professor.  Research and career  She served as the Gambrinus Fellow at the Technical University of Dortmund. She was made a Professor of Architecture at University of California, Berkeley from 1993. James-Chakraborty was appointed Professor of Art History at University College Dublin in 2007. She was Head of the School of Art History from 2007 to 2010. She spent the fall semester in 2015 and 2016 at Yale School of Architecture. Her work considers modern art, modernism and nationalism. She has extended the received perspectives of German modernism. James-Chakraborty has investigated the role of women in architecture and design. She also studied the Ruhrgebiet and recent German architecture. In 2016 she arranged the European Architectural History Network, which was held in Dublin Castle. Her 2017 book Architecture since 1400 was a global survey of architecture, described by Murray Fraser as a \\"scintillating overview\\". She is believed to be the first woman to write a global history of architecture. While others have characterized contemporary Berlin’s museums and memorials as postmodern, Kathleen James-Chakraborty argues that these environments are examples of an “architecture of modern memory” that is much older, more complex, and historically contingent. She reveals that churches and museums repaired and designed before 1989 in Düren, Hanover, Munich, Neviges, Pforzheim, Stuttgart, and Weil am Rhein contributed to a modernist precedent for the relationship between German identity and the past developed since then in the Ruhr region and in Berlin. She is involved with the 2019 National Gallery of Ireland exhibition Bauhaus Effects. She serves on the board of the National Museum of Ireland. Professor James-Chakraborty has criticised Ireland's obsession with university rankings, particularly QS rankings and the way in which this skews the allocation of resources. = Awards and honours = 2011 Elected to the Royal Irish Academy * 2018 Royal Irish Academy Gold Medal for Humanities = Publications =    *Conclusion The Kolumba Museum in Cologne, Modernism as Memory : Building Identity in the Federal Republic of Germany. :237-244  References  American architects American art historians Women art historians People from Chesapeake, Virginia Academics of University College Dublin University of California, Berkeley faculty Year of birth missing (living people) Living people ","title":"Kathleen James-Chakraborty"},{"id":"59975855","text":"Ilovica () is a village in the municipality of Bosilovo, North Macedonia.

It was founded in by female professional life models based in London, UK, to create a safe environment in which groups of women could try nude modelling for artists. Subsequently it has staged both mixed-gender and women-only events. Since 2018, Spirited Bodies has been active in campaigning for the use of life drawing as a means to help teenagers overcome social media body confidence issues by challenging the conceptions of conventional beauty.  Origins  The concept of making a safe space to help women liberate themselves through life modelling originally emerged from a conversation between professional life models Morimda Tassembedo, Esther Bunting and Lucy Saunders.  Philosophy  Spirited Bodies creates a space for people to discover the therapeutic value of shedding their inhibitions and seeing themselves in others' art. Their philosophy is that by shedding their clothes, amateur models will also shed their inhibitions and experience physical self- acceptance; baring all as a means of facing their own body issues through posing naked for artists.  Life modelling  Spirited Bodies multi-model life drawing events have been held in diverse venues across London, including the Royal Festival Hall, Mall Galleries, Battersea Arts Centre, The Feminist Library, St John's Church and Sh! Women's Erotic Emporium. Further events have been held around the UK, from Totnes in Devon to Edinburgh in Scotland. People who would like to try life modelling at Spirited Bodies events have been asked to fill-out an initial questionnaire to assess suitability. Workshops are held in which novices have the opportunity to model and also draw. Spirited Bodies life drawing can take place with up to 20 models in the room; up to 60 models featured at the Battersea Arts Centre in October 2012. Participants have reported wanting to mark a milestone of body confidence – for example, weight lost or gained, age, physical or mental scarring, chronic illness – and have found life modelling a good way to reconnect with their physical self. Spirited Bodies works with its models to come up with ideas for poses. They may be separate or together, connected with or without physical contact, in evolving tableaux rather than static scenes. Esther Bunting, as Artistic Director of Spirited Bodies, assists new models during events whilst sometimes modelling within the group herself. By 2014, it was reported that demand for model places was outstripping availability.  Activism  In August 2018, Spirited Bodies began campaigning to get life drawing in colleges and youth centres as a means of helping young people overcome body image anxiety and tackling the negative effects of social media on their mental health by showing what real people with real bodies look like. The campaign attracted broad media interest across the UK, with interviews and articles in national newspapers, radio and television news. Global coverage included Mexican television news. The way social media has affected life drawing was debated publicly when Esther Bunting was invited to speak at a panel event hosted by Mall Galleries, London in August 2018. From a premise that art is \\"often judged on the conventional attractiveness of the sitter rather than the quality of the painting\\", discussion covered how life modelling can be empowering and liberating, but that the male gaze continues to hinder body equality in the art room. Esther Bunting is also a physical artist, writer and feminist who has been evolving performance art since 2009.

His habilitation concerned the \\"remonstrances\\" printed in France between 1550 and 1600 and was completed under the direction of Denis Crouzet (Paris-Sorbonne, 2017). Mellet was awarded several research grants, allowing him to study in Geneva (BGE/IHR), Brussels (Bibliothèque Royale de Belgique), Wolfenbüttel (Bibliotheca Augusta), Chicago (Newberry Library) and Madison (Institute for Research in the Humanities).  Research  Mellet focuses on the history of Protestant reforms and the history of political ideas, notably perceptions of authorities during the Modern era (end of 15th c. to beginning of 16th c.) and the varying degrees of resistance or acceptance that they were met with. He is also interested in the history of books and the history of European warshttps://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00974581 in France, Switzerland, Germany, Savoy, the Netherlands, and England. Around these themes, he has published ten books, organized some 30 academic trips and symposiums and given over 80 papers and lectures in Europe and the United States. He has contributed to a number of publications on modern European history and taken part in several scientific popularization projects for the general public (television and radio segments, public lectures, etc.). He regularly contributes to a number of French reviews (RHMC, BSHPF, RHR, CRMH, etc.) and international reviews (Bibliothèque d'Humanisme et Renaissance, Archiv für Reformationsgeschichte, Church History and Religious Culture, Sixteenth Century Journal). At the CESR, he co-directed two collections with the publishers Champion (Savoir de Mantice) and Garnier (Travaux du CESR). He has published the majority of his works with Droz (Geneva). = Monarchomachs = With the study of French-speaking Protestant Monarchomachs (French Huguenot theorists who opposed monarchy, known in particular for having theoretically justified tyrannicide), Mellet is interested in undertakings starting in 1560 that aimed to oppose the tightening of religious policy in France, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. In particular, he has showed that the term Monarchomachs,Les Traités Monarchomaques. Confusion des temps, résistance armée et monarchie parfaite (vers 1560-vers 1600), Genève Droz, 2007, 584 p. coined in 1600 by the jurist William Barclay in order to collectively denounce Calvinists and members of the Catholic League who were, according to him, opposed to monarchy, ought to be decoupled from its etymology and initial context and adapted to fit five criteria: legitimate resistance, rejection of tyranny, double alliance (between God, the people and the king), conditional obedience, and the sovereignty of the people (through their representatives). With these criteria, it is possible to create a list of ten \\"Protestant Monarchomach\\" texts, of which the most well-known are François Hotman's Francogallia (1573), Théodore de Bèze's Droit des magistrats sur leurs sujets (1574), Jean de Coras' Question politique (1569) and Réveille-matin des François (1574). There are also the less celebrated treatises, such as Remonstrance aus seigneurs gentilshommes (1574), Discours politiques des diverses puissances establies de Dieu au monde (1576), Question, assavoir s'il est licite sauver la vie aux massacreurs (1573), and Questions, assavoir s'il est loisible aux sujets de se deffendre contre le Magistrat (1573). Once Barclay's restrictive definition is shed, we can not only study the conceptual foundation of these works from the point of view of their system of historical references (Saint Thomas, Grégoire de Tours, etc.) and biblical references (1 Samuel 8, Romains 13,1), but also measure their spread throughout Europe (Frankfurt Book Fair, public and private library catalogs). = Remonstrances = Another dimension of Mellet's research consists of the study of remonstrances printed in Europe between 1550 and 1650. Despite appearing suddenly and multiplying rapidly during periods of religious tension and civil war (in France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Empire, England, and Savoy), reaching 700 publications between 1560 and 1600 in France alone\\"Les remontrances : une expression paradoxale de la société politique (XVIe siècle)\\", in Marc Laureys, David A. Lines and Jill Kraye (ed.), 'Forms' in Renaissance Conflict and Rivalries, V&R; Unipress, Bonn University Press, 2015, ., these texts of circumstance had not been the object of any specific study until now. In contrast with Monarchomachian treatises, remonstrances are more situated in an institutional framework (particularly in the case for parliamentary remonstrances) and constitute an opposition of lower intensity. They are primarily intended to address the prince, along with his council and religious authorities, and to peacefully temper a given decision or edict. In return, the prince can address a remonstrance to his people to return order (Remonstrance aux habitants de Marseille, qu'il n'y a rien de plus profitable que de se conserver souz l'obeyssance de leurs Roys naturels, Lyon, Thomas Soubron, 1597). Only certain remonstrances take on a rhetoric of invective, like the remonstrances of the Catholic League after 1588. The other texts are characterized by lamentations of the present and adopt the rhetoric of \\"the miseries of the time\\" (Remonstrance a la Royne mere du Roy, par ceux qui sont persecutez pour la parole de Dieu, s.l., 1561). Remonstrance, in reality, reinforces the position of power which it addresses, thanks to various processes of humility and exhortations to, for instance, modify the religious legislation under Philippe II in the Netherlands or to force the adoption of decrees of the Council of Trent in France. Above all, remonstrances provide the opportunity to see political and religious conflicts from the perspective of the day, demonstrating that, despite the tension, violence, and wars, some spaces of negotiation subsisted that were actively conserved by certain actors. The civil wars of the 15th and 16th centuries were not periods during which all dialogue was cast aside, specifically between Catholics and Protestants; to the contrary, remonstrances maintained spaces of exchange and negotiation within armed conflict. He has also created an international research group on \\"The remonstrances of the Ancien Régime (15th-18th c.)\\" with Ullrich Langer (University of Wisconsin-Madison). This team of 30 European and American researchers studies remonstrances in a multidisciplinary fashion across law, literature, history, philosophy, rhetoric, theology, and political science. They have gathered several times since 2011, notably in Tours, Paris, Chicago, and Wolfenbüttel. An overview of these works is underway at Garnier with anticipated publication in 2020.

The process starts when the ancestors of the Last Universal Common Ancestor (the LUCA) become refractory to horizontal (or lateral) gene transfer (HGT) and become individual entities with vertical heredity upon which natural selection is effective. After this transition, life is characterized by genealogies that have a modern tree-like phylogeny. Darwinian threshold: the transition period during the evolution of the first cells when genetic transmission moves from a predominantly horizontal mode to a vertical mode  Before the Darwinian threshold  The Last Universal Common Ancestor is often considered to be an already complex organism with a DNA-based genome, a complex informational flow and an efficient metabolism, but some authors, like Carl Woese, believe instead that the LUCA was not a discrete entity but rather a diverse community of cells that survived and evolved as a biological unit. Carl Woese indicated that most likely there existed high mutation rates and small genomes. Also present were small proteins and larger imprecisely translated \\"statistical proteins\\". Entities in which translation had not yet developed to the point that proteins of the modern type could arise, have been termed “progenotes,” and the era during which these were the most advanced forms of life, the “progenote era”. These organisms or biological entities, these progenotes (or ribocytes), had RNA as informational molecule instead of DNA. RNA is capable of both catalysis and replication and could have been central to the origins of heredity and life itself. It has been proposed that the initial molecular events were carried out by transfer RNAs (tRNAs). It is hypothesized that structured tRNAs could have provided amino acids during a process called self-translation of a single extended tRNA strand. Compartmentalization with membranes was not yet completed and translation of proteins was not precise. Not every progenote had its own metabolism; different metabolic steps were present in different progenotes. Therefore it is assumed that there existed a community of sub-systems that started to cooperate collectively and culminated in the LUCA.  After the Darwinian threshold  Most scientists place the LUCA at the root of the tree of life. From this root depart two Prokaryotic Domains: the Bacteria and the Archaea. Just after this first split, one of the branches, going towards the Archaea, splits again and gives rise to a third branch which is that of the Eukaryotes so that now there are three Domains of life. Carl Woese thought that even during the era around the origin of the LUCA, the root and the first branches were very blurred since the cells were not very well defined yet and HGT was still quite important. Some authors maintain LUCA was a mesophilic eukaryote. According to these authors the Domains that derived from LUCA through a process of reductive evolution or \\"streamlining\\" were Prokaryotes; mesophilic and thermophilic Bacteria and thermophilic Archaea. The term \\"prokaryote\\" should therefore be abandoned, since it suggests that \\"prokaryotes\\" preceded \\"eukaryotes\\" in their evolution from LUCA towards complexity.

It is most often played in a semi-diagonal, guitar-like playing position and bowed with an underhand (palm up) “German” bow grip manner similar to Viola da Gamba. GuitarViols exist in solid body electric, semi-acoustic, and acoustic configurations. Since the early 2000s, GuitarViols have been predominantly used by media composers in TV/Film/video game soundtrack industry. Notable examples of prominent GuitarViol use include movies such as 300 and all seasons of Game of Thrones (with the exception of the main theme introduction track).

In January 1901, along with many of the Sydney Bohemian set such as sculptor Nelson Illingworth, writer Louise Mack, and poet Banjo Paterson, she attended the farewell dinner of Scottish-Australian poet and bush balladeer Will H. Ogilvie (1869–1963). Following her own testimonial dinner, in February 1902, Eyton travelled to London on board P&O;'s RMS Arcadia. = Hollywood career = She moved to Hollywood, California, by 1905, where she continued her literary efforts. By April 1909, Eyton's first play, based on Victor Cherbuliez's 1877 novel Samuel Brohl et cie, was accepted for production in New York City. She married fellow writer Robert von Saxmar around 1920 in Los Angeles, where she found work as a stenographer at Paramount. After working her way up the ranks, she earned a spot on the studio's writing staff; her first known credit was on 1918's A Girl Named Mary. She wrote over a dozen scripts in the ensuing five years. By June 1921 she was listed as a writer for the Realart company. = Death = Eyton died of burns sustained when her Halloween costume caught fire at a party being held in Pasadena, California. The party was being held in a cabin in Arroyo Seco, where she was temporarily residing while working on a novel; a lit match or cigarette somehow landed on Eyton's cotton snow maiden costume, which quickly went up in flames. She was rushed to the nearby Pasadena Hospital, but her burns were fatal.

Six people including the perpetrator died and six others were injured. Incident The first reports of the shooting began to arrive at , with the first officers arriving four minutes from the first call. Witnesses said they saw the perpetrator carrying a handgun with a green laser sight attached. The shooting prompted a multi-agency response with agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the United States Marshals Service assisting local police. The shooter returned fire when law enforcement arrived. Officers reported at that the suspect had been shot and killed. The exchange of gunfire lasted about 90 minutes. In total, five people were killed by the gunman. Five police officers were injured along with another civilian. The perpetrator was killed by law enforcement officers. Victims The five victims fatally shot were male workers at the Henry Pratt plant: a 32-year-old human resources manager, a 37-year-old plant manager, a 46-year-old mold operator, a 55-year-old stock room attendant and forklift operator, and a 21-year-old student of Northern Illinois University on his first day as a human resources intern. A sixth plant employee sustained gunshot wounds during the shooting, and was hospitalized with non life-threatening injuries. The six injured police officers ranged in age from 23 to 59. Four of them sustained gunshot wounds, one was injured by shrapnel, and one had a non-gunshot injury sustained while responding to the shooting. None of the injuries were life- threatening. Perpetrator Gary Montez Martin, a 45-year-old former employee of the Henry Pratt plant was identified as the perpetrator. Relatives of the shooter told reporters that he had been released from his position at the company about two weeks prior to the shooting. Other news outlets reported that he was being fired from his job on the day of the shooting, and that the shooting itself started during the termination meeting. Martin was convicted in 1995 for a felony aggravated assault in Mississippi, and served two-and-a- half years in prison in Mississippi for that conviction. Aurora police stated that he had six arrests with the Aurora Police Department, including arrests for domestic violence and violating a restraining order, and that he had a 2017 arrest in Oswego, Illinois for disorderly conduct and criminal damage to property. Martin was not legally allowed to possess a gun in Illinois because of his prior felony conviction in Mississippi. However, in 2014 he applied for, and was issued an Illinois FOID card by the Illinois State Police. In March 2014, he was able to buy a gun (which he is believed to have used during the shooting) from a licensed gun dealer in Aurora using that FOID card. Later that month he applied for a concealed carry license from the Illinois State Police. The concealed carry background check included a fingerprint check, and Martin's felony conviction was discovered at that point. The Illinois State Police rejected his concealed carry application, cancelled his FOID card and sent him a written notice demanding that he turn in the gun that he had purchased. He did not do so. According to a CNN report, the authorities are now trying \\"to determine why he didn't surrender the weapon and whether law enforcement followed up with him to confiscate the gun.\\" On February 15, after the shooting, the police conducted a search of Martin's home but did not find anything to indicate that he had planned the shooting in advance. Upon further investigation into the crime, the police found out that the gunman did plan this attack. On May 1, it was reported that the gunman entered the workplace with a gun and intended opening fire on people inside. The police learned from interviewing workers at the plant that the gunman made threats prior to being fired, and is quoted as saying, \\"If I get fired, I'm going to kill every motherfucker in here\\" and \\"I am going to blow police up.\\" The employee who heard this said he did not bother reporting this to anybody, as the gunman made comments like that regularly. Reactions U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin thanked law enforcement for their response, as did Governor J. B. Pritzker and President Donald Trump. Trump also offered condolences to the victims and their families. Aurora Mayor Richard Irvin said, \\"It's a shame that mass shootings such as this have become commonplace in our country [and] that a cold and heartless offender would be so selfish as to think he has the right to take an innocent life. But we as a society cannot allow these horrific acts to become commonplace.\\" References External links\\"Aurora shooting victims: What we know about those killed in Henry Pratt warehouse shooting\\", ABC News WLS-TV, via archive.org 2019 in Illinois 2019 mass shootings in the United States 2019 murders in the United States Aurora, Illinois February 2019 crimes February 2019 events in the United States Mass murder in 2019 Mass shootings in Illinois Mass shootings in the United States Murder in Illinois Workplace shootings in the United States ","title":"Aurora, Illinois shooting"},{"id":"59976386","text":"Yusif Sulemana is a Ghanaian politician and member of the Seventh Parliament of the Fourth Republic of Ghana representing the Bole Bamboi Constituency in the Northern Region on the ticket of the National Democratic Congress.
