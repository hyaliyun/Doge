Synopsis In June 1917, whilst recovering from shell shock inside a military hospital, beloved war poet and dedicated soldier Viscount Abercrombie is inexplicably shot dead. Meanwhile, Douglas Kingsley, a liberal Inspector for Scotland Yard, has refused national service because he considers the war to be an affront to his highly prized sense of logic. As a result, he's hauled before a judge, branded a coward by those who love him - including his wife Agnes - and thrown into prison, where his fellow inmates routinely assault him, taking revenge for him putting them behind bars in the first place. However, the Home Office gives the disgraced copper a chance for redemption when it abducts him from his cell, fakes his death and orders him to investigate the Viscount's death behind the lines at Flanders. As he begins his reluctant inquiries, encumbered by the presence of his psychopathic minder Captain Shannon, Kingsley discovers that not only was Abercrombie a homosexual, but that he had also become disillusioned with the war and was composing poetry to this effect before his untimely death. Reception The novel was generally very well received by critics, although questions were raised regarding the historical accuracy of some details. The Daily Telegraph described it as a \\"work of formidable imaginative scope... the writing is so good, the language so surprisingly subtle and the characters so beautifully delineated.\\" Characters *Inspector Kingsley - A vaguely arrogant, but nevertheless kind and morally upstanding, intellectual, whose intricate sense of logic is frequently given superiority over self- preservation, a trait which proves his undoing. His brother Robert was killed in battle and he must now face the prospect of losing his wife, Agnes, and young son George. Despite his objection to the war, he is also a talented soldier, as proven when he wades into the middle of no man‚Äòs land during a fray in order to obtain information. *Captain Shannon - An unbalanced, sadistic psychopath whose warped mentality has clearly been exacerbated by his experiences of war. He is deeply misogynistic, but has no trouble attracting women because of his handsome face and surface charm. Kingsley narrowly prevents him from raping a teenage girl, and throughout the story Shannon displays a cold disregard for women, civilians, conscientious objectors and victims of shell shock. *Nurse Murray - A staunch feminist and former suffragette, who abandoned her cause following the outbreak of war so she could lend her support to the military. She has a brief but passionate affair with Kingsley, who is both enamoured of and horrified by her unashamed vulgarity. *Agnes Kingsley *Viscount Abercrombie - The character of the Viscount Abercrombie may be based, at least in part, upon Siegfried Sassoon, a British soldier and poet who became disillusioned with the War and became an outspoken anti-war activist. *Stamford References 2005 British novels Novels set during World War I Novels by Ben Elton Fiction set in 1917 ","title":"The First Casualty"},{"id":"5769956","text":"Ravenscroft may refer to: People * John Ravenscroft (disambiguation), several people * Christopher Ravenscroft (born 1946), English actor * Edward Ravenscroft (c. 1654‚Äì1697), English dramatist * Edward James Ravenscroft (1816‚Äì1890), author of Pinetum Britannicum * George Ravenscroft (1632‚Äì1683), developer of lead crystal glass in England * Raphael Ravenscroft (1954‚Äì2014), saxophonist * Steve Ravenscroft (born 1970), rugby player * Thomas Ravenscroft (c. 1588‚Äì1635), English composer, died 1635 * Tim Ravenscroft (born 1992), Guernsey cricketer * Trevor Ravenscroft, author * Thurl Ravenscroft (1914‚Äì2005), American voice actor and singer Characters * Alistair, Margaret, and Celia Ravenscroft, characters in Agatha Christie's novel Elephants Can Remember  Places  * Ravenscroft, Tennessee * Ravenscroft School, Raleigh, North Carolina, United States * Ravenscroft School, Somerset, England  Other  * Ravenscroft Psalter * Ede & Ravenscroft, tailors  See also  * English-language surnames ","title":"Ravenscroft"},{"id":"5769974","text":"Waiting, Waitin, Waitin', or The Waiting may refer to: *Waiting staff, work as a waiter or waitress Music * The Waiting (band), a Christian pop rock band * Waiting (KLF film), a video by The KLF =Albums= * Waiting (Bobby Hutcherson album) (1976) * Waiting (Fun Boy Three album) (1983) * Waiting (Thursday album) (1999) * Waiting...

She was killed by communist insurgents while on a routine visit to assist rural villagers in Surat Thani Province. Early life Princess Vibhavadi Rangsit was born on 20 November 1920. She was the eldest daughter of Rajani Chamcharas, Prince Bidyalongkorn and Princess Phonphimonphan Rajani (n√©e Princess Phimonphan Voravan). She had a sibling, Prince Bhisadej Rajani. The princess was educated at the Mater Dei School, Bangkok. After completing her secondary education, she worked as a secretary for her father, who at the time was one of the most respected poets of the Rattanakosin era and wrote under the pseudonym No. Mo. So. (NMS; ). Princess Vibhavadi inherited her father's gift for writing and displayed her ability as early as age of fourteen, when she began writing children's novels. She was well known by her pen-name V. na Pramuanmarg ( Wo Na Pramuanmak). Her famous first novel, Prisana ( Pritsana), was written when she was eighteen and was followed by two sequels and many other novels, some of them historical. Marriage Princess Vibhavadi Rangsit married Prince Piyarangsit Rangsit (), eldest son of Rangsit Prayurasakdi, Prince of Chainat and Elisabeth Scharnberger, on 6 May 1946. They were the only couple married by King Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII). She had two daughters: # Mom Rajawongse Vibhananda Rangsit ( Wiphanan Rangsit) # Mom Rajawongse Priyanandana Rangsit ( Priyananthana Rangsit) Work In addition to a full writing career, the princess worked for King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit of Thailand. In 1957, she began accompanying them when they toured the country and was appointed a lady-in-waiting to the queen when they went on their first state visit abroad in 1960. Princess Vibhavadi accompanied them on seven occasions, visiting twenty-five countries. The last ten years of her life were dedicated to rural development in southern Thailand under the direction and sponsorship of the king. Her involvement began when the monarch asked her to go to a remote area called Phrasaeng in Surat Thani Province. From that initial visit in 1967, she was committed to the development of neglected areas and the improvement of the villagers' living standards. Sponsored by the king, she led a medical team on many missions to distribute medical supplies, schooling equipment, blankets, and other necessities to villagers in remote and almost inaccessible parts of the South. Death Princess Vibavadi often visited soldiers and Border Patrol Police stationed in areas where there was communist insurgency. On the morning of 16 February 1977, she set off on what should have been a routine visit to villages and to boost the morale of troops at Wiang Sa District, Surat Thani. While flying to her destination in an army helicopter, she heard a radio message saying two Border Patrol Policemen had been wounded by a landmine. She immediately ordered the flight diverted to pick up the wounded men and rush them to a hospital. As they flew at low altitude over Ban Nua Khlong, the helicopter was attacked from the ground by communist insurgents. A burst of heavy machine gun fire crippled the helicopter and seriously wounded the princess. She died one hour later. Prior to her royally sponsored cremation at Ratchabophit Temple, on 4 April 1977, \\"in recognition of her services to the country and the people\\", the king elevated her to the higher royal rank of Phra Chao Worawongse Ther Phra Ong Chao (Her Royal Highness) and awarded her the highest level of the most Illustrious Order of the House of Chakri Legacy February 16 is now known in Surat Thani as Vibhavadi Day, and civil and religious ceremonies are held in her honour. Vibhavadi Rangsit Highway, which connects Don Mueang International Airport with Bangkok, was named for the beloved princess. Her husband, Prince Piya Rangsit, founded the Vibhavadi Rangsit Foundation to ensure the continuity of her charitable work in the southern provinces. Vibhavadi Rangsit Road, which runs from Phaya Thai District in Bangkok to Lam Luk Ka District in Pathumthani was also named in her honour.

He spent over 30 years progressing the project to build a new British Library in London, originally planned to be built in Bloomsbury and now completed near Kings Cross. Early and private life Wilson was born in Cheltenham, the younger son of Henry Wilson, a Church of England clergyman who became Bishop of Chelmsford from 1929. His father was known as the \\"Red Bishop\\" as a result of his sympathy for the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War. Wilson was educated at Felsted School, and he studied history and then architecture at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge from 1940 to 1942, when he joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve. He served as a lieutenant in a Communication Squadron of the Fleet Air Arm in Europe during the Second World War and then India. He was demobilised in 1946, he completed his studies under Sir Albert Richardson at the Bartlett School of Architecture at University College London, graduating as an architect in 1949. Wilson married twice. First he married Muriel Lavender in 1955, but they were later divorced in 1971. Then he married the American-born architect Mary Jane Long, a founding partner of Long & Kentish architects, in 1972; with Long together he has one son and one daughter. Long and Wilson often collaborated on design projects. Career After graduating, he worked at the London County Council architects department from 1950 to 1955, under the directorship of Sir Leslie Martin, alongside James Stirling, Alison and Peter Smithson, Alan Colquhoun, Peter Carter, and William Howell. His designs of this period include the Le Corbusier-inspired Bentham Road Estate, Hackney. Wilson was involved with the Independent Group of artists at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, and he contributed to the seminal \\"This Is Tomorrow\\" exhibition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1956. He worked for a development company for a year before becoming a lecturer in architecture at Cambridge University in 1956, where Martin had been appointed Professor of Architecture. Wilson met Finnish architect Alvar Aalto through Martin and this had a major impact on his following building. He was a Fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge, from 1962 to 1971. He retired from teaching in 1969 to concentrate on his architectural practice. As well as teaching together, Wilson and Martin also practised together as architects from offices in Cambridge, designing Harvey Court at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, which himself argues had an influence on Italian rationalist architecture, especially that of Aldo Rossi, an extension to the School of Architecture in Cambridge, a house for painter Christopher Cornford in Cambridge, and the Law, English and Statistical Libraries on Manor Road in Oxford, and other buildings in Cambridge and London. Wilson designed his own home in Cambridge on Grantchester Road. He was commissioned to design the proposed Liverpool Civic and Social Centre, but the building was never finished, being deemed \\"fascist\\" by the council. He also designed an extension for the British Museum which was also never realised. Interior of the British Library, with the smoked glass wall of the King's Library in the background. In terms of architectural production, Wilson is best known for designing the current British Library building in London, begun in 1962 and finally completed - after a 35-year history of political wrangles, budget overspending and design problems - in 1997. He described it as his \\"30-year war\\". The original scheme would have created a piazza to the south of the British Museum in Bloomsbury, but would have required the demolition of a large part of Bloomsbury. After a public protest, a new site was found further north, between Euston Station and St Pancras Station. A design was approved in 1978, but then delayed by the change of government after the 1979 general election, and ambitions were reduced amid rising costs. The architecture of the huge building is influenced by several sources: the surrounding Victorian architecture in the St Pancras area of London and the collegiate architecture of Cambridge University. The use of finely detailed brickwork, multi-layer terraces, interplay of pitched roof elements and gradual stepping up of the entrance are all direct references to Aalto, in particular his S√§yn√§tsalo Town Hall. The entrance area features pendant lamps designed by the Finnish architect Juha Leivisk√§, whom Wilson knew personally. The building was shortlisted for the RIBA Stirling Prize in 1998. Wilson returned to Cambridge to become Professor of Architecture in 1975, stepping into shoes vacated by the early death of William Howell. He was a Fellow at Pembroke College, Cambridge, from 1977 to his death in 2007. He retired in 1989, becoming a professor emeritus. He became a trustee of the Tate Gallery in 1974, and a trustee of the National Gallery in 1977, retiring from both positions in 1980. He was a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Royal Academy. He was knighted in 1998 for services to architecture, and was an Honorary Fellow at Churchill College from 1998 to 2007. He received honorary doctorates from the universities of Cambridge, Essex and Sheffield. He was a visiting professor at Yale four times (1960, 1964, 1983 and 2000) and at MIT from 1970 to 1972. He published two theoretical works, Architectural Reflections in 1992 and The Other Tradition of Modern Architecture in 1995, and The Artist at Work, on Michael Andrews and William Coldstream, in 1999. More recently, Wilson and Long & Kentish designed the new wing of Pallant House Gallery in Chichester, England, which opened in June 2006. The unashamedly modern block stands next to the original gallery, housed in a Grade 1 listed Queen Anne townhouse, was shortlisted for RIBA awards in 2007, and won the 2007 Gulbenkian Prize. Wilson also donated his share of his collection of over 400 works of art to the gallery (owned jointly with his second wife). His collection, worth ¬£5m, included works by Michael Andrews, Victor Willing, Peter Blake, David Bomberg, Patrick Caulfield, Lucian Freud, Richard Hamilton, R. B. Kitaj, Eduardo Paolozzi and Walter Sickert. Many of the works were acquired directly from the artists, who were friends of Wilson: indeed, he designed homes for several. An extension to the British Library opened in 2007, shortly before his death. He was survived by his second wife, and their son and daughter.

History The Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR) was founded in 1925 as an international forum where national delegations representing a broad range of interests could meet and discuss both domestic and regional issues. The IPR was a respected forum in the period before, during and after World War II, but was disbanded in 1961 after the United States withdrew support. PBEC was one of the organizations that filled the void. It was founded in 1967 by business leaders from the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Later the founders were joined by groups of members from other countries in the region such as South Korea, Mexico, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines. The purpose of the Pacific Basin Economic Council is providing high level engagement between business leaders and Government officials through a regional network of local representative country chapters. Its mission is to create and maintain an environment that facilitates the orderly conduct of sustainable & responsible economic development within & between the 21 APEC Members States. The organization is funded by its patron, corporate & individual members. The organization is informal in the sense that it does not include official government representation and membership is strictly 'by Invitation Only\\". At the council's 12th general meeting in Los Angeles in 1978 the Pacific Economic Community Plan was proposed, calling for an economic community to coordinate solidarity and cooperation between countries of the region at different stages of development. As of 1993 the PBEC was the main non-government organization involved in economic cooperation in the Pacific region. However today it focuses on its Members needs and represents them in front of Government, when tackling some of the most important economic decisions in Asia. Activities The Pacific Basin Economic Council promotes a fair based regulatory environment for all its members in the region. It advises governments on ways to improve society issues, the wider business environment and cross-border digital trade barriers. It helps generate direct foreign investment (DFI) and encourages new technology development and deployment while avoiding environmental degradation where possible. Serving as the independent voice of business in the Pacific, PBEC provides authentic Intelligence through its platform for the diversity of industry, services and professions that have made Asia and the Pacific the world's growth region. PBEC has been a driving force in the region for the past five + decades, advocating environmental awareness, the UNSDG's, corporate social responsibility, ESG Reporting and transparency through its regional country chapters and executive committee. It provides policy advocacy and partners with like-minded organizations such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) / Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Anti-corruption Initiative, Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Horasis-The Global Visions Community and the United Nations Global Compact.

It was purchased in 2005 by Syracuse University,\\"SU Plans 'Historic' Move Downtown - College Aims For Community Connections\\", The Post-Standard, 12 December 2004 which renovated the building for classroom, gallery , and studio use at a cost of $9 million.\\"SU Set to Celebrate Armory Square Site - The Warehouse Provides a New Home for some of the University's Arts Programs\\", The Post-Standard, 29 April 2006 The renovation was designed by Syracuse alumnus Richard Gluckman of New York City-based Gluckman Mayner Architects. It is currently home to the School of Design of the College of Visual and Performing Arts'. In addition, the Goldring Arts Journalism Program is headquartered in the building. The design firm that developed the renovation was recently honored for their work on the Warehouse. As of 2014, the building has been given the official name of \\"The Nancy Cantor Warehouse\\" in honor of Chancellor Cantor, who was instrumental in the purchase and renovation of the building. The Warehouse is a collaboration between Syracuse University and the Syracuse community which resulted in repurposing an underutilized building in Syracuse's historic Armory Square into an academic facility. The renovated structure provides flexible space for design studios, classrooms, and offices for the School of Design, while providing a downtown venue for public lectures, exhibitions, and galleries. The Warehouse marks the western boundary of the Connective Corridor, the cultural arts pathway connecting the main campus of Syracuse University to downtown and Armory Square. It underscores the growing momentum for the revitalization of downtown Syracuse. School of Design Syracuse University School of Design The Warehouse houses the Syracuse University School of Design. The ground floor offers a cafe, reading room, community classrooms, lecture hall, and work spaces, a community exhibition space and an international contemporary art gallery, and is the most public space in The Warehouse. The first floor is home to the School of Design administrative offices, a large lecture space, a digital fabrication lab/wood shop, and the Genet Art Gallery. The second floor is a climate-controlled storage space for the SU library. The third floor is home to the Communications Design program; the fourth floor is home to the MFA in Collaborative Design, the Museum Studies program, and the Syracuse University Office of Community Engagement and Economic Development; the fifth floor is home to the Industrial + Interaction Design program; the sixth floor is home to the Environmental + Interior Design (EDI) program; and the seventh floor is home to the Fashion Design program. Part of The Warehouse's basement contains spray booths and a \\"dirty room\\" for messy projects. The Warehouse Gallery The gallery opened on April 29, 2006 under the temporary name Bridge Gallery, with Making Frames, a slide exhibition of the Gluckman Mayner architecture firm's projects, organized by Jeffrey Hoone, Executive Director of CMAC. Elaine Quick was hired as Administrative Assistant for CMAC. Elaine is now the Programs Coordinator at The Warehouse Gallery. In late June 2006, curator and artist Astria Suparak was hired as the director of the gallery, renaming it The Warehouse Gallery. The first exhibition, CMAC: Roots of Collaboration, exhibited selections from each of the CMAC member collections, opened August 2007. Artist Frank Olive was hired as Assistant Director in September 2006. Olive is now the exhibition designer and preparator at The Warehouse Gallery. Faux Naturel, an exhibition of contemporary international work curated by Astria Suparak, ran from November 9, 2006 to January 7, 2007 at The Warehouse Gallery and toured to the Foreman Art Gallery at Bishop's University in July to August 2007. Artists included Alex Da Corte, Emily Vey Duke and Cooper Battersby, Nick Lenker, Annie MacDonell, Allyson Mitchell and Andrea Vander Kooij. The press release states, \\"Entropy, redemption, apocalypse, the fall from grace, the temptations of commercial culture, and the relationship between science and magic all emerge as motifs in this exhibition.\\" Embracing Winter, a group exhibition of knitted sculpture, psychedelic video, photography, and audio and book works by artists Janet Morton, Takeshi Murata, Bruno Munari, Collin Olan, Lisa M. Robinson and Rudy Shepherd, curated by Suparak, was on display from February 13 - March 31, 2007. It also featured interactive displays with take-home elements created by The Warehouse Gallery, a film screening titled \\"Winter Light\\" (curated by Suparak and filmmaker Brett Kashmere), and a video event by Daniel Barrow, \\"Winnipeg Babysitter.\\" Networked Nature, on exhibit from April 17, 2007 to July 17, 2007 was a group exhibition that explored the representation of ‚Äúnature‚Äù through the perspective of networked culture. The exhibition included works by C5, Futurefarmers, Shih-Chieh Huang, Phil Ross, Stephen Vitiello and Gail Wight, who combined art and politics with innovative technology, such as global positioning systems (GPS), robotics and hydroponic environments. The exhibition was organized by Rhizome and Astria Suparak. COME ON: Desire Under The Female Gaze, curated by Suparak, included artists Jo-Anne Balcaen, Juliet Jacobson, and Rachel Rampleman. The press release states, \\"Three young artists in Brooklyn and Montreal explicitly express desire, fantasy, disappointment, and pleasure\\" in videos, drawings, sculptures, and text works. In July 2007 the Gallery was reorganized under the umbrella of the newly created SUArt Galleries at Syracuse University and Astria Suparak was dismissed as director of the Warehouse Gallery. The Gallery continued with Jeffrey Hoone as interim curator and after an international search Anja Chavez was hired as curator of contemporary art for the Warehouse Gallery and the SUArt Galleries. = Controversy = The dismissal of Astria Suparak as director of the Gallery in 2007 led to protests and demonstrations by local and international artists, professors, civic leaders, students, and business owners. There was speculation that her forthcoming exhibition \\"Keep It Slick: Infiltrating Capitalism with The Yes Men,\\" was canceled because of censorship. The University denied any claims of censorship. In 2008 Suparak was appointed director of the Miller Gallery at Carnegie Mellon University.

Belfast and Derry contain arguably the most famous political murals in Europe. It is believed that almost 2,000 murals have been documented since the 1970s. In 2014, the book, The Belfast Mural Guide estimated that, in Belfast, there were approximately 300 quality murals on display, with many more in varying degrees of age and decay. Murals commemorate, communicate and display aspects of culture and history. The themes of murals often reflect what is important to a particular community. A mural therefore exists to express an idea or message and could generally be seen as reflecting values held dear to that community. In Irish republican areas the themes of murals can range from the 1981 Irish hunger strike, with particular emphasis on strike leader Bobby Sands; murals of international solidarity with revolutionary groups are equally common, as are those which highlight a particular issue, for example the Ballymurphy Massacre or the McGurk's Bar bombing. In working class unionist communities, murals are used to promote Ulster loyalist paramilitary groups such as the Ulster Defence Association and Ulster Volunteer Force and commemorate their deceased members. However traditional themes such as William III of England and the Battle of the Boyne, the Battle of the Somme and the 36th Ulster Division are equally common.Maxamillian Rapp: Murals in Ulster: Symbol kultureller Revolution im nordirischen B√ºrgerkrieg. In: KultuRRevolution Nr. 61/62 2012. History A Loyalist political mural in Derry circa 1920 Murals can be described as a mirror of political change, as they have been painted throughout the last century and display all important historic as well as political developments in the scope of unique wall paintings. In 1908 Ulster loyalists started to portray William III of England on a white horse in order to strengthen the Orange identity of Ulster Protestants. Irish republican wall-paintings started in the late 1970s and can be seen in particular as a visual display of a social movement, which was radicalized after the IRA began to fight for a greater political voice and a United Ireland.Maximilian Rapp and Markus Rhomberg: The importance of Murals during the Troubles: Analyzing the republican use of wall paintings in Northern Ireland. In: Machin, D. (Ed.) Visual Communication Reader. De Gruyter. Murals are for the most part located in working class areas of Northern Ireland, primarily in Belfast and Derry. Arguably the most well-known and easily identified mural is that of Bobby Sands, on the side wall of Sinn F√©in's Falls Road office. A close second is the collection of Irish republican and international-themed murals which are located at what is known as 'The International Wall', also in Belfast. In Derry, Free Derry Corner, where the slogan \\"You Are Now Entering Free Derry\\" was painted in 1969 shortly after the Battle of the Bogside, is prominent. Not everyone considers Free Derry Corner to be a true mural, as it consists only of words and not images. Free Derry Corner has been used as a model for other murals in Northern Ireland, including the \\"You Are Now Entering Loyalist Sandy Row\\" mural in Belfast, which was a response to the republican message of Free Derry Corner, and the \\"You Are Now Entering Derry Journal Country\\" mural, which is an advertisement for a Derry publication. Not all murals in Northern Ireland are directly political or sectarian in nature, with some commemorating events such as the Great Irish Famine (1845‚Äì1849), and other moments in Irish history. Many portray events from Irish mythology, and images from Irish myths are often incorporated into political murals. A few murals avoid the subject of Ireland altogether, instead focusing on such neutral subjects as litter prevention and the C. S. Lewis novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. In Derry, there is a mural depicting the five principal characters from the TV show Derry Girls. Murals representing peace and tolerance are becoming increasingly popular with school groups who have children either design or actually paint murals in areas around their schools. With many paramilitaries now involved in community work, there has been a move to decommission many of the hard-edged murals across Northern Ireland (although this trend is reversed in times of tension). This change was further highlighted in 2007, when the Bogside Artists were invited to Washington, D.C. for the Smithsonian Folk Life Festival. The three artists were invited to recreate murals in the Washington Mall.

Mallet, V. Ball, W. Waagen, W. L. Willson (standing); A. Tween, W. King, T. Oldham, H. B. Medlicott, C. A. Hackett (sitting) Henry Benedict Medlicott, FRS (3 August 1829 ‚Äì 6 April 1905) was an Irish geologist who worked in India. He was a coauthor of a text on the geology of India and is credited with the coining of the term \\"Gondwana\\" which was later used to create the concept of Gondwanaland. Early life Portrait He was born in Loughrea, County Galway, Ireland, the son of the Church of Ireland Rector of Loughrea, Samuel Medlicott (1796‚Äì1858) and his wife Charlotte (c.1814-1884), daughter of Henry Benedict Dolphin, C. B. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin under Thomas Oldham (1816‚Äì1875) (as well as in France, Guernsey, and Dublin. He obtained a BA in 1850 with diploma in honours in the School of Civil Engineering and an MA in 1870. He was an expert in French and was acquainted with the works of the French geologists. He joined the Geological Survey of Ireland as a general assistant in October 1851 working under Joseph Beete Jukes (1811‚Äì1869) and later with the British Geological Survey in Wiltshire before resigning to join the geological survey of India in March 1854. On the recommendation of Sir Henry De la Beche (1796‚Äì1855), he was given the post of geology professor at Thomason College of Civil Engineering at Roorkee. His brothers Joseph G. Medlicott (d. 1866) and Samuel (c.1831‚Äì1889) worked in the geological survey of Ireland while Joseph later worked in India. Career in India thumb From 15 August 1854 he worked at Roorkee, making trips with Oldham. He married Louisa, daughter of Reverend Daniel Henry Maunsell, at Landour near Mussoorie on 27 October 1857. In 1857 he served as a volunteer with the garrison of Roorkee against the mutineers and was awarded the Indian Mutiny Medal for Special Service. While at Roorkee, he studied parts of the Narmada Valley and Bundelkhand (in 1854-55, 1856‚Äì57). He worked on the geology of the Lower Himalayas and the Siwalik Beds. Along with his brother Joseph G. Medlicott he was able to determine the separation of the Cambrian Vindhyan region from the Gondwana. He later worked in various parts of the country such as South Rewa, Bihar, Assam, Khasi Hills, Rajputana, Kashmir, the Satpura ranges and the Garo Hills. On 1 April 1876 he succeeded Dr Oldham to head the Department of Geology and was posted in Calcutta. The position was changed from Superintendent to Director in 1885. Medlicott began to isolate himself from social life and began to live an ascetic life, walking barefoot and editing papers. He wrote Manual of the Geology of India with William Thomas Blanford in 1879 and edited works in the Paleontologica Indica. His writing style was considered intemperate by his contemporaries but he began a policy to allow his subordinates free expression in print, a move that caused resentment among the staff. He was hostile to the promotion of native Indian geologists. He retired in April 1887 and lived at Clifton Bristol where he continued to research his interests in philosophy and theology. He died on 6 April 1905, leaving behind his wife, two sons and two daughters. He is credited with having suggested the name Gondwana. He used the term to describe stratigraphy of a mostly Permian formation in India. The geologist Edward Suess noted the widespread Glossopteris fossil flora and called all the regions \\"Gondwana-Land\\" and included India, Madagascar and Africa but not Australia. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1877 and won the Wollaston Medal of the Geological Society in 1888. He was a Fellow of Calcutta University, and from 1879 to 1881 he was President of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. His obituarist and colleague Blanford (who died in the same year) noted that he never used \\"FRS\\" after his name in any publications.

The station has a studio in One City Center, along with co-owned Townsquare Media stations WJBQ, WCYY, WHOM and WPKQ. The station also serves as the Portland market affiliate for the New England Patriots Radio Network. WBLM is one of the most powerful FM stations in New England, licensed to operate at 100,000 watts. It broadcasts from a transmitter tower near Route 121 in Raymond that is the second tallest man-made structure in Maine (second only to the tower for WMTW TV 8). In the movie City Slickers, Billy Crystal's character claimed to have been a sales executive for the fictional station \\"WBLM Radio\\".  History  WBLM signed on the air on March 1, 1973 on 107.5 MHz. By day, it played Beautiful Music (also known as Easy Listening, mostly instrumental versions of Broadway, Hollywood and popular hits) with free-form progressive rock airing from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. The station was licensed to Lewiston, Maine and its antenna was located in Litchfield, Maine, also the site of the original studio, which was a double-wide mobile home. Later that year, WBLM became a full-time progressive rocker. The first rock song the station played on the air was The Story in Your Eyes by the Moody Blues. Given that the transmitter site was some away from Portland, the station's signal was somewhat spotty in Portland and beyond. In 1979, it modified its format to mainstream album-oriented rock, after being challenged in the ratings by what at the time was a new 3,000-watt album rock station, 100.9 WLOB-FM, known as \\"FM 101\\" and currently WYNZ. In fact...Air personality John Clark from FM-101 defected to WBLM in late 1981. On December 6, 1989 it switched frequencies with 102.9 WTHT. 102.9 was previously beautiful music station WGAN-FM from its sign-on in February 1967 until 1985. Prior to 1966, 102.9 was WLOB-FM, but not related to today's AM 1310 WLOB. The 107.5 frequency is now WFNK, ironically a direct competitor to WBLM with a classic rock/classic hits format. The two stations are often at the top of the Portland ratings list. WBLM has a colorful connection to rock acts Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart. WBLM's nickname is \\"The Rock and Roll Blimp\\". The stations on air catchphrase is: \\"It's The Blimp Frank it's The Blimp!\\"; both refer to the Captain Beefheart track off the album Trout Mask Replica \\"The Blimp\\", which is where the catchphrase comes from (the catchphrase is a portion of the beginning of that song). It's The Blimp \\"Frank\\" is in reference to Frank Zappa as the portion of the song used for the catchphrase is a recording of a phone call made from Beefheart's recording session back to their record label owner Frank Zappa about their new song titled \\"The Blimp\\". The \\"Cosmic Muffin\\" astrological forecast, which was a daily report on WBLM for years also used as its theme song \\"Muffin Man\\" by Frank Zappa, specifically the vocal portion proclaiming \\"The man thought he was a man but he was a muffin.\\" On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Townsquare Media would acquire 53 stations from Cumulus Media, including WBLM, for $238 million. The deal is part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare and Dial Global are both controlled by Oaktree Capital Management. The sale to Townsquare was completed on November 14, 2013.

Overview Open-air concerts can range from small, acoustic gatherings taking place at a municipal park, to large multi-day music festivals, involving some of the most famous music acts in the world. Nearly any type of music can be played at one of these concerts, and they frequently feature pop, folk, classical, or jazz artists. Largely electronic music, such as techno, are seldom featured because of the difficulties of staging the event. Some open-air concerts known as festivals take place over several days and feature a large number of different artists. Facilities Open-air concerts take great amounts of planning, to make sure that the stage is visible from the entire audience seating area. Frequently, the area directly in front of the stage is kept clear for dancing. In the case of punk concerts and other energetic music, this area becomes a mosh pit filled with a violently moving crowd. Generally, care is taken to keep the dancers off the stage, however at punk concerts, stagediving and other audience interaction are more common. Open-air concerts can be free for the audience, or may sell tickets for entrance. With ticketed events, these concerts are staged in planned, fenced-in areas, to avoid non-paying visitors. The fencing used is often temporary. Rain can wreak havoc at an open-air concert. The grass in front of the stage is often heavily damaged by concert-goers, and may need replanted after the event. Therefore, it is common that visitors get a partial refund on the ticket price if they donate a sack of grass seed at the entrance. Concerts can take place at a location not served by the public electricity grid. In these cases, the concert promoters set up emergency power generators. Many open-air concerts are very loud, and without the insulation of a building or arena to contain the noise, this also takes an amount of planning, to assure that the concert does not bother the neighbors. Often, these events are staged at a distance from residential areas. Many areas have noise regulations in place limiting the areas in which these large events can take place. For larger events, the stage is built from scaffolding and often includes a roof to protect electrical equipment from potential rain. This scaffolding rig holds lighting and other special effects equipment. Loudspeakers are frequently mounted to the right and left of the stage in towers, with the mixing console placed before the stage. Support functions are often placed in areas surrounding the audience. Concessions are sold from trailers and other temporary structures. If plumbing facilities are available, toilets are found in this area; in areas without plumbing, chemical portable toilets are used.

This old town still have some buildings, over 150 years old. After the independence of Pakistan, many Ahmadies moved in this town. While Rabwah (now Chennab Nagar) was under construction, Ahmadies built their Jamia, boarding house and other buildings. Ahmad Nagar has Primary and High Schools for boys and a high school for girls. There are several private English schools, one of them is Jabbar Coaching Centre, the oldest one. The first student of this school was Sultan Zafar. Ahmad Nagar has a Government Hospital and many private clinics. The main sports of the town are Cricket and Kabaddi, however, youth were used to play hockey, badminton, soccer, mero dabba, gully danda, and many other local games. Ahmad Nagar was in District Jhang, but now it's in Chiniot District. Geography Ahmadnagar is a town situated at the Faisalabad to Sargodha road in the Chiniot District. History In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin, In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh invaded and occupied Chiniot District. The Muslims faced severe restrictions during the Sikh rule. During the period of British rule, Chiniot District increased in population and importance. The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslims refugees from India settled down in the Chiniot District.

The company was privately funded and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, with an engineering center in Bangalore, India. Gluster was funded by Nexus Venture Partners and Index Ventures. Gluster was acquired by Red Hat on October 7, 2011. History The name Gluster comes from the combination of the terms GNU and cluster. Despite the similarity in names, Gluster is not related to the Lustre file system and does not incorporate any Lustre code. Gluster based its product on GlusterFS, an open-source software-based network-attached filesystem that deploys on commodity hardware. The initial version of GlusterFS was written by Anand Babu Periasamy, Gluster's founder and CTO. In May 2010 Ben Golub became the president and chief executive officer. Red Hat became the primary author and maintainer of the GlusterFS open-source project after acquiring the Gluster company in October 2011. The product was first marketed as Red Hat Storage Server, but in early 2015 renamed to be Red Hat Gluster Storage since Red Hat has also acquired the Ceph file system technology. Architecture The GlusterFS architecture aggregates compute, storage, and I/O resources into a global namespace. Each server plus attached commodity storage (configured as direct-attached storage, JBOD, or using a storage area network) is considered to be a node. Capacity is scaled by adding additional nodes or adding additional storage to each node. Performance is increased by deploying storage among more nodes. High availability is achieved by replicating data n-way between nodes. =Public cloud deployment= For public cloud deployments, GlusterFS offers an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon Machine Image (AMI), which is deployed on Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances rather than physical servers and the underlying storage is Amazon's Elastic Block Storage (EBS). In this environment, capacity is scaled by deploying more EBS storage units, performance is scaled by deploying more EC2 instances, and availability is scaled by n-way replication between AWS availability zones. =Private cloud deployment= A typical on-premises, or private cloud deployment will consist of GlusterFS installed as a virtual appliance on top of multiple commodity servers running hypervisors such as KVM, Xen, or VMware; or on bare metal.  GlusterFS  GlusterFS is a scale-out network-attached storage file system. It has found applications including cloud computing, streaming media services, and content delivery networks. GlusterFS was developed originally by Gluster, Inc. and then by Red Hat, Inc., as a result of Red Hat acquiring Gluster in 2011. In June 2012, Red Hat Storage Server was announced as a commercially supported integration of GlusterFS with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Red Hat bought Inktank Storage in April 2014, which is the company behind the Ceph distributed file system, and re-branded GlusterFS-based Red Hat Storage Server to \\"Red Hat Gluster Storage\\". = Design = GlusterFS aggregates various storage servers over Ethernet or Infiniband RDMA interconnect into one large parallel network file system. It is free software, with some parts licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) v3 while others are dual licensed under either GPL v2 or the Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v3. GlusterFS is based on a stackable user space design. GlusterFS has a client and server component. Servers are typically deployed as storage bricks, with each server running a daemon to export a local file system as a volume. The client process, which connects to servers with a custom protocol over TCP/IP, InfiniBand or Sockets Direct Protocol, creates composite virtual volumes from multiple remote servers using stackable translators. By default, files are stored whole, but striping of files across multiple remote volumes is also possible. The client may mount the composite volume using a GlusterFS native protocol via the FUSE mechanism or using NFS v3 protocol using a built-in server translator, or access the volume via the client library. The client may re-export a native-protocol mount, for example via the kernel NFSv4 server, SAMBA, or the object-based OpenStack Storage (Swift) protocol using the \\"UFO\\" (Unified File and Object) translator. Most of the functionality of GlusterFS is implemented as translators, including file-based mirroring and replication, file-based striping, file-based load balancing, volume failover, scheduling and disk caching, storage quotas, and volume snapshots with user serviceability (since GlusterFS version 3.6). The GlusterFS server is intentionally kept simple: it exports an existing directory as-is, leaving it up to client-side translators to structure the store. The clients themselves are stateless, do not communicate with each other, and are expected to have translator configurations consistent with each other. GlusterFS relies on an elastic hashing algorithm, rather than using either a centralized or distributed metadata model. The user can add, delete, or migrate volumes dynamically, which helps to avoid configuration coherency problems. This allows GlusterFS to scale up to several petabytes on commodity hardware by avoiding bottlenecks that normally affect more tightly coupled distributed file systems. GlusterFS provides data reliability and availability through various kinds of replication: replicated volumes and Geo-replication. Replicated volumes ensure that there exists at least one copy of each file across the bricks, so if one fails, data is still stored and accessible. Geo- replication provides a master-slave model of replication, where volumes are copied across geographically distinct locations. This happens asynchronously and is useful for availability in case of a whole data center failure. GlusterFS has been used as the foundation for academic research and a survey article. Red Hat markets the software for three markets: \\"on-premises\\", public cloud and \\"private cloud\\".

History Hadleigh is known for its castle, and the country park to the south of the town centre. This gives its name to the local government district of Castle Point, with its extensive views overlooking the Thames Estuary. Most of the facing stones were stripped from the castle in the 16th century ‚Äì the only bits still visible today being high inside the surviving towers and a small section of the 'gate house' ‚Äì so most of what remains today is the rubble infill that was packed between the outer facing stones.

The painting now belongs to the Yale Center for British Art, and is on permanent display in its museum on the Yale campus.John Constable. Hadleigh Castle. ‚Äì Olga's Gallery Based on the previous census, writing in 1848, Samuel Lewis, summarised the facts of its history and economy as follows: *It had 366 inhabitants. *The Poor Law Union covering the area was Rochford *In the reign of Henry II of England a castle was built here by Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent, the remains are situated on the brow of a steep hill, and consist chiefly of two circular towers. *The living is a discharged rectory, valued in the king's books at ¬£11. 14. 7.; net income, ¬£450 [per year]; patrons, the Rector and Fellows of Lincoln College, Oxford. The church is an ancient structure, of which the eastern end is semicircular, and in the Norman style. A school is endowed with ¬£781 three % consols. In the 19th century, Hadleigh was the home of the cunning man James Murrell. He died in the town in December 1860. The town has never had a railway station and almost all of its architecture is late 19th and 20th century ‚Äì only three buildings are listed but one of these is the church, which is Grade I listed.St James the Less Landmarks The castle ruins are set at the top of a hill overlooking the Thames Estuary, and the Canary Wharf development nearly 30 miles to the west can be seen when visibility is adequate. Another building of note is the Church of St James the Less which was believed to be Norman but is now known to be Saxon because of its general dimensions, window alignments, Saxon Romanesque arches, pagan Saxon puddingstone inclusions and the pagan Saxon \\"fairy wheel\\" motif carved into the wall by the north door. The church remains picturesque and its neighbouring street layout resembles St Clement Danes in that it stands in the middle of a bustling high street. However, it has a considerably larger churchyard. Salvation Army Farm Colony The colony was established in Hadleigh in 1891 by William Booth, a preacher who founded the Salvation Army Christian organisation. He believed every human being should have food and shelter and published a plan to rescue the destitute from the squalor of London. His vision was that the poor would be given board and lodgings in a City Colony in exchange for a day's work. They could then move to a Farm Colony where they would be trained to work the land and run their own smallholdings. Then finally they could progress to Overseas Colonies, running smallholdings abroad. The trial City Colony was set up in Whitechapel in 1889 and two years later Booth put down a deposit on land in Hadleigh for his Farm Colony. Starting with of land, later expanding to , the farm was home to 200 colonists by the end of its first year. Existing farm buildings were renovated and new dormitories, a bathhouse, laundry, reading room, hospital and religious meeting house were built. As well as farming and market gardening, colonists were taught brickmaking, pottery and construction skills. Today the colony operates an employment training centre for people who have special training needs, and accepts referrals from Social Services and the Employment Service. The aim is to create a realistic working environment, with the intention of helping clients gain the skills necessary for work elsewhere. Employment at the training centre ‚Äì reminiscent of the colony's origins ‚Äì includes horticulture, carpentry, catering, office skills and estate management. Governance Since the Local Government Act 1972, Hadleigh, along with Canvey Island, South Benfleet, and Thundersley has formed the local government district and borough of Castle Point.

Using the desktop software, those notes can be merged into the original document. This provides malleability, an important feature of physical books that is missing from most ebook products, allowing users to annotate, highlight, and personalize the text. Third-party development Because of its open Linux operating system, the iLiad was able to run third party applications created for it. Developers and users wishing to create or run third party applications had the ability to request shell access from the manufacturer. Developers were able to improve on the device's functionality by porting viewers such as FBReader, and programs such as abiword and stardict. Full screen PDF reading was made available by community- supported iPDF releases. Some independent users reported successful porting of mobile web browsers to iLiad's Linux platform, although with limited functionality and many bugs. Version 2 In September 2007, iRex Technologies released an update to the iLiad. While officially called \\"iLiad 2nd Edition\\", it is generally noted as a minor update to the original. The update includes: * Redesigned backplane * Increased battery capacity * Software version 2.11 * Updated travel charger * Included case The 2.11 software, which contains stylus calibration, extended battery life, and other things, is also available to first-generation iLiads. Book edition In May 2008, iRex Technologies added a third installment to the iLiad line of products, this time branded under the name iLiad Book Edition. This is the iLiad Version 2 without WiFi and a new silver look. The technical cutbacks reduce the price to $599 (‚Ç¨499), which is cheaper than the original. It also comes with 50 free classics, including works from well-known writers Jules Verne, Charles Dickens, Lewis Carroll, and Leo Tolstoy. Bankruptcy In early June 2010, iRex Technologies of the Netherlands filed for Bankruptcy protection. According to CEO Hans Brons (2010), the decline in sales were a direct result of a delayed response from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to approve the device. iRex files for bankruptcy following lackluster sales, electronista, MNM Media, LLC, 9 June 2010 See also * Comparison of e-readers References External links * List of third- party applications * French newspaper Les Echos on the iLiad * Dutch specialist in e-Paper for education, training and knowledge management * A discussion thread containing large device images * Feedbooks: e-books and news for the iLiad * Dream reader: iRex iLiad Some stats and photos of iRex iLiad.

After graduating as a reader of philosophy at the British Museum Reading Room, Thomas began his life in the theater at Ellen Stewart's La MaMa E.T.C. in New York City. During this period Thomas became an illustrator for the Op-Ed page of the New York Times while conducting workshops at La MaMa E.T.C. where he adapted and directed world premieres of Samuel Beckett's prose and dramatic pieces. In the early 80s, Thomas began working with Beckett himself in Paris (after a lot of correspondence had been exchanged between them for almost two years), adapting new fiction by the author. Of these, the more notorious were All Strange Away and That Time starring the Living Theatre founder, Julian Beck in his only stage acting role outside of his own company. In the mid-80s, Thomas became involved with German author Heiner M√ºller, directing his works in the US and Brazil, and began a long-term partnership with American composer Philip Glass. In 1985 Thomas formed and established his Dry Opera Company, in S√£o Paulo. It has performed in 15 countries up until 2008 (see list of works below). In 2009 he wrote a manifesto declaring his \\"goodbye-to-theater\\" yet, in 2010, Thomas announced to Stage News that he was to set up his Dry Opera Company in London. Its first production, \\"Throats,\\" written and directed by Thomas, began performances at the Pleasance Theater in Islington on Feb. 18, 2011. In 2016, Thomas‚Äôs autobiography \\"Between Two Lines\\" or \\"Entre Duas Fileiras\\", is released by Grupo Editorial Record. The blurb on the back cover is by Oscar Nominee and Golden Globe winner Fernanda Montenegro (and protagonist of Thomas‚Äôs \\"The Flash and Crash Days\\") writes : \\"Gerald Thomas exists by virtue of his devastating quality, his inconstancy, his nonconformity, his aggressiveness, his faith laden disbelief, his life affirming death cult; through his clear and powerful incongruence; by laughing and crying like an innocent and somehow ominous child, by loving the neighbor he hates; by being an unexpectedly good, adorable boy and friend; by accepting and forswearing you in seconds; by loving you madly, by cursing you while blessing you; for his devilish, eternal and nonconformist Art is monstrously creative. His Art is unique upon our stages and in our lives. If you have seen or experienced it, it will remain unforgotten.\\" On November 11, 2017, Gerald Thomas opened his new production ‚ÄúDiluvio‚Äù at SESC Anchieta- Consola√ß√£o, in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, after a three-year absence from the theater. Cast: Maria de Lima, Lisa Giobbi, Julia Wilkins, Ana Gabi, Beatrice Sayd, Isabella Lemos, Andr√© Bortolanza, Ronaldo Zero, Wagner Pinto and Dora Le√£o.

This piece was commissioned by composer J√∏rgen Teller and performed by Gerald himself plus partner Lisa Giobbi. It was to be a brief staged reading (a reduced compilation from his autobiography Between Two Lines), but turned out to be a full evening of drama, comedy and dance thanks to this partnership with Lisa. Lighting was done by Gerald‚Äôs long term lighting designer Peter Glatz (Danish). ;2017 * On November 11, 2017, Gerald Thomas opened his new production ‚ÄúDiluvio‚Äù at SESC Anchieta- Consola√ß√£o, in S√£o Paulo, Brazil ;2016 * In 2016, Thomas‚Äôs autobiography \\"Between Two Lines\\" is released by Grupo Editorial Record.

The Sunday Times Rich List estimated his wealth at ¬£162m (US$238m) , making him the 497th richest person in Britain. The Romanian magazine Capital reckoned Timi»ô to be the 9th richest Romanian, estimating his wealth at $290m . In 2012 he became the richest Romanian with a net worth of ¬£1.34 billion (US$2.13 billion). A BBC News investigation alleged that Timi»ô paid ¬£35.20 in tax in 2017 despite living a life of luxury, and included a statement from the Tax Justice Network suggesting that Timi»ô be investigated for tax fraud. Early life Born in Bor»ôa, Maramure»ô County, he graduated from a vocational school for auto mechanics. He left Romania and settled as a refugee in Perth, Western Australia.Centrul Rom√¢n pentru Jurnalism de Investiga»õii \\"Vasile Frank Timi≈ü, the Mastermind Behind the 'Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ' Operation\\" Whilst in Australia he was convicted of possession of heroin with intent to supply and fined A$27,000. Career =Companies in Australia= Timi»ô started his own transport company in Australia, which owned only one truck driven by himself. However, it went bankrupt in 1986 with debts of 15,806 AUD. According to Jurnalul Na»õional, Timi»ô failed to declare this fact in the CV he published when he listed the company Gabriel Resources on the Toronto Stock Exchange, as required by law.Radu, Paul Christian, Jurnalul Na»õional, \\"Via»õa secret«é a lui Vasile Frank Timi»ô\\" 23 June 2005 (English translation) In 1992, he became the CEO of Morwest Holdings Pty Ltd, the first of his gold mining businesses. Timi»ô and two Australian miners dug for six months for gold in a region called Mosquito Creek, but the result was a failure. In the meantime, he founded another three companies: Riverdale Mining, Timis Corporation, and Carpathian Investments, together with Ioana Timi»ô and his sister, Ioana Majdik. However, these companies were liquidated by Timi»ô, and all creditors were paid in full. Another setback was Timi»ô' investment in Pneumatic Systems International Pty Ltd. In 2001, he quit his investment and kept only 11.6% of the company, administered via a new company, Regal Group Services, in the British Virgin Islands tax haven. According to an ex-manager of the company, in 2003, those shares were worth under A$1,500. Regal Group Services changed its name and headquarters, and is currently listed on the London Stock Exchange as Regal Petroleum. This company is associated with a Romanian company, Global Mineral Resources, owned by a son of a former Romanian senator of the Democratic Party, Teodor HƒÉucƒÉ, who used to be secretary of the Economic Commission of the Romanian Senate between 1996 and 2000. =Gabriel Resources= In 1995, Timi»ô founded Gabriel Resources NL Australia, and in the autumn of the same year, the Romanian state-owned mining company \\"Regia AutonomƒÉ a Cuprului din Deva\\" (RAC) announced that it was searching for a partnership with a foreign company for the mining of precious metals from the tailings in Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ and GurabarzƒÉ-Brad. However, Jurnalul Na»õional claims that it has documents indicating a collaboration signed by RAC Deva and Gabriel Resources one day before the announcement was published, on 4 September 1995. Also, RAC claimed it received several offers, including from another Australian company, Lycopodium Pty Ltd., but that company has denied RAC's claim. According to ASIC, in April 1996, Gabriel Resources NL had financial problems with its creditors, including the National Australia Bank, and Timi»ô started a new company after paying all creditors in full, Gabriel Resources Limited, registered in the Jersey tax haven. The mining contract was redirected to the new company. Timi»ô had an 80% stake in the joint company. The Romanian Agency of Mineral Resources declared that the new contract was unfavourable to the Romanian state, but it was allowed by the Government after a parliamentary vote.Academia Ca»õavencu, \\"Frank Timis a inhatat aurul din Apuseni printr-o caruta de falsuri, iar Tariceanu a inchis ochii\\" 19 April 2005 Timi»ô had access to various databanks of the Romanian research institutes of mineralogy and got data on the area. His company also hired relevant scientists and an ex-officer of the Topographic Department of the Romanian Ministry of Defence who mapped the area. Gabriel Resources sent 80 tonnes of ore to a research lab in Australia to measure the gold content. The ore was high in gold, and the market value of Gabriel Resources soared to $75 million. Timi»ô obtained a $3 million loan from the Rothschild bank in the United States. Between 1999 and 2000, the area being mined was increased from 12 km2 to 22 km2, and then to 42.8 km2. The resulting project in Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ has been a source of much controversy, with local people lining up on both sides of the issue, and some national and international environmental groups joining the opposition. One source of controversy involved the method used for mining, gold cyanidation, which causes pollution. The company hopes to eventually extract 300 tonnes of gold and 1600 tonnes of silver from the area but the project is currently on hold. =Regal Petroleum= Regal Petroleum, founded by Timi»ô in November 1996, was listed on the London Alternative Investment Market and owned some oil and gas resources in Romania and Ukraine. However, it became famous after the September 2003 acquisition of 60% of an oilfield located in Kavala, Greece. The Regal board hoped that the company's survey team had found one of the largest oil deposits in Europe: up to a billion barrels. The oil was allegedly under so much pressure that it almost destroyed the drilling platform.The Sunday Times 22 May 2005 \\"Focus: The gusher\\" This hype drove Regal's share price up to a peak of 509p, with the company's market value reaching ¬£500m, making it one of the highest-valued companies of the Alternative Investment Market. Many private investors and respectable institutions (including Merrill Lynch, Commerzbank, Artemis and Schroders) invested more than ¬£45m in the company. Days later, Timi»ô secretly agreed to sell the company's assets\\"New Regal shock as ex-chairman's secret sell-off deal is revealed\\" 21 June 2005 and then resigned as chief executive of the company.The Guardian, \\"Regal chairman resigns \\" 8 June 2005 By mid-2005, it was clear that Regal's oil field contained oil but not in commercial amounts. The flow rates were around 30 barrels a day and \\"deemed to be non-commercial\\". In a few hours, the stock fell by more than 60%, and as of June 2006, the share price was at 65p, less than 20% of the peak price. In 2010, the company was still worth about ¬£200m, and had cash reserves of ¬£80m,\\"Regal losses widen after 'difficult' year\\" 27 June 2006 In February 2006, Regal lost its Ukraine gas production license in a trial but got it back through appeal one year later.The Guardian, In June 2005, an environmental group, Alburnus Maior, asked the Romanian Supreme Court, under the freedom of information laws, whether Timi»ô was under any investigations. The answer was that his name was linked with three dossiers investigated by the organised crime department. However, Timi»ô denied all the claims and no charges were ever filed.The Independent, \\"Regal's Timis named in Romania organised crime investigation\\" 6 June 2005 Later queries to the Romanian administration on this subject were given the answer that there are no investigations concerning Timi»ô.Averea, \\"Dosarele lui Frank Timis s-au evaporat\\" 6 June 2005 Due to the collapse in the share price of this company, the Alternative Investment Market decided in 2006 to toughen regulations for companies in the natural resources sector and to hire experts who would prevent future bubbles followed by price fluctuations.Accountancy Age, AIM recruits to beef up rules\\" 15 June 2006 The company has, however, recently been given back licences that had been frozen by the government, and has begun to produce oil again. =African Minerals (AMI.L, was Sierra Leone Diamond Corporation)= In 2005, the Timi»ô Trust bought 30% of the shares of the Sierra Leone Diamond Corporation, via the Trust's Bermuda-registered Timis Diamond Corporation Limited. SLDC holds mineral rights over a third of the area of Sierra Leone in the northern part of the country,Awareness Times Newspaper, Sierra Leone \\"Romanian buys more Sierra Leone Diamonds shares\\" , 22 July 2005 including some important diamond fields and the Tonkolili & Marampa Iron Ore Projects. The company is also exploring for uranium at Lovetta, and for gold and base metals in the Sula Mountains, Gori Hills and Nimini Hills. On 16 August 2007 the AIM-listed company was renamed African Minerals Limited (AMI.L) to reflect these other interests.,London Stock Exchange RNS, Change of Name On 15 March 2010 AMI announced an initial Mineral Resource estimate of over 10 billion tonnes of iron ore (independently valued) at an average grade of 29.9% Total Iron in the Numbara and Simbili targets at Tonkolili. Timi»ô, who is executive chairman of the company, increased his shareholding to 34% in June 2006London Stock Exchange RNS, Directors Share Dealings, 29 June 2006 and to 34.6% (40,875,002 shares) in September 2006.London Stock Exchange RNS, Directors Share Dealings, 29 September 2006 the entire company was worth ¬£45m (US$65m). In 2015, Frank Timis together with then CEO Alan Watling and CFO Matthew Hird took African Minerals into administration. The company has been forced to sell its 75% share to Shandong Iron and Steel Group for a grossly undervalued sum. Half year results for AMI were impressive, the Company posted a quarterly production of 4mt ‚Äì an improvement of 81% on the prior 3 months. In January 2014 AMI hit its operating capacity for the first time, producing 5.3mt and exporting 4.6mt in the first quarter. Earnings for the company were US$203m in 2013 compared with a US$26.5m in 2012. Despite the best efforts of the team and management, the continued downturn in iron ore prices, slowing global growth and China's appetite and the Ebola crisis (which infected almost 15,000 and claimed 4,000 lives) left AMI exposed. The downturn in iron ore prices from US$128.12 in January 2014 decreased rapidly over coming months reaching US$68 in December 2014 and US$63 in February 2015. This combined with the Ebola crises created a perfect storm for the beleaguered mining company. Shandong refused to release remaining funds (US$100m) and their lawyers Linklater's recognised a perfect opportunity to take over buying 75% of AMI shares at a grossly undervalued price and through a process that was anything but transparent. The Board, management and Timis fought passionately to keep the company from going to administration, but given the perfect storm it was facing and like many other junior mining Companies then and since, there was no alternative but administration. Timis lost all of his $450m investment as did the institution investors, shareholders and bond holders. AMI was operating as Shan Steel under Chinese leadership until they recently left the tonkolili project with the loss of all jobs created by Frank Timis and AML. = African Petroleum = Timi»ô was formerly the non-executive chairman of African Petroleum, he stepped off the board and any role in Governance in African Petroleum in October 2014 and this remained a precondition of the subsequent and current listing on the Oslo Bors.

Allegations of tax fraud  A BBC News investigation accused Timi»ô of paying only ¬£35.20 in income tax in 2017, despite living a life of luxury. The BBC alleged that payments received in 2017 totalling ¬£670,000 from an offshore trust were described retrospectively as untaxable loans to avoid paying taxes on them. John Christiansen, Director and Chair of the Board of the Tax Justice Network, told the BBC that Timi»ô appeared to be dodging tax: \\"It all points to this being a manoeuvre to cheat the tax man. And, if that is the case, because it's been done retrospectively, there seems to be prima facie evidence that this is tax fraud and it should be investigated.\\" Timi»ô's lawyers told the BBC that he has fully complied with all of his tax obligations. Allegations of corruption Investigative journalism by BBC Panorama and Africa Eye accuses Frank Timi»ô of corruptly acquiring exploration rights of Cayar Offshore Profond and St. Louis Offshore Profond blocks, off the coast of Senegal. In 2012, Timi»ô-owned company called Petro-Tim was awarded a licence to explore the blocks despite having no known track record in the industry. Soon after, Aliou Sall, the brother of the President of Senegal, Macky Sall, was hired by the company, allegedly to ensure Petro-Tim could keep these rights. The BBC program further alleges that Petro-Tim paid tax worth US$250,000 to the President's brother instead of the Senegalese government. Further accusations concern the involvement of Kosmos Energy and BP in the development of the field, potentially leading to billion- dollar royalty payments from BP to Timis Corporation. Timi»ô has denied the accusations.

Following his return from the Dundee United loan spell, Cummings was again loaned to Bournemouth, for a three-month spell, before signing a permanent deal with the club. He went on to make 23 appearances for \\"The Cherries\\" in that season, helping them win promotion via the playoffs. In the following season he established himself as a first team player, making 46 appearances in total and scoring 2 goals.

However, during an away derby with Swindon Town in March 2005, he suffered a double broken leg in a crunch tackle by Swindon's Steve Jenkins. This was a major blow to both Cummings and Bournemouth, and was a major factor in them failing in their playoff bid. Nonetheless, Cummings signed a new deal with Bournemouth in the summer of 2006. He made his league return as a late substitute in the 3‚Äì0 defeat to Chesterfield at the start of the 2006‚Äì07 campaign. In June 2007 Cummings signed a new two-year deal with Bournemouth.

Still suffering from the injury suffered at the end of 2009, Tuiaki failed to make any appearances in the 2010 season. There were some doubts whether Tuiaki would ever make a full recovery, and Wests Tigers signed him to an incentive-based contract for 2011, with bonuses for playing in set number of games. Despite undergoing three operations, the ankle had still not gained full strength when Tuiaki announced his retirement before the start of the 2011 season, saying, \\"It's a real disappointment.

In 1967, D. S. Johnson reported the species to be common in blackwaters of southern Malaya. Of largely unremarkable Betta appearance, B. picta attains an overall length of 6 cm (2.4 in). It is noted for the pale bars on the male's back, absent in other similar Betta species. Mouthbrooders, spotted bettas spawn en masse when triggered by water changes; this is likely to be an adaptation to reduce the chances, by saturating the environment with young, of individual fry falling prey to predators. This betta spawns readily and prolifically in captivity, producing easily raised fry. Even though it is easily kept and bred, it is not one of the more popular Betta species among hobbyists, likely because, in the words of one B. picta keeper, \\"many just can not get excited by watching a drab colored fish that spends most of its time hiding away under the rocks and behind the plants.\\" Originally described by Valenciennes and assigned to genus Panchax (as P. pictum). It was found that Bleeker's Betta trifasciata, described in 1850 and used as the type species of his genus Betta, was identical to P. pictum. As the original type specimens are now lost, H. H.

Formerly named University College Plymouth St Mark & St John, the institution was awarded full university status in 2013. The Vice-Chancellor of the university is Rob Warner who joined in March 2017.  History  Original college building in Chelsea A model of the Chelsea Campus The university's history dates back to the foundation by the National Society (now National Society for Promoting Religious Education) of the constituent London colleges of St John's College in Battersea, London (1840) and St Mark's College in Chelsea, London (1841). St Mark's College was founded upon the beliefs of The Reverend Derwent Coleridge, son of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, its first principal: that its primary purpose was to widen the educational horizons of its students. During the First World War, St Mark's College was requisitioned by the War Office to create the 2nd London General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. St John's College was established by Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth, together with Edward Carleton Tufnell, as a teacher training institution. These colleges merged in 1923, establishing a single institution in Chelsea as the College of St Mark & St John. In 1973 came the move to Plymouth due to the college outgrowing the Chelsea campus. Not mentioned here is that there was a proposal by the GLC, in the late 1960's to build a large road over the West London Extension Railway which bordered on the college site. This would have impacted the site badly taking away a lot of space and demolishing many buildings. This is when/why the move to Plymouth first started. By the time the road scheme was abandoned it was too late to stop the move. This move was a subject of great sadness to many people, staff and former students, associated with the college at this location. Many of the staff did not move to Plymouth as they preferred to stay in London. There was plenty of room on the site to grow as can be seen from the development that has taken place since then which has incorporated much of the original fabric of the college as well as a substantial number of large residential buildings. (Personal note. I was a student there during this period), In 1991 the college became affiliated to the University of Exeter, which accredited it to run undergraduate and postgraduate programmes leading to degree awards of the University of Exeter, and in 2007, gained University College status, as the University College Plymouth St Mark & St John. It was awarded full university status as Plymouth Marjon University in 2013. Campus The main entrance to the campus in Derriford, Plymouth in April 2014 The university campus several miles north of Plymouth city centre, next to Derriford Hospital. Residential accommodation is provided, with all first year students guaranteed a place. In 2013 a major investment programme in campus facilities was completed, with new sport and exercise science laboratories, extensive indoor and outdoor sports provision, theatre, media centre and music studio.

A fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, she was named a 2011 MacArthur Fellow (the ‚ÄúGenius Grant‚Äù). Background Stallings was born and raised in Decatur, Georgia and studied classics at the University of Georgia (A.B., 1990) and the University of Oxford (MSt in Latin Literature, 1991, Lady Margaret Hall). She is an editor with the Atlanta Review. In 1999, Stallings moved to Athens, Greece and has lived there ever since. She is the Poetry Program Director of the Athens Centre. She is married to John Psaropoulos, who was the editor of the Athens News. Stallings's poetry uses traditional forms, and she has been associated with the New Formalism. She is a frequent contributor of poems and essays to Poetry magazine and the Times Literary Supplement. Her work has been published in The New Yorker, The Atlantic, The New York Review of Books, The Times Literary Supplement, The Sewanee Review, Beloit Poetry Journal, and many other publications. She has published four books of original verse: Archaic Smile (1999), Hapax (2006), Olives (2012) and Like (2018). In 2007, she published a verse translation of Lucretius's De Rerum Natura (The Nature of Things) and, in 2018, a verse translation of Hesiod's Works and Days, both with Penguin Classics. Critical response Sir Christopher Ricks, widely regarded as the greatest living critic of English-language poetry, writes: \\"The poems of A.E.Stallings are never less than the true voice of feeling, and always more...she is able to realize in her poems the myriad minds of Europe.\\" In 2015, Ricks nominated Stallings to be the Oxford Professor of Poetry. The MacArthur Fellowship committee praised her \\"mastery\\" of poetic form, declaring that: \\"[t]hrough her technical dexterity and graceful fusion of content and form, Stallings is revealing the timelessness of poetic expression and antiquity's relevance for today.\\" In a review for her book Archaic Smile, Able Muse, a formalist online poetry journal, noted that, \\"For all of Stallings' formal virtuosity, few of her poems are strictly metrically regular. Indeed, one of the pleasant surprises of Archaic Smile is the number of superb poems in the gray zone between free and blank verse.\\" Her work has been favorably compared to the poetry of Richard Wilbur and Edna St. Vincent Millay. In a review of her second book, Hapax, Peter Campion critically wrote that, \\"The meter and rhyme unfold elegantly, but at the expense of idiom,\\" a criticism that is commonly aimed at the Formalist poets. On a positive note, Campion also states that, \\"[her best poems in the collection] match prosodic talent with intensely rendered feelings.\\" In a review for her collection Olives, Publishers Weekly stated that they were most impressed with those poems that were not responses to ancient mythology, noting, \\"When she unleashes her technical gifts upon poems in which she builds a new narrative instead of building upon an old one, Stallings achieves a restrained, stark poise that is threatening even by New Formalism standards.\\" Awards Her debut poetry collection, Archaic Smile, was awarded the 1999 Richard Wilbur Award and was a finalist for both the Yale Younger Poets Series and the Walt Whitman Award. Her second collection, Hapax (2006), was awarded the 2008 Poets' Prize. Her poems have appeared in The Best American Poetry anthologies of 1994, 2000, 2015, 2016, and 2017. She has been awarded a Pushcart Prize, the Eunice Tietjens Prize, the 2004 Howard Nemerov Sonnet Award, and the James Dickey Prize. In 2010, she was awarded the Willis Barnstone Translation Prize. In 2011, she won a Guggenheim Fellowship, received a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship and was named a Fellow of United States Artists. In 2012, the book Olives was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. She is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences.

In 2007, Norman founded the Conservative Co-operative Movement. Norman's later books include The Big Society: The Anatomy of the New Politics (2010), published by University of Buckingham Press, a biography of Edmund Burke, which was long-listed for the 2013 Samuel Johnson Prize for Non- Fiction, and Adam Smith: What He Thought, and Why It Matters (2018), published by Allen Lane. Parliamentary career Norman won the new seat of Hereford and South Herefordshire at the 2010 General election with a 5.1% majority over the Liberal Democrats. He was a member of the Treasury Select Committee from July 2010 to March 2015, is Chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Employee Ownership, founder of the PFI Rebate Campaign and founding member of the Campaign for an Effective Second Chamber which campaigns for the House of Lords to be appointed rather than elected. On 10 July 2012, Norman was identified as a ringleader of the rebellion over the House of Lords Reform package presented to the House of Commons. On the vote being overturned, Government Whips suggested to David Cameron that before the debate \\"Norman had spread a rumour to rally rebels\\" the Prime Minister was in reality unenthusiastic about the reforms. Immediately after the intensive debate, culminating in a narrow Government defeat by Labour's rejection of the Lords Election proposals as tabled, Cameron is reported to have confronted Norman in the Members' Lobby telling him that such \\"conduct [misrepresenting Cameron to rally Lords Reform dissenters] was 'not honourable'\\"; Norman then withdrew in the direction of the Members' Bar but allegedly was immediately stopped and escorted from the Palace of Westminster by four Whips. Despite assertions by the then-Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband, a spokesman denied that there had been a heated argument, saying that Cameron had merely told Norman he had misrepresented his views. Miliband, then also leader of the Labour Party, described the scene as \\"fisticuffs in the Lobby\\" at Prime Minister's Questions the following day.Hansard 11 July 2012 : Column 302 Accounts of the severity of Cameron's words or gestures used vary (from the \\"Etonian Hairdryer\\") to no close finger-pointing at all and The Daily Telegraph wrote that cynics say this \\"public argument may have been staged\\" to try to prove to Liberal Democrats that Cameron shared their vision of Lords Reform. In 2013, Norman said that so many Old Etonians were in government positions because of Eton's \\"ethos\\" of public service that \\"other schools don't imbue the same commitment\\". Later on Twitter, Norman said his comments were \\"defending one institution, not attacking others\\". Norman describes his educational background as following \\"an educational argument between my mother, who despised any form of privilege, and my father, who took the view that he had set up his own business, so he was entitled to spend money on his kids' education\\". Norman was sacked from Downing Street's Policy Board after rebelling against the Government again in opposition to military intervention in Syria. On 27 June 2014, just prior to the nomination of Jean-Claude Juncker to the presidency of the European Commission, Norman gave his wholehearted support of Cameron's stance, as being \\"absolutely right ... in opposing Mr Juncker\\". He argued firstly that the EU constitution requires elected heads to choose its \\"President\\" and secondly that Juncker's manifesto fails to tackle what he (Norman) sees as the President's duty to address the unpopularity of EU mandates. He then asserted that democracy, for the British, involves legitimacy derived from the ballot box, whereas for some Europeans, it involves centralised bureaucracy. In September 2014 Norman raised the issue of rules concerning football club ownership in the House of Commons, alleging the then-Chairman of Hereford United had a criminal conviction, in support of Supporters Trust's campaign to oust the Agombar r√©gime at Hereford Utd FC. On 19 December 2014, the club was wound up in the High Court. =Chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee= On 19 June 2015, his election as Chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee was announced. On 8 September 2015 at a hearing of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee convened to discuss recent allegation of blood doping in athletics, Norman said the following \\"When you hear the London Marathon, potentially the winners or medallists at the London Marathon, potentially British athletes are under suspicion for very high levels of blood doping... \\" thus seemingly using parliamentary privilege to implicate Paula Radcliffe as being involved, since she is the only British London Marathon winner since 1996. This prompted Radcliffe to respond with a statement denying any involvement in doping though Norman said it wasn't his intention to implicate any individual. =Brexit= Norman chose not to publicly reveal how he voted over the UK's continued membership of the European Union in the 2016 referendum saying only, \\"A referendum is not an act of representative government and I am not a minister, so my vote can properly be a private one.\\" In 2017, Norman expressed support for his fellow Old Etonian Jacob Rees-Mogg to lead the party. Norman subsequently felt obliged to contact the newspaper concerned to say that his was a light-hearted response to a question in an interview about whether Rees- Mogg would make a good candidate and he was not backing him. In November 2019, he was appointed to be a member of the Privy Council.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Colorado Rockies, Cleveland Indians and Baltimore Orioles. Jim√©nez was an MLB All-Star in 2010. That year, he pitched the first no-hitter in Rockies' franchise history. Jimenez earned his 100th MLB career victory on September 22, 2015 as a member of the Baltimore Orioles, while pitching against the Washington Nationals. In 2016, he became an American citizen. Career =Colorado Rockies= 2006-2008 Jim√©nez made his MLB debut on September 26, 2006. He came in as a relief pitcher for the Colorado Rockies during the eighth inning of an 11‚Äì4 home loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. He allowed two hits and no runs. He would make his first MLB start on October 1 against the Chicago Cubs on the road, which was the last game of the regular season. Jim√©nez allowed three hits and three earned runs over a span of innings in an 8‚Äì5 loss. He didn't receive a decision for the game. Jim√©nez earned his first MLB win on July 29, 2007 at home against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He pitched six innings, giving up four hits and two earned runs. The Rockies won the game, 9‚Äì6. On September 5, he gained the distinction of giving up Barry Bonds's 762nd and final career home run. Jim√©nez made his Major League Baseball postseason debut on October 6 during Game 3 of the 2007 National League Division Series in Colorado against the Philadelphia Phillies. He started the game and pitched six innings, allowing three hits and one earned run, as part of a 2‚Äì1 victory (the win gave the Rockies a series sweep over the Phillies). However, Jim√©nez didn't receive a decision for the game. He started his second consecutive game of the postseason on October 12, which was Game 2 of the 2007 National League Championship Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks on the road. He pitched five innings, giving up one hit and one earned run. The Rockies would eventually win the game, 3‚Äì2, but Jim√©nez received his second straight postseason no-decision. Colorado swept Arizona and faced the Boston Red Sox in the 2007 World Series. Jim√©nez started Game 2, suffering a 2‚Äì1 loss in Boston. He allowed three hits and two earned runs in innings. Boston went on to sweep Colorado. In 2008, Jim√©nez went 12‚Äì12 with a 3.99 earned run average. His 34 starts led the National League. He threw the fastest fastball among starters in the Major Leagues, averaging 94.9 mph. 2009-2011 During the 2008 offseason, Jim√©nez signed a four-year, $10-million dollar contract with a club option up to 2013‚Äì14. In the 2009 season, he went 15‚Äì12 with a 3.47 ERA, his second full season as a starter in the majors. Jim√©nez pitched at least six innings in a franchise-record 25 consecutive starts from May 1 to September 7. Colorado Rockies in 2010 Jim√©nez pitched for the Dominican Republic during the 2009 World Baseball Classic. On March 10, he set a single-start strikeout record, fanning 10 of the 13 batters he faced during his 65-pitch, four-inning performance in Round One against the Netherlands. On April 17, 2010, Jim√©nez no-hit the Atlanta Braves 4‚Äì0 at Turner Field, the first no-hitter in the history of the franchise. He walked 6 batters, while striking out 7, and throwing a career- high 128 pitches (72 for strikes). He faced 31 batters in the game. The no- hitter was preserved by a diving catch in center field by Dexter Fowler in the bottom of the seventh inning. Jim√©nez's fastball reached 100 mph three times during the game, and it averaged 96.8 mph. During the no-hitter, Jim√©nez switched from the windup to the stretch delivery after issuing a lead-off walk in the fifth inning (his sixth total walk of the game). Following the switch, he didn't allow a walk for the remainder of the game. Jim√©nez also helped his own cause offensively, scoring Brad Hawpe with a fourth-inning single; he himself scored on a Carlos Gonz√°lez double one batter later. Jim√©nez was named the National League Pitcher of the Month for April, becoming the second pitcher in Rockies history to win a Pitcher of the Month award. Jim√©nez was only the second pitcher in MLB history to throw a no-hitter and notch five wins in the month of April. He also set a franchise record for consecutive scoreless innings () for a starting pitcher (the streak was eventually snapped on May 3 after straight scoreless innings). He broke that mark shortly thereafter, as he went 33 straight scoreless innings from May to June, which was a franchise record for not only starting pitchers, but relievers as well (Gabe White previously held the team record of 29 consecutive scoreless innings). Jim√©nez became the first pitcher since Jack Morris in 1986 to have two streaks of at least 25 consecutive scoreless innings in one season. He was again named National League Pitcher of the Month for May. He became the first pitcher in Rockies history to win the award more than once and the first pitcher since Pedro Mart√≠nez in 1999 to win the award in April and May. Jim√©nez was the third pitcher in MLB history to win 11 out of his first 12 games and have an ERA below 1.00 (0.93). He had the lowest ERA (0.78) in MLB history through 11 starts. In his one loss, he went seven innings, giving up two hits and one earned run in a 2‚Äì0 road loss against the Los Angeles Dodgers. On July 4, 2010, Jim√©nez was one of two Rockies, along with shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, selected as a National League All-Star to play in the 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California. He entered the game leading all Major League pitchers with a 15‚Äì1 record and a 2.20 ERA (as of July 8). On July 12, 2010, Jim√©nez was named the starting pitcher for the National League All-Star team ahead of fellow NL aces Tim Lincecum, Roy Halladay, and Adam Wainwright. In two scoreless innings he threw 25 pitches with two hits, one strikeout, one walk, and 3 baserunners. 2010 was the NL's first All-Star win since 1996 and Jim√©nez's first All-Star selection. Jim√©nez would finish the season on a rough note, going 4‚Äì7 after the All star break. Jim√©nez finished 19‚Äì8 and an ERA of 2.88 in 221.1 innings pitched for the Rockies. The following season, Jim√©nez through 21 starts was 6‚Äì9 for the Rockies, who at the time were considering trading Ubaldo. =Cleveland Indians= Jim√©nez signs autographs for fans prior to a game against the Tampa Bay Rays On July 31, 2011, Jim√©nez was traded to the Cleveland Indians in exchange for Alex White, Joe Gardner, Matt McBride and Drew Pomeranz. Tom Verducci wrote in Sports Illustrated shortly before the trade \\"Jimenez has terrific stuff, a powerful frame and the work ethic of a blast furnace\\" but was working an alarming number of innings in high altitude conditions and putting strain on the Rockies' ace. Jim√©nez would later recount the difficult days he had with the Rockies organization in a 2012 interview during spring training. \\"It was kind of hard being with the Rockies. I went through a lot of things people outside the organization don't know. But me and the people in the front office know.\\" On April 2, 2012, Jim√©nez was suspended five games by MLB for hitting former teammate Troy Tulowitzki with a pitch on the elbow the previous day. They walked toward each other and were separated, but no punches were thrown and no ejections were made. Jim√©nez was in conflict with Tulowitzki after he and former teammate Carlos Gonz√°lez got lucrative contract extensions after the 2010 season, while Jim√©nez did not. He originally intended to appeal the suspension but later decided against doing so. In a start against the Toronto Blue Jays on July 14, Jim√©nez struggled with his command and had his shortest outing on the season, being pulled after 2 1/3 innings, and matched a career-high 8 earned runs. In his previous 7 games his ERA was 2.14 but after the loss, his record fell to 8‚Äì8 and ERA rose to 5.09. Jim√©nez finished with a career worst 17 losses while winning 9 games for the Indians. He also led the league in wild pitches with 16. Jim√©nez rebounded in 2013, finishing with a record of 13‚Äì9 in 32 starts for the Indians. He also dropped his ERA to 3.30, 2 runs lower from the previous season. Jim√©nez elected to opt out of the final year of his contract with the Indians and became a free agent on November 1, 2013. =Baltimore Orioles= 2014 On February 19, 2014, Jim√©nez's successful 2013 season earned him a 4-year $50 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles. In his first start with the Orioles, Jimenez threw six innings against the Red Sox, getting tagged for four runs and a loss. He would go on to lose his next three decisions, as the Orioles lost in his first five starts. He pitched to a 6.59 ERA and went 0‚Äì4 in his first month with the O's. His first win as a member of the Orioles came on May 2, when he tossed 7 scoreless innings against the Twins. On July 11, 2014, Jimenez was placed on the 15-day DL due to a right ankle sprain. In his first season with Baltimore, Jimenez was 6‚Äì9 with a 4.81 ERA in 25 games (22 starts). He was included on the team's ALDS roster, but did not pitch in the series. Despite being on the ALDS roster, Jimenez was left off of the O's ALCS roster against the Kansas City Royals. After this failed season the Orioles President Dan Duquette refused to cut him or trade him because the team believed he could bring back that half a season of success. 2015 On April 11, 2015, in his first start of the season, Jimenez pitched 7 shutout innings, against the Toronto Blue Jays. He allowed only two base runners, a single by Jos√© Reyes in the 4th, and a walk to him in 6th, and struck out 8. On April 17, 2015, in a start against the Boston Red Sox, Jim√©nez was ejected for the first time in his career by home plate umpire Jordan Baker. Jim√©nez had hit Pablo Sandoval in the right shoulder. Baker deemed the hit by pitch intentional, after Sandoval had slid into second baseman Jonathan Schoop, to break up a double play.https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league- stew/ubaldo-jimenez-was-ejected-from-no-hit-bid-after-plunking-pablo- sandoval-154647839.html After starting the first half of the season going 7‚Äì4 with a 2.81 ERA in 17 starts, Jimenez had a disappointing second half, as he pitched to a 5.63 ERA with a 5‚Äì6 record after the All-Star break. He finished the 2015 season with a moderate 4.11 ERA in 32 starts. He went 12‚Äì10 with a 1.32 WHIP and 168 strikeouts in 184 innings pitched. 2016 Heading into the 2016 season, Jimenez looked to carry on the success from the previous season but struggled mightily in the first half, registering an ERA of 7.38 through 18 appearances. On September 5, Jimenez pitched his first complete game since 2011. After allowing a 3-run home run in the first inning to the Rays, Jimenez retired 25 of the final 26 batters he faced, including the final 17 batters of the game. It was also the Orioles' first complete game since September 3, 2014. In his very next start, Jimenez lowered his ERA to below six for the first time since May 17. He pitched seven innings of 2-run ball, earning his fourth straight quality start, and fifth straight start allowing three or fewer runs. Jimenez would finish the season with an 8-12 record and an ERA of 5.44 in 29 games, 25 starts. In the Wild Card game, Jimenez entered the game in the bottom of the 11th inning with 1 out and no one on base. He proceeded to give up 3 straight hits, the last of which was a game and season ending walk-off home run to Edwin Encarnaci√≥n, ending the Orioles season. 2017 Baltimore Orioles in 2017 Jimenez opened the season as the Orioles' fourth starter. Throughout the whole season, Jimenez endured his career worst season, setting career highs in ERA (6.81), earned runs (108) and home runs allowed (33). The 2017 season marked Jimenez's final season in Baltimore, ending his four-year run with a record of 32-42 and an ERA of 5.22 for Baltimore. =Second stint with Colorado Rockies= On February 5, 2020, Jimenez signed a minor league deal with the Colorado Rockies and was invited to spring training. Jimenez was released by the Rockies organization on July 20, 2020. Jimenez announced his retirement from professional baseball on September 17, 2020.https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2020/09/ubaldo-jimenez- retires.html Scouting report Jim√©nez's four-seam fastball was frequently clocked as high as 96 mph, although later in his career, his average four-seam fastball typically registered between 90‚Äì93 mph. No one threw more pitches over 95 mph (1,342) than did Jim√©nez during the 2008 season. In 2010, he was one of only three starting pitchers, along with Justin Verlander and Stephen Strasburg, to have pitched 20 or more pitches of over 100 mph. Jim√©nez's two- seam fastball exhibited strong \\"tailing\\" action (moving inside on a right- handed batter and away from a left-handed batter), as well as good \\"sinking\\" action, though not always by design. His velocity ranged from 89 to 93 mph, though sometimes reaching 94‚Äì96 mph. In 2008, Jim√©nez posted a very robust ground-ball percentage of 54.4%, a testament to this pitch's effectiveness and making him an ideal pitcher for Coors Field, a ballpark known for extra-base hits. Jim√©nez was known to throw a split-finger fastball and an occasional forkball, having deceptive downward movement in the 85‚Äì88 mph range. The changeup thrown by Jim√©nez also exhibited strong \\"sinking\\" action, so much so that television commentators unfamiliar with Jim√©nez often had trouble distinguishing his change-up from a sinking fastball or a split-finger fastball. Jim√©nez varied the pitch by using both a circle changeup and traditional straight changeup grip. Typically thrown between 85‚Äì90 mph, the pitch would dive down and away from left-handed batters. Jim√©nez's slider was usually thrown between 83‚Äì85 mph. This pitch fooled batters with an unusually sharp, late break and was used second most in frequency behind his four-seam fastball. Batters often confused this pitch with a fastball (the major league average for a fastball is approximately 91 mph) and due to the tight, late- breaking movement of the pitch, were often unable to hit it.

Biography Nicholson was born on December 9, 1866, in Crawfordsville, Indiana, to Edward Willis Nicholson and the former Emily Meredith. Largely self-taught, Nicholson began a newspaper career in 1884 at the Indianapolis Sentinel. He moved to the Indianapolis News the following year, where he remained until 1897. He wrote Short Flights in 1891, and continued to publish extensively, both poetry and prose until 1928. During the first quarter of the 20th century, Nicholson, along with Booth Tarkington, George Ade, and James Whitcomb Riley helped to create a Golden Age of literature in Indiana. Three of his books from that era were national bestsellers: * The House of a Thousand Candles (#4 in 1906) * The Port of Missing Men (#3 in 1907) * A Hoosier Chronicle (#5 in 1912) In 1928, Nicholson entered Democratic party politics, and served for two years as a city councilman in Indianapolis. He rose through the ranks of the Democratic party and was rewarded with appointments as Envoy to Paraguay, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. Nicholson was married firstly to Eugenie Clementine Kountze, daughter of Herman Kountze, and secondly to Dorothy Wolfe Lannon, whom he later divorced. Nicholson died on December 21, 1947, in Indianapolis, aged 81, and is buried in the Crown Hill Cemetery. Selected bibliography   Reissued as Daily Mail sixpenny novel No. 166 in 1912.

Early life in Europe He was born in 1909 in France at Boulogne-sur-Seine during the exile of the Brazilian imperial family, which had been deposed in 1889. His father, Prince Luiz of Orl√©ans-Braganza, was the second son of the heir to the defunct Brazilian throne, the Princess Imperial Isabel, and Prince Gaston, Count of Eu. His mother was Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. The year before Pedro Henrique's birth, she recognized his father, Luiz, as the heir to the succession when Luiz's elder brother, Pedro de Alc√¢ntara, Prince of Gr√£o-Par√°, renounced his claim to the throne on behalf of himself and his descendants. Thus, at birth Pedro Henrique became claimant to the title of Prince of Gr√£o- Par√°, according to Article 105 of the defunct Constitution of 1824. He was baptized in the chapel of the Ch√¢teau d'Eu with the waters of the fountain taken from Largo da Carioca, in Rio de Janeiro. His godparents were his paternal grandmother, Princess Isabel of Brazil, and maternal grandfather Prince Alfonso, Count of Caserta, Head of the royal house of the Two Sicilies. He and his family lived between the Eu castle and a palace in Boulogne-sur- Seine, both belonging to the Imperial Family. He was raised primarily by his paternal grandmother, and numerous preceptors educated him as future emperor of Brazil.SANTOS (2006: 61) In 1920, his father died in Cannes of injuries acquired in the trenches of the First World War. In the same year Brazil's banishment of the Orl√©ans-Braganzas was revoked by the then President Epit√°cio Pessoa. Pedro Henrique accompanied Count d'Eu when he led part of the Imperial Family back to Brazil, without the aged and infirm Princess Isabel. Grandfather and grandson soon returned to Europe.SANTOS (2006: 56‚Äì58). Upon the death of his father in 1920 Pedro Henrique became claimant to the title of Prince Imperial, but on 14 November 1921 Princess Isabel died at the Castle d'Eu. So, at age of 12 Prince Pedro Henrique became the head of the imperial family. Had he became emperor, his imperial name would be Dom Pedro III.ORLEANS E BRAGAN√áA, Pia Maria (1990: 8) He continued living in France with his mother, Princess Maria Pia, where she thought he could get a better education with his siblings Luiz Gast√£o and Pia Maria. Pedro Henrique was educated at the Ec√¥le des Sciences Politiques in Paris. He was described by his grandmother as \\"a very intelligent child\\". In 1925, at the age of 16, the Brazilian government ruled against his request to serve in the military.SANTOS (2006: 64). Life in Brazil Pedro de Alc√¢ntara died in 1940. Pedro Henrique was only able to return to Brazil in 1945, when the Second World War ended. He settled first in Petr√≥polis, Rio de Janeiro, in the palace of the Gr√£o-Par√°, and then in the neighborhood of Retiro, also in Petr√≥polis. His cousin, Prince Pedro Gast√£o of Orl√©ans-Braganza, the eldest son of Pedro de Alc√¢ntara, Prince of Gr√£o-Par√°, challenged Pedro Henrique's claim to the succession in 1946, on the basis that his father's renunciation had no legal force. In 1951, D. Pedro Henrique bought a farm, Fazenda Santa Maria, in the town of Jacarezinho, interior of Paran√°. In 1965, he returned to Rio de Janeiro, settling in Vassouras, an important city in the days of Empire for coffee production. Pedro Henrique resided at a site called Santa Maria until the end of his life.SANTOS (2006: 109). He was active in the monarchist movement. On his death in 1981, Pedro Henrique's claim to the throne passed to his eldest son, Luiz.

This feather is from a male Indian peafowl Pavo cristatus. Sexual display by a Megaselia female. Display behaviour is a set of ritualized behaviours that enable an animal to communicate to other animals (typically of the same species) about specific stimuli. These ritualized behaviours can be visual however many animals depend on a mixture of visual, audio, tactical and/or chemical signals as well. Evolution has tailored these stereotyped behaviours to allow animals to communicate both conspecifically and interspecifically which allows for a broader connection in different niches in an ecosystem. It is connected to sexual selection and survival of the species in various ways. Typically, display behaviour is used for courtship between two animals and to signal to the female that a viable male is ready to mate. In other instances, species may exhibit territorial display behaviour, in order to preserve a foraging or hunting territory for its family or group. A third form is exhibited by tournament species in which males will fight in order to gain the 'right' to breed. Animals from a broad range of evolutionary hierarchies avail of display behaviours - from invertebrates such as the simple jumping spider to the more complex vertebrates like the harbour seal.  In animals  = Invertebrates =  Insects  Communication is very important for animals all throughout the animal kingdom, even those with fairly simple nervous systems and body plans. For example, since female praying mantids are sexually cannibalistic, the male will typically avail of a concealment form of display behaviour. This is a series of creeping movements executed by the male as it approaches the female with freezing of the body whenever the female looks towards the male. However, according to laboratory studies conducted by Loxton in 1979, one type of praying mantis, Ephestiasula arnoena, shows both male and female counterparts performing overt and ritualized behaviour before mating. Both displayed a semaphore behaviour, meaning both displayed their front legs in a boxing fashion before the slow approach of the male from behind. This semaphore display in E. arnoenaiskey in communicating between both mantids that both are ready for copulation and, by extension, the continuance of their genetic line. Along with the display behaviour shown by the praying mantid, flies belonging to the genus Megaselia also show such behaviour. Contrary to the typically female-selected mating that occurs for most organisms, these flies have females that show the display behaviour and males that choose the mate. Females have a bright orange colouring that attracts the male and also perform a series of fluttering wing movements that make the insect appear to \\"dance\\" and make the openings on their abdomens to swell in order to attract a male. It is also interesting to note that there is experimental evidence that implies the female may also release pheromones that attract the male; this is an instance of chemical display behaviour that plays a large role in animal communication. This auditory courtship behavior is also seen in fruit flies like A. suspensa when they perform calling and pre-copulatory songs before mating. Both of these sounds are created by rapid flapping of the males wings.  Arachnids  Many arachnids show ritualized displays. For example, the family Salticidae consists of jumping spiders with keen vision which results in very clear display behaviours for courting in particular. Salticids are very similar in appearance to ants that live in the same area and therefore use their appearance to avoid predators. Since this similarity in appearance is so obvious, salticid spiders can use display behaviours to communicate both with members of their own species and also with members of the ants that they mimic. = Vertebrates =  Birds  Birds also very commonly use display behaviours for courtship and communication. Manakin birds (in the family Pipridae) in the Amazon undergo large demonstrations of display behaviour in order to court females in the population. Since males provide no other immediate benefit to females, they must undergo ritualized behaviours in order to show their fitness to possible mates; the female then uses the information she gathers from this interaction to make a decision on who she will mate with. This display behaviour consists of various flight patterns, wing and colour displays, and particular vocalizations. As a result of this performance, the males will be chosen by the female and reproduction will commence.  Mammals  Along with invertebrates and birds, vertebrates like the harbour seal also show display behaviour. Since the harbour seal resides in an aquatic environment, the display behaviours expressed are slightly different from those seen in terrestrial mammal species . Male harbour seals show specific vocalization and diving behaviours while demonstrating such behaviours for possible mates. As seals are distributed over such a large area, these display behaviours can slightly change geographically as males try to appeal to the largest number of females possible over a large geographical range. Dive displays, head flicks, and various vocalizations all work together in a display behaviour that signifies to the females in a colony that the males are ready to mate.  Factors influencing display behaviour in animals  Display behaviour is a set of very conspicuous behaviours that allows for the attraction of mates but also can result in the attraction of predators. As a result, animals have certain environmental and social cues that they can use to decide when is the most beneficial time to show such behaviours; they use these triggers to minimize cost (predator avoidance) and maximize gain (mate attraction). The first factor is temporal. Depending on the time of the season, animals (more specifically, tropical frogs, in this study) show strong seasonal trends in display behaviour favouring times closer to the beginning of the mating season. This is plausible as this allows the most time for the attraction of a mate and the decline in calling to the end of the season is also valid because most organisms will have a mate by then and not have any need to continue such display behaviour. Depending upon the species and evolutionary histories, environmental factors such as temperature, elevation, and precipitation can affect the presence of these behaviours. Along with environmental cues, social cues can also play a role in the demonstration of display behaviour. For example, aggressive display behaviour in the crayfish Orconectes virilistends to be triggered by impositions of other crayfish on previously established territory. Such displays consist of a preliminary raising of claws between 4 and 5 times and if this is not sufficient to warn the other to not encroach on the territory then tactile engagement will occur. In this case, display behaviour is a preliminary step to the engagement of aggressive tactile behaviour whereas many cases of display behaviour result in the engagement of mating rituals. In humans Human men typically advertise their suitability as mates by signalling their status in the social hierarchy, often by acquiring wealth or fame. The Papuan big men staged elaborate feasts to show the extent of their influence and power. The potlatches of the Pacific Northwest were held for much of the same effect. Tournament species Male mountain gorilla Tournament species in zoology are those species in which members of one sex (usually males) compete in order to mate. In tournament species, the reproductive success of the small group of competition winners is predominantly higher than that of the large group of losers. Tournament species are characterized by fierce same-sex fighting. Significantly larger or better-armed individuals in these species have an advantage, but only to the competing sex. Thus, most tournament species have high sexual dimorphism. Examples of tournament species include grouse, peafowl, lions, mountain gorillas and elephant seals. In some species, members of the competing sex come together in special display areas called leks. In other species, competition is more direct, in the form of fighting between males. In a small number of species, females compete for males; these include species of jacana, species of phalarope, and the spotted hyena. In all these cases, the female of the species shows traits that help in same-sex battles: larger bodies, aggressiveness, territorialism. Even maintenance of a multiple-male \\"harem\\" is sometimes seen in these animals. Most species fall on a continuum between tournament species and pair-bonding species.

A professor with a PhD in her specialty brought in to a facilitate a meeting would get tutelary authority from her knowledge and credentials. * Political authority ‚Äì involving the exercise of decision- makingHeron, J. The Complete Facilitator's Handbook (1999) Kogan Page with respect to the objectives, programme, methods, resources and assessment of learning. This manifests particularly in the planning dimension. * Charismatic authority ‚Äì influence by presence, style and manner. It manifests particularly through the feeling, confronting and valuing dimensions. Types US Navy training facilitator in action. Shimer College facilitator conversing with students. =Business facilitators= Business facilitators work in business, and other formal organizations but facilitators may also work with a variety of other groups and communities. It is a tenet of facilitation that the facilitator will not lead the group towards the answer that they think is best even if they possess an opinion on the facilitation subject. The facilitator's role is to make it easier for the group to arrive at its own answer, decision, or deliverable. This can and does give rise to organizational conflict between hierarchical management and theories and practice of empowerment. Facilitators often have to navigate between the two, especially where overt statements about empowerment are not being borne out by organizational behaviors.Wherrett, R. The Compleat Biz, (2009) Reroq Publishing =Conflict resolution facilitators= Conflict resolution facilitators are used in peace and reconciliation processes both during and after a conflict. They support constructive and democratic dialogue between groups with diverse and usually diametrically opposite positions. Conflict resolution facilitators must be impartial to the conflicting groups (or societies) and must adhere to the rules of democratic dialogue. They may not take sides or express personal opinions. Their role is to support groups develop shared vision for the future, learn to listen to each other, and understand and appreciate the feelings, experiences and positions of the opposing side. =Educational facilitators= Educators in dialogic learning and other peer instruction approaches often serve as facilitators. According to one common definition, an educational facilitator has the same level of knowledge about both education and the subject matter as a teacher, but works with the goal of having students take as much responsibility for their own learning as possible. Instructors at Shimer College, for example, are often referred to as facilitators due to their role in provoking learning by facilitating a conversation among students about the text rather than instructing the students directly. In language teaching, teachers may shift to a facilitative role to increase student ownership of the learning process. Effective facilitation requires self-monitoring and careful attention to the details of interaction as well as the content of the material. =Small group facilitators= Facilitators can help participants in small and medium-sized groups to work through a meeting agenda. The facilitator is often appointed in place of what would once have been a chairperson's role. Along with other officers, the facilitator is appointed at the group's annual general meeting to fill the role for the year ahead. Groups that have adopted this model include prayer groups, men's groups, writing groups and other community organisations. =Training facilitators= Training facilitators are used in adult education. These facilitators are not always subject experts, and attempt to draw on the existing knowledge of the participant(s), and to then facilitate access to training where gaps in knowledge are identified and agreed on. Training facilitators focus on the foundations of adult education: establish existing knowledge, build on it and keep it relevant. The role is different from a trainer with subject expertise. Such a person will take a more leading role and take a group through an agenda designed to transmit a body of knowledge or a set of skills to be acquired. (See tutelary authority above.) =Wraparound facilitators= Wraparound facilitators are facilitators in the social services community. The term \\"wraparound\\" refers to the broad, holistic approach used by the facilitators, taking into account a range of factors. They originally served disabled teens who were transitioning into adulthood. Now they include facilitators serving children between the ages of 0‚Äì3 years who are in need of services. Outside the meetings, the facilitator organizes meetings, engages team members and conducts follow through. During meetings the facilitator leads and manages the team by keeping the participants on track and encourages a strength-based discussion addressing the child's needs. The facilitator encourages equal participation among team members. Skills :See Facilitation (business) for a view of specific skills and activities. Many skills are required to be a good facilitator. The basic skills of a facilitator are about following good meeting practices: timekeeping, following an agreed-upon agenda, and keeping a clear record. The higher-order skills involve watching the group and its individuals in light of group dynamics. In addition, facilitators also need a variety of listening skills including ability to paraphrase; stack a conversation; draw people out; balance participation; and make space for more reticent group members (Kaner, et al., 1996). It is critical to the facilitator's role to have the knowledge and skill to be able to intervene in a way that adds to the group's creativity rather than taking away from it. A successful facilitator embodies respect for others and a watchful awareness of the many layers of reality in a human group. In the event that a consensus cannot be reached then the facilitator would assist the group in understanding the differences that divide it. Facilitators also require good understanding of processes ‚Äì how to enable group decision-making, structuring agendas for appropriate results, problem- solving, etc. Associations and organizations The International Association of Facilitators (IAF) was founded in 1993 to promote facilitation as a profession. The IAF maintains the Certified Professional Facilitator program. The competencies of a Certified Professional Facilitator can be found on the IAF website. These core competencies are: (1) Create collaborative client relationships; (2) Plan appropriate group processes; (3) Create and sustain a participatory environment; (4) Guide group to appropriate and useful outcomes; (5) Build and maintain professional knowledge and; (6) Model positive professional attitude. The International Institute for Facilitation (INIFAC) was founded in 2003 to maintain and promote a program of certification for facilitation, the Certified Master Facilitator program. The competencies of a Certified Master Facilitator can be found on the INIFAC website. See also  * Meeting * Process consultant References Bibliography * Bens, I.

Since 2013, he has worked with pitchers in the Rockies' lower- level minor league affiliates. Early years Apodaca played third base in high school, but converted to a pitcher at Cerritos College. After transferring to California State University, Los Angeles (where he was the Golden Eagles' MVP as a senior), he signed with the New York Mets as an amateur free agent in 1971. He spent three seasons in their farm system, going 24‚Äì11 with a 2.73 earned run average before making his major league debut as a September call-up in 1973. He faced two Pittsburgh Pirates batters, walking both. The first came around to score, giving Apodaca an infinite ERA in 1973. New York Mets Apodaca won a spot in the Mets' bullpen in 1974, and earned his first career save in his first appearance of the season. His first career win came on May 13 as a starter against the St. Louis Cardinals and future Hall of Famer Bob Gibson. Overall, he went 6‚Äì6 with three saves and a 3.50 ERA in his rookie season. He had a career year in 1975, when he led Mets relievers with thirteen saves and a 1.49 ERA. His 46 appearances were good enough for second best on the club, as were his 84.2 innings pitched out of the bullpen. He remained a staple of the Mets' bullpen through 1977. During Spring training 1978, Apodaca tore a ligament in his right elbow, causing him to miss the entire season. He would pitch just four innings for the Mets' triple A affiliate, the Tidewater Tides, in 1979, and did not pitch at all in 1980. Coaching After six games with the double A Jackson Mets in 1981, Apodaca retired and went into coaching. Immediately after stepping off the mound for good, he was hired as a coach with the Short-Season A ball Little Falls Mets of the New York‚ÄìPenn League. He moved to the double A Jackson Mets in 1983 before moving to the Columbia Mets of the South Atlantic League from 1984 to 1987. In 1986, he was named SAL Pitching Coach of the Year when his staff went 90‚Äì42 with a 3.38 ERA. In 1988, he served as pitching coach for the St. Lucie Mets under Clint Hurdle in Hurdle's first season as a professional manager. The two would work on and off together in the Mets' minor league system for the next couple of years until Apodaca became the Mets' major league pitching coach from 1996 to 1999. He was the pitching coach for the Milwaukee Brewers from 2000 to 2001 before returning to St. Lucie in 2002. Early in the 2002 season, Hurdle replaced Buddy Bell as the Colorado Rockies manager. At the end of the season, he brought Apodaca in as his pitching coach. Pitching in hitter friendly Coors Field the Rockies' pitching staff consistently finished with the National League's worst ERA. Since coming into existence in 1993, Rockies pitchers finished with the league's highest ERA in all but two seasons, finishing second to the Florida Marlins in 1998, and the Houston Astros in 2000. This trend continued until 2006, when the Rockies finished with the thirteenth (out of sixteen) best ERA in the league. This was due mostly to a cut in home runs allowed (155, third best in the NL, versus 175, eleventh in the NL in 2005). The improvement continued until 2007, when the Rockies' 4.32 team ERA was eighth best in the league. Coupled with an offense that produced the league's best batting average and the second most runs scored, the Rockies reached the post season for the first time since 1995. Rockies pitching allowed just eight runs and held the Philadelphia Phillies to a .172 batting average to sweep the 2007 National League Division Series in three games. Likewise, they held the Arizona Diamondbacks to just eight runs in their four- game sweep of the 2007 National League Championship Series to head to the World Series for the first time in franchise history. Apodaca remained the Rockies' pitching coach until June 26, 2012, when he asked to be reassigned, and was named Special Assistant to GM Dan O'Dowd. He was replaced by Jim Wright & Bo McLaughlin, who served as co-pitching coaches. It was under Apodaca's tutelage that Ubaldo Jim√©nez tossed the franchise's first and only no-hitter on April 17, 2010.

It was amalgamated into the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (SPVA) on 2 April 2007 under the brand Veterans- UK. It was formerly known as the \\"War Pensions Agency\\" and was part of the Department of Social Security. When, in 2001, the latter was reorganised into the Department for Work and Pensions, the War Pensions Agency became an Executive Agency of the Ministry of Defence and, in 2003, changed its name to the Veterans Agency. It was the single point of contact within the MoD for providing information, help and advice on issues of concern to veterans and their families. It did this through its free Helpline, welfare service and website . The term 'veteran' is used to mean all those who have served in HM Armed Forces (whether Regular or Reserve). This group has been commonly known as ex-Service personnel. The term veteran also includes their widows/widowers and their dependants as part of the veterans' community. As well as all members of the Armed Forces the term veteran also, exceptionally, includes those members of the Merchant Navy who played a vital role in legally defined military operations. The veterans' community is therefore a wide and disparate population, estimated to be over 10 million people in the United Kingdom. The Agency provided advice on a wide range of subjects including benefits and welfare issues, pensions and compensation, Service records and medals etc. The Veterans Agency Vision Service excellence for veterans and Serving personnel. Core functions To administer the War Pensions Scheme which provides financial support to approximately 250,000 war pensioners and war widow(er)s living in over 100 countries throughout the world, although most are resident in the UK. The Agency also administered the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme. This was mainly applicable to Serving personnel. In addition, the Agency managed the War Pensioners‚Äô Welfare Service (WPWS) which in turn manages Ilford Park Polish Home (IPPH). The War Pensioners‚Äô Welfare Service gives support to existing War Pensioners, war widow(er)s and veterans who are in the process of making a claim for a war disablement pension. WPWS will arrange home visits as required to discuss any particular issues that may be affecting individuals. Welfare managers often liaise with colleagues in other Government departments or ex-Service organisations to ensure the best help and advice is supplied where needed. Ilford Park Polish Home provides residential and nursing care to people who qualify for admission under the 1947 Polish Resettlement Act. The Agency contributed to a greater awareness of veterans and their concerns, undertaking a programme of PR activity. Also The Agency also: *co-ordinated, managed and delivered services to the veterans community as directed by United Kingdom Government; *administered the ex- gratia payment scheme for former prisoners of the Japanese in World War II in accordance with Government policy; and *contributed to advice given to the Department and Ministers on war pensions policy matters. Additional functions In addition to the above core functions, the Agency: *provided administrative support to the Central Advisory Committee (CAC) on war pensions and War Pensions Committees (WPC); *administered the nomination of Government appointees to certain charitable bodies *co-ordinated nominations for non- State honours from ex-Service organisations representing war pensioners, war widow(er)s and WPC‚Äôs; and *contributed to the management of Leopardstown Park Hospital, Dublin.

Crnoljeva is also a point where all three drainage basins of Serbia (and three out of four in the Balkans) meet, making the mountain a major hydrographic knot. In Albanian it is named after the village of Crnoljevo. Crnoljeva is located in the south-central part of Kosovo, between the valleys of the rivers Drenica (to the east) and Miru≈°a and Topluga (to the west). The mountain is elongated in the north-south direction and divides the Prizren depression of the Metohija from the Drenica region of the Kosovo Plain. The highest peak is Topila (1,177 m), while the Drmanska glava peak (926 m) is point of the hydrographic knot. Another prominent peak is the Korenik (1,142 m).

Tornionlaakson historia I. Birkarlit, 'pirkkalaiset'. Malungs boktryckeri AB. Malung, Sweden. 1991. The article draws heavily from the material available in the book. Background Birkarls (bircharlaboa) are first mentioned in 1328, when they are listed as one of the settler groups in northern H√§lsingland, a designation that covered the western coast of Gulf of Bothnia all the way up and around the gulf to Oulu River. The name birkarl probably originates from an ancient Scandinavian word birk that has been used in reference to commerce in various contexts. In the late 16th century, claims about birkarls coming from Great Pirkkala (a parish in Upper Satakunta) emerged, propagated by birkarls themselves in their battle to prevent the state from stripping their privileges. This is at least partly true, since men from Pirkkala appear as witnesses in a document from 1374 about local borders in northern Pohjanmaa. Later, in the 19th century, a Finnish term pirkkamiehet or pirkkalaiset was invented as a \\"domestic\\" name for birkarls. It never appears in any of the documentation or traditions, but is commonly used in Finland today to mean birkarls. In total, some twenty theories are estimated to exist to explain the origin and name of the birkarls. Sami trade and tax monopoly The main purpose of the birkarl organization was to control the trade with Sami people and tax them. Legends told that birkarls rights to tax Sami people was given by Magnus the Barnlock, the King of Sweden at that time. Sami people were traditionally taxed by Norwegians already in the Viking Age or even earlier. Later Russians started to tax them as well. After having southern Finland under control around 1250, Sweden became interested in the situation in the north. Eventually, some Sami people paid taxes to all three states. Birkarls were just one element in the colonial system profiting off of the Sami area. It seems that birkarls' privileges were more de facto, than de jure. No document has survived granting them official right to the tax and trade monopoly in the north, even though the state first supported and later tolerated the situation for centuries. Area of influence Birkarls were active in the Tornio, Lule√• and Pite√• River valleys, Tornio being their main area. Each of the valleys formed a separate \\"lappmark\\" with its own birkarls. Sami people south of Pite√• were \\"Crown Samis\\" that paid their taxes directly to the king. The birkarls living in each area of influence were very few, totalling only about 50 men still in the early 16th century. In the 16th century, towards the end of their existence, the Kemi River valley was also partly under birkarl influence. In the 1590s, they also tried to gain tax control of the sea Sami people on the Arctic Ocean. Decline and end Birkarls remained useful to the king as long as the state's hold on the north was weak. After the disintegration of the Union of Kalmar in the early 16th century, the situation in the north became more important. A major setback for birkals took place in 1553, when King Gustav Vasa terminated their right to tax the Sami people. Unable to continue their former lives, many birkarls became local tax authorities (lapinvouti in Finnish). The Birkarls' trade monopoly did not last much longer and was in the line of fire from 1570s. The state wanted to concentrate trade into towns that were easier to control, making the need for birkarls obsolete. Having no official status, birkarl organizations had little means of fighting back, and they silently eroded away in the 17th century after administrative changes initiated by king Charles IX. Tornio, Lule√• and Pite√• all received their town charters in 1621 marking an official end to birkarls.

The Gazimur and the Borzya Rivers flow through the district. The district's mineral reserves include the Bugdainskoe mine, which contain one of the largest molybdenum reserves in Russia. History Russians explored the region in the 17th century. In 1778, silver deposits were discovered here, and the first silver mine, which was included into the network of Nerchinsk silver refineries, was built in the village of Bazanovo. Catherine the Great ordered to give additional money to the network in 1790. As a result, on the spot of modern Alexandrovsky Zavod appeared a silver works in 1792, which later was named after Alexander I. All the workers of the works were political and penal criminals. The most famous of them was an ideologue of Russian Socialism, Nikolay Chernyshevsky. After the silver resources depletion in the late 1880s, population comprised Cossacks and peasants who took active part in Russian revolutions. The district in its modern form was established on January 4, 1926. In the 1930s, there was Cossack and peasant unrest caused by collectivization. There were massive deportations and repressions. World War II caused an enormous decrease in manpower and the district's industry. The population of the district suffers from different oncological diseases.

Having begun by at least 1979 it was originally part of his mid-morning show on BBC Radio 1, where it aired daily throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. The feature has more recently been heard on Smooth Radio, where Bates presented the Breakfast Show from 2011 to 2014. An edition of Our Tune typically features a personal story submitted by a listener together with a song that has significance to the person or situation. Many of these stories, which are read out over Nino Rota's Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet have a tragic narrative such as illness or death, although not all end on such an unhappy note. The feature's sentimental tone has earned it criticism from some, including a columnist at Glasgow's Evening Times who once described it as \\"dial-a-depression\\". But Our Tune has garnered a huge following among the listening public. At its peak the slot was heard by 11 million listeners on a daily basis, and it helped to establish Bates as a household name in the United Kingdom. Its popularity led to the release of an album of the most requested songs in 2006, and the publication of a paperback including some of the stories to mark its tenth anniversary in 1990. Our Tune continues to be referenced in popular culture, while similar features involving listeners' stories have been employed by other presenters, including Radio 1's Mike Read and Jo Whiley. US singer Jenn Bostic became popular in Britain after Bates played one of her songs on an edition of Our Tune in 2012. According to a programme aired on Smooth Radio in 2013 to celebrate the feature's 33rd anniversary, the most requested song for Our Tune is Whitney Houston's version of I Will Always Love You. Our Tune was last aired by Smooth Radio on 27 September 2013. The feature made a brief return in October 2015 as part of a series of programmes about relationships in later life that aired on BBC Local Radio. History Simon Bates joined BBC Radio 1 in 1976, where he presented the network's mid-morning show from 14 November 1977. He has said that the Our Tune slot first appeared on the programme on 21 July 1980, although the Radio Times makes reference to it as early as 14 February 1979. It was intended to run for a few weeks. Bates had the idea for the feature after reading a letter from one of his listeners who had enjoyed a holiday romance during a two-week trip to Bournemouth which ended after both parties returned home, and her love interest joined the armed forces. She asked Bates to play the song they had danced to during the vacation, and he read the story out one morning shortly before 11.00am. Bates then invited listeners to write to him with their personal stories and was quickly inundated with letters. He would then read these out on air. The segment quickly proved to be popular and was extended, soon becoming a regular mid-morning fixture for listeners, with people in offices, factories and schools often stopping work to hear the stories. Indeed, at its peak Our Tune attracted 11 million listeners on a daily basis. The name Our Tune was decided by listeners who would often request a song that was described by them as \\"our tune\\". Each morning at around 11.00am, Bates would read out one of the stories while sentimental music played in the background. At first this would be any music of the genre that Bates could find, but after he played Nino Rota's theme to Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 film Romeo and Juliet this became the official music of Our Tune. The stories tended to be about relationships to begin with, but as the feature grew in popularity Bates started to receive letters on other issues. Our Tune is perhaps best remembered for those stories that had a tragic theme, typically opening with a happy courtship followed by a disaster such as illness or death. However, they were not always heart-rending tales, and many had happy conclusions. The feature would close with a song or piece of music chosen by the correspondent, usually something that had significance to those involved in the story. It might be a song that a couple had danced to at their wedding or a favourite hit enjoyed by someone who had died in tragic circumstances. In 1982 Russell Kyle of Glasgow's Evening Times described Our Tune as \\"dial-a-depression\\". But although some bemoaned the feature's mawkish nature, Our Tune helped to establish Simon Bates as a household name in the United Kingdom. A spin-off album featuring songs chosen by listeners was released in 2006, while to celebrate ten years of Our Tune, in 1990 Arrow Books published a paperback of Our Tune stories co-authored by Simon Bates. The feature disappeared from Radio 1 after Bates resigned from the network in 1993. After Radio 1 After leaving Radio 1 Simon Bates worked for Irish- based long wave station Atlantic 252, where he revived Our Tune, before presenting a daily version of the feature for television, on BBC1's Good Morning with Anne and Nick in 1994‚Äì95. In 1995 he took the feature to Talk Radio after signing a contract to present with the then new broadcaster. The Our Tune slot aired at 9.45am as part of his breakfast show. Our Tune later appeared on Sky One. A version titled Our Tune at Noon was syndicated to commercial radio stations across the UK. Bates presented a one-off special of Our Tune across GCap Media stations on Valentine's Day 2006, and The Very Best of Our Tune, a CD featuring some of the most popular songs requested from the slot's Radio 1 days was released. On 17 August 2010, it was announced that from January 2011 Simon Bates would take over as host of the Breakfast Show on Smooth Radio. Bates' show replaced local programming on a number of regional radio stations, and began on 4 January 2011. Our Tune was revived again, this time as part of the Breakfast Show, airing initially on Fridays at 8.40am. After proving popular again the feature was extended to a twice-weekly slot on Mondays and Fridays later in the year, before going daily in Spring 2012. In May 2012 Smooth Radio launched an internet discussion forum allowing listeners to share their thoughts on each day's Our Tune story. The feature celebrated its 33rd anniversary on 21 July 2013 with a special programme on Smooth Radio in which Bates played the top ten most requested \\"our tunes\\". Number one on this list was Whitney Houston's version of I Will Always Love You. Bates announced on 27 September 2013 that the feature would be going \\"into recess\\", with that morning's edition of Our Tune being the last to be aired on Smooth Radio. In February 2014 Smooth Radio announced that Bates would no longer be presenting its breakfast show, news that prompted Radio Times columnist Eddie Mair to remark light-heartedly that his final Our Tune for the station was \\"Kill the Director\\" by The Wombats. Bates was succeeded as breakfast show presenter by Andrew Castle. After leaving Smooth Bates subsequently joined BBC Radio Devon, presenting the breakfast show from January 2015. Our Tune continues to appear. In May 2015 Bates produced a humorous version of the feature concerning the supposedly frayed relationship between England cricketer Kevin Pietersen and then newly appointed England director Andrew Strauss after Pietersen discovered he was no longer being considered for international selection. In October 2015 Our Tune made a brief return to national radio when it was aired as part of a week long feature on BBC Local Radio concerning sex and relationships in later life. The segment was included as part of the Love in Later Life series airing on Mark Forrest's evening show from 19‚Äì23 October. Legacy The idea of reading out listeners' stories about relationships or significant life events is one that has been often used on radio, and there have been a number of similar features following the Our Tune format. However, none has endured to the same extent. In the 1980s the broadcaster Mike Read presented a similar slot during his tenure as host of The Radio 1 Breakfast Show titled First Love. Here, listeners' stories of the first time they fell in love would be read out over The Love Unlimited Orchestra's instrumental piece Love's Theme. While presenting his weeknight programme on Birmingham's BRMB in the early 1990s, Graham Torrington had a similar feature as part of his The Love Zone strand. Radio 1's The Jo Whiley Show and Fearne Cotton both had a segment called Changing Tracks where listeners were invited to email requests for a song that reminded them of a time in their life when music changed everything. The theme music from Our Tune appears in Act II of the 1998 British musical Boogie Nights. Our Tune also featured as one of the items on a 1994 edition of the BBC satirical television series Room 101. Guest Tony Slattery included it among his list of banished items. in June 2012 Sam Wollaston of The Guardian compared the storyline from an episode of the BBC romantic drama True Love unfavourably with an edition of Our Tune, particularly as it was overlaid with sentimental music. In September 2012 The Daily Telegraph reported that a track created by users of the Poke website which remixed a speech by British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg had been compared to an edition of Our Tune because of its confessional nature. The original speech was an apology for Clegg's promise to block an increase in University tuition fees before the 2010 general election, a pledge on which he later reneged as a member of the post-election coalition government. In his review of the 2013 film Labor Day, which concerns a depressed single mother living in New England, Daily Express columnist Henry Fitzherbert compared the first part of the story to an edition of Our Tune, but adds \\"What you never heard Bates say, however, was 'and then she met Frank...a convicted killer on the run'\\". The Our Tune strand brought the US singer Jenn Bostic to the attention of listeners in the UK after Bates played her song \\"Jealous of the Angels\\" following a listener's story in 2012. The song became popular with listeners to Smooth and other radio networks, as well as on the internet. It was released as a single in December 2012 and reached number one in the UK singer-songwriter charts. In a 2008 interview with The Daily Telegraphs Lucy Cavendish, the singer Duffy recalled listening to Our Tune as a girl. She was also quoted on the topic in the Western Mail. \\"I spent most of my time listening to the radio and used to listen to the Our Tune slot with Simon Bates and I always cried at the end. I used to practise What Becomes of the Broken Hearted.\\" The BBC Asian Network presenter Sonia Deol made a tongue-in-cheek reference to the feature while discussing her formative years for a 2006 interview with The Independent. \\"Hearing sob stories when you're 10 forces you to grow up faster, doesn't it?\\" A 2015 Daily Telegraph article highlighting the 50 top love songs of the 1980s described the 1985 Kool & the Gang ballad \\"Cherish\\" as a \\"bittersweet and surprisingly metaphysical ballad [that] must be the epitome of Simon Bates' long-lost Our Tune.\\".

In April 1907 Grand Duke William IV decreed (approved in July 1907 by legislature of Luxembourg and thereafter enacted) amendments to the House law of Nassau: the Grand Duke's eldest daughter would succeed (that provision is identical with the effect of the 1783 pact), and after her, her issue in male line born of marriages that abide by the house laws; in default thereof, the Grand Duke's next daughters in similar fashion. Thus, issue of the Grand Duke's daughters received succession rights only in strict agnatic line - a male-line male descendant of a younger daughter would have had preference over female descendants of elder daughters. This law of succession in Luxembourg followed a special order among male lines issued from Grand Duke William IV's daughters. The 1907 amendments to the house law bypassed the Counts of Merenberg, male-line descendants of the House of Nassau. While the Merenberg line had a male heir in the person of Georg Nikolaus, Count von Merenberg (1871‚Äì1948), the count was born of a morganatic marriage between Grand Duke William IV's uncle, Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau, and Natalia Pushkina (daughter of Russian author Alexander Pushkin, a member of the untitled Russian nobility). The count's claim to be recognized as the heir to the Grand Duchy was dismissed on the grounds that he and his branch were non-dynastic despite his marriage to Princess Olga Alexandrovna Yurievskaya, a morganatic daughter of Tsar Alexander II of Russia. The Merenberg line eventually also ran out of male heirs; the last surviving male- line descendant is Countess Clotilde von Merenberg, third cousin once removed of Grand Duke Henri. Prince Jean of Luxembourg, second son of Grand Duke Jean, renounced his right of succession for himself and his heirs on 26 September 1986. Prince Louis of Luxembourg, third son of Grand Duke Henri, renounced his right of succession for himself and his heirs upon his marriage in 2006. =Absolute primogeniture= The preference for men over women in succession to Luxembourg's throne was abandoned in favour of absolute primogeniture on 20 June 2011 by decree of Grand Duke Henri.per http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/adm/dec/2010/09/16/n1/jo Henceforth, any legitimate female descendant of the House of Luxembourg-Nassau born of authorized marriage shall inherit the throne by order of seniority of line of descent and of birth as stipulated in Article 3 of the Constitution and the Nassau Family Pact without regard to gender, applicable first to succession by the descendants of Grand Duke Henri. The Grand Duke's Marshal issued an addendum to the decree explaining the context of the change: pursuant to the United Nations' 1979 call for nations to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women, in 2008 the Grand Duchy dropped the exception to gender non- discrimination it had declared in the matter of the grand ducal succession.

The project is the brainchild of the producer and multi-instrumentalist Ettore Rigotti and is mainly known for featuring Soilwork's vocalist Bj√∂rn \\"Speed\\" Strid as guest vocalist on several albums. After releasing two albums under Scarlet Records, they have signed to Italy-based Coroner Records. History =Early years and Nebularium= Disarmonia Mundi was founded by Ettore Rigotti in 2000. The band would initially go through several line-up changes but would successfully record their debut album, Nebularium. The album was completely self-produced by Ettore in his home studio. The response to the album allowed the band to sign a contract with Self for Italian distribution and with Cd-Maximum for distribution in Russia. Line-up problems would prevent live performances to support Nebularium and in turn would slow down the process of recording the forthcoming album. =New members, label and Fragments of D-Generation= The only people remaining from the former line-up, Ettore Rigotti and Mirco Andreis, would be joined by newcomer Claudio Ravinale. The resulting promo would help Disarmonia Mundi attain a recording contract with Scarlet Records. Ettore got in contact with Soilwork front man Bj√∂rn \\"Speed\\" Strid. What started out as a \\"guest appearance\\" on a track for the forthcoming album, Fragments of D-Generation would turn into Strid performing as guest vocalist for most of the songs featured on the album. The release of Fragments of D-Generation would generate several positive feedback. While Strid would go back to working on Soilwork's Stabbing the Drama, Ettore and Claudio would begin composing the music and lyrics for their third album. =Mind Tricks= While Ettore and Claudio worked on the new record, Mirco decided to leave the band to concentrate on other interests. The remaining members tracked most of the new album in three weeks. The band remained a duo for the recording of Mind Tricks while having Strid guesting again on vocals, splitting them equally between Claudio with Ettore contributing clean vocals as well. During the recording, ex-member Mirco shot a video for the band's single \\"Celestial Furnace\\". =The Isolation Game= The new album entitled, The Isolation Game, was released December 9, 2009. Strid recorded guest vocals on a few songs while the majority of the scream and growl vocals being handled by Claudio, guitarist Olof M√∂rck of Nightrage performed a guest solo on one song. On 12 November 2008 the band released new information on their MySpace: \\"We have finished the pre-production of our forthcoming fourth album entitled \\"The Isolation Game\\" scheduled for an early spring release. News about the label for this album will be revealed very soon.\\" The label would later be revealed as Coroner Records; a new record label based out of Italy. The recordings took place at Ettore Rigotti's \\"The Metal House\\" studios in Italy. Bj√∂rn \\"Speed\\" Strid (Soilwork, Terror 2000) recorded vocals for \\"a few songs\\" on The Isolation Game. Much like MindTricks, The Isolation Game features more singing from Ettore and Claudio. Upon its release, The Isolation Game received positive, if lukewarm reviews, with one critic commenting \\"however great an example of Swedish-style melodic death metal this is, it doesn‚Äôt do anything that we haven‚Äôt heard before\\". Prior to the release of The Isolation Game, Disarmonia Mundi released a remastered edition of their debut album, Nebularium, in double disc packaging, with the second disc containing six songs that were b-sides to album recording sessions. The second disc is called The Restless Memoirs EP. The re-release package was put out by Coroner Records on 26 June 2009. = The forming of The Stranded = On 10 November 2011, Ettore and Claudio announced on the Myspace page of Disarmonia Mundi that they had formed a new band with NeroArgento and the American professional skateboarder Elliot Sloan, called The Stranded. On 2 July 2012 the band released the album Survivalism Boulevard on Coroner Records, the album has been met with a general positive feedback. The band began writing for their fifth album in September 2012. On February 5th 2015, the band announced on their official Facebook page that they are currently mastering the album which is still untitled. = Cold Inferno = Following the March 16, 2015 announcement, the band's next album, Cold Inferno, got released on June 9, 2015. As for The Isolation Game, Cold Inferno featured the majority of vocals handled by Claudio with Ettore providing clean vocals and Speed guesting on a couple of tracks, while all the instrumental parts have been tracked and produced by Ettore at The Metal House studio as usual. According to an interview with Ettore Rigotti, the next album will be released within less than two years. An Instagram post, dated 11th of January 2020, implied the release date would be sometime within the year, but did not specify. =5 Star Grave and The Silverblack= Besides providing vocals for Disarmonia Mundi, Claudio has been active since 2005 with the horror metal band 5 Star Grave releasing three albums so far: Corpse Breed Syndrome (self-produced, 2008), Drugstore Hell (Massacre Records, 2012), Drugstore Hell (Sliptrick Records, 2017). In late 2013 Claudio and longtime friend, producer and multi- instrumentalist NeroArgento started working on a new industrial metal project called The Silverblack releasing the self-titled debut album in 2014 via AExeron Media / FiXT divided into five monthly episodes of two songs each. The second album entitled The Grand Turmoil has been released by Sliptrick Records in autumn 2015 while in 2018 the band completed the production of their third full-length album entitled Rain On A Wedding Day that has been released via DarkTunes Music Group the 30th of November 2018. The Silverblack released their fourth album Prototype 6:17 November 21st 2019.

The development of the Byzantine Empire and trade brought in spices, sugar and new vegetables to Greece. Cooks experimented with new combinations of food, creating two styles in the process. These were the Eastern (Asia Minor and the Eastern Aegean), consisting of Byzantine cuisine supplemented by trade items, and a leaner style primarily based on local Greek culture. Diet Byzantine food consumption varied by class. The Imperial Palace was a metropolis of spices and exotic recipes; guests were entertained with fruits, honey-cakes and syrupy sweetmeats. Ordinary people ate more conservatively. The core diet consisted of bread, vegetables, pulses, and cereals prepared in varied ways. Salad was very popular; to the amazement of the Florentines, the Emperor John VIII Palaiologos asked for it at most meals on his visit in 1439. The Byzantines produced various cheeses, including anthotiro or kefalotyri. They also relished shellfish and fish, both fresh and salt-water. They prepared eggs to make famous omelettes ‚Äî called sphoungata, i.e. \\"spongy\\" ‚Äî mentioned by Theodore Prodromos. Every household also kept a supply of poultry. Byzantine elites obtained other kinds of meat by hunting animals like deer and wild boar , a favourite and distinguished occupation of men. They usually hunted with dogs and hawks, though sometimes employed trapping, netting, and bird-liming. Larger animals were a more expensive and rare food. Citizens slaughtered pigs at the beginning of winter and provided their families with sausages, salt pork, and lard for the year. Only upper middle and higher Byzantines could afford lamb. They seldom ate beef, as they used cattle to cultivate the fields. Middle and lower class citizens in cities such as Constantinople and Thessaloniki consumed the offerings of the taverna. The most common form of cooking was boiling, a tendency which sparked a derisive Byzantine maxim‚ÄîThe lazy cook prepares everything by boiling. Garos fermented fish sauce in all its varieties was especially favored as a condiment along with the umami flavoring murri, a fermented barley sauce, which was similar to the modern umami flavoring, the fermented soy product soy sauce. Liutprand of Cremona, the ambassador to Constantinople from Otto I, described being served food covered in an \\"exceedingly bad fish liquor,\\" a reference to garos. Many scholars state that Byzantine koptoplakous () and plakountas tetyromenous are the ancestors of modern baklava and tiropita (b√∂rek) respectively.Speros Vryonis The Decline of Medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor, 1971, p. 482 Both variants descended from the ancient Greek Placenta cake. Thanks to the location of Constantinople between popular trade routes, Byzantine cuisine was augmented by cultural influences from several locales‚Äîsuch as Lombard Italy, the Persian Empire, and an emerging Arabic Empire. The resulting melting pot continued during Ottoman times and therefore modern Turkish cuisine, Greek cuisine and Balkans cuisine have many similarities, and use a very wide range of ingredients.  Drink  Macedonia was renowned for its wines, served for upper class Byzantines. During the crusades and after, western Europeans valued costly Byzantine wines. The most famous example is the still extant Commandaria wine from Cyprus served at the wedding of King Richard the Lionheart. Other renowned varieties were Cretan wines from muscat grapes, Romania or Rumney (exported from Methoni in the western Peloponnese), and Malvasia or Malmsey (likely exported from Monemvasia). Retsina, wine flavored with pine resin, was also drunk, as it still is in Greece today, producing similar reactions from unfamiliar visitors, \\"To add to our calamity the Greek wine, on account of being mixed with pitch, resin, and plaster was to us undrinkable,\\" complained Liutprand of Cremona, who was the ambassador sent to Constantinople in 968 by the German Holy Roman Emperor Otto I.

Wellesley backdated the statute of foundation to 4 May 1800, to commemorate the first anniversary of his victory over Tipu Sultan at Seringapatam. Thousands of books were translated from Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, Bengali, Hindi, and Urdu into English at this institution. This college also promoted the printing and publishing of Urdu books. Languages Fort William College aimed at training British officials in Indian languages and, in the process, fostered the development of languages such as Bengali and Urdu.Sarkar, Nikhil, Printing and the Spirit of Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, pp. 130‚Äì2, Oxford University Press, . The period is of historical importance. In 1815, Ram Mohan Roy settled in Calcutta. It is considered by many historians to be the starting point of the Bengali Renaissance.Sengupta, Nitish, 2001‚Äì02, History of the Bengali-speaking People, UBS Publishers‚Äô Distributors Pvt. Ltd., . Establishment of The Calcutta Madrassa in 1781, the Asiatic Society in 1784 and the Fort William College in 1800, completed the first phase of Kolkata's emergence as an intellectual centre. Teaching of Asian languages dominated: Arabic, Urdu, Persian, Sanskrit, Bengali. Later, Marathi and even Chinese were added. Each department of the college was staffed by notable scholars. The Persian department was headed by Neil B. Edmonstone, Persian translator to the East India Company's government since 1794. His assistant teacher was John H. Harington, a judge of Sadar Diwani Adalat and Francis Gladwin, a soldier diplomat. For Arabic studies, there was Lt. John Baillie, a noted Arabist. The Urdu department was entrusted to John Borthwick Gilchrist, an Indologist of great repute. Henry Thomas Colebrooke, the famous orientalist, was head of the Sanskrit department. William Carey, a non- civilian missionary and a specialist in many Indian languages, was selected to head the department of vernacular languages. While notable scholars were identified and appointed for different languages, there was no suitable person in Calcutta who could be appointed to teach Bengali. In those days, the Brahmin scholars learnt only Sanskrit, considered to be the language of the gods, and they did not study Bengali. The authorities decided to appoint Carey, who was with the Baptist Mission in Serampore. He, in turn, appointed Mrityunjoy Vidyalankar as head pandit, Ramnath Bachaspati as second pandit and Ramram Basu as one of the assistant pandits.Mukhopadhyay, Prabhatkumar, Rammohun O Tatkalin Samaj O Sahitya, 1965, pp. 47‚Äì51, Viswa Bharati Granthan Bibhag . Along with teaching, translations were organized. The college employed more than one hundred local linguists. There were no textbooks available in Bengali. On 23 April 1789, the Calcutta Gazette published the humble request of several natives of Bengal for a Bengali grammar and dictionary. Location The college was located at the corner of Council House Street and the parade ground, (now named Maidan). After the college closed the building had a series of occupancies. First it was The Exchange of Messrs. Mackenzie Lyall & Co., then offices of the Bengal Nagpur Railway,Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, 1909/1980, General Printers and Publishers Pvt. Ltd. and lastly the Raj Bhavan ('Government House'). Library The College library of Fort William was an important centre of learning and housed a magnificent collection of old manuscripts and many valuable historical books from across South Asia. Multiple MS copies were printed. When the college was dissolved in 1854, the books of the collection listed for preservation were transferred to the newly formed Calcutta Public Library, now the National Library. Hurdles The court of directors of the British East India Company were never in favour of a training college in Calcutta, and for that reason there was always a lack of funds for running the college. Subsequently, a separate college for the purpose, the East India Company College at Haileybury (England), was established in 1807. However, Fort William College continued to be a centre of learning languages. With the British settling down in the seat of power, their requirements changed. Lord William Bentinck announced his educational policy of public instruction in English in 1835, mostly to cater to the growing needs of administration and commerce. He clipped the wings of Fort William College, and the Dalhousie administration formally dissolved the institution in 1854. Eminent scholars Fort William College was served by a number of eminent scholars. They contributed enormously towards development of Indian languages and literature. Some of them are noted below: * William Carey (1761‚Äì1834) was with Fort William College from 1801 to 1831. During this period he published a Bengali grammar and dictionary, numerous textbooks, the Bible, grammar and dictionary in other Indian languages.Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali (editors), 1976/1998, Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical dictionary) Vol I, . * Matthew Lumsden (1777‚Äì1835) * John Borthwick Gilchrist (June 1759 ‚Äì 1841) * Mrityunjay Vidyalankar (c. 1762 ‚Äì 1819) was First Pandit at Fort William College. He wrote a number of textbooks and is considered the first 'conscious artist' of Bengali prose.Acharya, Poromesh, Education in Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, pp. 108‚Äì9, Oxford University Press, . Although a Sanskrit scholar he started writing Bengali as per the needs of Fort William College. He published Batris Singhasan (1802), Hitopodesh (1808) and Rajabali (1808). The last named book was the first published history of India. Mrityunjoy did not know English so the contents were possibly provided by other scholars of Fort William College. * Tarini Charan Mitra (1772‚Äì1837), a scholar in English, Urdu, Hindi, Arabic and Persian, was with the Hindustani department of Fort William College. He had translated many stories into Bengali. * Lallu Lal (also spelt as Lalloolal or Lallo Lal), the father of Sanskritized Hindustani prose, was instructor in Hindustani at Fort William College. He printed and published in 1815 the first book in the old Hindi literary language Braj Bhasha, Tulsidas's Vinaypatrika. * Ramram Basu (1757‚Äì1813) was with the Fort William College. He assisted William Carey, Joshua Marshman and William Ward in the publication of the first Bengali translation of the Bible. * Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar (1820‚Äì1891) was head pandit at Fort William College from 1841 to 1846. He concentrated on English and Hindi while serving in the college. After discharging his duties as academician, and engagements as a reformer he had little time for creative writing. Yet through the textbooks he produced, the pamphlets he wrote and retelling of Kalidasa's Shakuntala and Shakespeare's A Comedy of Errors he set the norm of standard Bengali prose. * Madan Mohan Tarkalankar (1817‚Äì1858) taught at Fort William College. He was one of the pioneers of textbook writing.

The region includes nearly all of Galicia, Asturias, and Cantabria, in addition to the northern parts of the Basque Country, as well as a small portion of Navarre. Climate and landscape It is called green because its wet and temperate oceanic climate helps lush pastures and forests thrive, providing a landscape similar to that of Ireland, Great Britain, and the west coast of France. The climate and landscape are determined by the Atlantic Ocean winds whose moisture gets trapped by the mountains circumventing the Spanish Atlantic fa√ßade. Because of the Foehn effect, the southern slopes fall inside the rain shadow zone and so Green Spain contrasts starkly with the Spanish drier central plateau. Conversely, in those brief episodes when the southwestern winds blow through the mountains (especially during October and Novemberhttp://www.euskalmet.euskadi.net/s07-5921/es/contenidos/informacion/ana_viento/es_7279/es_viento.html from Euskalmet, Basque Meteorology Agency (in Spanish)), the effect reverses, the northern coast gets inside the Foehn winds and is dry and much warmer than the inner plateau, where rain is present. The average precipitation is about 1,200 mm, higher than in most areas in inland central Europe, and wetter than almost anywhere in Spain, a country generally considered dry (the main exception to this northernly rainfall trend is the Sierra de Grazalema, in the southern province of C√°diz, with mountains that block the Atlantic moisture- carrying winds and which is, indeed, the most rainy place in Spain). Asturias has an average summer temperature of 20-22 ¬∞C, being one of the mildest climates in Europe. Most of the rain comes from the Atlantic through Galicia, the western part of Green Spain. Depending on the latitude of entry, this wet air can drop to the south, or more likely stay and run through the north stretch of land, pushed north by the Cantabrian mountains.  Native species  The main native tree species of this biome are beeches and oaks. However, since the second half of the 20th century, in some areas (especially in coastal areas), native forests have been replaced by plantations of eucalyptus and Monterey Pines for its commercial exploitation in the paper industry. The Pyrenees, which sometimes are considered in the same geologic system as the Cantabrian Mountains, were once included in Green Spain, even though the rainfall there has different patterns and the general landscape is more alpine rather than genuinely oceanic.

Tyndall Jr., (3 March 1917 ‚Äì 30 June 2006), whose full name was David Patrick Tyndall Jr., was a leading Irish businessman in the 20th century, who started out in a family business with his eponymous father and eldest brother William, and played an important role in helping modernise the wholesale and retail grocery trade, consolidate it, and enable the family grocery shop owner adapt to the advent of supermarkets. He also played a key role at the head of several business organisations, was a world traveller and amateur pilot, who also featured in the Guinness Book of Records as the oldest man ever to fly a helicopter solo. Family background He was a son of Sarah (n√©e Gaynor) and David P. Tyndall (Sr.). He married Molly (n√©e Kettle) in September 1949, and they had four children: Mona, Mary, Pauline and Vivian. Career in Business He was known for his keen sense of opportunity and strategic vision, and his success at mergers and acquisitions earned him the nickname \\"Take-over Tyndall\\" in Irish business circles. Known as a caring employer, he absorbed many of the employees of wholesalers who closed down (Hugh, Moore & Alexander, Shirley Spence & Belford, McMaster, Hodgson, R. Jones & Co.), and introduced a bonus incentive scheme, and a scheme of non-contributory pensions for all employees. He lay behind the first initiative of an Irish wholesale group to establish a bonded warehouse to expand their wine & spirits business. After his father's retirement, and in close collaboration with his older brother William, he expanded the Tyndall interests to include retail stores, through joint ventures for self-service stores across Ireland. Their reputation for honesty and loyal relationships with banks and insurance companies guaranteed them support in times of need, such as when damages were incurred due to floods or fire, etc. They successfully resisted a 25% takeover bid by Irish businessman Tony O'Reilly in 1971. Eventually they sold AWL to Joshua Watson Ltd., and Dave joined its board. It was later taken over by Irish Distillers, who were later taken over in 1988 by Pernod-Ricard. The Tyndall brothers continued to maintain their other interests, William retired in 1980 and Dave retired in 1984, after fifty-one years in the grocery business. Aviation interests Dave's aviation interests included an active involvement (President) with the Leinster Aero Club, currently based in TREVET (EITT), near Dunshaughlin, Co. Meath. The Leinster Aero Club was founded in 1956 and originally based at Weston Aerodrome. In 1964, the club re-located to Dublin Airport, where it existed until relocating back to Weston in 2004. In 2006, the club moved to Trevet Airfield, a newly licensed field near Dunshaughlin, Co. Meath. There are over 50 members in the club ranging from SPLs, PPLs, CPLs, ATPLs and Instructors.

Biography  Wood was born in Parbold, Lancashire and grew up in a musical family; while still a teenager, he was encouraged by the composer Alan Bush. He says that his \\"earliest enthusiasm was Bach... and that's been at the center of everything ever since.\\"In conversation with Robert Worby on BBC Radio 3's Hear and Now program (broadcast 16 June 2012) After military service in Egypt, he studied History at New College, Oxford, where he dedicated much of his time to music and writing compositions for the theatre. In 1954, he moved to London to study composition privately with William Lloyd Webber, Anthony Milner, Iain Hamilton, and M√°ty√°s Seiber. He also started a parallel career as a music teacher by finding work in schools, including Morley College, and as a lecturer at the Royal Academy of Music. In 1958 Wood composed his first published work: a set of variations for viola and piano showing the influence of Schoenberg and thematic references to Beethoven, which was premiered by Cecil Aronowitz. His first orchestral work, Scenes from Comus (with soloists and chorus), was commissioned by the BBC and composed between 1962 and 1965. Its premiere at the 1965 BBC Proms provided Wood with a public success. Wood's works are always cogently constructed, knitting together densely wrought counterpoint with rigorous motivic working, sometimes using a personalized serialist language. His music commands a broad communicative range: it can be violently expressionistic, poignantly lyrical, or even, as in the jazz inflected Piano Concerto, exuberantly rhythmic. Wood likes to compose slowly and he typically prefers chamber music genres, though several of his large- scale works, such as his Symphony and Violin Concerto, are amongst his best known. In recent years he has contributed several articles on music to The Times Literary Supplement. In 2007 his collected writings on music, Staking Out the Territory was published by Plumbago Books and the following year Ashgate Books published The Music of Hugh Wood by Edward Venn. = Career highlights = * 1965 ‚Äì highly acclaimed Proms premiere of BBC commission Scenes from Comus. * 1969 ‚Äì Proms premiere of Cello Concerto, commissioned by the BBC. * 1978 ‚Äì Premiere of String Quartet No 3 at the Bath Festival. * 1982 ‚Äì Proms premiere of Symphony by the BBC Symphony Orchestra. * 1998 ‚Äì UK premiere of Variations for Orchestra at Last Night of the Proms. * 1999 ‚Äì Serenade and Elegy premiered at Cheltenham Festival. * 2001 ‚Äì The Lindsay Quartet premiere String Quartet No 5 in Sheffield. * 2015 ‚Äì Proms premiere of BBC commission Epithalamion with BBC Symphony Chorus and Orchestra conducted by Sir Andrew Davis  Key works  * Variations for viola and piano, Op 1 (1958) * Trio for flute, viola and piano, Op 3 (1961) * Scenes from Comus, Op 6 (1962‚Äì1965) * Cello Concerto, Op 12 (1965‚Äì1969) * Chamber Concerto for large ensemble, Op 15 (1971) * Violin Concerto No.1, Op 17 (1970‚Äì1972) * Song Cycle to Poems of Pablo Neruda for high voice and chamber orchestra, Op 19 (1973‚Äì1974) * String Quartet No 3, Op 20 (1978) * Symphony, Op 21 (1982) * Piano Trio, Op 24 (1982‚Äì1984) * Horn Trio, Op 29 (1989) * Cantata for chorus and orchestra, Op 30 (1989) * Piano Concerto, Op 32 (1991) * Variations for Orchestra, Op 39 (1994‚Äì1997) * Wild Cyclamen, Op 49 (2005‚Äì2006) * Violin Concerto No.2, Op 50 (2003‚Äì2004) * Michael Berkeley Tribute for viola solo (2004) * Divertimento for Strings, Op 51 (2007) * Clarinet Quintet, Op 53 (2007) * Beginnings: Three Early Songs for soprano and strings, Op 54 (2010)  Recordings  * Clarinet Trio ‚Äì Divine Art 25009 * The Kingdom of God ‚Äì Hyperion CDA66758 * Overture; Variations Op.1; Paraphrase on 'Bird of Paradise'; Poem; Clarinet Trio; Piano Trio ‚Äì Toccata Classics TOCC0075 * Scenes from Comus; Symphony ‚Äì NMC D070 * String Quartet Nos 1‚Äì4 ‚Äì Conifer 75605 51239-2 * String Quartet Nos 2 & 3; The Horses; The Rider Victory ‚Äì Lyrita SRCD.304 * Violin Concerto; Cello Concerto ‚Äì NMC D082  References   External links  * Hugh Wood's homepage at Chester Music * 2002 interview with Hugh Wood for Classical Source * Staking Out the Territory and Other Writings on Music, a collection of articles and essays by Hugh Wood. 1932 births English composers Living people ","title":"Hugh Wood"},{"id":"5771288","text":"Demir Baba teke, Alian sacred place The Alian Kƒ±zƒ±lba≈üƒ´ community (in Turkish Alyanlar or Tajiklar), are a Shi\`a order, similar to the Sufi Mevlevi, who live in several regions of Bulgaria. Alians revere the name \\"Ali\\" carried by their circle of 12 Imams (awliya'), which they consider an emanation of God.Based on Ayats 2:107, 3:105, 5:55, 6:14, 33:17 and 9:116 etc.. They follow the mystical rituals of the wandering dervishes. Origin theories Their exact origin is not certain, since few relevant historical records have been preserved, but according to the prevailing theory they fled to Bulgaria from Central Anatolia after the 1512 victory by the Ottoman Sultan Selim I, a Sunni, over the first Turcoman Safavid shah of the Persians, Ismail I. Alians appear to be descendants of a Sufi-dervish-like group of priests but they themselves believe about 10% are the descendants of the earliest Christians of Asia Minor who fled the Sunni invasion of Anatolia. They believe the Sunni Muhammad is a false Muhammad. Ali for them is not one single historical person but the ineffable name kept by God's Ministers (Avlioh). It has also been suggested that they perhaps first came to the Balkans during the 15th century, in order to keep up the morale of Ottoman soldiers and to help integrate the newly conquered peoples into the empire. However, it is not likely since the Ottomans were Sunnis while the Alians are viewed as ghulat by other Muslims for their heterodox views concerning Muhammad and Ali. However, the reverse accusation is returned that their attackers are Munafiqun for abandoning the articles of Imaan especially that concerning belief in the 4 books which Alians believe and for adopting ibn Hazm's doctrine of Tahrif instead which Alians reject. Observances and beliefs The Alians have very similar beliefs and practices to the Alevis and along with Alevis are surviving examples of pre-Sunni Islam because the Alians are believed to be descendants of a member of the Banu Eli tribe who was called Abbas ibn Ali and Umm ul- Banin so their 12 imams (referring to 12 ministerial roles during the Alian Mass) has nothing to do with Twelver Shiism. They believe the Quran was compiled by an Alian ex-convert to Monophysitism from Zoroastrianism called Salman al-Farsi whom they hold in high esteem. Their tafsir of the Quran based on syncretic harmony between the 4 books (Quran, the Old Testament, the New Testament and Psalter) places them firmly within the Judeo-Christian tradition. They are a closed society and zealously hide their rituals. Circumcision, reserved for the priests, is done when the boy is one week old. At the age of 13 years his pubic hair may be trimmed in a special ceremony where only male Elders are present. They are monogamous and should only marry other Alians. Marriages may be arranged years in advance by the families but the couple are only married together as young men and women because, contrary to general Islamic practice, child marriages are abhorred by Alians. It is known that Alians are mysticists and believe in personal communication with God through a near-trance state during Zikr. They do not use the Sunni Islamic rituals, but the Persian calendar, an Old Rite-style breviary and use candles and wine during their Mass which they call Dzhem on Thursday nights to achieve the Haqq‚ÄìMuhammad‚ÄìAli communion. They celebrate Christmas (Gaxand) and Easter (Sultan Nowruz) while revering Christian saints especially Saint Nicholas as well as Sufi saints using icons and crosses alongside tasbih. Along with other Alevis. They historically placed a great role among themselves for converting Christians in Bulgaria.Tareekh e Alian ‚Äì Shaikh Zakaria pages ‚Äì 92‚Äì113 A tradition is performed among Alians and other Alevis after the 3rd week of December until the first week of January where St Nicholas (Grandfather Gaxan also known more recently as Baba Noel) and his bride Fadike and a character normally known as the Arab will visit the homes in the community to perform a play and collect gifts then go on to distribute them to others in the community especially Zeyi (young women who can not afford dowries) and distribute nuts, sweets, chocolates and dried fruits to children. Alian shrines are visited by Balkan Christians and do themselves also sometimes attend Christian Churches and frequent Balkan Christian Shrines. However, Alians have always refused to visit madrassahs in the Ottoman Empire, because orthodox Sunni Islam was taught there. As a consequence, they educated their children only within the bounds of their society, and that has led to a decline among them. The situation, along with the reticence of their esoteric culture, and the urbanization, doomed them to gradual assimilation into Orthodox Christianity or secularism. By the Second World War and the following communism in Bulgaria, many Alians fled in the European part of Turkey. In recent decades, the Muslim Brotherhood has pushed an agenda to assimilate them into Sunni Islam but have failed miserably. In fact, Alians have successfully converted thousands of Sunnis to their form of Islam since World War 2.Tareekh e Alian ‚Äì Shaikh Zakaria pages ‚Äì 56‚Äì63 Demir Baba teke is a sacred place to Alians and other Islamic sects because Demir Baba, a famous dervish who lived during the 16th century, is buried there in the lands of northeastern Bulgaria.

It was the first of three consecutive Accept records to utilize Dirk Steffens as producer. The album finds Accept continuing to search for their musical direction, experimenting with a more commercial sound than on their debut. Bassist Peter Baltes once again sings lead vocals on two tracks, the slower-paced songs \\"No Time to Lose\\" and \\"The King\\". The title track is credited to George Alexander, which is a pseudonym for Alex Young, eldest brother of record producer and musician George Young and AC/DC guitarists Angus Young and Malcolm Young. Guitarist Wolf Hoffmann recalled the circumstances that led Alex Young to work with Accept: \\"He got involved with Accept through the producer. Everybody after the first record said we have to have a radio hit. 'Guys you need a radio hit and we have just the song for you. Why don't you try this here?'\\" The song became the basis for the band's first music video. Lead singer Udo Dirkschneider believes that the album \\"wasn't too inspired. I think because of some unsuccessful experiments, the band wasn't too solid and the identity wasn't discovered yet.\\" He also blamed \\"too many people involved trying to manipulate the band, just like on the first album.\\" Accept would become determined to resolve these deficiencies on their next album, Breaker.

These international versions both depict a sword hilt on the cover, a more identifiably \\"heavy metal\\" image than the original German cover, which has a doorway-type shape encasing the band members superimposed on a picture of a crowded city street.

Its reputation led to the use of the word bluebeat as a generic term to describe all styles of early Jamaican pop music, including music by artists not associated with the record label. History The Blue Beat label was founded in 1960, in London, as an imprint of Emil E. Shalit's Melodisc Records.Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, , p. 31-32\\"'Blue Beat' Brought Jamaican Ska To UK Shores\\", Jamaica Gleaner, 29 June 2014. Retrieved 29 June 2014 Melodisc, which was founded in London in 1947, specialised in releasing calypso and mento and imported American jazz music. The Blue Beat label focused on American-influenced Jamaican blues and R&B;, which later evolved into ska, and was launched following the positive response in the United Kingdom to Laurel Aitken's Melodisc release of \\"Lonesome Lover\\". Shalit put Sigimund \\"Siggy\\" Jackson in charge of the label, and Jackson subsequently chose the name Blue Beat, which he said was an adaptation of \\"It sounds like blues and it's got a great beat\\" or \\"Blues Beat\\", which apparently was a generic term for Jamaican blues music at the time. The early years: 1960s and 1970s The first release on the Blue Beat label was \\"Boogie Rock\\" by Laurel Aitken, which was licensed from Dada Tewari's Downbeat label. The Blue Beat label's distinctive blue covers and silver logo first appeared with the label's third release, \\"Manny Oh\\" by Higgs and Wilson. The Blue Beat label reached licensing agreements with the majority of major Jamaican producers and also released many home-produced recordings by Siggy Jackson, featuring English-based artists such as the Marvels. Even some Prince Buster hits, including \\"Wash-Wash\\", were recorded in London, and involved well-known UK musicians such as Georgie Fame. The Blue Beat label released around 400 singles and over a dozen albums between 1960 and 1967.Adams, Owen (2008) \\"Label of Love: Blue Beat Records\\", The Guardian, 15 December 2008, retrieved 2011-06-25 Prince Buster became the Blue Beat label's biggest star, with songs such as \\"Al Capone\\". Siggy Jackson established a Blue Beat night at the Marquee Club in London, and fashion accessories featuring the Blue Beat label's logo became popular. Many records on the Blue Beat label were played alongside soul music in dance clubs such as the Twisted Wheel in Manchester. In addition to appealing greatly to the West Indian community in the UK, the music became associated with the British mods of the early to mid-1960s, as well as the skinheads of the late 1960s. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, records on the Blue Beat label became highly collectable amongst those who regarded records like Prince Buster's \\"Al Capone\\" as classics. When the ska rhythm slowed to rocksteady around 1966, Melodisc started a new sub-label, Fab, and the Blue Beat label stopped issuing new releases after 1967 (although the back catalogue continued to sell for several years). Jackson left to work for EMI, where he founded the Columbia Blue Beat label. The Blue Beat label was revived in 1972 for a short run of obscure releases including John Holt's \\"Ok Fred\\" and \\"Sad News\\" singles. as well as reissues of some of the popular classics from Prince Buster's catalogue such as Al Capone and Ten Commandments Of Man. Later in the decade some of these tunes were once again reissued in 12\\" single format to supply the new younger audience that emerged from the 2-Tone generation. 1980s and 1990s In 1987, Buster Bloodvessel (of the 2 Tone ska revival band Bad Manners) and producer Ivan Healy Purvis started a brand new record label called Blue Beat Records and licensed the Blue Beat label name and logo. The label was run from a reclaimed riverboat named \\"The Bloodvessel\\", which was in Bloodvessel's backyard in Spring Hill. Between 1987 and 1990, this label released several records, including the Bad Manners album Return of The Ugly. The Bad Manners single \\"Skaville UK\\" was the last Blue Beat single to make an impact on the UK charts, reaching #87 in 1989. 21st century In 2004, Siggy Jackson was approached by No.1 Station band leader Marcus Upbeat (aka Downbeat) with the idea of starting a revival of The Blue Beat Label. Together Siggy and Marcus released a series of 7-inch singles on the label in the style of The Blue Beat Label's 1960s output. These releases included six singles by No. 1 Station, which featured The Blue Beat Label veteran Eddie 'Tan-Tan' Thornton on trumpet and several guest vocalists, including The Marvels. Siggy Jackson re-issued several tracks from his own back catalogue, as well as one single each from ska revival band Intensified and veterans of The Blue Beat Label the Pyramids. Siggy also reissued two Laurel Aitken tracks, and a single by the Mopeds which had previously been issued on Columbia Blue Beat. These releases were all limited edition vinyl pressings. Siggy Jackson retired from the music industry in 2008. Marcus Upbeat then acquired The Blue Beat Label to continue with label's revival. In 2011, Marcus Upbeat registered Blue Beat Records Ltd to continue The Blue Beat Label.From Companies House Website - BLUE BEAT RECORDS LTD, Company No. 07824089 Status: Active, Date of Incorporation: 26/10/2011, Country of Origin: United Kingdom, Company Type: Private Limited Company, Nature of Business (SIC):90030 - Artistic creation and in 2011 released another new 7\\" single on The Blue Beat Label. Marcus then embraced the emerging and ever faster growing digital age for The Blue Beat Label. An exclusive digital distribution agreement for The Blue Beat Label was implemented and over the following years a few selective No.1 Station and other releases were made available for digital release on iTunes and other reputable digital outlets. The Blue Beat Label got a further reboot in 2019 with the release of a brand new Marcus UpBeat single She's So Sweet on 7 inch vinyl and digital single release on The Blue Beat Label, and a new website featuring all the releases on the label over the past sixty years,thebluebeatlabel.com alongside Marcus Upbeat agreeing a deal with Tipp Investments to acquire a stake in Blue Beat Records Ltd. It has been reported that the deal is due to complete during April 2020. The Blue Beat Label is still going independently as it reaches sixty.

The Shahadah (profession of faith) is not considered a pillar and is instead seen as the foundation upon which they are built.IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ fƒ´qh (jurisprudence) IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´ pillars * Walayah \\"guardianship\\" denotes love and devotion to God, the prophets, the scripture, the imams and the du'ƒÅt \\"missionaries\\". In IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´ doctrine, God is one and the true desire of every soul, creator of everything. the appointed du'ƒÅt lead believers to the right path. The Druze refer to this pillar as Taslƒ´m \\"Submission\\": An informative article on the Seven Pillars and Walayah. * Taharah \\"purity\\": The IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´ lay special emphasis on purity and its related practices, and the Nizari consider this in a more esoteric sense too and apply it to purity of mind, soul and action, the Musta'lis also apply it to ritual practices related to prayer and cleanliness. * Salat \\"prayer\\": Unlike Sunni and Twelver Muslims, Nizari IsmƒÅ'ƒ´liyya reason that it is up to the current imƒÅm to designate the style and form of prayer, and for this reason the current Nizari prayer is called Du'a and they pray three times a day. These three times have been related with the three times that have been mentioned in the Qur'an: sunrise, before sunset, and after sunset. In contrast, the Musta'lƒ´ maintain five prayers and their style is generally closely related to that of the Twelvers. The Druze believe that the meaning of prayer is sidqu l-lisƒÅn \\"speaking Truth (to/about God)\\" and do not believe in five daily prayers. They do sometimes attend prayers, which is the practice of the \\"uninitiated\\" (juhhƒÅl) and historically was also done for reasons of taqiyya. * Zakah \\"charity\\": with the exception of the Druze, all IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´ Madh'hab have practices resembling that of Sunni and Twelver Muslims with the addition of the characteristic Shƒ´'a khums: payment of one fifth of all income earned at the end of the year to the imƒÅm. Nizari IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´s donate 10% to 12.5% of their monthly net income (after taxes, basic living necessities and debt repayment) to the ImƒÅm, an amount which includes zakat and khums. Part of this money is typically paid to organizations run by the Aga Khan Development Network, one of the biggest welfare networks in the world. Thus, IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´s believe that as Muhammad was designated to take zakƒÅt from the believers in the past, it is now the duty to pay the imƒÅm or his representative. The Druze practice hifzu l-'IkhwƒÅn \\"protection of one's brothers\\", instead of paying a fee, involves a culturally complex practice of interdependence. * Sawm \\"fasting\\": Nizari and Musta'lƒ´ believe in both a metaphorical and literal meaning of fasting. The literal meaning is that one must fast as an obligation, such as during the Ramadan and the metaphorical meaning being that one is in attainment of the Divine Truth and must strive to avoid worldly activities which may detract from this goal. In particular, IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´s believe the real and esoteric meaning of fasting is avoiding devilish acts and doing good deeds. Not eating during the month of Ramadan in conjunction with a metaphorical implementation of fasting. The Druze emphasise the esoteric meaning, which they call tark 'ibƒÅdat al-awthƒÅn \\"deserting idol-worship\\": that which detracts from communion with God is an idol (wathan). * Hajj \\"pilgrimage\\": For IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´s, visiting the imƒÅm or his representative is one of the most aspired pilgrimages. There are two pilgrimages, Hajj-i-Zahiri and Hajj-i-Batini. The first is the visit to Mecca; the second, being in the presence of the Imam. The Musta'lƒ´ also maintain the practice of going to Mecca. The Druze interpret this completely metaphorically as \\"fleeing from devils and oppressors\\" and rarely go to Mecca. * Jihad \\"Struggle\\": The definition of jihad is controversial as it has two meanings: \\"the Greater Struggle\\" and \\"the Lesser Struggle\\", the latter of which means a confrontation with the enemies of the faith. The Nizari are pacifist and interpret \\"adversaries\\" of the faith as personal and social vices (i.e. wrath, intolerance, etc.) and those individuals who harm the peace of the faith and avoid provocation and use force only as a final resort only in self-defense. The Druze have a long history of military and political engagement, but refer to this pillar solely as Rƒ´da \\"Contentment\\" ‚Äì the war to fight that which removes one from the ease of the Divine Presence, a meaning similar to that of the Nizari. In addition, the 'UqqƒÅl \\"Wise Ones\\", the religious cadre of the Druze, are pacifists. Druze list The ordering of the pillars as understood by Druze is as follows: # Taslƒ´m \\"submission\\" denotes love and devotion to God, the prophets, the ImƒÅm (al-Hakƒ´m) and the du‚ÄòƒÅt \\"missionaries\\". In IsmƒÅ‚Äòƒ´lƒ´ doctrine, God is the true desire of every soul, and he manifests himself in the forms of prophets and imƒÅms; the appointed du‚ÄòƒÅt lead believers to the right path. # ShahƒÅdatayn \\"profession of faith\\". The Druze never mention ‚ÄòAlƒ´, unlike most IsmƒÅ‚Äòƒ´lƒ´s, as they believe al-Hakƒ´m supersedes his authority. # Sidqu l-LisƒÅn \\"speaking truth (to/about God)\\": The Druze believe that the meaning of prayer is sidqu l-lisƒÅn and do not believe in five daily prayers. They do sometimes attend prayers, which is the practice of the \\"uninitiated\\" (juhhƒÅl) and historically was also done for reasons of taqiyya # Hifzu l-IkhwƒÅn \\"protection of one's brothers\\": The Druze practice a culturally complex system of interdependence instead of a set fee to a religious scholar or organisation (i.e. zakat) # Tark ‚ÄòIbƒÅdat al-AwthƒÅn \\"deserting idol-worship\\": The Druze emphasise the esoteric meaning of the traditional pillar called sawm, by which they mean that which detracts from communion with God is an idol (wathan). # Hajj \\"pilgrimage\\": The Druze interpret this completely metaphorically as \\"fleeing from devils and oppressors\\" and rarely go to Mecca. # Rƒ´da \\"contentment\\": The Druze have a long history of military and political engagement, but refer to this pillar solely as the struggle (jihad) to fight that which removes you from the ease of the Divine Presence, a meaning similar to that of the Nizari.

The building was constructed in 1938‚Äì1939. The Gullichsens were a wealthy couple and members of the Ahlstr√∂m family. They told Aalto that he should regard it as 'an experimental house'. Aalto seems to have treated the house as an opportunity to bring together all the themes that had been preoccupying him in his work to that point but had not been able to include them in actual buildings. Today, Villa Mairea is considered one of the most important buildings Aalto designed in his career. Introduction The plan of the Villa Mairea is a modified L-shape of the kind Aalto had used before. It is a layout which automatically created a semi- private enclosure to one side, and a more exclusive, formal edge to confront the public world on the other. The lawn and the swimming pool are situated in the angle of the L, with a variety of rooms overlooking them. Horizontals and overhangs in the main composition echo the ground plane, and the curved pool weds the nearby forest topography. In contrast to these softening devices, the main facade has a more rigid, formal mood, and even possesses a canopy restated in a garden pergola vocabulary of bindings, poles and slats. The interiors of the Villa Mairea are richly articulated in wood, stone and brick. The spaces vary in size from the grand to the cabin-like. =Clients= The Villa Mairea was designed for Harry and Maire Gullichsen, to whom Aalto was introduced in 1935, by Nils-Gustav Hahl. Hahl was keen to promote his bentwood furniture designs. Maire, after whom the house was named, was the daughter of Walter Ahlstr√∂m, of the Timber and Paper Company. She studied painting in Paris during the early 1920s, and in 1928, married the businessman Harry Gullichsen, who four years later became managing director of the A. Ahlstr√∂m Company. Maire and Hahl had the idea of founding an avant-garde art gallery in Helsinki to act as a focus of progressive culture, and in due course this became ‚ÄòARTEK‚Äô, now world-famous as manufacturers and distributors of Aalto's furniture and glassware. The Gullichsens believed in the possibility of a social utopia based on technological progress, and found in Alvar Aalto a designer who shared their ideals and could give them convincing architectural expression. Aalto and his first wife Aino had undertaken various projects for the Ahlstr√∂m Company, including workers' housing, social facilities, and the celebrated Sunila Plant, completed in 1939, but it was in the Villa Mairea itself that the character of their utopian vision was demonstrated most fully. Family projects The villa was the third major house built with Ahlstr√∂m money. In 1877 the founder of the company, Maire's grandfather Antti Ahlstr√∂m, had built an imposing wooden house as a family residence in Noormarkku, a village a few miles inland from the town of Pori on Finland's west coast; at the turn of the century her father, Walter, commissioned an art nouveau house on a nearby site. As Aalto's biographer G√∂ran Schildt has pointed out, each was representative of the values of their time: the first an expression of semi-feudal authority organized around a highly formalized style of living, the latter underlining ‚Äòthe domestic happiness afforded by solid riches, with comfortable rooms, cosy furniture and luxurious, well-tended garden grounds‚Äô. The new villa ‚Äì to be used as a summer house, a form of retreat to nature traditional in Finland ‚Äì was intended to express the aspirations of the new generation and of the Gullichsens‚Äô vision of ‚Äòthe good life‚Äô which they believed industrialization would eventually make available to the majority in the newly independent state. Initial concepts Aalto began work on the Villa towards the end of 1937, and was given an almost free hand by his clients. His first proposal was a rustic hut modelled on vernacular farmhouses. Early in 1938, however, inspiration came from a radically different source, the residence named ‚ÄòFallingwater‚Äô designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, which had just received international acclaim thanks to an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and publication in Life and Time magazines, as well as in architectural journals. Such was Aalto's enthusiasm for the design, Schildt tells us, that he tried to persuade the Gullichsens to build their home over a stream on Ahlstr√∂m land a few miles out of Noormarkku. =Serpentine= The influence of Fallingwater is evident in several sheets of studies, which show boldly cantilevered balconies and an undulating basement story intended as a substitution for the natural forms of the stream and rocks. In later sketches, the free-form basement appears as an upper-floor studio with a serpentine wall sunk into a one-and-half storey entrance hall, forming a drop-ceiling around the fireplace. The undulating, wave-like form was already established as a leitmotiv of Aalto's work: it was familiar from the vases designed for the 'Savoy Restaurant' in Helsinki. It also featured prominently in the second-prize-winning entry for the Finnish Pavilion at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (Paris World Fair of 1937), named ‚ÄòTsit Tsit Pum‚Äô. Aalto won the first prize with a different design and, never one to waste a good idea, used vast sinuous partitions as the primary spatial device of his masterly design for the New York Fair of 1939. The free forms of nature were seen as symbols of human freedom, and as early as 1926 Aalto remarked that the ‚Äòcurving, living, unpredictable line which runs in dimensions unknown to mathematics, is for me the incarnation of everything that forms a contrast in the modern world between brutal mechanicalness and religious beauty in life. The fact that the Finnish word aalto means ‚Äòwave‚Äô doubtless added a certain piquancy to his attraction to the motif. Fireplace, interior view Fireplace, as seen from gardens =L-shape= Throughout his early studies for the Villa, Aalto envisaged an L-shaped plan similar to that of his own house in Munkkiniemi (1934‚Äì36). There, the ‚ÄòL‚Äô shape distinguishes between the house proper and the integral studio; at Villa Mairea, it separates the family accommodation from that of a courtyard - garden variously enclosed by combinations of walls, fences, trellises and the wooden sauna. Demetri Porphyrios has pointed out that this plan form is common amongst Scandinavian aristocratic residences; it was also used, for example, by Gunnar Asplund in his celebrated Snellman House of 1919. Although Aalto's clients had asked for an ‚Äòexperimental‚Äô house, it is significant that he first envisaged it as a reversion to a vernacular form, and then as a variant on a familiar plan type; in embodying a vision of the future, Aalto is at pains to endow the dwelling with strong memories of the past. 'Proto-Mairea' In the early spring of 1938 the Gullichsens approved a design which Schildt has called the Proto-Mairea, on the basis of which construction began in the summer. The plan established the basic disposition of accommodation found in the finished house, with the dining situated in the corner between the family rooms and the servants' wing, and the bedrooms and Maire's studio upstairs, the latter originally expressed as a free-form curve in elevation, rather than plan. Aalto's analysis of the activities to be accommodated produced a schedule of reception rooms which included an entrance hall with an open fireplace, a living room, a gentlemen's room, a ladies‚Äô room, a library, a music room, a winter garden, a table tennis room and an art gallery. It read more like the programme for a Victorian country house than a demonstration of the social-democratic dwelling of the future, and Aalto was far from satisfied with the design. A young Swiss student working in his office at the time recalls that he used to scold the model like a naughty dog, explaining to her that 'those people don't need so many rooms'. =Redesign= After the foundations had been excavated Aalto had a new idea and was able to persuade his clients to accept a radical redesign in which only the plan footprint and servant wing remained more or less intact. The basement was greatly reduced in area, and the main entrance moved from its curious position at the side and rear to a much more obvious location in front of the dining room. Marie's studio was re-positioned to occupy the place above the former entrance canopy, whose shape it echoes, and the various reception rooms were accommodated in a large 14 metre-square space. The separate art gallery was removed and its place taken by the sauna, which nestles against a low L-shaped stone wall, the remainder of the original wall and trellis being replaced by a short fence and earth mound. Harry Gullichsen's only objection to the revised design was the lack of a separate library where he could hold confidential business meetings, for which Aalto proposed a small room screened by movable shelving units which did not reach the ceiling. Aalto suggested that these units could also be used for storing Maire's art collection ‚Äì an idea which, he pointed out, should be 'socially supportable as it could be realized in a small, even single room, dwelling' where the inhabitant has ‚Äòa personal relationship to the phenomena of art'. Not surprisingly, this arrangement did not offer the necessary acoustic privacy and the shelving units were permanently sited (although not actually fixed), with one angled to suggest frozen movement; the gap under the ceiling was filled with an undulating glazed screen. ii Final design Although the revised plan followed the existing foundations, the transformation achieved a compression and coherence in the spatial organization which had been almost entirely lacking in the ‚ÄòProto-Mairea‚Äô. The entrance opens into a small top-lobby, from which another door straight ahead leads into an open hall positioned four steps below the main level. One enters on axis with the dining table beyond, but the axiality is undermined by asymmetry of a screen of wooden poles and a free-standing, angled wall which together define an informal ante-room between the living room and dining room. The angle of the low wall is set from the corner of the white-plastered fireplace diagonally opposite, which becomes the natural centre of attention as one ascends the step into the living room. Similar diagonal relationships are established between Harry Gullichsen's private library/study and the ‚Äòwinter garden‚Äô (which Maire used for flower arranging and from which a stair leads directly up to her studio), and between the main staircase and open sun-lit part of the living room into which eyes are drawn as you emerge from behind the vertical poles which screen the stairs. File:Alvar Aalto, Villa Mairea 01.jpgDetail at main entrance File:Alvar Aalto, Villa Mairea 02.jpgView from main entrance File:Alvar Aalto, Villa Mairea 06.jpgFront door, detail =Living room= The open living room is planned around a rectilinear structural grid whose dimensions are adjusted to suit the disposition of rooms above. This is in contrast to the conventional Modernist practice exemplified by the work of Le Corbusier by comparison with the sophisticated spatial composition of the ground floor. Aalto varies the dimensions of the structural grid in both directions, and the circular steel columns are randomly placed; in one case, they are tripped clad with wooden strips or bound with rattan, and in the library, one of the three columns in arbitrarily changed to concrete (early sketches also show it as free-form in plan). Aalto is at such pains to subvert any clear geometric reading of the structural and spatial organization that it comes as something of a discovery that the whole plan is in fact regulated by a series of squares. This is in contrast to Mies van der Rohe, by whom the structural grid was conceived as a regular counterpoint to the independent spatial disposition of the ‚Äòfree plan‚Äô. Although this geometry contributes to the formal discipline which underpins the episodic spatial composition, and is emblematic of an ‚Äòideal‚Äô house, it is only in the dining room that one can directly sense the underlying order. =Dining room= The dining room itself is a double-square in plan, and the triple-square of the service block is centred on it; the formality is entirely appropriate to the activity of dining and entertaining and can be interpreted, as Klaus Herdeg, an architect and author, has argued, as an architectural embodiment of the social traditions of the bourgeois family. Harry Gullichsen, as head of the household, occupied the head of the table facing towards the entrance. From there he could see along the axis to the entrance and beyond into the pine forest through the clerestory windows above the vestibule, and also diagonally through the entire living room. Mrs. Gullichsen would occupy the seat at the opposite end of the table, conveniently close to the servery and kitchen, from where, as Herdeg writes, she ‚Äòcan contemplate her husband silhouetted against the dining room‚Äôs asymmetrical fireplace, while through the window she can see the sauna, the pool, the garden court, and the pine forest - things natural or traditional. Most of these views the father would only see reflected in an artifice, the living room windows. =Terrace= The flat roof of the dining room is extended to form a covered terrace, which connects with the irregular roof of the small timber sauna. The terrace is served by a fire which backs up against the fireplace in the dining room, and over which a rustic stone staircase rises to the wooden deck on the roof. The angle of the stairs determines the line of the plaster which rises diagonally across the fire to level out over the door. The same angle is continued outside in the flue which connects at the first-floor level into the service wing ‚Äì a typical example of a rigorous formal integration which underlies Aalto‚Äôs at times seemingly willful manipulation of form. The rectangular pier at the end of the terrace affords another example. Viewed in isolation this seems to be simply another instance of Aalto‚Äôs desire to break the ‚Äòartificial rhythms‚Äô established by a regular grid, akin to the doubling and tripling of columns in the living room, but it is also an act as a visual and formal termination to the implied band of secondary circulation which runs through the door between dining room and terrace, past the servery wall which defines the entrance hall. File:Alvar Aalto, Villa Mairea 05.jpgGarden kitchen File:Alvar Aalto, Villa Mairea 04.jpgSide entrance File:Alvar Aalto, Villa Mairea 07.jpgTerrace door, detail =Upper floor= View of second floor window from entrance By comparison with the sophisticated spatial composition of the ground floor, the upper or first (second-U.S) floor is a relatively straightforward assemblage of private rooms. The main stair arrives in an intimate upper hall, with its own fireplace placed directly above the one below. Mr. and Mrs. Gullichsen's bedrooms are paired on either side of an en suite bathroom, which are entered under a slightly dropped ceiling, with vents for air conditioning. The upper hall terminates in the familiar serpentine line. The three children's bedrooms open onto a large circulation/play space, fitted with wall bars for exercise. Their windows are obliquely projecting bays, which read almost as objects on the fa√ßade, rather than openings in it, and are angled to address the line of approach to the main door. The guest bedrooms are disposed along a single- banked corridor and look out full-height windows and present a blank wall to the family's private garden.

Design and description The Royal Canadian Navy had intended to place a six ship order under the of destroyer escorts; however, during the design phase, the last two vessels ordered were altered to the DDH design and were classed under the new Annapolis designation.Hadley, p. 141 The ships measured in length, with a beam of and a draught of .Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 44Macpherson and Barrie have the ships at 371 feet long, and a draught of 13 feet 8 inches.

(12 officers and 234 enlisted) The ships were powered by two Babcock & Wilcox boilers connected to the two-shaft English-Electric geared steam turbines providing . This gave the ships a maximum speed of . The ships were initially armed with two /50 caliberCaliber denotes the length of the barrel. In this case, 50 caliber means that the gun barrel is 50 times as long as it is in diameter dual-purpose guns mounted in a single turret forward. The extra topweight of the helicopter required the return of the American Mk 33 3-inch gun over the heavier 3-inch/70 caliber guns used on the preceding class. The guns could fire 45 ‚Äì 50 rounds per minute with a lifespan of 2,050 rounds. The guns were placed in a Mk 33 mount. The mounting allowed the guns to elevate from ‚àí15¬∞ to 85¬∞. The elevation rate was 30¬∞ per second and train rate was 24¬∞ per second. The mounts could train 360¬∞. For anti-submarine warfare, the ships were armed with a Mk 10 Limbo mortar. The Limbo was a British-designed three- barrel mortar capable of launching a projectile shell between . Placed on stabilized mountings, the projectiles always entered the water at the same angle. The total weight of the shell was . They also had a Mk.4 thrower with homing torpedoes. Initially the ships were outfitted with one SPS-12 air search radar, one SPS-10B surface search radar, and one Sperry Mk.2 navigation radar. For sensing below the surface, the class was given one SQS-501 high frequency bottom profiler sonar, one SQS-502 high frequency mortar control sonar, one SQS-503 hull mounted active search sonar and one SQS-504 VDS medium frequency active search sonar. For fire control purposes they were given one Mk 64 GFCS fire control with SPG-48 tracker (GUNAR). The two Annapolis-class destroyers were built late enough to incorporate the helicopter hangar retrofitted to the St. Laurent class and the \\"Beartrap\\" haul-down device. This allowed the destroyer escorts to deploy with one CH-124 Sea King helicopter. =DELEX refit= The DEstroyer Life EXtension (DELEX) refit was born out of the need to extend the life of the steam-powered destroyer escorts of the Canadian Navy in the 1980s until the next generation of surface ship was built. Encompassing all the classes based on the initial St. Laurent (the remaining St. Laurent, , Mackenzie, and Annapolis-class vessels), the DELEX upgrades were meant to improve their ability to combat modern Soviet submarines,Milner, pp. 277‚Äì278 and to allow them to continue to operate as part of NATO task forces.Gimblett, p. 179 The Annapolis class received the same sensor and communications upgrades that others in the St Laurent family of ships received, including the installation of a new tactical data system (ADLIPS), updated radars and sonars, fire control and satellite navigation. They also received the new Canadian Tactical Towed Array Sensor or CANTASS which was a long-range towed sonar array that was affixed to the stern,Milner, p. 278 which replaced the older VDS. The class also received a new lattice mast. They were given torpedo tubes to allow them to fire Mark 46 torpedoes. However, the Limbo mortar was removed in order to install the CANTASS. This visibly altered the overall appearance of the ships. Service history Annapolis was ordered in 1958, initially as a repeat Restigouche-class vessel. However in 1959, the last two repeat Restigouches were altered to incorporate variable depth sonar and a helicopter landing area.Milner, pp. 224‚Äì225 The ship was laid down on 2 September 1961 by Halifax Shipyards Ltd. at Halifax. Christened by Mrs. Miriam Nowlan, wife of George Nowlan M.P. for Digby‚ÄîAnnapolis‚ÄîKings three days before the ship's launch on 27 April 1963, Annapolis was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 19 December 1964 with the classification number 265. STANAVFORLANT in 1974. Annapolis is in the center Annapolis served first with Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) and later with Maritime Forces Pacific (MARPAC). In 1965, Annapolis, while serving with MARLANT, Annapolis was ordered to the Dominican Republic as a show of Canadian support for the American intervention there. In 1970, Annapolis, with the destroyer and the replenishment ship , participated in Manitoba's centennial celebrations, making port visits at Churchill, Rankin Inlet, Chesterfield Inlet and Wakeham Bay. Annapolis served as flagship in 1974 of STANAVFORLANT, the standing NATO fleet. In June, Annapolis rescued the crew of a Sea King helicopter which had ditched into the sea while attempting to land on the frigate . Annapolis later recovered the helicopter. In December, Annapolis boarded five Soviet fishing vessels in the Atlantic believing them to be illegally fishing. The ship later released them. Annapolis underwent the DELEX refit from 19 August 1985 to 8 January 1987 at the Saint John Shipbuilding yards in Saint John, New Brunswick. Following completion of the refit, Annapolis took part in the large NATO naval exercise, Ocean Safari '87 and in Fall 1987, escorted the royal yacht on the Great Lakes. In the late 1980s, she was used as the trial ship for the CANTASS towed sonar array system.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), p. 61 On 14 August 1989, Annapolis transferred to the Pacific coast, joining MARPAC. She arrived at Esquimalt, British Columbia on 25 September. From 3‚Äì7 June 1990, Annapolis was a Canadian task group that visited Vladivostok, Russia. In 1994, the destroyer was deployed as part of Operation Forward Action, the Canadian participation in the United Nations-sanctioned blockade of Haiti that year.Tracy, p. 231 She arrived off Haiti on 25 March and on 12 April, suffered an explosion in her port boiler. She remained on station for a further 30 days before returning to Esquimalt. The ship was removed from active service from Maritime Command on 15 November 1996 and placed in reserve. She was paid off on 1 July 1998 and stripped of all weapons and sensors before being laid up at CFB Esquimalt. =Sale for artificial reef= Annapolis was sold to the Artificial Reef Society of British Columbia (ARSBC) in 2008.

He played for Warrington from 1982 to 1994, and won 20 caps for Great Britain. He was the head coach of Wigan Warriors. Playing career Gregory was born in Wigan, Lancashire, England. He had a distinguished playing career, captaining both Warrington and Great Britain. He made his d√©but for Warrington on Sunday 5 September 1982, and he played his last match for Warrington on Saturday 12 February 1994, making 222 1st team starts and 24 substitute appearances and scoring 45 tries and a total points of 176. Gregory played and scored a try in Warrington's 14-36 defeat by Wigan in the 1990 Challenge Cup Final. He captained a Great Britain tour to New Zealand. Gregory was selected to go on the 1988 Great Britain tour of Australasia, and scored a try as the Lions upset Australia in the third Ashes test in Sydney. He won 20 caps for Great Britain, and played once for the Rest of the World against Australia, in 1988. Gregory's testimonial match at Warrington took place in 1994. He is a Warrington Wolves Hall of Fame inductee and Heritage No. 822. Coaching career Gregory started his coaching career as assistant to Shaun McRae at St. Helens. He spent three successful seasons at St. Helens between 1996‚Äì98, before taking the head coach job at the Swinton Lions. He later joined the Wigan Warriors, taking charge of the Senior Academy in 2001. He led the youngsters to first place in the 2002 Academy Championship, before being promoted to assistant coach for the 2003's Super League VIII. Gregory had international coaching experience with Wales in the 1995 World Cup. He also guided the England Academy team to a historic series victory against the Australian Schoolboys in 2002. He was assistant coach of the Lancashire Origin squad for 2003 and was also appointed as head coach of Scotland for the 2003 European Nations' Cup. Following the departure of the Wigan Warriors' head coach Stuart Raper in July 2003, Gregory was appointed head coach until the end of 2003's Super League VIII. After Raper's announcement, Gregory had announced his intention to run for the job permanently. It was the first time since Colin Clarke in 1985 that a Wigan- born man has coached Wigan. Gregory spent three months as caretaker coach, remaining unbeaten for 11 matches and guiding the Wigan Warriors to the 2003 Super League Grand Final ‚Äì becoming the first side from outside the top two to make it all the way ‚Äì before being awarded the job full-time on a 2-year contract. The grand final was lost to the Bradford Bulls. Illness In 2004, it became known that Gregory had been suffering from progressive muscular atrophy, a form of motor neuron disease affecting his nerves and muscles which he had possibly contracted as early as 2001. The illness blocks signals from the brain getting to muscles, causing weight-loss and affecting speech. He went to the United States for a week in May 2004 for treatment. Initially it was thought that he had become unwell from an insect bite whilst abroad. Ian Millward was appointed as head coach of the Wigan Warriors while Gregory was still recovering from his illness. =Disagreement with Wigan= In September 2004 there were reports that his illness would prevent him from returning to his job at Wigan. Maurice Lindsay said that Wigan would continue to employ and pay Gregory while he was on sick leave and wait for advice from medical advisers.\\"Warriors deny Gregory exit\\", BBC Sport, 3 September 2004 Gregory felt that during 2004 he would be able to return but that the club blocked his return to work. He took Wigan and the club's owner Dave Whelan to court, claiming Wigan should have done more to help him carry on. The case was settled out of court with Wigan agreeing to pay Gregory ¬£17,500. After the settlement, Gregory said: =Death and legacy= On 19 November 2007, Having used a wheelchair for the previous year, Gregory died aged 43.\\"Former Lions skipper Gregory dies\\", BBC Sport, 19 November 2007. In 2008, the Rugby Football League (RFL) introduced the Spirit of Rugby League Award to recognise individuals who have made a significant positive contribution to rugby league, with the inaugural award being presented posthumously to Gregory. In subsequent seasons, the award was renamed in his honour to the Mike Gregory Spirit of Rugby League Award.

An astounding number of enthusiastic musicians queued patiently waiting their turn to prove their worth; ultimately Edwards' natural vocal flair, Wilkin's 'Wilkey Fingers' and, after Dave Sumeray decided to quit the band and the music business, Steed's conquering bass prevailed to form Masterswitch.  1976-1978  In 1977, the band signed to the Epic record company and in the following year released their only studio release Action Replay/Mass Media Meditation. Despite talent and the intelligent social commentary (notably That's Light Entertainment), Masterswitch only picked up a small cult following playing regularly at the Marquee Club in Soho, London. With The Clash grabbing all attention of Epic's marketing combined with poor management, Masterswitch split in 1978. Jimmy Edwards and Mark Steed went to record as Jimmy and The Profiles and later Edwards and Ray Simone went on to form Time UK with former The Jam drummer Rick Buckler. After three singles they split, although Jimmy and Buckler formed the short-lived band Sharp with Buckler's ex-Jam bandmate Bruce Foxton.  2007-date Ray Simone, Martin Lee and Dave Sumeray reunited as Woodfog. After a 34-year break, they worked on some new songs and renamed themselves as Creatures of Habit. Following a lengthy period of illness, Ray Simone died on 18 June 2012. In 2013, following Simone's death, Lee and Sumeray decided to resurrect Woodfog. They recruited Paul Squires on drums. Edwards died in January 2015.

Area code 219 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan for Northwest Indiana, including the state's portion of the Chicago metropolitan area, which includes Lake, Porter, La Porte, Newton, and Jasper Counties. The area code includes the cities of Schererville, Chesterton, Lake Station, Crown Point, Cedar Lake, Hobart, Whiting, Gary, Hammond, East Chicago, Merrillville, Munster, Griffith, Highland, Portage, Valparaiso, Michigan City, Ogden Dunes, St. John, La Porte, DeMotte, Roselawn, Kouts, Lake Village, and Rensselaer. 219 is largely co- extensive with the Indiana side of the Chicago metropolitan area. Service is provided by AT&T;, Frontier Communications, and Northwestern Indiana Telephone Company. The original area code 219, as of 1952. History When AT&T; published the first configuration of proposed numbering plan areas (NPAs) for a new nationwide numbering and toll call routing system in 1947, Indiana was divided to receive two area codes. Area code 317 served the northern two- thirds of Indiana, while area code 812 served the southern third. In 1948, 317 was cut back to central Indiana, while the northern third of Indiana, including Gary, Hammond, East Chicago, South Bend, Elkhart and Fort Wayne, received area code 219. It was the first new area code after AT&T; had published the initial configuration of a nationwide numbering system in 1947. Despite the presence of the Chicago suburbs, Michiana and Fort Wayne, this configuration remained unchanged for 53 years. By the end of the 20th century, however, 219 was on the verge of exhaustion. When it was apparent that the need for a split could no longer be staved off, it was decided to split northern Indiana into three area codes. Northwest Indiana won a random drawing to decide which of the areas would keep 219. The central portion of the old 219 territory, centered on South Bend, became area code 574. The eastern portion, centered on Fort Wayne, became area code 260. The area codes split on January 15, 2002. Permissive dialing of 219 continued across northern Indiana until June 14, 2002.

She was a wooden sailing ship that was built as MV J.E. Kinney by Smith and Rhuland at Lunenburg, Nova Scotia and used in the harbours of the east coast of Canada by the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps as General Schmidlin during the Second World War. Following the war the vessel was purchased by the Royal Canadian Navy. The ship was sold again for mercantile service in 1959 and remained in service until 1969. Description Cedarwood was long with a beam of and a draught of . Cedarwood had a displacement of 566 tons. The vessel was powered by one Fairbanks Morse diesel engine making the ship capable of and had a complement of 23. Service history =MV J.E. Kinney and RCASC General Schmidlin= Launched at Lunenburg in 1941 by Smith and Rhuland as MV J.E. Kinney, she was taken over by the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps in 1944 during the Second World War and renamed General Schmidlin. She was used to resupply Canadian Army detachments scattered throughout the Maritimes. During the war, General Schmidlin was used to tow targets for shore batteries. In April 1944 the vessel was spotted by a U-boat off Halifax, Nova Scotia and chased. General Schmidlin escaped the German submarine by fleeing to Halifax. Upon arrival it was found that every bearing in her engine had been burned out. Following the war, the Canadian Army placed the ship in reserve. =Royal Canadian Navy and mercantile service= General Schmidlin transferred to the west coast in 1946 and was used as an ammunition dumping tender by the Army. General Schmidlins purchase by the Royal Canadian Navy was requested by the Pacific Oceanographic Group who wished to use her as an oceanographic survey vessel to replace HMCS Ekholi, which was considered too small for their needs. The ship was acquired in 1946. The purchase was approved and she was renamed Cedarwood and commissioned on 22 September 1948. Cedarwood was based in Esquimalt. During her service with the Royal Canadian Navy she was used to travel into the Arctic Ocean and test equipment. She also did bathythermographic surveys along with general biology, oceanography and acoustic surveys. During her time in the Bering Sea, she laid submarine cables and carried scientists of both Canada and the United States on survey missions, mapping a large amount of the British Columbia coastline. On 22 September 1950, Cedarwood was heavily damaged by a storm while in the Hecate Strait. The repairs took a month to fix. She continued in her service until she was paid off on 9 July 1958. After her naval service she was converted as a replica of the paddle steamer Beaver and then had other dummy fittings added to play the role of the steamer Commodore during the British Columbia centennial celebrations. She was sold in 1959 to Coast Cargo Services Ltd of Vancouver, keeping her name. Cedarwood was sold again in 1965 McCartney Enterprises Ltd & Berven Enterprises Ltd of Vancouver before being acquired by Offshore Seismic Services Ltd and having her port of registry changed to Nassau, Bahamas in 1966. Cedarwood was broken up in 1969.

The paper had regular sections covering aspects of Greek news such as politics, social issues, business, arts & entertainment and sports, as well as international news. Features included analysis of domestic and foreign affairs by leading academics and experts, humour columns and reader contributions. During the dictatorship, Athens News was a leading voice against the junta, and its publisher Yannis Horn was jailed and threatened by the dictators. History Athens News was founded by Yannis Horn, brother of Dimitris Horn, and first appeared on 29 January 1952. It closed down permanently in March 2013, after a long period of economic problems, making it a victim of the Greek crisis.Greece: Athens News closes down after 61 years In 1993, Athens News was redesigned and revamped when it was acquired by the Lambrakis Foundation, a non-profit research centre specialising in education. As such, it formed part of the Lambrakis Press Group. It was the first Greek newspaper to be published on the internet - an online edition appeared in 1995. In 2001, after 49 years as a daily, the Athens News became a weekly, appearing on Fridays. In October 2008, the paper was acquired by Myenpi Publishing. =History against the dictatorship= The 1973 Chinese edition of Athens News mocking the political situation in Greece during the Papadopoulos dictatorship. The editor changed his Greek name \\"Yannis Horn\\" to its pseudo-Chinese version \\"Ya ‚Äì nih orn\\", and it is visible on the page. In October 1971, Athens News publisher Yannis Horn was arrested and jailed for writing an article against the junta after a visit to Athens by US vice-president Spiro Agnew. The title of the article was \\"ŒíœåŒºŒ≤ŒµœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒµœÄŒπœÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒµœÖŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøŒπ ŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ∑œÑŒ≠œÇ œÖœÄŒøŒ¥Œ≠œáŒøŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ œÑŒøŒΩ ŒÜŒ≥Œ∫ŒΩŒπŒøœÖ\\" (Bombs and recruited students greet Agnew).

The article was written in Chinese. Horn did not speak Chinese, but he copied a random article from a Chinese newspaper that he had seen that day, and he changed his Greek name \\"Yannis Horn\\" to its pseudo-Chinese version \\"Ya ‚Äì nih orn\\". He was arrested for the publication of the article, and was told by a junta official that if he were ever to be caught again [by the junta official] he would be converted to soap. Yannis Horn did not know the meaning of the Chinese text that he put on the front cover of his newspaper, so he went to a Chinese restaurant in Athens and asked the owner to translate it for him. The owner, however, was a Chinese-American and told Horn that he did not understand Chinese. It was later that Horn found out that the text was not from mainland China, but from a nationalist newspaper published in Taiwan. In April 1973, Athens News, along with Bradini, and Thessaloniki, were the only newspapers in Greece to publish comments by Konstantinos Karamanlis criticising the dictatoship. The editions of all three newspapers were confiscated by the dictators.

The ship was commissioned into Maritime Command on 10 November 1978 at Lauzon, becoming the second Canadian naval unit to bear this name. In 1980, the first mixed gender crew trial took place aboard Cormorant in response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women. The trial lasted until 1984. Between 23 August and 5 October 1989, Cormorant and conducted defence research as part of Operation Norploy 89, which took place in the Arctic region of Canada, mainly in Baffin Bay, Lancaster Sound and the Davis Strait. Using the submersible SDL-1 deployed from Cormorant, the sunken vessel was discovered, a ship not seen since its sinking in 1853. Cormorant was an integral part of the November 1994 expedition to recover the ship's bell from the wreck of in Lake Superior. She was decommissioned on 2 July 1997 and sold to United States owners for diving operations. The ship underwent conversion to an offshore support vessel in 1998 however the ship was docked in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia in 2000 and has remained there. As of March 2015, the ship developed a severe list. As of 21 March 2015, the ship had sunk in the LaHave River due to the amount of ice on the deck. The Canadian Coast Guard took control of the salvage effort in May due to pollution concerns. The ship was refloated with the list reduced to 8 degrees. Salvage was anticipated to be completed in another week. The ownership of the vessel remains unclear, with lawsuits claiming that a Texas-based company and the Port of Bridgewater own the ship, and therefore liable for the cleanup. The Port of Bridgewater claims that the vessel's sinking was due to sabotage and that the ship's thru-hull valves had been opened. The ship remained at laid up in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia due to the ongoing court case. The ship's bell of HMCS Cormorant is currently on loan to a Navy League Cadet Corps in British Columbia. The Christening Bells Project at Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt Naval and Military Museum includes information from the ship's bell of HMCS Cormorant, which was used for baptism of babies on board ship.

The term \\"benefice\\" originally denoted a grant of land for life in return for services. In church law, the takings were spiritual (\\"spiritualities\\") and some form of assets to generate revenue (the \\"temporalities\\") were permanently linked to the duties to ensure the support of the office holder. Historically, once in possession of the benefice, the holder had lifelong tenure unless he failed to provide the required minimum of spiritual services or committed a moral offence. With the passing of the Pastoral Measure 1968 and subsequent legislation, this no longer applies, and many ancient benefices have been joined together into a single new one. At one time, an incumbent might choose to enjoy the income of the benefice and appoint an assistant curate to discharge all the spiritual duties of the office at a lesser salary. This was a breach of the canons of 1604, but the abuse was only brought under control with the passing in 1838 of the Pluralities Act (1&2 Victoria, ch.106), which required residence unless the diocesan bishop granted a licence for non-residence for reasons specified in the same act and provided severe penalties for non-compliance. Official title The incumbent's official title might be that of rector, vicar, \\"curate-in-charge\\" or \\"perpetual curate\\". The difference between these titles is now largely historical. Originally, an incumbent was either a rector who received all the tithes or a vicar who received only the small tithes (see Impropriation). Curate-in-charge and perpetual curate were later legal terms to meet the case when new parishes were created or chapels of ease established which were not supported by tithes. Nomination and admission into office The future incumbent is either nominated by the ordinary (normally the diocesan bishop) or the patron who owns the advowson. Originally, the parish concerned had no legal voice in the matter, but modern legislation established the need for consultation to take place. The form of admission to office has two parts: the future incumbent is first authorised by the bishop to exercise the spiritual responsibilities (institution or collation - see below), the second puts him in possession of the \\"temporalities\\" (induction) which he receives at the hands of the archdeacon or his deputy. The two actions are often combined into one ceremony and the canons require the bishop to use his best endeavour to perform the ceremony in the parish church. However, this is not legally essential. =Collation and institution= The difference between collation and institution resides in the fact that when a patron presents a cleric for institution the bishop may examine him and refuse on good grounds to proceed. A negative decision may be contested in the courts and the Gorham Controversy was a case in point. If the bishop himself has chosen the cleric, this is unnecessary and the legal formalities are different. The bishop admits the incumbent to the spiritualities of the benefice by reading a written instrument bearing his episcopal seal committing the care or \\"cure\\" of souls to the priest who kneels before him while this is done and holds the seal. =Induction= The bishop then instructs the archdeacon by Letters Mandatory for Induction to induct the priest into the temporalities of the benefice. This must be performed in the church and is done by placing the hand of the priest on the key or ring of the door and reciting a formula of words. The priest advertises his or her induction by tolling the church bell. Induction is a vestige of the medieval legal practice of livery of seisin. Temporalities Legally, the incumbent is a corporation sole i.e. \\"a legal entity vested in an individual and his successors by reason of his office\\" and any particular occupant had the right to receive the income and make use of its assets to support him in his ministry. Traditionally, these were the tithes, the glebe, fees, the parsonage house plus the church where his responsibilities were shared with the churchwardens, and if he was a rector, he had to finance the maintenance of the chancel from his own resources. During a vacancy, the temporalities were normally administered by the churchwardens, who could disburse monies to cover the costs of providing spiritual attention and other legally recognized expenses until the new incumbent entered, when they had to pay any balance in hand over to him.

He held the chair of Modern Political and Social History at the University of M√ºnster.  Life  Gollwitzer was born in Nuremberg and grew up in Munich. After being severely wounded in World War II he took up his studies (history and German literature) at the University of Munich, earning his Ph.D. in 1944. He earned his qualification to teach as a professor in 1950 with a thesis called ‚ÄúThe Image of Europe and the European Thought ‚Äì Contributions to the German History of Ideas‚Äù. He subsequently taught at universities in Munich and M√ºnster until retiring in 1982. He died in Munich.  Scientific focus  Gollwitzer's books mostly deal with the history of mentalities and political ideas, as well as with German regional history and biography. Due to the preponderance of structural history in the German scientific community during the post war age, his impact on colleagues and students was rather small. This outsider position was to change from the beginning of the early Nineties, when historians became more and more sensible to universal history as well as to the relevance of personality in history, such in the case of the German nobility from the end of the ancien r√©gime to the end of middle European monarchies in 1918, which was one of Gollwitzer's basic scientific aims.

Cynethryth is the only Anglo-Saxon Queen consort in whose name coinage was definitely issued. Biography =Origins = Nothing certain is known of Cynethryth's origins. Her name recalls the wife and daughters of King PendaCynewise, Cyneburh, and Cyneswithwhich may indicate that she was a descendant of Penda.Stafford, p. 36. A tradition related by the 13th century Vitae duorum Offarum tells that she was of Frankish origin, and that for her crimes she was condemned by Charlemagne's justice system to be set adrift at sea in an open boat. The boat eventually stranded on the Welsh coast where she was taken to Offa. She pleaded that she had been cruelly persecuted and was of the Carolingian royal house. Offa left Drida, as she was called, in the charge of Marcellina, his mother. Offa would fall in love with and marry her, at which point she adopted the name Quindrida, but she continued in her iniquitous ways before being murdered by robbers. This seems to relate to a brief mention of Offa's sinful but reformed wife, Thritha, that appears in Beowulf, but also has aspects similar to a story told of the wife of Offa of Angel, a Yorkshire girl set adrift by her father.Klaeber's Beowulf, and the Fight at Finnsburg, 4th ed., R.D. Fulk, Robert E. Bjork and John D. Niles, eds., University of Toronto Press, 2008, pp. 222-226. Unlike the relations of √Üthelbald, Offa's predecessor, which had been condemned by the church, the marriage of Offa and Cynethryth was entirely conventional and met with the approval of the church hierarchy.Stafford, p. 37. In a letter to Cynethryth and Offa's son Ecgfrith, Alcuin advises him to follow the example of his parents, including his mother's piety. Elsewhere Alcuin refers to Cynethryth as \\"controller of the Royal household\\".Keynes. Alcuin's letters 61, 62, and 101 mention Cynethryth; Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Epistolae Karolini aevi (II), pp. 105, 106, & 148. =Queen of the Mercians= Coin of Cinethryth, wife of Offa The date of Offa and Cynethryth's marriage is not known, but it was not until after the birth of Ecgfrith that Cynethryth began to witness charters.Stafford, p. 38. She first witnessed a charter dated 770, along with Ecgfrith and √Ülffl√¶d. By 780 she is Cyne√∞ry√∞ Dei gratia regina Merciorum (\\"Cynethryth, by the Grace of God, Queen of the Mercians\\").For a list of charters witnessed by Cynethryth, see the Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England; for the charters themselves, see the Anglo-Saxon Charters homepage and Dr. Sean Miller's Anglo-Saxons.net. It has been suggested that Cynethryth's coinage was in emulation of the Byzantine Empress Irene, who ruled during this time through her son Constantine VI. The imagery employed, however, does not follow that on Irene's coinage, but that used on coins of late Roman empresses, just as the image used on Offa's coins show him as a late Roman emperor.Kelly; Keynes; Stafford, pp. 39-40. It has been suggested that the coins were minted for donations by Cynethryth to the Church, but their similarity to the general issues suggests otherwise. This coinage is unique in Anglo-Saxon England, and indeed in Western Europe in this period. Cynethryth is associated with her husband in charters and is said to have been a patron of Chertsey Abbey. Pope Adrian I, when elevating Higbert's Bishopric of Lichfield to an Archbishopric, wrote to Offa and Cynethryth jointly. = Allegations regarding the death of St √Üthelberht of East Anglia = √Üthelberht II, King of East Anglia (died 20 May 794) ‚Äì who was later canonised as Saint Ethelbert the King ‚Äì is widely believed to have been assassinated, on Offa's orders. Some later chroniclers, such as Roger of Wendover, have alleged that Cynethryth was either personally responsible for the assassination of √Üthelberht, or to have incited Offa to kill him. =Later entry into religious order= After Offa's death in 796, Cynethryth entered a religious order. She became abbess of the monastery at Cookham and also had charge of the church at Bedford, where Offa was interred. Cynethryth was alive as late as 798, when a dispute over church lands with √Üthelhard, Archbishop of Canterbury, was settled at the Synod of Clofesho, at an uncertain location. Family King Offa had at least five children, and it is thought that they were all Cynethryth's as well; they were: *Ecgfrith (died 796) - King of Mercia, died after a reign of only 141 days. *Eadburh - Queen of Wessex, wife of Beorhtric of Wessex. *√Ülffl√¶d - Queen of Northumbria, wife of √Üthelred I of Northumbria. *√Üthelburh - An abbess. *√Üthelswith - possibly √Ülfthryth of Crowland.

Barron's Educational Series, Inc., This organ allows labyrinth fish to take in oxygen directly from the air, instead of taking it from the water in which they reside through use of gills. The labyrinth organ helps the inhaled oxygen to be absorbed into the bloodstream. As a result, labyrinth fish can survive for a short period of time out of water, as they can inhale the air around them, provided they stay moist. Labyrinth fish are not born with functional labyrinth organs. The development of the organ is gradual and most labyrinth fish breathe entirely with their gills and develop the labyrinth organs when they grow older.  Range  Labyrinth fish are endemic to fresh waters of Asia and Africa. In Asia, they are found throughout East, Southeast, and South Asia, especially but not exclusively in the warm, slow-flowing, low-oxygen waters. In Africa, significantly smaller numbers of labyrinth fish can be found in the southern half of the continent, with concentrations in the rainforest waters. The characteristics of the fish habitats are indicators of the size of the labyrinth organ, as the organ size is negatively correlated with the level of oxygen in the waters. Species native to low-oxygen waters are more likely to have larger and more complex labyrinth organs than species found in fast-flowing, oxygen-rich waters.  Behavior  A male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, is building a bubble nest. In general, the labyrinth fish are carnivores that eat small aquatic organisms and carrion. Some species will also consume algae and water plants. Most fish are active during daytime, but several African species feed at twilight and night. Species of the genus Trichogaster can spit water toward insects to bring them down to the water surface, similarly to the archerfish behavior. Labyrinth fish are well known for their bubble-nesting behavior, although some species do not build bubble nests and employ other methods of brooding. For the bubble nesting species, males establish nesting territories and defend them vigorously. As the name suggests, the bubble nests are floating bubbles coated with oral mucus from the males. Typically, the male bubble nesters stay nearby to guard the nests and constantly retrieve any falling eggs and fry to the nest. Some Betta species from fast-flowing waters, however, are mouthbrooders and do not build bubble nests. In these species, males hold the eggs and fry in their mouths and release the free-swimming fry about a week to 10 days after spawning. Phylogeny Phylogeny of families and genera in Anabatoidei based on mitochondrial DNA sequences:  Anabantoids as food fish  The giant gourami, Osphronemus goramy, is often raised in floating cages in central Thailand. Several labyrinth fish are important food sources in their native countries. The giant gourami, in particular, is highly valued as food fish, due to its size and tender flesh with few spines.Chanphong, Jitkasem. (1995). Diseases of Giant Gourami, Osphronemus goramy (Lacepede) . The Aquatic Animal Health Research Institute Newsletter 4(1). This species is farmed extensively in Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries, and was intentionally introduced in tropical and subtropical waters around the world. During the colonial period, the French attempted to introduce this fish to many of their territories. Although an attempt to introduce a population in southern France failed, the giant gourami became well established in other French colonies. In the late 1880s, attempts to introduce the giant gourami to California waters as food fish were unsuccessful. In the 1950s, a giant gourami population was established in Hawaii.Nico, L. (2006). Osphronemus gorami. USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database, Gainesville, FL. Other smaller labyrinth fish, such as the climbing perch, the kissing gourami, the snakeskin gourami, and other gouramies of the genus Trichogaster, are local food fish in Southeast Asia. In some areas, the fish are processed into salted and dried food.  Anabantoids as aquarium fish  The Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, originally bred for staged fights, has become popular in the aquarium trade The Siamese fighting fish is perhaps the most popular labyrinth fish in the aquarium trade. The paradise fish also has a long aquarium history and was one of the first aquarium fish introduced to the West. Many species of gouramies, particular the three spot gourami and the dwarf gourami, are commercially bred for the trade, and several color morphs are commonly available. Because of their capability to use atmospheric oxygen, these fish generally are not so dependent on a form of aeration in their tanks, as they can rise to the surface of the water and take a breath, or breathing apparatus. Many of the labyrinth fish are peaceful and do well in most community tanks. However, individual males, especially the Siamese fighting fish and paradise fish, are territorial towards each other. Male Siamese fighting fish cannot be kept together under any circumstances, as they have been bred for aggression and will fight to the death. In many breeding pairs, the male and female cannot be kept together for long periods of time. Males may perceive males of other species as competition if they have long and bright fins and attack them, as well. For other species of anabantoids, a large aquarium with only one male per tank is ideal to prevent aggression.

Such priests are not legally responsible for the churches and glebe, but simply hold a licence rather than the freehold and are not appointed by advowson. The appointment of priests in charge rather than incumbents (one who does receive the temporalities of an incumbent) is sometimes done when parish reorganisation is taking place or to give the bishop greater control over the deployment of clergy. Legally, priests in charge are temporary curates, as they have only spiritual responsibilities. Even though they lead the ministry in their parishes, their legal status is little different from assistant curates. However, the term priest in charge has come to be used because the term curate often refers to an assistant curate, who is usually a priest recently ordained who is not in charge of a parish ‚Äî although it is quite possible for a priest previously beneficed to return to a curacy, sometimes as a matter of choice. The stipend of a priest in charge is often the equivalent to that of an incumbent, and so they are sometimes referred to as having incumbent status. Incumbents include vicars and rectors.

His usual position was at scrum-half. He played 56 times for France. Biography Berbizier was born in Saint-Gaudens. He made his international debut for France as a 22-year-old on 17 January 1981 in a test during the Five Nations against Scotland in Paris, which France won 16 points to nine. He played in the remaining Five Nations matches that season; earning caps against Ireland, Wales and England. He was capped twice more after the Five Nations that year, in two matches against the All Blacks, which France lost. He was capped twice the following year; once during the Five Nations against Ireland in Paris, which France won 22 points to nine, and then against Romania in Bucharest, which France lost. He played in two Five Nations matches in 1983, and one the following year. Appearing just once in the 1984 Five Nations, he was then capped twice against the All Blacks in Christchurch and Auckland, both of which the All Blacks won. He played twice for France in 1985; in a two test series against Argentina. After appearing for France on various occasions throughout the early 1980s, he was capped 11 times during the 1986 season; including all the Five Nations matches, as well as three games against the All Blacks. The following season he led France to a grand slam victory at the 1987 Five Nations. 1987 was also the year of the first-ever Rugby World Cup, in which France were invited to compete, as they were an IRFB member. France played Scotland in the first World Cup match, drawing 20-all in Christchurch. he led them to subsequent victories over Romania and Fiji, which saw them enter the finals, defeating the Wallabies in a classic semifinal encounter 30‚Äì24 to enter the first World Cup final. They went down to hosts, the All Blacks, 29‚Äì9 at Eden Park. His last cap for France was at Twickenham on 16 March 1991. In 1992 he became the head coach of France, and led them to the semi-finals at the 1995 Rugby World Cup. He was sacked after falling out with French Federation president Bernard Lapasset. He went on to coach at Narbonne, and since worked as a television pundit. Berbizier took over from John Kirwan to coach Italy. Under Berbizier, Italy for the first time won two matches in a single Six Nations edition in 2007 when they defeated Scotland 37‚Äì17 at Murrayfield and Wales 23‚Äì20 at Stadio Flaminio in Rome.

FAPE was created on November 5, 1968 by Executive Order No. 156, in implementation of the project agreement between the Philippine and United States governments to establish a permanent trust fund that would address the needs of the private education sector in the country. In the 1960s, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations, or COCOPEA, campaigned for a share in the Special Education Fund, which was from the surplus funds authorized by the War Damage Act of 1962. The private education sector successfully convinced the Philippine government that it has an important role to play in nation-building such that it not only deserved but also needed to be assisted financially. The trustee of FAPE is the Private Education Assistance Committee (PEAC), which is headed by the Secretary of Education as its chairman. PEAC is also composed of representatives from the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA); Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (CEAP); Association of Christian Schools, Colleges, and Universities (ACSCU); and the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities (PACU). Through the years, the management of the Fund has evolved to cover other programs of assistance to the private education sector and with it an organization that helps the PEAC. Recently renamed the PEAC National Secretariat (so as not to confuse with the trust fund), the organization, as directed by the PEAC, manages and develops programs of assistance to private education and participates in initiatives affecting the sector. Presently, it manages the Education Service Contracting, Teacher Salary Subsidy, and Senior High School Voucher Program components of the GASTPE Program of the Department of Education, the In-Service Training Program, and the Research Program, among others.

The stadium seats 32,603 and is used mostly for football matches. History Construction of the stadium began between 1957 and 1958 as a municipal facility for the city of Toluca, with a formal opening on 5 November 1964. It is named for Alberto \\"Chivo\\" C√≥rdoba, who coached the UAEM American football team. In the early 1970s, the UAEM made its first entrance into professional soccer with the first Potros team, which played for a number of years and managed a promotion but was shuttered due to poor economic support. Between 1974 and 1976, the mural Aratm√≥sfera was painted on the west side stands by Leopoldo Flores. It depicts a man reaching toward the sky to touch light. The mural resulted in Spanish news site 20minutos naming the stadium as one of the 10 most original in the world.

It also grows on the slopes of gullies and in open grassland and scrub at 50 m altitude. Soil types range from alkaline loam developed on limestone to acidic clays containing silica. In many of these groups of plants, however, the sex ratio is very unbalanced, resulting in a low output of seedlings. Humans have negatively impacted the species through forestry operations, clearing of land, and pesticide use. Because of the plant's graceful and ornamental appearance, harvesting of plants and seeds by growers has also seriously affected M. calocoma. Many populations are now protected in reserves. Conservation The species is critically endangered, with a world population of only about 600 plants. It is listed under CITES Appendix I / EU Annex A, and CITES prohibits international trade in specimens of this species except when the purpose of the import is not commercial, for instance for scientific research. Although Microcycas calocomas round crown and shiny drooping leaves make it a very ornamental plant, cultivation is limited due to the lack of growing material. Locals have used the plant's toxic roots as a rat poison. References *Jones, David L. Cycads of the World: Ancient Plants in Today's Landscape.

It represents Europe's only instance of a river bifurcation flowing into two seas, dividing into two irreversible branches. The left branch flows into the Black Sea, and the right branch flows into the Aegean Sea. For other cases see List of unusual drainage systems. Geography The Nerodimka river rises as Golema Reka in the Nerodimka mountain and is formed by the two main tributaries, Golema (Velika) Reka and Mala Reka. They join near the village of Nerodime e Ep√´rme (Gornje Nerodimlje). From there it flows to the outskirts of Ferizaj, where the second bifurcation occurs at . The northern branch flows into the Sitnica river and ultimately into the Black Sea via the Ibar, Morava and Danube rivers; while the main, southern branch joins with another branch of the Nerodimka river and together continue the journey to the Aegean Sea via the Lepenac and Vardar Rivers. After the major settlement of southern Kosovo, the town of Ferizaj, the Nerodimka turns south and flows next to the villages of Varo≈° Selo, Kamena Glava, Stari Kaƒçanik, Stagovo and Runjevo, before it reaches the town of Ka√ßanik and empties into the Lepenac river. The bifurcation is actually an artificial phenomenon, as the connection was achieved by digging an artificial canal, but the downstream water flow is still natural. In the 14th century, during the reign of king Milutin, a canal connecting the Sazlia pond and the river Nerodimka was dug, creating an artificial bifurcation, since the Nerodimka flows to the south into the Lepenac river and thus belongs to the Aegean Sea drainage basin, while the Sitnica (which is an outflow of the Sazlia) flows to the north, into the Ibar river and belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin. After World War II, the canal was covered with earth again as it was previously mudded as a result of the lack of maintenance. These water flows have separate impact in annual temperatures of this region. The average annual temperature is 9.9 ¬∞C. Warmest months are July and August, with average temperature 18.9 ¬∞C. The coldest month is January, with an average temperature -2.6 ¬∞C. Maximum air temperature is 32.5 ¬∞C in July, while the minimum -14.0 ¬∞C in January. Atmospheric precipitation also plays a role of abundance water in Nerodimka river. The average of rainfalls for every month is 73.3 mm. Months with the most rainfalls are April‚ÄìMay, 105.6 mm, while at least August with 42.2 mm.  Development strategies and protection  The bifurcation of Nerodimka has been under state protection since 1979, and it is declared as a strict wildlife sanctuary, first category according to (IUCN) The official emblem of the municipality of Ferizaj contains the visual representation of the Nerodimka river bifurcation. This phenomenon is attractive for researchers and visitors and has great importance to education, science and tourism. The western part of the city offers ideal conditions for the formation of public green spaces (parks), for the development of tourism and recreation. Branch of Nerodimka River enters within the city, extensive recreational area that is also available to residents of Uro≈°evac bifurcation area, waterfall and the merger of the two rivers. The Nerodimka drains an area of 229 km¬≤ itself, and it is not navigable.

The image was created using Digital Effects' Vision software, written in APL and Fortran. Digital Effects Inc. was an early and innovative computer animation studio at 321 West 44th street in New York City. It was the first computer graphics house in New York City when it opened in 1978, and operated until 1986. It was founded by Judson Rosebush, Jeff Kleiser, Don Leich, David Cox, Bob Hoffman, Jan Prins, and others. Many of the original group came from Syracuse University, where Rosebush taught computer graphics. Rosebush developed the animation software APL Visions and FORTRAN Visions. Kleiser later went on to found Kleiser- Walczak Construction Company, which experimented with creating synthespians and made the animation for Monsters of Grace. The company's original animation system consisted of a Tektronix display with a 1200 baud modem connection to a remote Amdahl V6 in Bethesda, Maryland, with rendering done on an IBM System 370, recording on an Information International Inc. (III) film recorder in Los Angeles, and final processing and optical printing completed back in New York. The V6 ran APL, and could render at a rate of one polygon per second. The company later built one of the first frame buffers and video paint systems (the Video Palette), acquired a Harris mini-mainframe computer, and a Dicomed 35mm color film recorder. Digital Effects was one of the first companies in the world to produce \\"flying logos\\" for television and advertising, but they aggressively and rapidly expanded their capabilities to include motion capture, form morphing, raster effects, and so forth. Among their early works were historic animated sequences of Times Square, commercials for Scientific American, and a set of MTV-style demonstration reels. But they are perhaps best remembered for their contribution to the computer graphics in the movie Tron  among other things, they were responsible for creating the main title, and for the animation of the Bit, including one that accompanies Kevin Flynn in his reconstructed Recognizer. The name of the company has entered the popular language as a noun which refers to visual effects which are both synthetic as well as image-altering and which occur in the realm of both 2D and 3D graphics and animation. Besides pure 3D computer modeling and animation, digital effects include scene-to-scene transition devices, deformations such as morphing, and color manipulation.

With Badir, Haifa would win four championships, failing only once, in 2002‚Äì03 when Maccabi Tel Aviv won the title. =Hapoel Tel Aviv= In 2005, while Haifa began a major campaign to revamp the squad with South American players such ad Gustavo Boccoli and Roberto Colautti, Badir signed with Hapoel Tel Aviv. He became a major part of their 2005‚Äì06 season when they were runners-up to his former team and State Cup winners. He was awarded the captaincy of the team and held it until his retirement.

Ph.D. D.I.C. A.R.C.S.) was warden of Hugh Stewart HallHugh Stewart Hall (1980) Douglas Davies (ed.), Nottingham University Press. in the University of Nottingham for 29 years (1975-2004). Dr. Rees was a highly respected academic, being a professor of mathematics, and a leading member of the University community. He was the last warden to inhabit the Warden's House at Hugh Stewart in its entirety. The Hall library is now named after Dr. Rees in recognition of his service to the Hall, the University and the City. He arrived in Nottingham with a London Ph.D. in Mathematics and was one of the first tutors recruited at the opening of Lincoln Hall in 1962. As with many of his Welsh countrymen, his twin passions were rugby football and music, being an accomplished pianist in the latter field. According to old Lincolnites of that era he was a lively and popular tutor, and the rugby team especially flourished with his encouragement.A History of Hugh Stewart Hall (1995) Charles Watkins (ed.), Milfords Ltd. In 1972 he was appointed as Deputy Warden of Cripps Hall and then three years later he made the short move to Hugh Stewart. Certainly he fought hard to maintain the best traditions of Nottingham's Halls, for example keeping a schedule of one Formal Dinner each week, open to all students, when almost all other Halls had reduced to two per term. Additionally Hugh Stewart continually staged concerts of a high standard, often hosting the Sinfonia String Quartet. HM the Queen visited the hall in 1981. During his time at Hugh Stewart, the University progressively reduced the power and influence of all Wardens, especially with regard to finance, staffing and maintenance of the fabric. Nevertheless, in the history of the University, perhaps only Dr Harry Lucas, Warden of first Wortley and then Cripps (who was said to be one of Vice-Chancellor Hallward's most trusted advisers in the 1950s and 60s) worked harder to the benefit of the entire Hall system.

Health of the river The Thai Pollution Control Department (PCD) has reported that the water quality of rivers flowing into the upper Gulf of Thailand has seriously deteriorated in the past decade. The department found the Tha Chin estuary contains bacteria and nutrient pollution from phosphates, phosphorus, and nitrogen. Nutrient pollution causes algae to grow faster than ecosystems can handle, harming water quality, food resources for aquatic animals, and marine habitats. It also decreases the oxygen that fish need to survive. PCD rated water quality in the river in 2015 as \\"poor\\".

She is well known in France, Switzerland, Canada and Belgium for a number of hit singles released in the 1980s. Her first success was \\"Toute premi√®re fois\\" in 1984. This song was simultaneously released in the United Kingdom in English. Two of her singles charted at number one in France: \\"Johnny, Johnny\\" and \\"En rouge et noir\\" in 1985 and 1986, respectively. Her 1980's albums are good examples of the Euro disco electropop style popular in Continental Europe at the time, featuring synthesizers and very catchy melodies.  Biography  Jeanne Mas was born in Alicante, Spain. She started studying languages at the University of Nanterre (near Paris). After one year studying Spanish and Italian, she took off for Italy giving up her studies at the university. She settled in Rome when she was only 18 years old. In Rome, she took dance and acting classes. She started landing small parts in commercials as well as in full-length films and she hosted her own show on a private channel: La Uomo TV. Music was her true passion. In 1979, she signed her first contract with RCA Italia and recorded her first single \\"On the Moon\\", and toured with a rock group which was rather hardcore. She recorded several 45's, one in English and the others in Italian. In 1984, she signed a contract with EMI Music France. Roberto Zaneli and Romano Musumara wrote her first French hit \\"Toute premiere fois\\". =First time (1984‚Äì1985)= \\"Toute premi√®re fois\\" It was an instant success: she sold more than 900,000 copies of the single which was played on the radio all the way until December. French people discovered a young woman on their TV screen entirely dressed in black, with jet-black hair, an emaciated face, and very pronounced make-up: a bland version of the punk look. Stimulating choreography with jerky gestures reinforced the image of a woman \\"who wants some action\\", almost aggressive. This striking combination of dance and image seduced the young public. The press, the radio, the television and even the discos grabbed hold of this phenomenon. At the start of the following year, she successively released a second single \\"Johnny, Johnny\\" followed by an album simply called Jeanne Mas. To reach a wider audience, she asked Daniel Balavoine for help. He produced two of the songs for the album. Another single \\"Coeur en st√©r√©o\\" was a hit in its own right. In October, she played the Olympia club in Paris for the first time for four triumphant concerts. A few weeks later, she won the equivalent of a grammy for female performer of the year during the first Victoires de la musique. =Triumphant Olympia (1986)= Building upon this success, ravaging and full of energy, she locked herself in a studio in Denmark to record her next album. Heavily into her work, she'd already started writing her own lyrics. Jeanne Mas had a critical view on music and knew what she wanted. This is why she refused a song written by Musumara which would become \\"Ouragan\\" interpreted by the gloss and glitter Princess Stephanie of Monaco. At the beginning of 1986, she released Femmes d'aujourd'hui which went on to sell over 1 million copies. The single from the album \\"En Rouge et Noir\\" quickly became a hit. In June, the album and the single were number one on the French charts. In the autumn, she played for seven days at the Palais des Sports in Paris and continued with forty concert dates in the rest of France. =Bercy (1987‚Äì1989)= This tour commenced in March 1987 for twenty dates, one of which was a concert in Lyon where a live record and a ninety-minute film were made. She then decided to take a break and take advantage of this time to return to Italy to have a baby, a little girl named Victoria. 1988 allowed her to look closely at her career, her artistic doubts. In September she got involved publicly for a subject that she held close to her heart, crimes against children. Jeanne nevertheless didn't stay inactive and got back to work quickly with Piero Calabrese. She went into a studio for three months and chose the best musicians for the recording: Manu Katch√© on drums, Steve Shehan on percussion, Tony Levin on bass and David Rhodes on guitar. In February 1989 a new album titled Les crises de l'√¢me was released. The lyrics seemed more committed with songs like \\"J'accuse\\", \\"Tango\\" or still \\"Y'a des bons...\\" which denounced violence in the world. The latter song was in fact the first track on the album and Jeanne would make the video clip. In September, she played at Bercy. The tour was cancelled and this was the beginning of her decline. =Her first time Los Angeles and declining years (1990‚Äì1995)= Far from letting herself be beaten, the singer gathered her team to write a new album at the beginning of 1990. Recorded in Los Angeles, L'art des femmes came out in October. She recorded \\"Tous les cris les S.O.S.\\" by Balavoine. EMI promoted the first single, \\"Shakespeare\\", but both the album and singles were complete flops. A year later, EMI released a compilation Depuis la toute premi√®re fois. In 1992, Jeanne Mas gave birth to a boy, Christopher. Au nom des rois was the new album which came out on AB Productions in September, her collaboration with EMI having ended. The first single of the album was \\"Au nom des rois\\" of which the video clip was once again directed by the singer. \\"Dors bien Margot\\" followed a few months later with a slightly different mix. 1993 saw the release of a new version of the album including three new songs, one of which was the third single \\"Aime-moi\\". In September 1993, she played three nights at Casino de Paris and followed with a fifty-five-date tour. With her career floundering she withdrew from public life for a while and settled in the South of France. In 1994 \\"C'est pas normal\\", a more dance floor-oriented song, was released but interest was minimal, received limited airplay and was another flop. =Rocker (1996‚Äì2002)= She came back in 1996 with a new album on Arcade records. Jeanne recorded Jeanne Mas & les √âgo√Østes in Toulouse which had 14 songs that she had written, more rock so as to a return to her initial roots. The record received little attention. After this attempted comeback, Jeanne Mas, became interested in cinema and took screen a writing course in Paris. She also made a short film. By 2000 the record company XIII Bis enabled her to release a further album. D√©sir d'insolence her seventh album. Amongst the songs, three have texts by the poets Paul Verlaine, Alfred de Vigny and Guillaume Appolinaire's \\"Le pont Mirabeau\\". In 2003, Jeanne Mas released a new album: Les Amants de Castille in hommage to the famous play Le Cid by Corneille. In 2004‚Äì2005 she toured to celebrate her 20 years of career and performed at the Espace Pierre Cardin and the Casino de Paris. Jeanne Mas left France in June 2005 and settled in California where she created her own label Red Rocks Productions. In 2006 a new album : The missing Flowers was recorded between Paris and Los Angeles and produced with Dj Esteban. A new chapter commenced with this new album and a new look. Blond hair and feminine. In 2007: the album was released in Europe by Edina Music France. =2008 Concert and her renewed popularity= In June 2008, Jeanne Mas announced four nights of concerts at the Trianon in Paris. =2009 Olympia Theatre ‚Äì Paris, France= In May 2009, Jeanne Mas performed two nights at the Olympia Theatre in Paris with her band ‚Äì Mike Pachelli & Willis Clow (guitars), Todd Connelly (bass), Matt Lesser (drums) and Balint Sapszon (keyboards). In July 2011, Jeanne Mas released her 13th album, Bleu Citron, with a single, Les Dimanches being well received by critics. In 2012, she released the album Made in France, which received a mixed reception. From this the single Il pleut des lunes, and EP dance Gil with DJ Esteban was released. On 24 October 2012, Jeanne Mas is back on the big screen with the film Stars 80 , which tells the story of the two producers of the tour RFM Party 80. The film was a box office success. 10 August 2013, Jeanne Mas began a tour of seven dates in Obernai in Alsace, ending in Romans 28 September.  Personal life  Jeanne Mas has a daughter and a son. In 2005, she relocated from Rueil-Malmaison, France to the United States, firstly in California and then in Arizona. As of 2016, Jeanne Mas has been vegetarian for twenty-three years, and later she became a vegan. In February 2016, Mas published the book Ma vie est une pomme (\\"My life is an apple\\") under Michel Lafon, which advocates the lifestyle.

Two quarts or one Drona of the Gothama Buddha's relics are enshrined which is the largest collection of his relics anywhere.https://www.pressreader.com/sri- lanka/sunday-times-sri-lanka/20191208/283029761483692 It was built by King Dutugemunu c. 140 B.C., who became King of all Sri Lanka after a war in which the Chola King ElƒÅra (Ellalan) was defeated. It is also known as \\"Mahathupa\\", \\"Swarnamali Chaitya\\", \\"Suvarnamali Mahaceti\\" (in Pali) and \\"Rathnamali Dagaba\\". This is one of the \\"Solosmasthana\\" (the 16 places of veneration) and the \\"Atamasthana\\" (the 8 places of veneration in the ancient sacred city of Anuradhapura). The stupa is one of the world's tallest ancient monuments, standing at and with a circumference of . The original stupa had been about in height and was renovated by many kings.The Kaunghmudaw Pagoda in Sagaing, Myanmar is modelled after this stupa. The Mahavamsa contains a detailed account on the construction and the opening ceremony of the stupa. The stupa was a ruin in the 19th century. After fundraising efforts by a Sinhalese bhikkhu, it was renovated in the early 20th century.Swarnamali Maha Seya and the forgotten monk, July 13, 2012 The Ruwanveli Seya Restoration Society was founded in 1902 and the final crowning of the stupa took place on 17 June 1940.  Buddha‚Äôs Relic  After The Buddha's MahaparinibbƒÅna, His relics were enshrined and revered in stupas by princes of eight countries two quarts in each country. The two quarts of relics that were enshrined in the village RƒÅmagƒÅma were, according to The Buddha‚Äôs determination, destined to be enshrined in the Great St≈´pa Ruvanveli. King Dutthagamini (often spelled as Dutugemunu) who, on the full-moon day of the month of ƒÄsƒÅ·∏∑ha (June‚ÄìJuly), under the constellation of ‚Äò‚ÄòUttarƒÅsƒÅ·∏∑ha‚Äô‚Äô, would officiate in the ceremony for the enshrining of the relics in the Great St≈´pa, worshipped the Sangha (Order of monks) on the day before the full-moon day, reminded them that tomorrow is the appointed day for the enshrining of the relics and requested them to give him the relics. The Sa·πÖgha ordered then the novice Arahant So·πáuttara, who was gifted with the six supernormal faculties, to procure the relics from Naga-Loka realm, which Arahant So·πáuttara manages to visit and bring and offer to the Sangha. Then king Dutthagamini received from the Sangha the Buddha‚Äôs relics upon his head in a casket and departed from the golden pavilion in the midst of manifold offerings and honours made by gods and ‚Äò‚ÄòBrahmas‚Äô‚Äô. He circumambulated the relic-chamber three times, entered to it from the east, and when laid the relic-casket on a silver couch one ‚Äò‚Äòko·π≠i‚Äô‚Äô worth, that was arranged in the north side. An image of the Buddha was then, according to the Buddha‚Äôs determination, created in the lion‚Äôs reclining posture (‚Äò‚Äòsƒ´haseyya‚Äô‚Äô), and all the relics were enshrined within that image. When the enshrining of the relics in the Great St≈´pa Ruvanveli was completed, the two novices Uttara and Sumana closed the relic-chamber with the stone- blocks that were previously hidden to be used as a lid. In the Thupavamsa numerous types of beings attended the enshrinement of the relics into the Mahathupa; including the Naga king Mahakala who until recently guarded them. The relics were to be placed atop a golden throne crafted by Visvakarman the divine artificer; the throne brought by Indra. Brahma offers his invisible umbrella of sovereignty, with the king Dutthagamani offering his own. The arhat Indagutta creates a metal canopy over the universe, so that Mara will not interfere, as monks chanted the Sutta Pitaka (the Collection of Discourses delivered by the Buddha). Dutthagamani ceremoniously enters with the urn atop his head; but as he is about to place the urn on the golden throne, the relics rise into the air and form Buddha, with each of the 32 major signs and 80 lesser signs of a great man.

The idea subsequently became a staple of legal thinking in Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions and continues to be a topic of debate. There is also a long pre-history of similar sentiments going back centuries in a variety of legal traditions. The message that government and the courts must err on the side of bringing in verdicts of innocence has remained constant. In Blackstone's Commentaries The phrase, repeated widely and usually in isolation, comes from a longer passage, the fourth in a series of five discussions of policy by Blackstone: The phrase was absorbed by the British legal system, becoming a maxim by the early 19th century. Re Hobson, 1 Lew. C. C. 261, 168 Eng. Rep. 1034 (1831) (Holroyd, J.). It was also absorbed into American common law, cited repeatedly by that country's Founding Fathers, later becoming a standard drilled into law students all the way into the 21st century.G. Tim Aynesworth, An illogical truism, Austin Am.-Statesman, 18 April 1996, at A14. Specifically, it is \\"drilled into [first year law students'] head[s] over and over again.\\" Hurley Green, Sr., Shifting Scenes, Chi. Independent Bull., 2 January 1997, at 4. Benjamin Franklin's version of Blackstone's ratio is very commonly quoted Other commentators have echoed the principle. Benjamin Franklin stated it as: \\"it is better 100 guilty Persons should escape than that one innocent Person should suffer\\".9 Benjamin Franklin, Works 293 (1970), Letter from Benjamin Franklin to Benjamin Vaughan (14 March 1785) Defending British soldiers charged with murder for their role in the Boston Massacre, John Adams also expanded upon the rationale behind Blackstone's Ratio when he stated: Given that Sir Matthew Hale and Sir John Fortescue in English law had made similar statements previously, some kind of explanation is required for the enormous popularity and influence of the phrase across all the Anglo-Saxon legal systems. Cullerne Bown has argued that it \\"...can be seen as a new kind of buttress of the law that was required in a new kind of society.\\" Historic expressions of the principle The immediate precursors of Blackstone's ratio in English law were articulations by Hale (about 100 years earlier) and Fortescue (about 200 years before that), both influential jurists in their time. Hale wrote: \\"for it is better five guilty persons should escape unpunished, than one innocent person should die.\\" Fortescue's De Laudibus Legum Angliae (c. 1470) states that \\"one would much rather that twenty guilty persons should escape the punishment of death, than that one innocent person should be condemned and suffer capitally.\\"Alexander Volokh, 1997 Some 300 years before Fortescue, the Jewish legal theorist Maimonides wrote that \\"the Exalted One has shut this door\\" against the use of presumptive evidence, for \\"it is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death.\\"Moses Maimonides, The Commandments, Neg. Comm. 290, at 269-271 (Charles B. Chavel trans., 1967). Maimonides argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would progressively lead to convictions merely \\"according to the judge's caprice\\" and was expounding on both Exodus 23:7 (\\"the innocent and righteous slay thou not\\") and an Islamic text, [Jami'] of at-Tirmidhi. [Jami'] of at- Tirmidhi quotes Muhammad as saying, \\"Avoid legal punishments as far as possible, and if there are any doubts in the case then use them, for it is better for a judge to err towards leniency than towards punishment\\". Another similar expression reads, \\"Invoke doubtfulness in evidence during prosecution to avoid legal punishments\\".Exegesis of Sunan at-Tirmidhi - the Book of Punishments , Abu 'Isa Muhammad ibn 'Isa at-Tirmidhi, 884 C.E. Other statements, some even older, which seem to express similar sentiments have been compiled by Volokh. A vaguely similar principle, echoing the number ten and the idea that it would be preferable that many guilty people escape consequences than a few innocents suffer them, appears as early as the narrative of the Cities of the Plain in Genesis (at 18:23‚Äì32),Alexander Volokh, 1997 With respect to the destruction of Sodom, the text describes it as ultimately being destroyed, but only after the rescuing of most of Lot's family, the aforementioned \\"righteous\\" among a city or overwhelming wickedness who, despite the overwhelming guilt of their fellows, were sufficient by their mere presence to warrant a \\"stay of execution\\" of sorts for the entire region, slated to be destroyed for being uniformly a place of sin. The text continues, Similarly, on 3 October 1692, while decrying the Salem witch trials, Increase Mather adapted Fortescue's statement and wrote, \\"It were better that Ten Suspected Witches should escape, than that one Innocent Person should be Condemned.\\" In current scholarship Blackstone's principle influenced the nineteenth-century development of \\"beyond a reasonable doubt\\" as the burden of proof in criminal law.Epps 2015 p.1086 Many commentators suggest that Blackstone's ratio determines the confidence interval of the burden of proof; for example Jack B. Weinstein wrote:; cited in Epps 2015 p.1145 :Blackstone would have put the probability standard for proof \\"beyond a reasonable doubt\\" at somewhat more than 90%, for he declared: \\"It is better that ten guilty persons escape than one innocent suffer.\\" Pi et al. advocate formalizing this in jury instructions. However, Daniel Epps argues that this is too simplistic, ignoring such factors as jury behaviour, plea bargains, appeals procedures, and \\"the percentage of innocent persons among the pool of charged defendants\\".Epps 2015 pp.1074, 1145 Particularly in the United States, Blackstone's ratio continues to be an active source of debate in jurisprudence. For example Daniel Epps and Laura Appleman exchanged arguments against and in favour of its continuing influence in the Harvard Law Review in 2015.Epps 2015; Viewpoints in politics Authoritarian personalities tend to take the opposite view; Bismarck is believed to have stated that \\"it is better that ten innocent men suffer than one guilty man escape\\". Pol Pot made similar remarks.Locard, Henri. Pol Pot's Little Red Book: The Sayings of Angkar. Silkworm Books, 2004. pp. 209. Wolfgang Sch√§uble referenced this principle while saying that it is not applicable to the context of preventing terrorist attacks. Former American Vice President Dick Cheney said that his support of American use of \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\" against suspected terrorists was unchanged by the fact that 25% of CIA detainees subject to that treatment were later proven to be innocent, including one who died of hypothermia in CIA custody. \\"I'm more concerned with bad guys who got out and released than I am with a few that in fact were innocent.\\" Asked whether the 25% margin was too high, Cheney responded, \\"I have no problem as long as we achieve our objective. ... I'd do it again in a minute.\\" \\"Dick Cheney Simply Does Not Care That the CIA Tortured Innocent People\\", New York Magazine. 14 December 2014. Alexander Volokh cites an apparent questioning of the principle, with the tale of a Chinese professor who responds, \\"Better for whom?\\" References =Citations= =Sources=  Ethical principles Criminal justice ethics Anti-fascism ","title":"Blackstone's ratio"},{"id":"5772097","text":"Thuparamaya is the first Buddhist temple in Sri Lanka. Located in the sacred area of Mahamewna park, the Thuparamaya Stupa is the earliest Dagoba to be constructed in the island, dating back to the reign of King Devanampiya Tissa (247-207 BC). The temple has been formally recognised by the Government as an archaeological site in Sri Lanka. History Stone pillars around the Stupa suggest that there was a Vatadage with a conical roof and the Stupa in the center of the house Mahinda Thera, an envoy sent by King Ashoka himself introduced Theravada Buddhism and also Chaitya worship to Sri Lanka. At his request King Devanampiya Tissa built Thuparamaya in which he enshrined the right collar-bone of the Buddha. It is considered to be the first dagaba built in Sri Lanka following the introduction of Buddhism and also the earliest monument, the construction of which was chronicled. The name Thuparamaya comes from \\"stupa\\" and \\"aramaya\\" which is a residential complex for monks. According to the Palumekichchawa Inscription, the tank called Madamanaka (Palumekichchawa Wewa) at Upala Vibajaka area had been constructed at a cost of 5000 Kahavanu and donated on behalf of the Bhikkus who were living at the Thuparama temple. It further states that the harvest from the paddy fields surrounding the tank was presented to the Bhikkus at the temple. The inscription is the earliest chiseled stone inscription in which the name of the Thuparama temple is inscribed, and said to belong to the reign of King Gajabahu (114-136 A.D.). The Stupa Thuparamaya dagoba has been built in the shape of a bell. This dagoba was destroyed from time to time. During the reign of King Agbo II it was completely destroyed and the King restored it. What is seen presently is the construction of the dagoba, done in 1842 AD. As of today, after several renovations, in the course of the centuries, the monument has a diameter of , at the base. The dome is in height from the ground, in diameter. The compound is paved with granite and there are 2 rows of stone pillars round the dagaba. During the early period, a vatadage was built around Thuparamaya.

History A panel of azulejos celebrating CAISL's 50th anniversary with an image of the old crest of St. Columban's School superimposed in front of CAISL's current emblem. CAISL's history begins in 1956, when the school is founded as St. Columban's School, by Irish professor Anthony A. McKenna, to serve the children of the American engineers who were in Portugal working on the Salazar Bridge (now 25 de Abril Bridge), in Lisbon, so that the children would be able to reintegrate back into the American system upon their departure from Portugal.Journal for the Advancement of International Education - The Carlucci American International School of Lisbon Celebrates 50th Anniversary During this time, the school was housed in the Quinta da Casa Branca, an 18th-century quinta (manor or estate) in Carnaxide, Oeiras, outside of Lisbon.P√∫blico - H√° 50 Anos, um Professor Irland√™s Criou um Col√©gio Americano The school renamed itself the American International School of Lisbon (AISL) in 1995, when management of the school passed from private ownership to the Funda√ß√£o Escola Americana de Lisboa (American School of Lisbon Foundation; FEAL), a not-for-profit foundation was created by the American Delegation to Portugal, the Ford Motor Company, and Esp√≠rito Santo Financial Group. These three entities became the three, equal members of the school's board of trustees. With the school's new not-for-profit mission and with a new oversight organization, through FEAL, AISL became a U.S. State Department-recognized school. After the creation of FEAL in 1995, the foundation's main priority was to centralize all of the schools of AISL onto one purpose-built site, as the secondary school, elementary school, and early child center were housed in different facilities spread across the Portuguese Riviera. In 1997, in cooperation with the municipal government of Sintra, a new purpose-built campus was built in Linh√≥, in the freguesia of S√£o Pedro de Penaferrim, on land granted on a permanent lease by the municipality near the Quinta da Beloura. In 1998, the Linh√≥ campus was inaugurated by Hillary Clinton, then the First Lady of the United States.Revista Pontos de Vista - Uma L√≠der que Tem como Miss√£o Formar L√≠deres In 2001, the school officially changed its name to its current designation as the Frank C. Carlucci American International School of Lisbon, in honor of American diplomat and politician, Frank C. Carlucci, who served as American Ambassador to Portugal, from 1974 to 1978.Pares e √çmpares, Mem√≥rias de um Bairro - Uma Escola Americana Carlucci, who went on to serve as Deputy Director of the CIA and U.S. Secretary of Defense, played a prominent role in Portugal following the events of the 1974 Carnation Revolution, especially in maintaining good Luso-American relations.

Often from the viewpoint of standing beneath an 'overhang' there is shade provided by a protrusion from the adjacent vertical domain, such as a tree or building. In marketing, overhanging the market relates to the business practice of announcing a new product or a new business strategy by a company in an adjacent space to the target. To be an overhang in this context, the following conditions must exist: the announcer is a market leader in the adjacent space; the new product is not ready for release at the time of the announcement; the market is new and standards are not yet clearly defined; and, the goal is to forestall competitor growth by encouraging customers to wait for the new product.  Recent examples of overhang  In June 1999 - Nortel declared a voice over IP strategy, while Cisco and its newly acquired Selcius Systems IP PBX were starting to gain traction.Inca strategy Nortel was a leader in enterprise PBXs and made this announcement to retain the loyalty of their enormous installed base and to slow down the adoption of the IP PBX product category. Nortel overhung the IP PBX market, announcing products 12 months or more before their availability. In June 2006 - Microsoft enters the IP Telephony market with PowerPoints. Here the collection of products and related applications in adjacent markets combined with announcements of as-yet-not- available products, attempt to overhang the IP PBX market, slowing down the growth of the market, forcing the players to consider the implications and adjust, encouraging customers to think about what Microsoft can bring to the market, giving Microsoft engineering the time to catch up with product.  Effectiveness of Market Overhang  The empirical evidence suggests this technique is effective since it continues to be used as a marketing tactic by major players that are slower to respond to the high growth of adjacent markets that are rapidly emerging. As the high technology industry continues to consolidate, market overhang is likely to continue as a mechanism for marketers to 'shape' emerging segments.

He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Biography =Early life= Born in Oklahoma and raised in Mena, Arkansas, Teague graduated from the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (now Texas A&M; University) in 1932. He joined the Army in 1940 as a lieutenant and was discharged in 1946 as a colonel. He participated in the D-Day invasion of Normandy, and was a decorated combat veteran of World War II, receiving the Silver Star with two clusters, the Bronze Star, and two Purple Hearts.Past Chairmen of House Committee on Veteran's Affairs The nickname \\"Tiger\\" came from his play on the football field while in high school. =Congressional career= Representative Olin Teague and other members of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics visited the Marshall Space Flight Center on March 9, 1962, to gather first- hand information of the nation's space exploration program. While in Congress, he was the veteran's champion, authoring more veterans' legislation than any congressman before him. He was one of the majority of the Texan delegation to decline to sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto opposing the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education. However, Teague voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He proposed 50 amendments in Congress, including: Providing for the election of President and Vice President; to abolish the electoral college (1953), Provides representation for the people of the District of Columbia (1957), Relative to appointment of postmasters (1959), Proposal with respect to the appointment of postmasters (1961), Empowering Congress to grant representation in the Congress and among the electors of President and Vice President to the people of the District of Columbia (1950 and 1951 and 1953), Equal rights regardless of sex (1967). He was instrumental in improving benefits for servicemen's survivors. In 1956, he helped overhaul the survivor's benefits, with the creation of the Dependency and Indemnity Compensation. He was also chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs (1955‚Äì1972), and chairman of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics (1973‚Äì1978). Before 1973, he also chaired the Manned Space Flight Subcommittee and in that capacity oversaw NASA's efforts to place a man on the moon. In 1976, Teague was pivotal in establishing the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Legacy The Olin E. Teague Veterans Center, a VA hospital and health center in Temple, Texas, was named for him. The VA also presents the annual Olin E. Teague Award for contributions to improving the quality of life of disabled veterans. Also named for him were the Olin E.

The band released one cassette album and appeared on compilation LP \\"One Summer In Liverpool\\". In 1991, the band toured Russia as part of a cultural exchange tour organised by Liverpool City Council. Tyson didn't contribute greatly to the compositions of this band, however his contribution lying in \\"total dedication to his instrument\\". In 1994 Tyson joined Cast, the band formed by former La's bass player John Power. The band went on to sign to Polydor and released 3 studio albums, All Change, Mother Nature Calls and Magic Hour. In 2001 Power set to work on fourth album Beetroot, which featured little input from the other band members. The album moved away from the band's previous guitar sound and relied heavily on drum loops and sampled flutes and horns. The album failed to make the UK Top 75, and within two weeks the band cancelled a forthcoming tour to promote the album. Amid rumours of bust ups and being dropped by their record label, the band announced their split in August 2001. Following the demise of Cast, Tyson went on to tour, record and write with Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant in his band \\"The Strange Sensation\\", following the departure of Porl Thompson in 2002. Now based in Snowdonia, during down time from the Strange Sensation Tyson began work on the project \\"Men from Mars\\", featuring members of The Strange Sensation and Pyramid Dream. The first Men From Mars album was eventually released in digitally in 2010 via the projects official Bandcamp page. Cast reformed in 2010 and toured the UK in November/December 2010 to mark the 15th anniversary of the band's debut album All Change. The band went on to play further select dates and festivals throughout 2011 before releasing new studio album \\"Troubled Times\\" in March 2012. In 2012, Tyson returned with other former Strange Sensation band members, with the addition of Dave Smith, Juldeh Camara and Patty Griffin, to back Robert Plant as Sensational Space Shifters, who debuted on stage in Gloucester on 8 May and will continue to tour throughout 2012.

It is also known as the Brazen Palace or Lohaprasadaya because the roof was covered with bronze tiles. In ancient times, the building included the refectory and the uposathagara (Uposatha house). There was also a Simamalake where the Sangha assembled on Poya days to recite the sutra of the confessional. The famous Lohaprasada built by King Dutugemunu, described as an edifice of nine stories, was a building of this class. One side of the building was 400 ft (120 m) in length. There are 40 rows, each row consisting of 40 stone pillars, for a total of 1600 pillars. It is said that Lovamahapaya was adorned with corals and precious stones. It is believed that it took six years for the construction of the building and the plan was brought from the heavens. The building was completely destroyed during the reign of King Saddhatissa.Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 13, The Royal Asiatic Society 1881, p.170 (Cambridge University) Retrieved 20 November 2015Lovamahapaya ‚Äì The Great Copper Roofed Mansion, Amazing Lanka Web, Retrieved 20 November 2015 Whilst the Jetavanaramaya, Abhayagiriya and Ruwanwelisaya were taller structures, the Lovamahapaya remained the tallest building of the island for over a millennium between 155BC and 993AD.

Abhayagiri VihƒÅra was a major monastery site of Mahayana, Theravada and Vajrayana Buddhism that was situated in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. It is one of the most extensive ruins in the world and one of the most sacred Buddhist pilgrimage cities in the nation. Historically it was a great monastic centre as well as a royal capital, with magnificent monasteries rising to many stories, roofed with gilt bronze or tiles of burnt clay glazed in brilliant colors. To the north of the city, encircled by great walls and containing elaborate bathing ponds, carved balustrades and moonstones, stood \\"Abhayagiri\\", one of seventeen such religious units in Anuradhapura and the largest of its five major viharas. One of the focal points of the complex is an ancient stupa, the Abhayagiri Dagaba. Surrounding the humped dagaba, Abhayagiri Vihara was a seat of the Northern Monastery, or Uttara Vihara and the original custodian of the Tooth relic in the island. The term \\"Abhayagiri Vihara\\" refers not only to the complex of monastic buildings, but also a fraternity of Buddhist monks, or Sangha, which maintained its own historical records, traditions and way of life. Founded in the 2nd century BC, it had grown into an international institution by the 1st century AD, attracting scholars from all over the world and encompassing all shades of Buddhist philosophy. Its influence can be traced to other parts of the world, through branches established elsewhere. Thus, the Abhayagiri Vihara developed as a great institution vis‚Äëa‚Äëvis the Mahavihara and the Jetavana Buddhist monastic sects in the ancient Sri Lankan capital of Anuradhapura. King Valagamba and Abhayagiri It is recorded in the chronicle that Abhayagiri Dagaba was established by King Valagamba during the period of his second reign, from 89-77 BC. A young Brahmin named Tiya (Tissa) declared war against him. Tiya was deluded by the prophecy of another Brahmin that was destined to be king. Before the arrival of Bhikkhu Mahinda, who brought Buddhism to the island, Brahmins held the highest place in society. After the establishment of the Buddhist sangha on the island, however, they lost their supremacy, and were replaced by the sangha. Some Brahmins converted to Buddhism, while others revolted. Tiya, who enjoyed the support of his community, lived both in and outside of Sri Lanka, and was therefore very powerful. At the same time, seven Tamil chiefs landed at Mahatittha with a mighty army. Valagamba, a good diplomat, realized that his forces were too weak to fight against both of these enemies and tried to rid himself of them by making them fight each other. He sent a message to Tiya that if he could have the kingdom, provided he managed to defeat the foreign invaders. Tiya agreed, advanced with his forces to meet the Tamils, and was vanquished by them. The Tamils, elated by their success, advanced towards Anuradhapura and defeated the King, who was forced to abandon the throne and go into hiding in the mountains. As the King, defeated in battle, was fleeing Anuradhapura, a Jain monk (\\"nigantha\\" in Pali) named Giri, who headed the arama built by King Pandukhabaya near the northern gate of the city, cried out: \\"The great black Sinhala is fleeing.\\" ‡§§‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ ‡§™‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç, ‡§®‡§ø‡§ó‡§£‡•ç‡§†‡•ã‡§ó‡§ø‡§∞‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ï‡•ã‡•§ ‚Äò‚Äò‡§™‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§ï‡§æ‡§≥-‡§∏‡•Ä‡§π‡§≥‡•ã‚Äô‚Äô‡§§‡§ø ‡§≠‡•Å‡§∏‡§Ç ‡§∞‡§µ‡§ø‡••, ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§µ‡§Ç‡§∏ ‡§§‡•á‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§Ç‡§∏‡§§‡§ø‡§Æ ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡•á‡§¶, ‡§¶‡§∏‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§ï‡•ã The king thereupon resolved, \\"if my wish (of regaining the kingdom) is fulfilled, I will build a vihara here.\\" During the Beminitiya Seya or period of famine and foreign rule which followed, Vattagamani Abhaya took refuge in the mountain region amassing troops until, after more than fourteen years of exile, he marched on Anuradhapura in 89 BC and defeated the last Tamil king, Bhatiya. In fulfillment of the vow made on the day of his defeat, one of his first acts was to build the Abhayagiri Vihara on the site of the Giri monastery. Mahatissa Thera of Kupikkala was appointed its Chief Incumbent as a mark of gratitude for his support in the fight against the invaders. Abhayagiri thereafter became a symbol not only of religious, but also of national, resurgence, as it signaled the end of Brahmin and Jain influence in the country. According to the Mahavamsa, the name Abhayagiri Vihara originated from the names of King Vattagamani Abhaya and the Jain monk Giri who lived in the monastery earlier. The Mahavamsa, The Great Chronicle of Sri Lanka, Geiger, Wilhelm, Chapter XXXIII, The Ten Kings, p. 228 However, since most ancient monasteries were built around a hillock, or giri in Sinhala, (for example the Vessagiri, Meghagiri or Chetiyagiri monasteries) it is possible that the name Abhayagiri symbolizes the monastery created by Vattagamani Abhaya after his recapture of the kingdom surrounding the hillock known as Digapasana, now inside the Abhayagiri complex. The golden age of Abhayagiri Bronze statue of Avalokite≈õvara Bodhisattva. Sri Lanka, ca. 750 CE =Royal patronage= Under Gajabahu I, Abhayagiri grew in prestige and importance. The accession of King Mahasena in the 3rd century AD saw the suppression of the Mahavihara monks. The king prohibited the giving of alms to them and went as far as to demolish the buildings of the Mahavihara and re‚Äëuse their materials for the construction of new buildings at the Abhayagiri. The accession of Mahasena ushered in the golden age of Abhayagiri. After the Buddha's Tooth Relic was brought to Sri Lanka in the 4th century, Abhayagiri was selected to house it for public veneration. Faxian, a Chinese monk, recounted: > Ten days from now, Buddha's tooth will be brought out and carried to the > Abhayagiri Monastery... on both sides of the road; the king sets images of > the Five Hundred Forms which the Buddha assumed in his previous existence.'A > Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms, by Fa-hsien. By the time Faxian came to Sri Lanka in search of the Dhamma and visited Abhayagiri in 412 AD, it had developed into a leading Buddhist centre of Sri Lanka. By the 7th century, Abhayagiri Vihara consisted of four mulas (literally \\"families\\", fraternities or grouped institutions for religious teaching): * Uttara‚Äëmula * Kapara‚Äëmula * Mahanethpa‚Äëmula * Vahadu‚Äëmula All of these have been located and identified through archaeological excavations, research and epigraphical evidence. Before the 12th century CE, more rulers of Sri Lanka gave support and patronage to the Abhayagiri TheravƒÅdins, and travelers such as Faxian saw the Abhayagiri TheravƒÅdins as the main Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka.Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. A History of Indian Buddhism: From ≈öƒÅkyamuni to Early MahƒÅyƒÅna. 2007. p. 125 =Foreign relations= In the course of time, Abhayagiri had developed into a well‚Äëorganized religious and educational institution having well established relations with China, Java, and Kashmir. According to the Chinese text Biqiuni Zhuan, the biography of the bhikkhuni compiled by Shi Baochang in 526 AD, and the biography of Gunavarnam and Sanghavarnam, the Sinhala nuns gave the second Upasampada, or higher ordination, to the Chinese nuns. According to another Chinese source, in 426 AD, eight Sinhala nuns arrived in Nanjing, the capital of the Liu Song dynasty (420-77 AD), on a merchant ship owned by man named Nandi. Consequently, three more nuns, headed by Tissara, arrived in Nanjing. Thus in the year 434, over three thousand nuns received their higher ordination for the second time in the presence of more than ten Sinhala nuns headed by Tissara at the Nanjing Temple in China. It is also recorded that there were religious contacts between Sri Lanka and Java through the Abayagiri Vihara, at least toward the end of 8th century, as described by a fragmentary inscription from the Ratubaka plateau in central Java. This inscription records the establishment of \\"the Abhayagiri Vihara of Sinhalese ascetics trained in the sayings of jinas [Buddhas].\\" Commenting on this record, J.G. de Casparis observes, 'The most important detail is the name of the foundation, the Abhayagiri Vihara. =MahƒÅyƒÅna and VajrayƒÅna= Abhayagiri Vihara appears to have been a center for MahƒÅyƒÅna and VajrayƒÅna teachings;\\"Esoteric Buddhism in Southeast Asia in the Light of Recent Scholarship\\" by Hiram Woodward.

A History of Indian Buddhism: From ≈öƒÅkyamuni to Early MahƒÅyƒÅna. 2007. p. 121 As a major university and center of learning, Abhayagiri was the home of various important Buddhist scholars working in Sanskrit and Pali. These include Upatissa (who wrote the Vimuttimagga), Kavicakravarti Ananda (authored the Saddhammop√•yana), Aryadeva, Aryasura, and the tantric masters Jayabhadra, and Candram√•li.Rangama, Chandawimala;The impact of the Abhayagiri practices on the development of TheravadaBuddhism in Sri Lanka, 2007 In the 8th century CE, it is known that both MahƒÅyƒÅna and the esoteric VajrayƒÅna form of Buddhism were being practiced in Sri Lanka, and two Indian monks responsible for propagating Esoteric Buddhism in China, Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra, visited the island during this time.Hirakawa, Akira.

American Buddhism: Methods and Findings in Recent Scholarship. 1999. p. 134 The Culavamsa narrates that (ch 78:1-27) king Parakramabahu I purified the Mahavihara first and then unified it with the Abhayagiri and Jethawana fraternities. The monks of these two traditions were then defrocked and given the choice of either returning to the laity permanently, or attempting re-ordination under the MahƒÅvihƒÅra tradition as \\"novices\\" (') according to Gombrich, Richard. TheravƒÅda Buddhism: A Social History From Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo. 1988. p. 159 Richard Gombrich who writes:Gombrich, Richard. TheravƒÅda Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo. 1988. p. 159 ParakkamabƒÅhu also appointed a Sangharaja, or \\"King of the Sangha,\\" a monk who would preside over the Sangha and its ordinations in Sri Lanka, assisted by two deputies. Periodic South Indian invasions, especially in the 9th century in the reign of Sena I, almost half a century of Chola rule and the subsequent abandonment of the capital, Anuradhapura, led to the disintegration of the Abhayagiri Vihara. Despite efforts by Vijayabahu I and Parakramabahu I in the 13th century to renovate and resurrect the temple, its gradual destruction in the course of time could not be averted, particularly after the final transfer of the capital from Polonnaruwa in the Rajarata, or King's Country, to an alternative location in 1215 as a result of repeated Maga invasions. A dark era of eight hundred years engulfed Abhayagiri Vihara until its rediscovery in the 1880s awoke scientific and scholarly interest in the abandoned and vandalized ruins. Mistakenly identified at first as Jetavana Vihara, they were photographed and drawn by specialists in the late 19th century, while the Department of Archaeology, established about the same period, undertook excavation and conservation work of some of the edifices at the beginning of the 20th century. Legacy Veneration of Avalokite≈õvara Bodhisattva has continued to the present day in Sri Lanka, where he is called Natha.Baruah, Bibhuti. Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism. 2008. p. 137 Avalokite≈õvara worship is a prominent practice in Mahayana, while the Maithreya Bodhisatta (Santhusitha) is venerated by Theravadins. In more recent times, it has been attempted to identify NƒÅtha with Maitreya Bodhisattva. However, traditions and basic iconography, including an image of AmitƒÅbha Buddha on his crown, identify NƒÅtha as Avalokite≈õvara. Andrew Skilton writes:Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. p. 151 Early reports by Europeans from the 18th century describe the Buddhist monks of Sri Lanka as being engaged in the recitation of mantras, and using mƒÅlƒÅ beads for counting, as practiced in MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism. Architectural decoration The Abhayagiri dagoba Detailing on the dagoba The architectural elements of the buildings excavated at Abhayagiri Vihara clearly reflect the social beliefs and religious practices prevalent at the time. Although Buddhism was the state religion and the principal doctrine followed by the majority of the population, the influence of other local beliefs, particularly Hinduism, were considerable, and are expressed in the architecture of the period. The design of entrances, for example, illustrates the practice of placing buildings under the protection of a guardian deity. The two slabs erected on either side of the foot of the flight of steps leading to a building are known as guard stones (Muragala). They are usually carved, although plain guard stones have also been found. Among the Hindu symbols represented on these stones, the most common, apart from the Pot of Abundance and Kalpavrksa, is the figure of the Nagaraja, or anthropomorphic King Cobra. The best example of these, and one of the finest guardstones yet discovered, was found at the Ratnaprasada in Abhayagiriya, and illustrates the degree of perfection reached by the sculptors of Abhayagiri. Lotuses and punkalas are indicative of plenty. Representations of the lotus are of particular significance in agricultural societies where they symbolize the daughters of the guardian deity of rain. The elephant figure at the Eth Pokuna is also a symbol of water. The principal Buddhist guardian deities are frequently indicated by the animal vehicles of the particular gods, particularity on the guard stones. A good example is furnished by the exquisite statues on either side of the entrance to Abhayagiri Stupa. The head‚Äëdress of one of the statues is a conch while that of the other is a lotus. Representing Sanka and Padma, the two principal treasure houses of Kuvera, they are believed to have been erected to ward off any evil or danger that might threaten the stupa or its precinct. Even at present they are commonly believed to be endowed with mystic powers, and courts of law in Anuradhapura accept swearing before the statues as evidence in settlement of minor disputes between litigants. The best example of a moonstone, a unique creation of Sri Lanka sculptors, can be seen at the foot of the steps leading to the Pancavasa commonly known as Mahasena‚Äôs palace. A smaller example, just as exquisitely carved, was found nearby at the Queen's Pavilion. Varying in shape and size and made of different kinds of stones, all are exquisite artistic creations. According to Paranavitana, the moonstone symbolizes samsara, the endless cycle of rebirth, and the path to freedom from the samsaric process leading to nirvana. He interprets the pattern of the outermost ring as flames, and the various animals shown in the other concentric circles as successive phases of man's passage through samsara. Current status Over the course of 15 years, the Abhayagiri Stupa was fully restored and renovated by the Sri Lankan Central Cultural Fund as a UNESCO project for a total of Rs519.5 million (US$3.9 million). It was unveiled in June 2015 with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe attending.

Nonetheless, the partial bone is distinctive enough to place the species clearly into the heron family.

Location of Banu Harith along with some of the major tribes of the Arabian Peninsula at the dawn of Islam (approximately 600 CE). History =Origins and early history= The Banu Harith descend from the Qahtanite people, one of the most prominent Arab tribes originating from Yemen. The earliest recorded ancestor of the Qahtanites is Joktan, one of the two sons of Eber. The Qahtanite people are divided into the two factions, the Himyarite and Kahlani tribes. The Kahlani tribe can be further broken into smaller sub-groups which include the Banu Harith which was established by Harith bin Ka'b.

This was brought to an end during the Christian invasion.

The individual tribes vary in religious composition. In Islamic history One Banu Najjar group is mentioned in the Charter of Medina, and the Banu Najjar of Medina were the maternal clan of Muhammad's grandfather Abdul-Muttalib. Islamic historians like Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani and al-Tabari list them as a clan of the large Banu Khazraj tribe of Medina. Al-Asqalani states that their ancestor was Taymallah ibn Thalabah ibn Amr ibn al-Khazraj.Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (1986). Fath al- Bari. page 144. The Banu Najjar had at least three sub-clans. Before Islam, the Banu Najjar of Medina mainly practiced traditional Arab polytheism, and owned idols named Samul, Husa, and at-Tamm that were destroyed after the clan converted to Islam. They may have had a tribal alliance with some of the Jews of Medina. Muhammad initially settled with them when he emigrated from Mecca to Medina. The Prophet's Mosque was later built in the tribe's garden. The Banu Najjar are praised in a hadith attributed to Muhammad.

Early years Pietri spent the first five years of her life in Algeria. In 1962, because of the independence gained by the country, her family was forced to exile in France. Thereafter, she decided to return to North Africa, in Casablanca. A few years later, she decided to live in Le Pecq, in Saint Germain en Laye suburb.Interview of Julie Pietri on the DVD Julie Pietri √† l'Olympia At the age of fourteen, Pietri formed a musical group named Transit, with whom she performed songs from artists including V√©ronique Sanson, Janis Joplin and Joe Cocker. In 1975, th band released its first single : \\"On s'est laiss√© faire\\".Julie Pietri, biography Chantefrance.com (Retrieved 7 May 2009) Beginnings  Then, after two years of studying speech therapy, she began working with La Bande √† Basile, a music group dressed in costumes inspired by the Commedia dell'arte; she was dressed as a gypsy. In late 1979, Julie was chosen to record the song \\"Magdalena\\". It was successful, allowing the singer to record her first studio album in 1980 with the contribution of French composer Jean Schultheis and lyricist Jean-Marie Moreau. In 1981, she went for the first time on stage of the Olympia with Sacha Distel. Seduced by her voice, he invited her to participate in his show and to sing with him two songs as duets. In 1982, Pietri met success with \\"Je veux croire\\", a post-disco song with gospel sounds. She then enjoyed success with a French language version of The Kinks's hit \\"I go to sleep\\", retitled \\"Et c'est comme si\\". The following year, Pietri duetteed with French singer Herbert Leonard on the song \\"Amoureux fous\\". Other singles followed including \\"Tora Tora Tora\\" and \\"√Ä force de toi\\" (a cover of \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" performed by Jim Diamond) which supported the release of her new album in 1985, √Ä force de toi. Meanwhile, she founded her own line of makeup. She was again invited to perform at the Olympia during a show by Belgian singer Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois. She decided to take a break. During this whole period, her stage name was simply Julie. Solo career In 1986, the singer returned to music using her complete name, Julie Pietri, and scored a French number one hit with \\"√àve l√®ve-toi\\".\\"√àve l√®ve-toi\\", French Singles Chart Lescharts.com (Retrieved 8 May 2009) She re-recorded the song in English as \\"Listen to your heart\\". Le Premier Jour, her new album, was co-written by the singer. In December 1987, the song \\"Nuit sans issue\\" was released at the same time of the album release, composed by Vincent-Marie Bouvot. A few months later, she participated in a charity song with other artists for the boat people in Southeast Asia : \\"Dernier Matin d'Asie\\". In December, the singer gave a series of concerts at the Olympia, followed by a tour through France. She sang \\"Nouvelle Vie\\", the second hit off the album, and did a cover version of \\"Non, je ne regrette rien\\" by √âdith Piaf and \\"La vie ne m'apprend rien by Daniel Balavoine. In spring 1989, Pietri came back with a new look (blazing red hair) and told \\"La l√©gende des madones\\" (\\"The Legend of madonnas\\") in a new album. Julie asked the singer-composer Daran to compose two of the eleven tracks of the album (\\"Feeling en noir\\" et \\"Joh-Da√Ø\\"). The first single was \\"Salammb√¥\\", a song inspired by the female character created by Gustave Flaubert. In 1990, she released the third single from the album, \\"√âtrang√®re\\", and started a concert tour in France during the summer. She also did softcore photos for French magazine Lui'.Lui, cover of May 1990 Member.lycos.fr (Retrieved 8 May 2009) In March 1992, Julie Pietri gave birth to a daughter, Manon and decided to retire from music. The same year, a compilation and a double compilation were released. The transition In 1995, the album F√©minin singuli√®re was released and contained new versions of Pietri's previous hits, arranged by Jean-Pierre Pilot, plus some new songs written by Julie Pietri and mainly composed by Fran√ßois Bernheim. She regularly performed in Paris at the Petit Journal Montparnasse, then at the Caf√© Opus. In 1996, she recovered The Pretenders' hit but in French-language : \\"I'll Stand by You\\" was re-entitled \\"Je pense √† nous\\". During the summer, she was requested by France 2 to record the ballad \\"Canto di Sorenza\\" with the Corsican polyphonic choir Voce di Corsica. She recorded this song for the credits of the TV movie Dans un grand vent de fleurs, aired in September and October. In June 2000, she recorded a dance version of \\"√àve l√®ve-toi\\" especially for the European compilation Euro Pride 2000. A Best Of compilation titled √àve l√®ve-toi was released the same year. The singer returned to stage performance giving a concert at the Th√©√¢tre of Boulogne Billancourt in February 2001. She toured again during summers and appeared in many television shows. She recorded a new duet with Herbert L√©onard, entitled \\"Orient Express\\". \\"Retour gagnant\\" The TV broadcast \\"Retour gagnant\\", aired in May 2003, resurrected her career thanks to her successful cover of \\"Vivre pour le meilleur\\" (originally performed by the French singer Johnny Hallyday). In September, Pietri released an album called \\"Lumi√®res\\", containing cover versions and original songs. In March, Julie gives three concerts in the Duc des Lombards, a famous jazz club in Paris. The music style of her repertory is at that time turned into a jazzy mood. In 2007 after, the DVD collection is completed by a CD + DVD bonus edit. In May and June, Julie Pietri records the songs of her new album called \\"Autour de minuit\\", the first single from which is a cover of the Etienne Daho song \\"Des Heures hindoues\\". At the beginning of November, Pietri presented her jazzy song recital in Paris at the Sc√®ne Bastille and again then at the Bataclan. At the end of these concerts, a collector edit of her new album (limited to 1,000 copies) with a photo booklet was released.

There can be many reasons for deciding to perform a rejected takeoff, but they are usually due to suspected or actual technical failures, such as an engine failure, fire, incorrect configuration, aircraft controllability or environmental conditions such as windshear. A rejected takeoff is normally performed only if the aircraft's speed is below the takeoff decision speed known as V1, which for larger multi-engine airplanes is calculated before each flight. Below the decision speed, the airplane should be able to stop safely before the end of the runway. Above the decision speed, the airplane may overshoot the runway if the takeoff is aborted, and, therefore, a rejected takeoff is normally not performed above this speed, unless there is reason to doubt the airplane's ability to fly. If a serious failure occurs or is suspected above V1 but the airplane's ability to fly is not in doubt, the takeoff is continued despite the (suspected) failure and the airplane will attempt to land again as soon as possible. Single-engine aircraft will reject any takeoff after an engine failure, regardless of speed, as there is no power available to continue the takeoff. Even if the airplane is already airborne, if sufficient runway remains, an attempt to land straight ahead on the runway may be made. This may also apply to some light twin engine airplanes. Before the takeoff roll is started, the autobrake system of the aircraft, if available, is armed. The autobrake system will automatically apply maximum brakes if throttle is reduced to idle or reverse thrust during the takeoff roll once a preset speed has been reached.  RTO testing  An RTO is usually seen as one of the hardest tests an airplane has to undergo for its certification trials. The RTO test is performed under the worst possible conditions; i.e. with fully worn out brakes, the plane loaded to maximum takeoff weight and no use of thrust reversers. During an RTO test most of the kinetic energy of the airplane is converted to heat by the brakes, which may cause the fusible plugs of the tires to melt, causing them to deflate. Small brake fires are acceptable as long as they do not spread to the airplane body within five minutes (the maximum likely time for arrival of the airport fire fighters).Bernard Choi and Joe Parke (2011), Boeing.com - Boeing 747-8 Performs ultimate rejected take-off , article retrieved 30 January 2013.

(1981), WarGames (1983), Blue Thunder (1983), Stakeout (1987), The Hard Way (1991), Another Stakeout (1993), and Nick of Time (1995). He was also member of the band The Beepers. In 1983 Rubinstein created the score to Blue Thunder (which he composed, conducted and produced) using various synthesizers, a popular instrument of the 80's era. In the score Rubinstein used these synthesizers in a symphonic manner by combining them with brass, percussion and string ensembles. Using the Synclavier II (a digital computer instrument) and dubbing this with both the Jupiter, the Prophet and the Moog analog synthesizers. Rubinstein also created a very unusual sound by placing a microphone inside a large empty water bottle and placing it underneath a Steinway grand piano.

His publications include a memoir and biographies of David Livingstone (1973), Robert Baden-Powell (1989), and Henry Morton Stanley (2007). Jeal was formally educated in London and Oxford, and lives in north London. He has a wife and three daughters. Biography Tim Jeal's father, Clifford Jeal, about whom Jeal published a memoir in 2004, was a Christian mystic and follower of the Anglican Order Of The Cross fellowship and as such practised pacifism and vegetarianism. Jeal's mother was Norah Pasley, daughter of Sir Thomas Pasley Bt, and Constance Wilmot Annie Hastings, who is the daughter of the 14th Earl of Huntingdon.Jeal, Swimming with my Father, 2004 Jeal was educated at Westminster School, London, and Christ Church, Oxford. From 1966 to 1970, he worked for BBC Television in the features group.Author details to Baden-Powell, Pimlico edition, 1991 Jeal is married to Joyce Jeal and they have three daughters. Publications Jeal has been writing books since the 1960s, for London and New York-based publishers. Although most of his works are fictional, he is best known for his biographies. His biography, Livingstone (1973) based on private letters, diaries and archives was the first to describe the explorer/missionary's faults and failings and to reveal the man behind the icon. It became the basis for a BBC TV documentary and a film for the Discovery Channel. Livingstone has never been out of print since first publication in 1973 and in 2013 was reissued in a revised and expanded edition by Yale University Press. In Baden-Powell (1989), Jeal offers a revisionist account of Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Boy Scouts, restoring his reputation which had deteriorated during the 20th century. However, Jeal also speculated that Powell was a homosexual, even a repressed one, and this sparked a great deal of attention in the popular press culminating in scouting organizations reissuing an earlier biography of Powell by William Hillcourt to dilute attention and sales of Jeal's book.Robert Campbell (1993) Origins of the Scouts, Sydney, Australia In 1995 Jeal's book was the basis for a TV documentary in the Channel 4 series \\"Secret Lives\\" entitled Lord Baden-Powell: The Boy Man. The 2007 biography of Henry Morton Stanley was a revisionist account that showed Stanley in a more sympathetic light. Professor John Carey in The Sunday Times accepted that Jeal's 'ardent, intricate defence of a man history has damned' had been successful, and concluded: 'Anyone who, after reading this book, imagines they would have behaved better than Stanley, if faced with the same dangers, must have a vivid imagination.' Tim Gardam said in The Observer that Jeal had 'fulfilled a mission to rehabilitate one of the most complex heroes of Victorian Britain'. Kevin Rushby in The Guardian said he was 'aware of the dangers of revisionism' and doubted that Stanley was as innocent as Jeal argued. While calling Stanley 'an awesome piece of scholarship executed with page-turning brio,' he expressed doubt that it would be the 'last word on Henry Morton Stanley.' In the Washington Post Jason Roberts wrote of '...this commanding, definitive biography' being 'an unalloyed triumph...'; and in the New York Times Book Review Paul Theroux described it as 'the most felicitous, the best informed, the most complete and readable [biography of Stanley]'. Tim Jeal had unique access to the massive Stanley collection in the Royal Museum of Central Africa in Brussels and saw many letters, diaries and other documents (including correspondence between Stanley and King Leopold II of Belgium) unseen by previous biographers. The book had its detractors. Kenyan law professor Makau Mutua said \\"If Jeal's attempt was the resurrection of a humane Stanley, then I must judge him a complete failure,\\" going on to suggest that \\"the author should have set aside any biased personal agendas and let history speak for itself. Instead, Jeal writes a political book in defence of a historical monster.\\" Explorers of the Nile: The Triumph and Tragedy of a Great Victorian Adventure (2011) is about the search for the source of the Nile by John Hanning Speke, James Augustus Grant, Richard Francis Burton, Samuel White Baker, Henry Morton Stanley, David Livingstone and many others from 1856-1878. It is particularly focused on John Hanning Speke, seeking to restore his reputation, who is credited with unraveling the mystery of the source. Jeal has pitched the book as an update to Alan Moorehead's The White Nile.

However most species of the genus were not as big. Biology Species of Palaeophis were specialised aquatic animals, as their fossils occur primarily in marine strata, though at least some estuarine remains have also been found. Different species are thought to have occupied different ecological niches. Studies on Palaeophis vertebrae show a high degree of vascularisation, suggesting that it had a considerably faster metabolism and growth rate than modern snakes. This may suggest that palaeophiids, like other marine reptiles such as mosasaurs, might have developed towards endothermy.

Before the Chernobyl disaster and the fall of the Berlin Wall, there were very few green activist groups in the country. Koeberg Alert and the Dolphin Action and Protection Group are probably two of the oldest post-conservation groups. While most early conservationists, with few exceptions, implicated themselves in the apartheid system, groups such as Earthlife Africa were consciously aware of their role as nurturers of freedom and human rights as well as the rights of the earth and animal kingdom.

But he had to walk most of the 673 miles, (which took over 104 days effort).Dan Lewis Fische He collected seeds of Penstemon baccharifolius (Hook), between Texas and El Paso, which were later given to William Hooker. Also, Castilleja lanata (found near the Rio Grande) and Castilleja integra (found in the Organ Mountains, near El Paso).Francis Whittier Pennell In the spring of 1851, he joined the United States and Mexican Boundary Survey (also with Gray's help). His collections from these two trips, formed the basis of Gray's Plantae Wrightianae (1852‚Äì53). He found around 50 new plants in the area. Between 1853 and 1856, he took part in the Rodgers-Ringgold North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition, collecting plants in Madeira, Cape Verde, Cape Town, Sydney, Hong Kong, the Bonin Islands, Japan (at Hakodate, Tanegashima, the Bonin Islands and the Ryukyu Islands including Okinawa) and the western side of the Bering Strait. He collected over 500 specimens while the ships were delayed at Simon's Bay, near Cape Town. Wright left the expedition at San Francisco in February 1856 and went south to Nicaragua. His collection of plants from Hong Kong was used by George Bentham for his Flora Hongkongensis (1861). Between 1856 and 1867, he led a scientific expedition to Cuba. In 1859 he joined Juan Gundlach in the area around Monteverde, and in the winter of 1861-62 they explored together around C√°rdenas. He was also still in communication with Asa Gray and via him, Charles Darwin, discussing orchids.Charles Darwin This was possible because at the start of the American Civil War, he was in Cuba and Gray kept him there until 1864 to keep Wright safe and his ongoing botanical work intact.Dupree, p. 310 In 1871, he went with the US Commission to Santo Domingo. From 1875 to 1876, he was the librarian of the Bussey Institution at Harvard University. His lichen specimens were given to Edward Tuckerman. * Legacy Charles Wright is commemorated in the names of a number of plants, including Datura wrightii, the genus Carlowrightia (wrightworts) and Geissorhiza wrightii (Baker). George Engelmann named a small cactus after him, Wright's fishhook (Sclerocactus uncinatus var. wrightii). He is also commemorated in the name of the American grey flycatcher (Empidonax wrightii ) found near El Paso. Tropidophis wrighti (Wright's dwarf boa) was also named after him. Charles Wright Elementary School in Wethersfield, Connecticut is named after him.

Dune pattern in the Great Sand Sea, Egypt. NASA Earth Observatory. The Great Sand Sea is an approximately 72,000 km¬≤ sand desert (erg) in the Sahara between western Egypt and eastern Libya in North Africa. Some 74% of the area is covered by sand dunes. Geography The Great Sand Sea stretches for a length of about 650 km from north to south and a width of 300 km from east to west. On satellite images this desert shows a pattern of long sand ridges running in a roughly north-south direction. However, despite the apparent uniformity the Great Sand Sea has two large areas with different types of megadunes.Besler, Helga (2008) The Great Sand Sea in Egypt: Formation, Dynamics and Environmental Change: A Sediment- Analytical Approach Elsevier, Amsterdam, page 1 - 3, The Egyptian sand sea lies parallel to the Calanshio Sand Sea of Libya, with which it is contiguous in the north. The dunes of the Great Sand Sea cover about 10% of the total area of the Egyptian Western Desert. Siwa is an oasis located in Egypt, about 50 km (30 mi) east of the Libyan border, in the eastern part of the Great Sand Sea or Egyptian Sand Sea. Although well-known to the Tuareg and traders who traveled with caravans across the Sahara, Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs was the first European to document the Great Sand Sea. He began his Saharan expeditions in 1865, and named the great expanse of dunes the Gro√üe Sandmeer, but it was not until 1924 with the maps of Ahmed Hassanein that the full scope of the Great Sand Sea was appreciated by Europeans.

The theatre is owned and operated by Mansfield District Council.  History  left The Palace Electric Theatre opened on Tuesday 13 December 1910. It was the first cinema in the town and only showed silent films at first. In 1949 the cinema was converted to a live theatre, featuring famous names such as Larry Grayson, Steve Lawrence and Hilda Baker. Mansfield District Council bought the theatre for ¬£11,500 in 1953 and have been responsible for it ever since. After commissioning renovation work, the council reopened the theatre as 'Mansfield Civic Hall' with the first performance in the 'new' theatre being \\"School for Spinsters\\" by Chesterfield Repertory Company. In 1963, nearly all of the foyer and fa√ßade were rebuilt to give the theatre a new look. In 1968, a public competition offered a prize to rename the theatre. Many suggestions were made, but it was decided that the 'Civic Theatre' was the most appropriate, although this later changed to the 'Palace Theatre', the building's original name.  The Palace today  As part of a project to make the Palace Theatre a major touring venue for the North of England, the theatre closed for major redevelopments in 1997. During the seven-month period in which it was closed, many areas of the theatre were demolished, with all of the building being completely renovated. The project cost over ¬£2.9 million. As a result of the works, the Palace Theatre has been designated as a regional mid-scale touring venue, meaning that it caters for an audience within a 40-minute drive-time. Along with physical improvements to the theatre, programming of the venue has also been revised to offer a broader range of events suited to its new status. To complement the amateur and professional variety shows performed at the theatre, it now stages a wider range of professional performances including classical music, opera and contemporary dance. = Redevelopment = * The orchestra pit was extended and redesigned to accommodate more musicians and provide improved sound quality, with some acoustic adjustments made to the auditorium * The wings were extended to provide a greater back-stage space - this was essential to the development as it enables the theatre to receive larger scale sets and shows * A high fly tower was built above the stage - this allows traditional backdrops to be used more effectively * The proscenium arch was widened to enhance the greater stage space * New seats were installed, providing greater leg room and comfort and improved access for disabled patrons * The foyer and public spaces were fully refurbished and modernised * A lift and ramp were installed to enable easy access to all areas except the balcony * New spaces were created to facilitate the use of the theatre for corporate entertainment, training and workshops * A computerised box office system was installed * A new, contemporary fa√ßade was built {Stage Foyer Auditorium } External links *Official Website Theatres in Nottinghamshire Buildings and structures in Mansfield ","title":"Palace Theatre, Mansfield"},{"id":"5772469","text":"Isurumuniya is a Buddhist temple situated near to the Tissa Wewa (Tisa tank) in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. There are four carvings of special interest in this Vihara. They are the Isurumuniya Lovers, Elephant Pond and The Royal Family. History This is the place where the mythical Pulasthi Rishi was said to live and the place of which the mythical King Ravana was born. The temple was built by King Devanampiya Tissa (307 BC to 267 BC) who ruled in the ancient Sri Lankan capital of Anuradhapura. After 500 children of high-caste were ordained, Isurumuniya was built for them to reside. King Kasyapa I (473-491 AD) again renovated this viharaya and named it as \\"Boupulvan, Kasubgiri Radmaha Vehera\\". This name is derived from names of his 2 daughters and his name. There is a viharaya connected to a cave and above is a cliff. A small stupa is built on it. It can be seen that the constructional work of this stupa belongs to the present period. Lower down on both sides of a cleft, in a rock that appears to rise out of a pool, have been carved the figures of elephants. On the rock is carved the figure of a horse. The carving of Isurumuniya lovers on the slab has been brought from another place and placed it there. A few yards away from this vihara is the Ranmasu Uyana. Archaeological ruins =Isurumuni Lovers= 6th Century Gupta style carving. The woman, seated on the man's lap, lifts a warning finger, probably as a manifestation of her coyness; but the man carries on regardless. The figures may represent Dutugemunu's son Saliya and the low caste (Sadol Kula) maiden Asokamala whom he loved. It's known that he gave up the throne for her. ‚ÄòSiddha mahayaha kuni ‚Äì maha (la) ka Asala yaha (di) ni‚Äô [Hail!

It was created in 1991 by Austrian company Tridonic and is based on Manchester-coded 8-bit protocol, data rate of 1200 baud, 1 start bit, 8 data bits (dimming value), 4 stop bits, and is the basis of the more sophisticated protocol Digital Addressable Lighting Interface (DALI). The technology uses a single byte to communicate the lighting level (0-255 or 0x00-0xFF). DSI was the first use of digital communication in lighting control, and was the precursor to DALI. Advantages * Its simple nature makes it straightforward to understand, implement, and diagnose, while its low voltage means it typically runs along relatively thin cables. * Because each device has its own wire to the controller (rather than being part of a network) it has no need of an address to be set, so can be replaced simply by unplugging the faulty one and plugging in the new. * It dims to off, so does not require mains switching equipment to turn them off. Disadvantages * It requires one wire per control channel so a sophisticated system could have hundreds of wires, thereby making diagnoses of problems difficult. * It is a proprietary standard initially exclusive to Tridonic and mainly brands of Tridonic's parent company Zumtobel. Rival protocols =0-10V analog= =ACN= ACN is an ANSI standard protocol adopted by the entertainment industry. It is based on Ethernet and is typically used as the backbone communication between controllers and control segments. To date few fixtures offer native ACN interface.

Several companies have adopted the DALI protocol in their product offerings. Even though DALI is an open standard, there are already versions of its implementation emerging in different lighting manufacturers products as they strive to provide a point of difference. DSI is essentially the same technology as DALI in terms of messaging, however, DSI eliminates the individual addressing aspect of each light fitting found in DALI. =DMX= DMX is an ANSI standard protocol adopted by the entertainment industry worldwide which is also being offered on many architectural fixtures.

It is a large scale, aquarium and is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. This means they are a leader in conservation and education, supporting programs for wildlife and having a strong educational component in the forms of summer camps, school trips, etc. The facility is home to more than 7,000 aquatic plants and animals from Florida and all over the world. The facility is located in the Channel District of Downtown Tampa. The Florida Aquarium opened in March 1995 as a privately funded entity and became a public-private partnership when the city of Tampa assumed responsibility for its debt in 1999. On April 18, 2012, the AIA's Florida Chapter placed the Florida Aquarium on its list of Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places. On May 8, 2017, it was announced that the aquarium hired Roger Germann as its new president and CEO. Germann came from the John G. Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, where he was executive vice president for 16 years, and also served on the advisory board of the EPA Great Lakes National Program Office. History Before the Florida Aquarium was constructed in Channelside of Downtown Tampa, it was formally known as the Clearwater Marine Science Center located on Clearwater Beach. It wasn‚Äôt until 1992 that the Tampa City Council accepted the Florida Aquarium‚Äôs proposed plan to begin construction in its new downtown location. The Florida Aquarium was largely constructed using borrowed money amid inflated projections that high attendance and ticket sales would pay off the incurred debt. However, after the aquarium opened in March 1995, the number of visitors and tourists fell well below expectations. The aquarium fell into financial debt. In response to the crisis, the city of Tampa took over The Florida Aquarium's mortgage and debt in 1999. Managers at the institution were forced to lay off or demote roughly one-third of the aquarium's total staff. Though it struggled in its early years, The Florida Aquarium reinvented itself and made entertainment a key aspect of its mission, incorporating fun and exciting ways to instil strong messages about the importance of Florida's natural resources and educating 100,000 school children each year. Inside the atrium of the Florida Aquarium in Tampa, Florida. Jeff Swanagan became CEO of the Florida Aquarium in 1998 and is credited with turning around the troubled institution. Swanagan loosened the aquarium's previous emphasis on science and Florida wildlife. He introduced several new exhibits featuring flora and fauna from other regions of the world to attract new and returning visitors to the aquarium. New exhibitions overseen by Swanagan included the \\"Dragons Down Under\\", which features leafy sea dragons that are native to the waters off Australia; an albino alligator; and an exhibit featuring snakes and bats called \\"Frights of the Forest\\". A sting ray was even nicknamed \\"Roseanne Barb\\" by a marketing department in an attempt to attract attention to the aquarium. Under Swanagan, The Florida Aquarium was able to return to financial stability. The aquarium was able to pay off approximately $3 million in debt by 2002. He was also able to slash the annual subsidy provided to the aquarium from the city of Tampa from $1.1 million to $700,000. The number of visitors to the Florida Aquarium also rose during Swanagan's tenure as CEO. Total yearly attendance rose from 545,000 visitors to a record high of 620,000 in 2002. Jeff Swanagan departed The Florida Aquarium in 2002 to become the first president of Georgia Aquarium. Thom Stork became President and CEO following Swanagan's departure for Georgia and continued the financial successes of his predecessor. In 2005, under Stork, The Florida Aquarium added Explore A Shore, a 2-acre outdoor, water adventure play area for children adjacent to the Caribbean Cantina. Average time spent at the aquarium doubled and response to the new water adventure zone was excellent. In the fall of 2008, The Florida Aquarium took one of its four galleries, Sea Hunt, and transformed the subdued gallery into the vibrant and interactive, Ocean Commotion gallery. Ocean Commotion brought high technology into an Aquarium for the first time, using \\"smart wi-fi' that was location-aware to transmit additional content and information directly to a guest's smartphone. In 2011, The Florida Aquarium added large sand tiger sharks to its signature exhibit, the Coral Reef, which holds 500,000 gallons of natural saltwater (delivered by barge 4 times a year) and moved their popular Dive with the Sharks program from Shark Bay to the Coral Reef with the new sand tiger sharks. Following 11 consecutive years of financial stability and operating in the black, the aquarium plans expansions over several phases for the future. The expansion includes new, state-of-the- art classrooms, changing exhibit space, an off-site rehabilitation and research facility and an exciting event center for hosting conventions, seminars, weddings and other special events. While The Florida Aquarium is best known as a world-class attraction in downtown Tampa, Florida, the aquarium is also an established education resource having had its 1-Millionth student in 2011 and a research and conservation facility with current projects on coral propagation, underwater archaeology and sea turtle rescue and rehabilitation. A new gallon exhibit named \\"Heart of the sea\\" will open during fall 2018, introducing animals such as southern stingrays, Atlantic goliath groupers, tarpon, bonnethead sharks and Kemp's ridley sea turtles to the aquarium's collections. For the first time, the habitat will feature television cameras in the water, so that visitors can see the sea life from unique perspectives. Aquarium fish Exhibits The Florida Aquarium's exhibits are laid out to show the journey of a drop of water from one of Florida's many fresh-water springs out to the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Exhibits include a large simulated wetlands exhibit located under a tall glass atrium, a simulated beach, and a coral reef community housed in a tank. The newest section is Waves of Wonder and Heart of the Seas gallery, which replaced the OceanCommotion section. Coral Reef Research The world has lost 25% of its coral over the past 30 years. Over 250 years, the state of Florida has seen 50% of its coral disappear, due to pollution, human contact, bleachings, and now an idiopathic disease that is killing the U.S.'s only inshore reef tract. To fight this loss, and attempt to save the coral ‚Äì of extreme importance to the well-being of the state - the Florida Aquarium has joined a consortium led by the University of Miami, including NOVA Southeastern University, coral conservation organization SECORE International, and the Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum. The goal is to restore 125 acres of coral reef by planting 150,000 coral colonies, including five species of coral, by 2022. Education The mission statement of the Florida Aquarium is to \\"entertain, educate and inspire stewardship of the natural environment.\\". One way they accomplish this is through their educational programming. Several times a year adults can attend Evening Tide Talks, which are lectures given by renowned scientists, photographers, explorers, and researchers. Complimentary food, beer, and wine are provided for attendees. =Teachers and Schools= The Aquarium offers field trips, traveling programs, and teacher workshops. Teachers are able to attend the aquarium for free in order to prepare for a field trip. The Aquarium also provides teaching materials that are designed to meet specific Sunshine State Standards/ FCAT Benchmarks. These materials were developed for grades Pre-K through 8 and consist of pre and post lessons, scavenger hunts, and lab programs. =Youth and Families= Kids and families can enjoy birthday parties, sleepovers, Scout programs, homeschool programs, and Aquatots. Aquatots is a program built for children 3‚Äì5 years old that they attend with a parent or guardian. It is \\"designed to encourage interaction with parent and child through story time, craft making, activity center play and touring the aquarium\\". =Camps= The Aquarium offers both School Year Camps and Summer Camps. School Year Camps coincide with holidays that take place in Hillsborough County during the school year. Children grades K-5 can enjoy activities such as science experiments, aquarium hikes, crafts, and animal encounters. Summer Camps, referred to as Aqua Camps, are available for people ages 3‚Äì18. They are centered around animals and their natural environments and include plenty of animal encounters and hands-on learning.

The fragment was given the title of The Watsons and published in 1871 by the novelist's nephew, James Edward Austen-Leigh (1798‚Äì1874), in the revised and augmented edition of his A Memoir of Jane Austen. The original manuscript of the novel covered eighty pages, currently divided between the Morgan Library & Museum, New York, and the Bodleian Library, Oxford. On Jane Austen's death it was left to her sister Cassandra and then passed to other family relations until it was divided up in 1915. The smaller part was later acquired by the Morgan Library in 1925 and the remaining larger portion went through various hands until it was bought by the Bodleian in 2011. There are erasures and corrections to the manuscript and in three cases there were substantial revisions written on small pieces of paper and pinned in place over the cancelled portions.\\"Jane Austen‚Äôs Fictional Manuscripts\\", The Watsons The description of the ball in Jane Austen's manuscript The novel's timeframe covers about a fortnight and serves to introduce the main characters. Mr. Watson is a widowed and ailing clergyman with two sons and four daughters. The youngest daughter, Emma, the heroine of the story, has been brought up by a wealthy aunt and is consequently better educated and more refined than her sisters. But after her aunt contracted a foolish second marriage, Emma is obliged to return to her father's house. There she is chagrined by the crude and reckless husband- hunting of two of her sisters, Penelope and Margaret. One particular focus for them was Tom Musgrave, who had paid attention to all of the sisters in the past. This Emma learns from her more responsible and kindly eldest sister Elizabeth. Living near the Watsons are the Osbornes, a great titled family, Emma attracts some notice from the young and awkward Lord Osborne while attending a ball in the nearby town. An act of kindness on her part also acquaints her with Mrs Blake, who introduces Emma to her brother, Mr Howard, vicar to the parish church near Osborne Castle. A few days later Margaret returns home, having been away on a protracted visit to her brother Robert in Croydon. With her come her brother and his overbearing and snobbish wife. When they leave, Emma declines an invitation to accompany them back. Here the story broke off, but Edward Austen-Leigh's Memoir gave a hint of how it was to continue: > When the author's sister, Cassandra, showed the manuscript of this work to > some of her nieces, she also told them something of the intended story; for > with this dear sister - though, I believe, with no one else - Jane seems to > have talked freely of any work that she might have in hand. Mr. Watson was > soon to die; and Emma to become dependent for a home on her narrow-minded > sister-in-law and brother. She was to decline an offer of marriage from Lord > Osborne, and much of the interest of the tale was to arise from [the > dowager] Lady Osborne's love for Mr. Howard, and his counter affection for > Emma, whom he was finally to marry.Deirdre Le Faye, William Austen-Leigh, > Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh, Jane Austen: A Family Record, Cambridge > University 2004, p. 241. In a talk at the Bodleian following the acquisition of its part of the manuscript, Professor Kathryn Sutherland described the novel as being about one sixth of the length of Austen's published novels and as marking a turning point in her writing. Here she leaves behind her parodies of earlier authors for a more naturalistic plot. \\"The Watsons is an experiment in turning fiction into life and life into fiction\\" and a \\"repository of classic Austen ingredients\\". The latter includes particularly the theme of being an outsider within the family and the consequent search for belonging. The talk also raised the possibility that Austen's fragment might really have been meant as a novella.Kathryn Sutherland, \\"The Watsons: Jane Austen Practising\\", a talk at the Bodleian on 8 June 2012 That final point takes up an earlier claim that the work was nearer completion than assumed in that it \\"comprises the complete history of the heroine's movement from a position of social exclusion to one of inclusion\\".Kathleen James-Cavan, \\"Closure and Disclosure: The significance of conversation in Jane Austen's The Watsons, Studies in the Novel Vol. 29.4, Johns Hopkins University 1997, , pp. 437‚Äì452. Such an argument, however, was merely one more addition to the many theories why Jane Austen had never completed the fragment. An earlier article by Joseph Wiesenfarth disagreed with the speculation that the novel was unfinished because of the unhappy associations for the author of the time it was written and that it covered a theme too close to her own circumstances. And in reviewing the theory that the plot had been rewritten as Emma, Wiesenfarth advanced the counter-argument that The Watsons was \\"a pre-text ‚Äì a text that comes before other texts\\". Situations first foreshadowed there were eventually reworked with more skill in novels that Austen had already begun, such as Pride and Prejudice, or would write later, so that \\"it would be redundant to use them again in a completed version\\" of The Watsons.Joseph Wiesenfarth, \\"The Watsons as Pretext\\", Journal of the Jane Austen Society of North America, Persuasions 8, 1986, pp. 101‚Äì111 Continuations Dissatisfaction that the fragment's promising beginning was not brought to fulfilment eventually resulted in attempts to finish the novel. Some of the earliest of these were authored by descendants of the Austen family itself. In 1850, Jane's niece Catherine Hubback adapted the plot into a three-volume novel under the title The Younger Sister. The initial chapters were based on Jane's fragmentary story, which was known to family members but had still not been published at the time. The writing, however, was not word for word from the manuscript and in the development of the story some names were changed and new characters and episodes introduced, as well as long moralising passages and a good deal of descriptive detail. The continuation is recognisably Victorian in its themes and attitudes to social class.Cheryl A. Wilson, Jane Austen and the Victorian Heroine, Palgrave Macmillan, 2017, ch.3, \\"Updating Austen, Catherine Hubback and Emily Eden\\"Tamara S. Wagner, \\"These were the days . . .\\": Victorian Themes in Hubback's Continuation of Jane Austen's The Watsons, Victorian web Possibly the new focus on the economics of the penniless heroine's situation could not have been adequately treated until this later date. In the opinion of Jane Austen's great-nephew, William Austen- Leigh (1843 -1921), his aunt may have become aware of the difficulty \\"of having placed her heroine too low, in a position of poverty and obscurity‚Ä¶and therefore, like a singer who has begun on too low a note, she discontinued the strain.\\"William Austen-Leigh, Jane Austen - Her Life and Letters - A Family Record, Read Books Ltd, 2012 Mrs Hubback's novel differs importantly from later continuations of The Watsons, in that it was not presented as a continuation when it appeared in 1850. That fact would not become apparent until Jane Austen's earlier fragment was first published in 1871, although Mrs Hubback's relationship with her is made clear by the dedication at the start: \\"To the memory of her aunt, the late Jane Austen, this work is affectionately inscribed by the authoress who, though too young to have known her personally, was from childhood taught to esteem her virtues, and admire her talents.\\" Moreover, it is not until the opening paragraphs of Chapter 2, following a digression on the style of ball-dresses over the centuries, that Mrs Hubback announces the period in which her novel is set. It is \\"sixty years ago\\", at which time \\"the liveliest fancy would have never pictured an English ball such as we now see it.\\".Chapter 2, third paragraph With these clues, the reader is guided to expect a pastiche of an Austen novel, a Regency era situation described from the point of view of mid-Victorian times. No more continuations of The Watsons appeared until some fifty years after Austen-Leigh had published Jane Austen's manuscript. Then came The Watsons - A Fragment by Jane Austen & Concluded by L. Oulton, published in 1923 and prefaced by Austen- Leigh's original introduction of 1871, as if to give it authenticity.Hutchinsons 1923 The American edition went further in suggesting that the continuation had family sanction by claiming that Miss Oulton \\"has carried out her task so successfully that the reader will share with the members of the Austen family, to whom she showed her work, an inability to recognize the place where she took up the story from her distinguished predecessor\\".From the cover of the American edition, D. Appleton & Co., New York A contemporary reviewer for The Spectator certainly noticed, however, commenting that \\"soon after she has taken up the tale, we become aware that all the rich reality has faded out of it and from being, as it were, a perfect little Dresden group, it has shrunk to a two-dimensional drawing\\", for all that the author \\"is often successful in hitting off Miss Austen's style and intonation\\".Spectator Archive, 3 March 1923, Page 17 Another family response followed five years later with the publication of The Watsons, by Jane Austen. Completed in accordance with her intentions by Edith, the granddaughter of Catherine Hubback, and her husband Francis Brown.E. Matthews & Marrot, London 1928, details on World Cat. The aim, according to the book's introduction, had been to \\"disentangle Jane's story from that of her niece\\", although a dependence on The Younger Sister remained.Deborah Yaffe, The Watsons in Winter, 16 January 2014 Mrs Hubback's novel was quarried yet again in 1977 by David Hopkinson (1914-2002), the husband of Diana Hubback - a niece of Edith Brown.Tamara Wagner, \\"Rewriting Sentimental Plots: Sequels to Novels of Sensibility by Jane Austen and Another Lady\\", in On Second Thought: Updating the Eighteenth-century Text, University of Delaware Press, 2007, p.219 This relationship was coyly concealed on publication under the title The Watsons by Jane Austen and Another. A postscript surveyed the history of the family continuations and criticised the Brown version which \\"so greatly compressed the plot's development that it did less than justice to Jane's own work when all it yielded was so perfunctory a conclusion\\".Corgi reprint, 1968, pp.230-5 Nevertheless, believing that Catherine Hubback had absorbed from family members \\"an accurate picture of the author's intentions\\", he too kept his version close to Catherine's original wording and incorporated all of Jane Austen's fragment at its start. What are curtailed are all the digressions that Mrs Hubback had added to give her novel context and the subplots that maintained its momentum. A further continuation came from John Coates (1912‚Äì63), a writer with no family connection but who had earlier written a time-travel novel, Here Today (1949), featuring a man who claimed to have wooed Jane Austen.Encyclopedia of Science Fiction His The Watsons: Jane Austen's fragment continued and completed appeared from British and American publishers in 1958.Methuen, London; Crowell, New York; Westport : Greenwood Press 1973; WorldCat In his postscript (pages 314-18) he admitted to having rewritten the original fragment in order to develop the characters differently, including renaming Emma Watson as Emily. He also pointed out that the tempo of Jane Austen's contribution had been \\"leisurely‚Ä¶It is the start of a long book, not of a short one. Yet it comprises a half of [Ms] Oulton's book and almost half of the Browns' book.\\" In his own book that proportion is reduced to less than a quarter of the total length. As a result of giving himself this extra leg-room, his version of the story has been judged \\"more successful in capturing the feel of early 19th-century society than many of the other sequels, but [is] probably much lighter and cheerier than Austen had originally intended the book to turn out\\".Bibliography of Jane Austen Sequels Since then, as part of the burgeoning new genre of \\"Austenesque fiction\\",Laurel Ann Natress, \\"An Introduction to Jane Austen Sequels\\", AustenProse 2012 Joan Aiken has written sequels to several Jane Austen novels, among them her Emma Watson: The Watsons Completed (1996).Victor Gollancz, London; St Martin's Press, New York, 1996; ; reprinted by Bello in 2018, New continuations also include The Watsons by Merryn Williams in 2005;Pen Press Publishers the self-published The Watsons, by Jane Austen and Another Lady by Helen Baker in 2008;Amazon, ASIN B002ACZTWA the religiously-themed The Watsons Revisited by Eucharista Ward in 2012;Outskirts Press and The Watsons by Jane Austen, completed by Jennifer Ready Bettiol of the Jane Austen Society of North America in 2012.Kindle Direct Publishing ASIN B009O5IYP0 In 2020, Irish author Rose Servitova won the Bronze prize in the Self-Publishing Review Book Awards for her book, The Completing of The Watsons, which she wrote after attending The Jane Austen FestivalThe Jane Austen Festival Bath Website in Bath, England.

It was directed by Robert Scheerer and premiered December 2, 1977 on ABC. Plot During construction at the old, hard-pressed Lakewood Hotel, two workers stumble upon a swarm of ants in a closed section of the building. After discovering the unusually aggressive and dangerous ants, the workers attempt to get the warning out, but they are accidentally buried alive. Shortly after, the unscrupulous real estate magnate Anthony Fleming (Gerald Gordon) and his partner and mistress Gloria (Suzanne Somers) arrive at the hotel, there to haggle with the elderly proprietor, Ethel Adams (Myrna Loy), and her daughter Valerie (Lynda Day George) as they pursue plans to convert Lakewood into a casino. In the meantime, foreman Mike Carr (Robert Foxworth), who is in a relationship with Valerie, and his co-worker and friend Vince (Bernie Casey) find the two missing men, but dead from poisoning. The ants begin to emerge, attacking a boy, then killing a hotel cook. They nearly kill Vince as he and Mike investigate the pit in which their men were buried. Peggy Kenter (Anita Gillette), a Board of Health (BOH) inspector and an acquaintance of Carr's, decides to quarantine the hotel, thinking a virus is at work. But Mike soon discovers that there is an immense ant nest in the pit, and concludes that these insects are responsible for the attacks. Tom (Bruce French), a BOH researcher, finally discovers that the ants are highly poisonous and resistant to insecticides. By that time, the ants are swarming the hotel by the millions, killing Gloria and Peggy's assistant White (Steve Franken) and driving Carr, Valerie, Ethel, Fleming, hotel employee Richard (Barry Van Dyke) and his girlfriend Linda (Karen Lamm) upstairs. Vince alerts the authorities, who attempt to contain the ants with a trench - filled first with water, then with burning gasoline after Tom points out that army ants cross streams on bridges built from ant corpses - and rescue most of the trapped people inside the hotel. Carr, Valerie and Fleming, the only people remaining, are eventually cornered by the ants; Tom tells them not to move, in order to give the ants no reason to attack them. As the ants begin crawling all over them, Fleming launches himself from the room's balcony into the swimming pool below, in a desperate attempt to escape, and dies in the fall. Shortly afterwards, two suited-up rescuers arrive and take Carr and Valerie to safety. When they are taken away by the ambulance, Tom assures Carr that such a case will not likely be recurring, as the unique environmental conditions at the hotel estate were vital for the existence of the ants' nest.

The Stupa was identified to have been built to mark the site of cremation of King Dutugamunu (161 BC ‚Äì 137 BC). The structure was identified in 1946 as Dakkhina Stupa by the eminent archaeologist Senarath Paranavithana. This structure was for centuries locally known as the tomb stone of king Ellalan, known as Elara Sohona, which was worshipped by Tamils and Sinhalese.  History  According to the legends this site was known as the Pulila terrace as there was a growing Pulila tree at that time period and the thero, Mihindu had requested from the King Devanampiya Tissa (307 BC ‚Äì 267 BC) to cremate his remains here. The legend further states that the remains of King Dutugamunu were also cremated in this terrace. It is said that this Stupa was constructed and named as Dhakkina thupa by a minister during the reign of King Valagamba (103 BCE and c. 89‚Äì77 BCE). The structure was popularly known as Elara Sohona, the tomb of 2nd century BCE king Chola Tamil king Ellalan (c. 205 ‚Äì c. 161 BC), who invaded Sri Lanka and ruled the Anuradhapura Kingdom for over 40 years. It was popularly believed that King Dutugemunu had built this for King Ellalan, after defeating him in battle. But in the mid-19th centuries James Fergusson a Scottish architect and writer who studied History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, had mentioned (1876) this structure could not be the Elara's tomb.

He had been arrested in January 1781 on suspicion of being a spy, and held for six months in the Tower of London. At an Old Bailey trial on 23 July he was found guilty of running an operation which sent secret naval intelligence to France‚Äîa country which supported the rebellious American colonists, and with which Great Britain had been at war since 1778. Specifically, the intelligence concerned British fleet dispositions at Portsmouth and other British ports. In July 1781 the War of American Independence was not over (though it would be within a few months) and the navies of Great Britain and France were still fighting each other not only in the North Atlantic but as far afield as the Indian Ocean. What sealed de la Motte's fate was the damning testimony of a former accomplice, Henry Lutterloh, who was the chief prosecution witness. Having been found guilty by the jury, the terrible sentence pronounced by the judge was that the prisoner be hanged, drawn and quartered. In fact de la Motte was spared some of the gruesome refinements ‚Äî after hanging for nearly an hour, he was taken down and his heart cut out and burned, but he was not quartered, nor subjected to the refinements visited on David Tyrie, a Scottish spy, the following year.

He was hanged for 22 minutes, following which he was beheaded and his heart cut out and burned. He was then emasculated, quartered, and his body parts put into a coffin and buried in the pebbles at the seaside.Hampshire Chronicle, Monday 2 September 1782. Transcript available online: see Some Selected Reports from the Hampshire Chronicle) Public executions were considered a spectator sport in the eighteenth century, and when individuals of high rank were involved the attraction was irresistible. It was not just the lower orders who turned up to witness these occasions (see the diaries of George Selwyn). A crowd of more than 80,000 people witnessed de la Motte's execution at Tyburn. On this occasion people from all walks of life turned up to witness the edifying prospect of a handsome gentleman of rank, elegantly dressed, and in the prime of life, being ceremoniously butchered in public ‚Äî \\"pour d√©courager les autres\\", French for \\"to discourage others\\".  De la Motte in English Literature  De la Motte's life and execution resonated in the imagination of writers like Charles Dickens and W. M. Thackeray. The drama and language of the trial scene of Charles Darnay in A Tale of Two Cities is very close to that of de la Motte's trial, with Dickens emphasising the grotesqueness and the gruesomeness of the proceedings in his inimitable manner.An article on this topic (by Harvey Peter Sucksmith and Paul Davies) was published in The Dickensian magazine (Spring 2004, No 462 vol.100 Part 1 ). As for Thackeray, in his last, unfinished novel, Denis Duval we find de la Motte and his sometime accomplice, Henry Lutterloh, figuring there as leading characters. Thackeray portrays de la Motte as a tortured, demonic figure, which is not at all how he comes across in contemporary reports in the press. Still less is that the impression conveyed in a sympathetic memoirM. d'Auberade, The Authentic Memoirs of Francis Henry De la Motte published by a French writer some time between the trial verdict and the execution ‚Äî in the hope (perhaps) of mitigating the severity of the sentence.

The generally accepted theory is that the lighter birds represent immatures, and certainly only such specimens have been described as young birds (the Hanover specimen is labeled as \\"juvenile\\"), but since the exact collection localities are not known with sufficient detail, only DNA analysis could resolve this question, particularly since the recovered bone material can also be expected to yield analyzable DNA fragments. At any rate, both light and dark birds are today treated as a single species, with five of the junior synonyms referring to the dark form. However, Rallus obscurus is something of a mystery as it is generally assumed that at the time of Gmelin's writing, the species was only known from light birds (which were described as sandwichensis on the preceding page of Gmelin's work), but he seems to have seen a specimen of his obscurus at the Leverian Museum. =Etymology= The native name for the bird was moho, said to refer to a small \\"bird that crows in the grass\\". The name iao or iao was claimed to refer to a moho-like but smaller bird; it is not clear whether this bird was the distinctive lighter form or the extinct unnamed small rail (see below). The bird is referenced in the old Hawaiian proverb Aohe mea nƒÅna e hoopuhili, he moho no ka lƒÅ makani which means roughly \\"nothing can blow him off course, he is like a moho in the wind\\"; it was used to indicate admiration for an undaunted or determined person (as the bird was unable to fly, it was not affected by the wind). This is not to be confused with the taxonomical name Moho, which are the ≈ç≈ç; also from Hawaii, also extinct, but completely unrelated birds. Description Specimen painted by William Ellis while accompanying Captain James Cook on his third voyage (1776‚Äì78) The first collections were of individuals of the lighter form, of which today 5 specimens seem to exist: in the Naturalis in Leiden (one: RMNH 87450), in the American Museum of Natural History and New York City (1)). Of the dark form, several additional individuals are present in collections in Cambridge (Museum of Natural History, 1), London (Natural History Museum, 1), Vienna, New York City (1) and Honolulu (Bishop Museum, 2). One 1778 painting by William Ellis (plate 70) depicts a light bird, possibly the Leiden specimen (which was apparently collected in late January/early February, 1779), and in more recent times, subfossil bones have also been recovered. Habitat Turnaround video of specimen RMNH 87450 at Naturalis Biodiversity Center It was a flightless bird that was apparently found in shrubland and secondary growth on abandoned fields and in times of danger had the habit of hiding in Polynesian rat burrows. Specimens are known or assumed to be from an area which roughly corresponds to the middle elevations of today's Puna district around the present settlement of Mountain View, below the primary rainforest. Extinction Specimens of the light form were collected in 1778 on the third Cook expedition; the dark form was supposedly not found at that time (but see above). Apparently, all or at least most specimens of the latter were procured over a short period around 1860 by James D. Mills, the last one in 1864. The last reliable sight record was in 1884, with a doubtful one in 1893; a dedicated search in 1887 failed to find the bird, but as it was rather cryptic, this cannot be taken as unequivocal proof that it was completely extinct by then. As neither the small Asian mongoose nor mosquitoes (which transmit fowlpox and avian malaria, both exceptionally lethal to Hawaiian endemic birds) were present on Big Island until 1883 and the 1890s, respectively, this species' extinction was probably caused by introduced European rats, cats and possibly dogs. Hunting, sometimes assumed to have played a major part, probably was not significant as the bird was protected by a kapu which prohibited hunting except by alii until 1819 . After that, the few specimens that were collected suggest it was not extensively hunted even after the kapu were abolished.

Whether the Buddha's Enlightenment was the experience technically called samadhi, or some other phenomenon, may depend upon the philosophical allegiance of the believer. In the Dhyana Mudra the Buddha sits cross-legged with his upturned palms placed one over the other on his lap. This position is universally known throughout the Buddhist world, and this statue is therefore one of the most typical pieces of Buddhist sculpture. It is not to be confused with the very similar \\"Earth-Touching Mudra,\\" which depicts the simple action the Buddha took to fend off the illusions projected by Mara, who was desperate to prevent the Buddha from realizing that his, Mara's, projections, and with them the entire world, are an illusion.

Carved out of granite, it is one of the best-preserved sculptures from Sri Lanka and is similar to the Samadhi statue of Anuradhapura. Some features of the statue indicate that it may have been influenced by the Mathura School. The statue is now kept at the National Museum of Colombo. Appearance and characteristics The Toluvila Buddha statue is considered to be a masterpiece, and is one of the best examples of the ancient Sri Lankan sculpting art, along with the Samadhi statue in Anuradhapura. The Toluvila statue is also one of the best- preserved images of the Buddha that has been found in Sri Lanka. It is carved out of a single block of granite, and bears a close resemblance to the Samadhi statue, although slightly smaller. The Toluvila statue is in height. It shows the Buddha seated with his legs crossed and hands together in meditation, depicting the dhyana mudra. The seating style is known as weerasana. The distance between the shoulders is , while the knees are apart. While many other Buddha statues from the same period have long, hanging earlobes, the Toluvila statue lacks this feature. Another unusual feature is three lines that have been carved into the front of the neck that are believed to have been influenced by the Mathura School of India. It is possible that seated Buddha images, such as the one found at the Wat Phra Borom That temple in Chaiya, Thailand, may have been influenced to some extent by statues of the Anuradhapura period like the Toluvila statue. History Historians believe that it dates back to the latter part of the Anuradhapura period, specifically the 4th or 5th century. It was found in 1900 during archaeological excavations conducted in the village of Toluvila in Anuradhapura by archaeologist Harry Charles Purvis Bell. According to him, it was the best historical artifact found in Anuradhapura. The statue was later taken to the National Museum of Colombo, where it is kept to this day. The museum identifies it as the \\"most significant\\" sculpture of ancient Sri Lanka that it possesses, and it is displayed directly in front of the main entrance to the building.

The society's official mandate was to advance the careers and interests of native-born and other long-time residents. Newfoundlanders, regardless of gender, ethnic origin, religious affiliation or social standing were welcomed as members. This marked the arrival of a new phenomenon, Newfoundland nationalism. Natives' Society branches existed in St. John's, Harbour Grace and Carbonear as well, it is thought, in other communities. In St. John's, the Natives' Society was formed by Richard Barnes in 1840 and elected its first president, Dr. Edward Kielly, on June 15, 1840.Carolyn Lambert, Emblem of our Country, Newfoundland and Labrador Studies, Volume 23, Number 1, 2008.Paul O'Neill (2003) The Oldest City, The Story of St. John's, Newfoundland (p. 515) The cornerstone of the society‚Äôs hall, located at Bannerman Park, was laid by Civil Governor of Newfoundland Sir John Harvey on May 24, 1845. The completed hall fell in a windstorm on September 19, 1846, killing two people. The society had a distinctive elaborate banner with red, white and green being prominent colours. For ease of manufacture a tricolour flag was adopted. This flag consisted of three equal width vertical panels of red (at the hoist), white (in the centre) and green (on the fly) in proportion 1:2. This flag became known as the \\"Native Flag\\". Red and white could be seen as representing the Tudor rose, the floral emblem of England. White was for the white saltire on the Scottish flag and the white down of the thistle, as well as the white fleur de lis of France, the predominantly white royal flag of France and the white centre in the French tricolour. Green was for the shamrock of Ireland while green and white could be seen as depicting the leek of Wales. Thus the majority European resident groups were represented. These and all others, especially indigenous people, could be seen as being represented by the pitcher plant in the colours red and green. The pitcher plant had been chosen by Queen Victoria as a national symbol to appear on Newfoundland coins. White could also be seen as depicting ice and snow as well as peace among the people of various ancestries. Green could also represent the various and numerous pine trees. Other Natives' Society branches, notably in Carbonear and Harbour Grace, adopted this same red, white and green flag, thus establishing it as the first widely recognized unique but unofficial flag of Newfoundland (Island and Labrador). It was commonly called \\"the native flag\\". With the introduction of Responsible Government in 1855 need for the Society lessened and it ceased functioning in 1866. The NNS had worked for the establishment of responsible Government. In 1871, the Roman Catholic Church established a fishermen's aid and benefit organization, the Newfoundland Fishermen's Star of the Sea Association. Its official banner was a green background with a central white star with a pink cross in it.. The green was probably for the cold North Atlantic Ocean or pine trees or the shamrock of Ireland since the vast majority of Newfoundland Catholics at the time were of Irish ancestry. The star was for Polaris, the North Star which was very important in navigation. Also in the Roman Catholic Church the Virgin Mary is known as the Star of the Sea (Stella Maris in Latin). The Christian cross indicated the organization's church connection and the colour pink was a liturgical colour for a joyous celebration in the Anglican, Methodist, Roman Catholic, Lutheran many other Christian denominations. This banner gave rise to what was commonly-named \\"the pink, white and green\\" tricolour flag which became the unofficial flag of association. With green at the hoist, white in the centre and pink on the fly it should have been called \\"the green, white and pink\\". With the demise of the Natives' Society it was often mistakenly referred to as \\"the Native Flag\\" by the public and even newspaper reporters. This green-white-pink tricolour which started with the Newfoundland Fishermen's Star of the Sea Association has survived and become known as the Newfoundland tricolour flag. The green, white and pink flag is quite distinctive since so very few flags show any pink and even fewer show as much as a third of the flag. One notable exception is the flag of the State of Espirito Santo (Holy Spirit) in Brazil which is also one third pink. The older red, white and green \\"Native Flag\\" of the Newfoundland Natives' Society's has been forgotten even though it served as the first unofficial flag the Colony of Newfoundland (Island and Labrador) for many years in the 19th century.

The route extends for from NY 17 in Hillburn to U.S. Route 9W (US 9W) in Nyack. In Suffern, it has a concurrency with US 202 for . NY 59 runs parallel to the New York State Thruway its entire route. The routing of NY 59 became a state highway in 1911 and was signed as NY 59 in the late 1920s. When NY 59 was first assigned, it began at NY 17 in Suffern. A western bypass of Suffern was designated as New York State Route 339 ; however, it became part of a realigned NY 17 in the mid-1930s. NY 339 was reassigned to NY 17's former routing between Hillburn and Suffern, but it was replaced again by an extended NY 59\\\\. In the 1960s, proposals surfaced for the Spring Valley Bypass, a highway that would utilize the NY 59 corridor between NY 306 in Monsey and NY 45 in Spring Valley. The proposed highway was never built. Route description NY 304 NY 59 begins at an intersection with NY 17 in Hillburn, just south of the village of Sloatsburg in southern Rockland County. It heads to the southeast as the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, crossing over the Ramapo River and the Metro-North Railroad's Port Jervis Line before following both into Suffern. The river leaves NY 59 just inside the village line; however, the railroad continues to run alongside NY 59 into the center of Suffern, where both pass under the New York State Thruway near where Interstate 87 (I-87) connects to I-287. Just south of the I-87 overpass, NY 59 meets US 202 at Wayne Avenue. US 202 joins NY 59 for a one block wrong way concurrency along Orange Avenue‚Äîas NY 59 eastbound is paired with US 202 westbound and vice versa‚Äîduring which time both routes cross a Norfolk Southern Railway line at-grade. At the end of the overlap, US 202 continues south along Orange Avenue to the New Jersey state line while NY 59 forks eastward toward central Rockland County. As NY 59 leaves Suffern and enters Airmont, it passes Good Samaritan Hospital, a major hospital in Rockland County. While in Airmont, NY 59 intersects County Route 89 (CR 89) and CR 85\\\\. After leaving Airmont, NY 59 proceeds east through Monsey, where it intersects the southern terminus of NY 306. NY 59's brief wrong-way concurrency with US 202 in Suffern. As NY 59 passes Spring Valley High School, it enters the village limits of Spring Valley. While in Spring Valley, NY 59 has an overlap with CR 35A for about a tenth of a mile and meets the Thruway at exit 14, with a pair of park and ride lots located at the interchange. The route continues eastward into Nanuet, where NY 59 passes through a heavy commercialized area, crossing under NJ Transit/Metro-North Railroad's Pascack Valley Line. Before its busy intersection with CR 33, NY 59 passes The Shops at Nanuet to its south and the Rockland Plaza to its north. Upon entering West Nyack, NY 59 intersects the Palisades Interstate Parkway (exit 8) and NY 304\\\\. The route proceeds onward, passing Palisades Center, one of the largest shopping malls in the country. Immediately after passing the Palisades Center, NY 59 briefly enters Central Nyack. Here it connects to NY 303 by way of an interchange. Before hitting the Nyack village line, NY 59 has its final interchange with the Thruway. The southbound entrance to the Tappan Zee Bridge is via Mountainview Avenue, and the northbound entrance is via Polhemus Street. At the Nyack line, NY 59 becomes known as Main Street. As Main Street, NY 59 runs under the Thruway one final time before the Thruway heads over the bridge. The route continues toward downtown Nyack; however, it ends at an intersection with US 9W before it reaches the central district. Main Street continues for several blocks into downtown Nyack. History =Origins= NY 59 originated as the Nyack Turnpike, which was the first major thoroughfare in Rockland County. A petition was filed in 1813 to construct the turnpike. Legislation stemming from the petition was passed on April 17, 1816, allowing construction to begin. The Nyack Turnpike was completed from Suffern to Nyack in the 1830s, despite many years of local opposition to the highway. Its charter was renewed multiple times throughout the 19th century, and it was designated as a toll road to help pay for its upkeep. In 1894, the turnpike was absorbed into the Rockland County road system. The bridge carrying NY 59 over the Norfolk Southern Railway near its western terminus in Hillburn on a snowy day. The turnpike was turned over from the county to the state of New York on July 14, 1911, and added to the state highway system as part of Route 39-b, an unsigned legislative route extending from Nyack (at Broadway) to Harriman via modern NY 59 and NY 17. The Route 39-b designation was eliminated on March 1, 1921, as part of a partial renumbering of New York's legislative route system. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the portion of former Route 39-b between Suffern and Harriman became part of NY 17\\\\. The remainder of the route from Nyack to Suffern was not given a number. =Designation= The Suffern‚ÄìNyack highway remained unnumbered until the late 1920s when was designated as NY 59\\\\. At the time, NY 59 was routed on West Nyack Road between Nanuet and Central Nyack. The route was rendered unchanged in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. A western bypass of Suffern was designated as NY 339 . The north‚Äìsouth highway left NY 17 at the hamlet of Ramapo and followed the modern New York State Thruway and I-287 corridors south through Hillburn to the New Jersey state line. In the mid-1930s, the alignments of NY 17 and NY 339 south of Ramapo were swapped, placing NY 17 on the bypass and NY 339 on the Ramapo‚ÄìSuffern route. In Suffern, NY 339 ended at a junction with US 202 just one block north of NY 59's western terminus. NY 339 was replaced by an extended NY 59 . In the early 1950s, construction began on a bypass of West Nyack Road between Nanuet and West Nyack. The highway was completed and became part of a realigned NY 59\\\\. The portion of NY 59's former routing that did not overlap NY 304 was redesignated as NY 59A in February 1956. This designation was short-lived as it was removed from West Nyack Road in the late 1950s. In 1960, control of the highway was turned over to the town of Clarkstown, and parts of NY 59A's former routing were abandoned. A local company carried out work to convert the highway into a shopping center access road; however, Rockland County asserted that the town‚Äîand by extension the company‚Äîhad no rights to perform this action. The county sued the company that helped improve the highway in 2002. =Traffic problems= In 1958, Ramapo town engineer Edwin Wallace noticed an increase in the amount of traffic passing through the village of Spring Valley, which had become the largest village in Rockland County by this time. This led Wallace to propose a bypass of NY 59 in Monsey and NY 45 in Hillcrest. Rockland County approved the proposed bypass two years later. In 1966, the Tri-State Transportation Commission released its long-term highway report for the area. The new study replaced the Spring Valley Bypass with the NY 45 expressway, a north-south bypass of Spring Valley connecting the Garden State Parkway to the Palisades Interstate Parkway. The road would serve a steadily growing area of commercial businesses along the NY 45 corridor. No action was taken on this proposal. With the Spring Valley Bypass plan shelved, traffic continued to pour through the Spring Valley‚ÄìNanuet area. In 1987, a task force was introduced to come up with a plan to solve this issue. Traffic became even worse when the Nanuet Mall expanded in 1994. NYSDOT tried to fix the worsening situation in 1995 when they reconstructed almost of NY 59 from the eastern border of Spring Valley to exit 8 of the Palisades Interstate Parkway. The project widened the road to six lanes, helping to move traffic through the area from Grandview to Middletown Roads in Nanuet. In 1997, the New York State Thruway Authority dropped the Spring Valley toll on the Thruway for all motorists except truckers. This helped reduce traffic on NY 59 between exits 14A and 14B. Shortly after the traffic problems in Nanuet were reduced, the focus was shifted to West Nyack where Palisades Center was being constructed. First proposed in the late 1980s, construction finally started in 1995. This caused major delays for motorists when a bridge was constructed from NY 59 to Palisades Center south parking lot. To keep this portion of NY 59 from being overloaded with mall goers, exit 12 of the Thruway with NY 303 was re-routed through Palisades Center via Palisades Center Drive. In coordination with the Lower Hudson Transit Link, new traffic signals, with transit priority, were built on NY 59, along with new bus shelters, ADA-compliant sidewalks and crosswalks. Integrated Corridor Management systems and Intelligent Traffic Signal technology were also installed on NY 59 to decrease travel times for Hudson Link buses going to and from New York City.  Future  The New York Metropolitan Transportation Council (NYMTC) has started the Route 59 Area Transportation & Land Use Study to study NY 59 between Airmont Road and the bridge over South Pascack Road. The study, taking place between Winter 2019 and Spring 2020, will investigate possible improvements to the road, such as new bicycle lanes and sidewalks.

It is jointly administered by the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the National Academy of Medicine. As one of seven major divisions of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the TRB promotes innovation and progress in transportation through research in an objective and interdisciplinary setting. It stimulates research and offers research management services that promote technical excellence; provides expert advice on transportation policy and programs; and disseminates research results broadly and encourages their implementation. The TRB hosts some 200 standing committees that address specific aspects of transport and the TRB Annual Meeting attracts more than 14,000 attendees. History The Transportation Research Board was established in 1920 as the \\"National Advisory Board on Highway Research\\" and changed its name to the \\"Highway Research Board\\" from 1925 until 1974, when it was renamed again as the \\"Transportation Research Board.\\" Initially being solely involved in the sharing of information, it has commissioned ad-hoc research since 1950, became more involved in multi-modal transport in the 1960s, and has extended its operations further more recently. Overview TRB fulfills this mission through the work of its more than 200 standing committees and task forces addressing all modes and aspects of transportation; publication and dissemination of reports and peer-reviewed technical papers on research findings; management of cooperative research and other research programs; conduct of special studies on transportation policy issues at the request of the U.S. Congress and government agencies; operation of an online computerized file of transportation research information; and the hosting of the TRB Annual Meeting each January in Washington DC that, in 2020, attracted more than 14,000 transportation professionals from throughout the United States and abroad. TRB's activities are organized as follows: * Division A - Technical Activities * Division B - Studies and Special Programs * Division C - Administration and Finance * Division D - Cooperative Research Programs TRB's varied activities annually draw on over 7,000 engineers, scientists, and other transportation researchers from the public and private sectors and academia, who contribute expertise in the public interest by participating on TRB committees, panels, and task forces.http://www.trb.org/AboutTRB/AboutTRB.aspx The program is supported by state transportation departments, the various administrations of the U.S. Department of Transportation and other federal agencies, industry associations, and other organizations and individuals interested in the development of transportation.http://www.trb.org/AboutTRB/AboutTRB.aspx Publications include the Highway Capacity Manual, theTransportation Research Record journal, and a bi-monthly magazine called TR News. A history of transportation research and of TRB was published in January 2020 called The Transportation Research Board, 1920‚Äì2020: Everyone Interested Is Invited.The Transportation Research Board, 1920‚Äì2020: Everyone Interested Is Invited Transportation Research Information Services (TRIS) offers several databases for researchers: *The TRID Database is an integrated database that combines the records from TRB's Transportation Research Information Services (TRIS) Database and the OECD's Joint Transport Research Centre‚Äôs International Transport Research Documentation (ITRD) Database. TRID is the world's largest and most comprehensive bibliographic resource on transportation research information. It contains more than one million records of published and ongoing research, covering all modes and disciplines of transportation. More than 156,000 records contain links to full-text documents. The records in TRID are indexed with a standardized vocabulary from the Transportation Research Thesaurus (TRT) or the ITRD Thesaurus, depending on the source organization. *The Research in Progress (RiP) Database contains more than 12,400 current or recently completed transportation research projects, mostly those funded by the modal administrations of the U.S. Department of Transportation, state Departments of Transportation (DOTs), University Transportation Centers, or by TRB's cooperative research programs. *Research Needs Statements (RNS) Database An important function of TRB is to stimulate research that addresses issues facing the transportation community. In support of this function, TRB Technical Activities standing committees identify, develop, and disseminate research need statements (RNS) for use by practitioners, researchers, and others. *The TRB Publications Index (Pubsindex) contains bibliographic information on almost 48,000 papers, articles, and reports published by the Highway Research Board, Transportation Research Board, Strategic Highway Research Program, and the Marine Board. *The Practice Ready Papers (PRP) Database] contains papers that are defined as those in which the research results presented and discussed make a contribution to the solution of current or future problems or issues for practitioners. Information presented in these papers is ready for immediate implementation or requires minimal additional research or implementation effort.  Funding Opportunities  The TRB offers selective research funding for graduate students and faculty, notably, the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP), the Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP), and the Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP).

In a professional career which spanned nearly two decades, he played in 496 Serie A games, mainly with Fiorentina (nine seasons) and Milan (four), winning six major titles with the latter club. An international in the 1980s, Galli appeared with Italy in two World Cups, and the 1980 UEFA European Football Championship; he was an unused member of the squad that won the 1982 FIFA World Cup and served as Italy's starting goalkeeper at the 1986 FIFA World Cup. Club career Born in Pisa, Galli started his career with his home town's youth side as a midfielder before switching to the role of goalkeeper. He began his professional career with ACF Fiorentina in 1977, where he played for nine Serie A seasons. In 1986‚Äì87, he joined fellow league side A.C. Milan, being first-choice for three of his four years, and establishing himself as one of Italy's best goalkeepers, winning the Serie A title and the Supercoppa Italiana during his first season. He also started in both of the club's back- to-back European Cup conquests, in 1989 and 1990, also winning consecutive European Supercups in 1989 and 1990, and the Intercontinental Cups in 1989. He also reached the final of the 1989‚Äì90 Coppa Italia with Milan. In his final season with the club, he was often alternated and faced competition for a starting spot from back-up Andrea Pazzagli, whom manager Arrigo Sacchi often fielded during league games, while Galli played in European matches. In the 1990 summer, following Milan's signing of Sebastiano Rossi, 32-year-old Galli left, going on to represent S.S.C. Napoli and appearing in an average of 33 league games during his three-year spell, starting by winning the Italian Supercup, 5‚Äì1 against Juventus. In 1993, he played as the starting keeper for Torino Calcio for a single season, reaching the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia, and the quarter-finals of the Cup Winners' Cup, despite a disappointing mid-table finish. He finished his stint in the top division at the end of the 1994‚Äì95 season, after being named backup goalkeeper behind Luca Bucci at AC Parma, who won the UEFA Cup that season, and reached the Coppa Italia final, also placing third in Serie A. Galli retired in 1996 at the age of 38 after a brief stint with A.S. Lucchese-Libertas of Serie B. International career Galli took part in Italy's victorious 1982 FIFA World Cup expedition, without playing a single match however, as he served as backup to Dino Zoff, alongside Bordon. The same had already happened in the UEFA Euro 1980 tournament, where Italy finished in fourth place on home soil, after reaching the semi-final. Galli was given his national team debut in a friendly match against Greece on 5 October 1983, which ended in a 3‚Äì0 win to Italy. As a starter, Galli played in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico under manager Enzo Bearzot, as Italy were ousted in the round of 16 by eventual semi-finalists France, led by Michel Platini. During the tournament, in Italy's 1‚Äì1 draw against eventual champions Argentina in their second group match on 5 June, Galli drew criticism in the media for his goalkeeping on Maradona's equaliser. Following the competition, he was no longer called up to Italy. In total, Galli obtained 19 caps for Italy. Style of play Considered one of the best goalkeepers in Italy and the world during his prime, Galli was an extremely consistent, composed, reflective, and reliable goalkeeper, with a good physique and an excellent fundamental goalkeeping technique, who stood out for his elegance in his both playing style and movements. He was known in particular for his strong positional sense, handling, and his efficient rather than spectacular playing style, as well as his calm personality and serious demeanour, both on and off the pitch; however, he was also an athletic shot- stopper, with a good spring, who was capable of producing decisive diving saves when necessary. In spite of his reserved character, he was also highly regarded for his charismatic leadership, as well as his mentality, and his ability to communicate with his defenders and organise his back-line, which often inspired a sense of confidence in his teammates. He excelled in Milan's zonal marking system due to his speed when rushing off his line to claim crosses or anticipate opponents who had beaten the offside trap, which enabled the team to maintain a high defensive line. He also possessed good distribution, vision, and solid ball skills, which enabled him to play the ball out from the back. After retirement In December 2007, Galli joined Hellas Verona F.C. as its director of football, leaving his position after only two months in charge. He also later worked as a football pundit. Politics Following his retirement, Galli pursued a career in politics. On 1 March 2009, Galli was announced as the centre-right mayoral candidate in the 2009 local elections in Florence. His candidacy was supported by People of Freedom, Lega Nord and a number of minor local movements. In the first round of the elections, held on 6 and 7 June, he ended in second place, with 32% of votes; he was successively defeated fourteen days later in the second round of the election by centre-left candidate Matteo Renzi, taking only 40% of local votes.Mattwo Renzi takes Florence; Italy Chronicles, 24 June 2009 Personal life Galli was the father of Niccol√≤ Galli, a promising young footballer who died in a road accident on 9 February 2001, aged only 17. He is married to Anna, and also has two daughters, Camilla and Carolina.

The statue, which has a height of more than , was carved out of a large granite rock face during the 5th century. It depicts a variation of the Abhaya mudra, and the closely worn robe is elaborately carved. Constructed during the reign of Dhatusena, it may have been made as a result of a competition between a master and a pupil. The Avukana statue is one of the best examples of a standing statue constructed in ancient Sri Lanka. It is now a popular tourist attraction. Location and appearance The Avukana statue is located in the village of Avukana (also spelled Aukana) near Kekirawa. It is close to the Kala Wewa reservoir, and faces it. It was carved out of a large granite rock face, but is not completely separated. A narrow strip of rock has been left at the back of the statue, connecting it to the rock face and supporting it. However, the pedestal on which the Buddha stands, which is carved in the form of a lotus flower, was carved separately and positioned under the statue. The statue alone is in height, and with the pedestal the total height of the Avukana statue reaches . The statue had been located within a large image house or shrine, of which parts of the walls still remain. The structure was made of brick and stone, and was long and wide. Characteristics The Avukana statue is considered to be one of the best examples of a standing statue of the Buddha from ancient Sri Lanka. The Avukana statue shows some influence of the Gandhara school of art, as well as the Amaravati school of art of India. The robe is worn tightly, clearly outlining the shape of the body, and its pleats are carved clearly and delicately. It is worn over the left shoulder, and the right shoulder is bare, as is the tradition in Buddha statues of Sri Lanka. The Buddha's body is straight, and the left hand clutches the robe at the left shoulder. The right hand is raised up to the right shoulder, with the palm facing left. This position is known as the Asisa mudra, a variation of the Abhaya mudra. Construction left The Avukana statue is widely believed to have been constructed in the 5th century during the reign of King Dhatusena and under his orders. However, another theory is that it was done by an individual named Barana. There is another nearby standing statue of the Buddha, quite similar to the Avukana statue, at Sasseruwa. According to legend, the two statues are the result of a competition between a stone sculpting guru (master) and gola (pupil). The story goes that the master constructed the Avukana statue, while the pupil made the statue at Sasseruwa. The first to complete his statue had to notify the other by ringing a bell. The master managed to complete his statue first and won the competition. This is said to be why the Sasseruwa statue is unfinished. The Avukana statue is considered to be the better of the two, and similarities between them have led historians to believe that the story is actually true. However, that is a mere legend as the Sasseruwa stature was built nearly four hundred years prior to the Avukana Buddha image. Reswehera Rajamaha Vihara is an ancient temple which was built by the king Devanampiya Tissa (307-267 BC). Current situation Today, pilgrims visit the statue from all parts of the country and the Avukana statue has become a popular tourist attraction. Although the site lacked many facilities, it has now been improved by the Department of Archaeology and the Civil Defence Force.

It is about a group of survivors fighting against gods that have taken over the planet. Their life-expectancy when encountering a god is ten seconds.  Plot  In the near future, human society has been destroyed by the Gods (beings with superpowers closely resembling those of archetypical comic book superheroes) who came to our planet offering help but instead, seeing that we could not look after ourselves, demanded that we accept them as our leaders. Stubbornly, humanity fought back and were defeated by the Gods and their incredible powers, leaving few survivors. The surviving humans are now fighting a seemingly fruitless guerilla war against the Gods. One such group of survivors, The Ten Seconders, have encountered a man known only as The Scientist who promises to help humanity defeat the Gods, but seems mysteriously linked to the God's existence. Now Jenny, one of The Ten Seconders' own people, is being turned into a God by The Scientist in exchange for a way to defeat the Gods...  Characters  = Human = *Jenny - One of the three main characters and is but only a teenage girl who has recently begun her transformation into a God. *Malloy - The leader of The Ten Seconders and a guardian to Jenny and has sworn to protect her. When The Fathers arrive they turn him into a God saying that this is his world and he must change it to the best way he sees fit, as a God he tries to rebuild the world and bring the dead back to life, but as The Scientist explains once you're dead there's no coming back and that their just empty shells and he is in fact destroying the world. In the end Malloy cancels himself out of existence believing he can't come like the other Gods. *Harris - A friend of Malloy and Jenny and also the toughest of them all. In the end he is the sole survivor on The Ten Seconders. The character was added to bring comedy to the strip. *Kane - An American soldier who joins The Ten Seconders after the Gods devastate America; he is driven to the edge of insanity with guilt because he killed his wife and kids to protect them from the Gods and eventually commits suicide because of it. = \\"Gods\\" = *Hero - The psychotic leader of the Gods, and the first God to appear. He is killed near the end of the progression by Watchtower, another God. His superpowers include flying, the ability to set things on fire and a heat ray from his eyes. His character is a nod to all-purpose superheroes such as Superman (in one panel, he is shown saving a plane from crashing) *Lord Mach - A servant to Hero with the ability to move extremely fast making him impossible to shoot. But when he attacks Jenny, The Scientist pins him down allowing Jenny to kill him. *Watchtower - A God from New York whose superpower ability is to fly great distances, as well as the ability to \\"see\\" everything that occurs over a wide area. He is chained up by Hero in order to keep an eye on the city. Watchtower betrays Hero at the end of the first book and decapitates him with the chain and then disappears. He is later found in The Farthers Spaceship by Harris in a cell where he and many other Gods have been imprisoned by The Farthers Harris make a deal if he saves him from Arachne he'll let him go, Watchtower honors his deal and kills Arachne, then tells Harris he will take the other Gods back to their Home planets and tells Harris he can have the Spaceship if he wants, Harris says he just wants to go home, he tells Harris this is why he survived and takes him home. * Arachne - Another psychotic \\"God\\" who was captured by the US military and abandoned. He later escapes, thanks to the Ten-Seconders. When The Farthers are destroyed he manages to escape his cell and plans to kill Harris and become the new leader, however he is killed by Watchtower. *The Scientist - A mysterious man who seems linked to the Gods, and later revealed to be one himself. Now he is turning Jenny into a God as part of a deal with Malloy, which lets the surviving humans defeat the Gods. It is later revealed he too is a God and created most of the Gods for The Fathers, he hates them and plans to destroy The Fathers and take their powers for himself. He is defeated when Jenny sacrifices herself and destroys the power of the Gods, making The Scientist mortal, allowing Harris to kill him. *Damage - A massive God, with a childlike mentality and intelligence, who cannot be harmed by any weapon making him impossible to kill. At one point, it is revealed that he is an aberration, a failed attempt at a God that nevertheless has the powers of one. He treats The Scientist as his father but because he is so stupid, does anything for him. The Scientist sends him on a chore to the bottom of the ocean and like Watchtower we are yet to see him again. Damage is a reference to the stereotypical \\"super-strong, yet unintelligent\\" comic book character, such as the Incredible Hulk, killed by The Scientist *The Fathers - The creators of the Gods, who arrive on Earth after The Scientist sends them a message. He describes the Gods as teenagers who stole the family car and cause a little trouble with The Fathers as angry parents who have arrived to punish them. They are later wiped out by the Scientist with help from Jenny, who's now a \\"God\\", and Damage.

Donaldson, Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials, 353 (2nd Ed. 2007). A taxpayer is subject to tax in the current year if he or she has unfettered control in determining when items of income will or should be paid.Treas. Reg. ¬ß 1.451-2(a). Unlike actual receipt, constructive receipt does not require physical possession of the item of income in question. Background The full text of the IRS regulation defining constructive receipt states as follows: > ‚ÄúIncome although not actually reduced to a taxpayer's possession is > constructively received by him in the taxable year during which it is > credited to his account, set apart for him, or otherwise made available so > that he may draw upon it at any time, or so that he could have drawn upon it > during the taxable year if notice of intention to withdraw had been given. > However, income is not constructively received if the taxpayer's control of > its receipt is subject to substantial limitations or restrictions.‚Äù The United States Tax Court more concisely articulated the doctrine of constructive receipt in Davis v. Commissioner.Davis v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1978-12. The court stated that for income to be constructively received, the funds must be made available to the taxpayer without substantial limitations. At issue was whether or not a taxpayer faced such substantial limitations when a check was available to her at the post office on the last day of the tax year after the mail carrier attempted to deliver the certified letter containing it to her home earlier the same day. The taxpayer was not at home when the first delivery attempt was made and the carrier left a note that the letter would be at the post office for her. The taxpayer retrieved the check from the post office several days later, just after the new tax year began. Courts had previously held that when a taxpayer makes a decision to be unavailable to take delivery of a check, then he will not satisfy the substantial limitations requirement and he will be deemed to have had constructive receipt at the time of attempted delivery. However, in this case, the court noted that the check sender specifically informed the taxpayer on a prior occasion that the check would be arriving approximately two months later than it actually did. The taxpayer had no notice to expect that the check would be delivered; therefore she could not have made a decision to be unavailable to take receipt. The court held that this lack of notice, under the circumstances, meant that she faced substantial limitations on the availability of the funds and that they were not constructively received during the first tax year. History The Tax Court had previously addressed this issue in Hornung v. Commissioner. Paul Hornung, a football player for the Green Bay Packers, won a Corvette as a prize on December 31, 1961, for his performance in the 1961 NFL Championship Game. The game was played in Green Bay, Wisconsin, the car was kept at a dealership in New York City, and Hornung did not retrieve the car until January 3, 1962. The court decided that Hornung had not constructively received the car (income) in 1961 because, under the circumstances, it would have been unreasonable to expect him to retrieve the car on the day he won it. The Tax Court also addressed constructive receipt in two cases, both entitled Veit v. Commissioner. In Veit I, as part of redoing his employment contract, the taxpayer agreed to defer receiving a bonus that he was owed until the next year. The Tax Court upheld the agreement over the IRS's protest because it was the result of an arm's length business transaction, not a sham to evade paying taxes for a year.Veit I, 8 T.C. 809. See also Indeed, the deferral was requested by the taxpayer's employer. In Veit II, the Tax Court upheld a subsequent agreement by which the taxpayer would receive five equal payments over the course of five years, rather than the one lump-sum payment previously agreed-upon. Again, the IRS objected to the deferral, and again, the Tax Court found for the taxpayer. The deferral was requested by the employer, and the full amount of the bonus was never \\"unqualifiedly subject to [the taxpayer's] demand or withdrawal.\\" Impact The doctrine of constructive receipt is often used in combination with the doctrine of cash equivalence in order to determine the timing of receipt of income items. A constructive receipt issue arises when the taxpayer has not actually received the income, and the issue is whether the income is substantially available to the taxpayer such that receipt will occur for tax timing purposes. A cash equivalence issue occurs when a taxpayer receives a payment as some sort of promise to pay, and the issue is whether the promise is sufficiently definite as to be considered equivalent to receipt of cash income.

The equilibrium line altitude (ELA) or snow line separates the ablation zone from the higher-altitude accumulation zone. The ablation zone often contains meltwater features such as supraglacial lakes, englacial streams, and subglacial lakes. Sediments dropped in the ablation zone forming small mounds or hillocks are called kames. Kame and kettle hole topography is useful in identifying an ablation zone of a glacier. The seasonally melting glacier deposits much sediment at its fringes in the ablation area. Ablation constitutes a key part of the glacier mass balance. The amount of snow and ice gained in the accumulation zone and the amount of snow and ice lost in the ablation zone determine glacier mass balance. Often mass balance measurements are made in the ablation zone using snow stakes. References * Summerfield, M.

The AU-KBC Research Centre is a first of its kind, a public-private research centre in India, being the partnership between a wholly for-profit company (KBC Research Foundation Private Limited, KBCRF) and a state institution (Anna University). The Center has no employees, and all researchers stationed there are employees of the for-profit company KBCRF. The Centre's original goal, when it had its own employees, was to generate research and products of international quality. Its current goal is to create revenue for KBCRF and its sister for-profit concerns.  Mission and goals  The AU-KBC Research Centre initiates research in new and emerging thrust areas such as nanosciences and conducts research in areas such as communications and biology with modelling and experimental component. There is an interdisciplinary core of mathematics, physics and computing sciences that impact on all the teaching and research work at the Centre.  Focus areas of the centre  The major areas in which the centre dabbles are information sciences, Life sciences, mathematics, physics, bioinformatics, nanobiology, cryptography, network security, communications engineering and natural language processing. The centre is also concentrating on producing individuals in the field of clinical research. Clinical research in India has the fundamental merits of sparse federal oversight, and a drug-unexposed population. Accordingly, the centre has started a course \\"Post Graduate Certificate Program in Clinical Trials Management\\". The clinical trials course at the centre offers its trainees a head start with multinationals who wish to use these unprecedented opportunities for drug trials (Phase II) in India. It is offered both full-time and part-time and is a first such course offered by a public-private institution.

Martha Hildebrandt was the second woman to occupy the Presidency of the Congress of the Republic of Peru in 1999 (Martha Ch√°vez was the first). Since 1995 she has exercised her charge in the Congress of Peru. She is also the sister of C√©sar Hildebrandt, a Peruvian journalist.  Studies  In 1942, Martha studied education in National University of San Marcos. In 1952, she studied \\"Descriptive Linguistics\\" in Oklahoma, United States and subsequently \\"Structural Linguistics\\" in Illinois, also in the United States.  Working life  From 1947 to 1953, Martha worked at the National University of San Marcos as a teacher. Then she traveled to Venezuela, where she worked in the area of linguistics at the Department of Justice of Venezuela. In 1962, she returned to the National University of San Marcos as a professor and remained there until 1973. From 1972 until 1976 she was also the General Director of the Institute of Culture.  Linguistics  From 1974 to 1978 she held important positions in the Organization of American States (OAS) and in UNESCO, in the area of linguistics.  Political life Martha Hildebrandt is a local linguist who is best known to the broad Peruvian public, though she spoke neither Quechua nor Aymara. She was Perpetual Secretary of the Academia Peruana de la Lengua from 1993 to 2005. Her numerous books on subjects related to the Spanish Language are extensively quoted. Hildebrandt's political life began in 1994 with her professional relationship with Alberto Fujimori. In the general elections of 1995, she was chosen by Cambio 90-Nueva Mayor√≠a as the Congressperson of the Republic, initiating her first period in the Legislature. When the general elections of the 2000 approached and Alberto Fujimori desired to seek re-election, she defended the controversial project, along with Martha Ch√°vez, Luz Salgado and Carmen Lozada. In 1999, she was chosen as President of the Congresshttp://www.congreso.gob.pe/participacion/museo/congreso/presidentes/Martha_Hildebrandt_a, and in 2000 she was reaffirmed in the position. When the state of Alberto Fujimori began to collapse, Hildebrandt was removed from the position to \\"avoid to be closely tied to the regime\\" after holding the post for 48 hours only.. She was replaced by the First Vice-president Luz Salgado, and then after two quarrelled, elections between government supporters and opposition, Valent√≠n Paniagua Corazao (Accion Popular) was chosen temporarily as the new President of the Congress and therefore as Transitory President of the Republic. In the general election of 2001, she was not elected; Luz Salgado was her replacement in the Congress of the Republic. Already in the general election of the 2006, advanced with the number 2 to the Congress and was chosen in the third voting inside Alianza para el Futuro, a coalition of the fujimoristas. In August 2006, Hildebrandt criticized two congresswomen from Cusco; Hilaria Supa and Mar√≠a Sumire; for being sworn in before Congress in their native language Quechua on July 25, 2006.

In Japan it was titled , a play on the Japanese name for the system, PC Engine. The first game in the Bonk series, it was followed by two more games for the TurboGrafx-16 before branching out to other platforms. Bonk's Adventure was ported to the NES and Amiga, as well as being released as a coin-operated arcade game, under different titles (FC Genjin and BC Genjin). A completely different game with the same name appeared on the Game Boy (under the title GB Genjin in Japan). Plot The game's protagonist is Bonk, a strong and bald caveboy who battles anthropomorphic dinosaurs and other prehistoric enemies. Bonk's mission is to rescue Princess Za (a small pink Pleisiosaur-type reptile) who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool (a large, green, Tyrannosaurus-type dinosaur). In the arcade version, Bonk is also assisted by a female version of himself. Gameplay Screenshot of the TurboGrafx-16 version Bonk attacks enemies by \\"bonking\\" them with his large, invincible forehead. Bonk starts the game with three hearts' worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage, and three extra lives. Bonk's health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables. Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger. There are three stages of a power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground, and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable. Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat. The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time. A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power and a large one takes him to stage three. Eating a small meat while in stage two will also put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power. When the third stage effect wears off he returns to the second state and remains there for a while before turning back to the regular Bonk. Eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power. Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart, which restores all of Bonk's missing health. There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart. Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air. Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small \\"smiley\\" power-up. Bonk's smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage. The player is given additional points and a caveman-type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected. The arcade version is much different: at the beginning of the game, the player can choose from one of 28 different levels. Unlike the console versions, the levels are extremely short, and the goal is to get to the end as quickly as possible while trying to get a high score. There are various sports items in the stages, like basketballs and footballs. As long as Bonk continues to dribble these items, the player will get bonus points. Similarly to Super Mario World, there is a goal post at the end of each level, which grants more points if Bonk hits it at its apex. After completing three stages, the player gets to choose from one of seven boss battles. There are no power-ups in this version. Instead, there are smiley faces, which attach themselves to Bonk's head and can be used to absorb enemy projectiles or extend the length of Bonk's attacks. However, if Bonk gets hit once, he will lose all of his smiley faces and he will have to pick them up again. This version of the game also includes a two-player mode, where player 2 plays as a female Bonk. The game can be set up to dispense tickets, and the ticket payouts can be adjusted by the operator. Development The Japanese name for the original game for the PC-Engine is PC-Genjin (PCÂéü‰∫∫, in English: PC-Caveman). In Japanese, PC-Genjin sounds like PC-Engine, and the PC stands for Pithecanthropus Computerus, a pun on Pithecanthropus erectus. It is generally called PC-Kid in English, as he was meant to be NEC's mascot at the time. Later, when the game was ported (or given different versions) for other platforms, it was renamed accordingly, like FC-Kid (after Family Computer, the original Japanese name for the NES, and the FC stood for Freakthoropus Computerus), GB-Kid (after the Game Boy), or the more generic name BC-Kid in some other versions, including Amiga. In North America, this was scrapped, as the game name is always Bonk's Adventure or something similar. Reception Entertainment Weekly picked the game as the #3 greatest game available in 1991, saying: \\"Cute, cartoony, and highly imaginative, this is one of the rare games that‚Äôs as much fun to watch as it is to play.\\" In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly editors ranked the TurboGrafx-16 version as number 85 on their \\"100 Best Games of All Time\\", citing its imaginative level designs and hilarious player character. Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. Legacy In 2003 Hudson Soft included a 3D remake of Bonk's Adventure in their Hudson Selection series of games released exclusively in Japan for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube consoles. Factor 5, developers of the Amiga port, have made the Amiga version of BC-Kid available for free through their company website. The TurboGrafx-16 version was released for Wii's Virtual Console on November 22, 2006, and according to informal surveys it has been one of the most purchased games. In March 2008, a version for mobile phones was released in Japan. Hudson was developing a reboot of the franchise entitled \\"Bonk: Brink of Extinction\\" for WiiWare and PlayStation Network. With the closure of Hudson the status and future of this title is uncertain.

It was once again recorded at Delta-Studio in Wilster with Dirk Steffens producing, and was the first Accept album engineered by Michael Wagener. Bassist Peter Baltes sings lead vocal on \\"Breaking Up Again,\\" and the bridge vocal on \\"Midnight Highway.\\" After the unsuccessful attempt at commercialism on I'm a Rebel, Accept decided not to allow any more outside people to influence the band. Pulling together in the midst of a very cold winter, the band members concentrated on making the album they themselves wanted to make. Udo Dirkschneider remembers: \\"Following our experiences with I'm A Rebel we made it our goal not to be influenced musically by anyone outside of the band this time.\\" Udo believes Breaker is among Accept's best records and marks the beginning of the band's golden era which lasted up until 1985  the album title would later become the name of Udo's own record company, Breaker Records. Wolf Hoffmann concurs: \\"Maybe we knew that the old approach from the record before didn't work very well. So we were saying 'fuck it, let's just do what we think is right. Let's not try to be somebody else, let's not try to have a radio hit anymore.'\\" The lone possible concession to commercial interests was the upbeat rocker \\"Midnight Highway\\", which Wolf described as \\"sort of a semi-commercial attempt\\" and \\"a little too happy for my tastes.\\" Much of the rest of the album is angry and defiant in tone, especially the profanity-laced \\"Son of a Bitch\\". Udo describes that song's lyrics as \\"absolutely anti record company.\\" Wolf explains why this particular song was the only one to not have its lyrics printed inside the album: \\"On the initial release we thought it would be a good idea to just put 'Censored' on the liner notes for the song to avoid any controversy. Well, it turns out it caused more controversy that way with everyone wanting to know who censored it.\\" An alternate version titled \\"Born to Be Whipped\\" was recorded with tamer lyrics. Wolf explains: \\"We had to change it because the British were so uptight about this kind of stuff that you couldn't possibly release the record over there with a song called Son of a Bitch.\\" Track listing Credits ;Band members *Udo Dirkschneider ‚Äì lead vocals *Wolf Hoffmann ‚Äì lead guitar *J√∂rg Fischer ‚Äì lead guitar *Peter Baltes ‚Äì bass guitar, backing vocals, lead vocals on \\"Breaking Up Again\\" *Stefan Kaufmann ‚Äì drums, backing vocals ;Production *Dirk Steffens ‚Äì producer, arrangements with Accept *Michael \\"Overload\\" Wagener ‚Äì engineer, mixing *Stefan B√∂hle ‚Äì cover photography *H.G.

It is owned and operated by the Ireland, Great Britain and Malta District of the de La Salle brothers. The Centre was set up by three De La Salle Brothers in 1975, Br Damian Lundy FSC, Br Joe Hendron FSC and Br Dominic Green FSC and is housed in a small Manor House (Formerly known as Wallingtons Manor in the south-west of Kintbury town centre, between Inglewood and Titcomb). It is set in picturesque grounds with landscaped gardens and this rural countryside setting offers a quiet atmosphere for those who attend retreats. Wallingtons The Manor of Wallingtons in Kintbury dates from the early 13th century. Robert de Wallington purchased the Manor in 1220 and it became named after his family. In the late 15th century, it was purchased by William Waynflete, the Bishop of Winchester. He gave it to his foundation at Magdalen College, Oxford. They remained in possession until 1859, but rented it out to tenants. The present manor house was built in the late 16th century. It was remodeled after a fire in 1784 and again in 1891 by Temple Moore when William Hew Dunn moved there from nearby Inglewood House.  Rooms in the Centre  =The Quiet Room= alt= This is a room where people can go to be quiet. Situated in part of the attic space of the west wing of the original house, it has space for all those in attendance at the centre. This space allows it to be used for daily reflection, most regularly in the morning after breakfast and in the evening after dinner. The floor space is lined with cushions for seating and the centrepiece of the room is a sprawling candle holder with many candles. These candles are lit whenever the room is used for reflection. =The Cedar Room= The Cedar Room is located on the ground floor and is used for gatherings during retreats. The floor is covered with beanbags for seating which can be rearranged depending on what the room is being used for. The room is so called because its windows overlooks a large cedar tree (colloquially known as Cedric) in the middle of the lawns at the side of the house (see below). Despite this, it is almost universally known as the 'Bean Bag Room'. =The De La Salle Room= Mainly known as a common room, this room is used by all who visit the centre to relax and socialise during their free time on retreat. This room is located on the first floor of the house. =The Damian Lundy Room= Named after the founder of the centre, this room is the largest in the house. It is mainly used for functions, retreats and masses.  Trees - Cedric and Marge  There are two prominent trees in the grounds of the centre. These are a large cedar tree known affectionately as Cedric and a coniferous tree named Marge. The team encourage all to give Cedric \\"hugs\\" due to him being over 200 years old. Marge stands just behind Cedric it is named after its resemblance to Marge Simpson's hair-do. The Lasallian Young Team The Lasallian Young Team is a group of volunteers who work at the centre for a year. They start in September and finish the following August.

During the Reconstruction Era he served as the state's governor and called for equal economic opportunity and political rights for blacks and whites in Georgia. He also promoted public education for both, and encouraged railroads, banks, and industrial development. During his governorship he requested federal military help to ensure the rights of freedmen; this made him \\"the most hated man in the state\\", and he had to flee the state without completing his term. After returning to Georgia and being found \\"not guilty\\" of corruption charges, for three decades afterwards he was an esteemed private citizen. Early life Bullock was born in Bethlehem, New York and moved to Augusta, Georgia, in 1857 for his job with the telegraph company Adams Express. Political life Bullock served as the 46th Governor of Georgia from 1868 to 1871 during Reconstruction and was the first Republican governor of Georgia. After Georgia ratified the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the Omnibus Act declared that states were entitled to representation in Congress as one of the states of the Union. Georgia again lost the right to representation in Congress because the General Assembly expelled twenty-eight black members and prevented blacks from voting in the 1868 presidential election (see Original 33). In response to an appeal from Bullock, Georgia was again placed under military rule as part of the Georgia Act of December 22, 1869. This made Bullock a hated political figure. After various allegations of scandal and ridicule, in 1871 he was obliged by the Ku Klux Klan to resign the governorship, and felt it prudent to leave the state. He was succeeded by Republican State Senate president Benjamin Conley, who served as Governor for the two remaining months of the term to which Bullock had been elected. Conley was succeeded by James M. Smith, a Democrat, and no Republican would serve as governor of Georgia again until Sonny Perdue in 2003. Postbellum life Bullock served as president of the Macon and Augusta Railroad in 1867, and established the Augusta First National Bank. He later became president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, and in 1895 served as master of ceremonies for the Cotton States and International Exposition. Bullock introduced the speaker, Booker T. Washington, who gave his famous \\"Atlanta Compromise\\" speech. Death and legacy Bullock died in Albion, New York, in 1907 and was buried in Mt. Albion Cemetery nearby. Bullock has had both detractors and admirers. According to the New Georgia Encyclopedia, he was the last progressive governor of Georgia until Jimmy Carter. He is the only governor of Georgia since 1850 of whom there is no portrait in the Georgia State Capitol. In books The novel Gone With the Wind, by native Georgian Margaret Mitchell, references the election of Rufus Bullock at the end of Part Four, calling it the end of a process of Northern subjugation of Georgia that had begun with Sherman's March to the Sea in 1864. In the novel, the Republicans win the election, utilizing voter fraud with the help of their Negro (freed slaves) constituency. According to Mitchell, \\"The election had lasted three days instead of one. Trainloads of negroes had been rushed from town to town, voting at every precinct along the way. Of course, Bullock had won.\\" References Further reading *Entrepreneur for Equality: Governor Rufus Bullock, Commerce, and Race in Post-Civil War Georgia (1994), Russell Duncan, University of Georgia Press, .

When entire scenes are redone, it is referred to as a re-shoot or additional photography. Both types of shots usually occur after continuity, logic, or quality issues are identified during the film editing process. In other words, such shots occur months after the sets have been struck, the costumes and props have been stored, and all the cast and most of the crew have moved on to other projects. If the issues had been identified during principal photography, the director would simply have asked for another take. Therefore, in deciding whether to proceed, the director and producer must carefully balance the substantial expense of reuniting key cast and crew members on set against whether pick-ups or re- shoots are absolutely necessary to fix plot holes (or worse) in the final cut. Pick-ups and reshoots themselves can pose significant continuity issues. For example, if the original costumers and makeup artists are unavailable to participate (and if rented costumes and wigs were returned and original makeup supplies were entirely used up), then those crew members' replacements must study their predecessors' work and precisely match whatever was used during the original film shoot.

It is sometimes confused as a Slowinski's corn snake, which is a subspecies of corn snake which is commonly kept as a pet. The two are sometimes interbred to produce varying pattern and color morphs. Etymology The epithet, emoryi, is in honor of Brigadier General William Hemsley Emory, who was chief surveyor of the U.S. Boundary Survey team of 1852 and collected specimens for the Smithsonian Institution.Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Pantherophis emoryi, pp. 83-84). As such, it is sometimes referred to as Emory's rat snake. Common names Additional common names for Pantherophis emoryi include the following: brown rat snake, chicken snake, eastern spotted snake, Emory's Coluber, Emory's pilot snake, Emory's racer, Emory's snake, gray rat snake, mouse snake, prairie rat snake, spotted mouse snake, Texas rat snake, and western pilot snake.Wright AH, Wright AA (1957). Handbook of Snakes of the United States and Canada. Ithaca and London: Comstock. 1,105 pp. (in 2 volumes) (Elaphe emoryi emoryi, pp. 218-223, Figure 68, Map 23). Description The Great Plains rat snake is typically light gray or tan in color, with dark gray, brown, or green-gray blotching down its back, and stripes on either side of the head which meet to form a point between the eyes. They are capable of growing from 3 feet to 5 feet long. Behavior Great Plains rat snakes prefer open grassland or lightly forested habitats, but are also found on coastal plains, semi-arid regions, as well as rocky, moderately mountainous regions. They can often be found on farmland, which often leads it to be erroneously called the chicken snake, and other areas with a relatively high rodent population, which is their primary diet. They will also eat birds, and occasionally snakes, lizards and frogs, all of which they subdue by constriction. They are primarily nocturnal, and oviparous, laying clutches of as many as 25 eggs in the late spring. Like most rat snakes, when agitated, the Great Plains rat snake will shake its tail vigorously, which by itself makes no noise, but when it shakes amongst dry leaf litter, it can sound remarkably like a rattlesnake, and often leads to misidentification. Warning signs of agitation are curling up tightly, shaking its tail rapidly. Though this snake has very small teeth and is nonvenomous, it will bite. However, as a whole, this species of snake is very calm and non- aggressive. Taxonomy This species, Pantherophis emoryi, has undergone extensive reclassification since it was first described by Spencer Fullerton Baird and Charles Fr√©d√©ric Girard in 1853 as Scotophis emoryi. It has often been placed in the genus Elaphe, but recent phylogenetic analyses have resulted in its transfer to Pantherophis.Utiger U, Helfenberger N, Sch√§tti B, Schmidt C, Ruf M, Ziswiler V (2002). \\"Molecular Systematics and Phylogeny of Old and New World ratsnakes, Elaphe Auct., and related genera (Reptilia, Squamata, Colubridae)\\".

Biography Currier was born in Denver, Colorado. From 1920 to 1932 he was the head of the editing department at Hal Roach Studios. His contract ensured that his name appeared as editor on nearly every Hal Roach film released while he was head of the department, though the actual work was often done by other people. Most of the Laurel and Hardy films released by the company during this period were actually edited by Bert Jordan. After his work at Roach, Currier worked at Paramount Pictures and Monogram Pictures. He worked at Hal Roach Studios again for a short while before starting his own editing company. He died in Lake Forest, California. Currier had been elected to membership in American Cinema Editors.

Before 200 CE, residents were building earthwork mounds, which were used for cooking and religious purposes. Succeeding peoples, including those of the ancient Mississippian culture established by 1000 CE in Piedmont, continued to build or add onto such mounds. In the 500‚Äì700 years preceding European contact, the Mississippian culture built large, complex cities and maintained far-flung regional trading networks. Historically documented tribes in the North Carolina region included the Carolina Algonquian-speaking tribes of the coastal areas, such as the Chowanoke, Roanoke, Pamlico, Machapunga, Core, Cape Fear Indians, and others, who were the first encountered by the English; Iroquoian-speaking Meherrin, Cherokee and Tuscarora of the interior; and Southeastern Siouan tribes, such as the Cheraw, Waxhaw, Saponi, Waccamaw, and Catawba. Spanish attempts to settle the interior, with several forts built by the Jose Pardo expedition in the 1560s, ended when the Indians destroyed the forts and killed most of the garrisons. Nearly two decades later, English colonists began to settle the coastal areas, starting with a charter in 1584. Sir Walter Raleigh (namesake of the city of Raleigh) began two small settlements in the late 1580s, but they failed. There is much speculation about what happened to the \\"Lost Colony\\" of Roanoke Island; in 1586, many settlers returned to England and when the English returned in July 1587, they found no settlers remaining but just the word \\"CROATOAN\\" carved into a tree. Theories, but none with conclusive evidence, include: * lack of food or other environmental considerations may have led colonists to take shelter with local tribes, possibly traveling 50 miles south to Hatteras Island, then called Croatoan Island and inhabited by the Croatan tribe * disease may have killed all the colonists * native tribes may have massacred the colonists By 1640, some growth took place with colonists migrating from Virginia, who moved into the area of Albemarle Sound. In 1663, the king granted a charter for a new colony named Carolina in honor of his father Charles I.North Carolina State Library - North Carolina History He gave ownership to the Lords Proprietors.Lefler and Newsome, (1973) Reconstructed royal governor's mansion, Tryon Palace, in New Bern North Carolina developed a system of representative government and local control by the early 18th century. Many of its colonists resented British attempts after 1756 to levy taxes without representation in Parliament. The colony was a Patriot base during the American Revolution, and its legislature issued the Halifax Resolves, which authorized North Carolina delegates to the Second Continental Congress to vote for independence from Britain. Loyalist elements were suppressed, and there was relatively little military activity until late in the war. During the first half of the nineteenth century, North Carolina remained a rural state, with no cities and few villages. Most whites operated small subsistence farms, but the eastern part of the state had a growing class of planters, especially after 1800 when cotton became highly profitable due to the invention of the cotton gin, which enabled cultivation of short-staple cotton in the uplands. All cotton cultivation as a commodity crop was dependent on the slave labor of African Americans. Politically the state was highly democratic, as heated elections pitted the Democratic east versus the Whiggish west. After the fire and ensuing battle on Fort Sumter in April 1861, North Carolina seceded from the United States and joined the Confederate States of America. More soldiers from North Carolina fought for the Confederacy during the American Civil War than from any other state, but few major battles were fought here. During the early years of Reconstruction, strides were made at integrating the newly freed slaves into society. Whites regained political power by violence and in 1899, disfranchised blacks through a new constitution, imposing Jim Crow and white supremacy. The Civil Rights Movement strengthened in the 1950s and 1960s, and it had strong supporters and activists in North Carolina. Events such as the sit-in protest at the F.W. Woolworth's store in Greensboro would become a touchstone for the movement. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, a central organization in the movement, was founded at Shaw University in Raleigh. Following the passage of national civil rights legislation to enforce suffrage, in 1973, Clarence Lightner was elected in Raleigh as the first African-American mayor of a major southern city. Pre-colonial history Artists conception of Town Creek Indian Mound during the late Town Creek-early Leak phases circa 1350 CE. The earliest discovered human settlements in what eventually became North Carolina are found at the Hardaway Site near the town of Badin in the south-central part of the state. Radiocarbon dating of the site has not been possible. But, based on other dating methods, such as rock strata and the existence of Dalton-type spear points, the site has been dated to approximately 8000 BCE., or 10,000 years old.Ward (1999), pp. 35‚Äì46 Spearpoints of the Dalton type continued to change and evolve slowly for the next 7000 years, suggesting a continuity of culture for most of that time. During this time, the settlement was scattered and likely existed solely on the hunter-gatherer level. Toward the end of this period, there is evidence of settled agriculture, such as plant domestication and the development of pottery.Ward (1999), pp. 51-75 From 1000 BCE until the time of European settlement, the time period is known as the \\"Woodland period\\". Permanent villages, based on settled agriculture, were developed throughout the present- day state. By about 800 CE, towns were fortified throughout the Piedmont region, suggesting the existence of organized tribal warfare.Ward (1999), pp. 98-99 An important site of this late-Woodland period is the Town Creek Indian Mound, an archaeologically rich site occupied from about 1100 to 1450 CE by the Pee Dee people of the South Appalachian Mississippian culture.Ward (1999), pp. 123-133 =The Native Peoples of North Carolina= Ceremony of Secotan warriors in North Carolina. Watercolour by English colonist John White in 1585. North Carolina was home to several distinct cultural groups. Along the east coast were the Chowanoke, or Roanoke, & Croatan nations, Algonquian speaking people. The Chowanoke lived north of the Neuse River & the Croatan south or it. They had (along with the Powhatan, Piscataway & Nanticoke further north) adopted a governing system whereas there would be a largely patriarchal society living under the rule of several local chiefs who all answered to a single, higher ruling chief & formed a council with him to discuss political affairs. This was different from the more common Algonquian approach, which was more of a Socialist style of governing without a true, full-time government. The Chowanoke became protected by the English in the late 17th century but dissolved completely in the 19th. Their descendants reformed during the 21st century. In the 18th century, the Croatan & several local Siouan groups would merge to form the Lumbee, who still exist in the state to this day. Apparently there was also a long-standing debate dating to, at least, the 1970s as to whether the Croatan had ever actually existed. In this case, much of their assumed lands would have been claimed by Eastern Siouan tribes. As the Powhatan started to dissolve under English rule, some tribes‚Äîlike the Machapunga‚Äîbroke away and migrated south to live among the Chowanoke. Inland of them were three Siouan speaking tribes associated with a culture group called the Eastern Siouans. Broken into several smaller tribes, they were the Catawba, the Waccamaw Siouan, the Cheraw, the Winyaw, the Wateree & the Sugaree. It's difficult to say just how many existed in the region. Between 1680 & 1701, the region also played host to the Saponi, Tutelo, Occaneechi Keyauwee, Shakori & Sissipahaw (possibly among others), who had been driven out of the state by an invasion of the Iroquois Confederacy. Most of these tribes later returned to Virginia, where they came to be collectively known as the Eastern Blackfoots, or Christannas.Hale, Horatio \\"Tutelo Tribe & Language\\" (1883) Most of all other Siouan tribes of the Carolinas slowly merged and were all thought of as subtribes of the Catawba Nation by the American Revolution. In the 19th century, the Catawba moved west and were consolidated with the Cherokee, despite keeping their own traditions alive long term.Speck, Frank G. Catawba Texts 1934. It is also important to note that many of the southernmost Eastern Siouan tribes had largely homogenized their culture with that of the Muskogean populations beyond the Santee River. There were even isolated communities north of the river who are believed to have acted as Siouans, but spoke Muskogean. The northernmost known tribe such as this‚Äîthe Pedee‚Äîlived in south-central North Carolina.\\"The Unabridged Version of Tribes of the Carolina Lowland: Pedee - Sewee - Winyaw - Waccamaw - Cape Fear - Congaree - Wateree - Santee.\\" Stanley South. University of South Carolina - Columbia, stansouth@sc.edu (1972) The first Spanish & English explorers appear to have greatly overestimated the size of the Cherokee, placing them as far north as Virginia. However, many historians now believe that there was a large, mixed race/ mixed language confederacy in the region, called the Coosa. The Spanish also gave them the nicknames Chalaques & Uchis during the 16th century & the English turned Chalaques into Cherokees.Cheves, L. \\"Shaftesbury Papers.\\" Col. of the South Carolina Historical Society 5, Richmond: William Ellis Jones The Cherokees we know today were among these people, but lived much further south & both the Cherokee language (of Iroquoian origin) & the Yuchi language (Muskogean) have been heavily modified by Siouan influence & carry many Siouan borrow words.\\"Yuchi Language Primer\\" (2007) Yuchi.orgcherokeelessons.com/pdf/Cherokee Lessons 978-0-557-68640-7.pdf This nation would have existed throughout parts of the states of Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North & South Carolina & Georgia, with cores of different culture groups organized at different extremes of the territory &, probably, speaking Yuchi as a common tongue. Two other tribes must be noted here. Between 1655 and 1680, a tribe known as the Westo appeared in the region. It is now believed that they were the remainder of the Erie and Neutral Iroquoian nations who had been pushed out of Ohio during the Beaver Wars. They appeared in West Virginia, driving the Tutelo east to live near the Saponi, then punched straight south, through the Chalaques, settled somewhere around the Yadkin river & began preying on the smaller Siouan tribes of the region. After they were defeated by a coalition led by the \\"Sawannos,\\" much of the land in North Carolina was reclaimed by its former owners. However, Muskogean people from further south filed north into the southern reaches of this area & reformatted themselves to create the Yamasee Nation. In further reference to the Chalaques, after the Westo punched straight through them, they seem to have split along the line of the Tennessee River to create the Cherokee to the south & the Yuchi to the north.Oatis, Steven J. \\"A Colonial Complex: South Carolina's Frontiers in the Era of the Yamasee War, (1680-1730) Then, following the Yamasee War (1715‚Äì1717), the Yuchi were force across AppalachiaOatis, A Colonial Complex & split again, into the Coyaha & the Chisca. The French, seeing an opportunity for new allies, ingratiated themselves with the Chisca and had them relocated to the heart of the Illinois Colony to live among the Algonquian Ilinoweg. Later, as French influence along the Ohio River waned, the tribe seems to have split away again, taking many Ilinoweg tribes with them, and moved back to Kentucky, where they became the Kispoko. The Kispoko later became the fourth tribe of Shawnee.Charles Augustus Hanna, 1911 The Wilderness Trail, Vol II, 1911, pp. 93‚Äì95. Meanwhile, the Coyaha reforged their alliance with the Cherokee & brought in many of the smaller Muskogean tribes of Alabama (often referred to as the Mobilians) to form the Creek Confederacy. The Creeks would go on to conquer the Yamasee & the remaining Muskogean peoples of the east coast, as well as the Carib Calusa nation of southern Florida.Ethridge, Robbie (2003). \\"Chapter 5: \\"The People of Creek Country\\"\\". Creek Country: The Creek Indians and their World. The University of North Carolina Press. p. 93 They then spread out, splitting into the Upper, Middle & Lower Creeks‚Äîbest known today as the Muscogee, Cherokee & Seminole Nations. Although broken and abandoned by their former English allies, the Yamasee people survived as backwater nomads throughout a vast territory between South Carolina & Florida. Many Yamasee tribes have since reformed in modern times.\\"Yamasee Indian Tribe History.\\" Access Genealogy. (retrieved 20 Nov 2010) Later, the Meherrin migrated south from Virginia & were settled on a reservation in northeast North Carolina. Due to early maps, the Iroquoian Nottoway may have also existed more on the Virginia-North Carolina border before migrating a little more northwest. They are noted as the Mangoag on a map by John Smith from 1606.http://www.sonofthesouth.net/revolutionary-war/maps/captain-smith- virginia-map.jpg Following the Meherrin were a small group of Tuscaroras who remained in the region after the Tuscarora War of 1722 sent most of their people north to live among the Iroquois. This tribe has since been referred to as the Coharie.\\"Coharie Tribe\\". Coharie Tribe. Coharie Tribe. Retrieved 27 January 2017. Earliest European explorations Map of North America by Vesconte Maggiolo after an earlier map made on the Verrazzano expedition of 1524. The narrow isthmus of land separating \\"Tera Florida\\" from \\"Francesca\\" is the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Cape Fear is labeled \\"C. de la Forest\\". The earliest exploration of North Carolina by a European expedition is likely that of Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524. An Italian from Verrazzano in the province of Florence, Verrazzano was hired by French merchants in order to procure a sea route to bring silk to the city of Lyon. With the tacit support of King Francis I, Verrazzano sailed west on January 1, 1524, aboard his ship La Dauphine ahead of a flotilla that numbered three ships. The expedition made landfall at Cape Fear, and Verrazzano reported of his explorations to the King of France, > The seashore is completely covered with fine sand [15 feet] deep, which > rises in the shape of small hills about fifty paces wide ... Nearby we could > see a stretch of country much higher than the sandy shore, with many > beautiful fields and planes[sic] full of great forests, some sparse and some > dense; and the trees have so many colors, and are so beautiful and > delightful that they defy description.Mobley (2003), p 16 Verrazzano continued north along the Outer Banks, making periodic explorations as he sought a route further west towards China. When he viewed the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds opposite the Outer Banks, he believed them to be the Pacific Ocean; his reports of such helped fuel the belief that the westward route to Asia was much closer than previously believed.Powell (1977), pp 9-10 Just two years later, in 1526, a group of Spanish colonists from Hispaniola led by Lucas V√°zquez de Ayll√≥n landed at the mouth of a river they called the \\"Rio Jordan\\", which may have been the Cape Fear River. The party consisted of 500 men and women, their slaves, and horses. One of their ships wrecked off the shore, and valuable supplies were lost; this coupled with illness and rebellion doomed the colony. Ayll√≥n died on October 18, 1526, and the 150 or so survivors of that first year abandoned the colony and attempted to return to Hispaniola. Later explorers reported finding their remains along the coast; as the dead were cast off during the return trip.Powell (1977), pp 10-11. Ready (2005), pp. 18. Some sources, notably David Weber in The Spanish Frontier in North America, believe the location of the colony to be farther south; either the Waccamaw River in South Carolina or Sapelo Island in Georgia. thumb Hernando de Soto first explored west-central North Carolina during his 1539‚Äì1540 expedition. His first encounter with a native settlement in North Carolina may have been at Guaquilli near modern Hickory. In 1567, Captain Juan Pardo led an expedition from Santa Elena at Parris Island, South Carolina, then the capital of the Spanish colony in the Southeast, into the interior of North Carolina, largely following De Soto's earlier route. His journey was ordered to claim the area as a Spanish colony, pacify and convert the natives, as well as establish another route to protect silver mines in Mexico (the Spanish did not realize the distances involved). Pardo went toward the northwest to be able to get food supplies from natives.Ward (1999), pp. 229‚Äì231 Pardo and his team made a winter base at Joara (near Morganton, in Burke County), which he renamed Cuenca. They built Fort San Juan and left 30 men, while Pardo traveled further, establishing five other forts. In 1567, Pardo's expedition established a mission called Salamanca in what is now Rowan County. Pardo returned by a different route to Santa Elena. After 18 months, in the spring of 1568, natives killed all the soldiers and burned the six forts, including the one at Fort San Juan. The Spanish never returned to the interior to press their colonial claim, but this marked the first European attempt at colonization of the interior. Translation in the 1980s of a journal by Pardo's scribe Bandera have confirmed the expedition and settlement. Archaeological finds at Joara indicate that it was a Mississippian culture settlement and also indicate Spanish settlement at Fort San Juan in 1567‚Äì1568. Joara was the largest mound builder settlement in the region. Records of Hernando de Soto's expedition attested to his meeting with them in 1540. British colonization =Roanoke colony= Sir Walter Raleigh, sponsor of the ill-fated Roanoke Colony The earliest English attempt at colonization in North America was Roanoke Colony of 1585‚Äì1587, the famed \\"Lost Colony\\" of Sir Walter Raleigh. The colony was established at Roanoke Island in the Croatan Sound on the leeward side of the Outer Banks. The first attempt at a settlement consisted of 100 or so men led by Ralph Lane. They built a fort, and waited for supplies from a second voyage. While waiting for supplies to return, Lane and his men antagonized the local Croatan peoples, killing several of them in armed skirmishes.Ward (1999), pp. 231‚Äì232Mobley (2003), pp 20-21 The interactions were not all negative, as the local people did teach the colonists some survival skills, such as the construction of dugout canoes.Powell (1977), p. 15 When the relief was long in coming, the colonists began to give up hope; after a chance encounter with Sir Francis Drake, the colonists elected to accept transport back to England with him. When the supply ships did arrive, only a few days later, they found the colony abandoned. The ship's captain, Richard Grenville, left a small force of 15 men to hold the fort and supplies and wait for a new stock of colonists.Ward (1999), p. 232Powell (1977), pp. 15‚Äì16 In 1587, a third ship arrived carrying 110 men, 17 women, and 9 children, some of whom had been part of the first group of colonists that had earlier abandoned Roanoke. This group was led by John White. Among them was a pregnant woman; she gave birth to the first English subject born in North America, Virginia Dare. The colonists found the remains of the garrison left behind, likely killed by the Croatan who had been so antagonized by Lane's aggressiveness. White had intended to pick up the remains of the garrison, abandon Roanoke Island, and settle in the Chesapeake Bay. White's Portuguese pilot, Simon Fernandez, refused to carry on further; rather than risk mutiny, White agreed to resettle the former colony.Ready (2005), pp. 24‚Äì25 The Spanish War prevented any further contact between the colony and England until a 1590 expedition, which found no remains of any colonists, just an abandoned colony and the letters \\"CROATOAN\\" carved into a tree, and \\"CRO\\" carved into another. Despite many investigations, no one knows what happened to the colony.Ward (1999), pp. 232‚Äì233Powell, pp. 16‚Äì18Ready (2005), p. 27 Historians widely believe that the colonists died of starvation and illness or they were being taken in and assimilated by Native Americans. =Development of North Carolina colony= The Province of North Carolina developed differently from South Carolina almost from the beginning. The Spanish experienced trouble colonizing North Carolina because it had a dangerous coastline, a lack of ports, and few inland rivers by which to navigate. In the 1650s and 1660s, settlers (mostly English) moved south from Virginia, in addition to runaway servants and fur trappers. They settled chiefly in the Albemarle borderlands region.Jonathan Edward Barth, \\"'The Sinke of America': Society in the Albemarle Borderlands of North Carolina, 1663-1729,\\" North Carolina Historical Review, Jan 2010, Vol. 87 Issue 1, pp 1-27 In 1665, the Crown issued a second charter to resolve territorial questions. As early as 1689, the Carolina proprietors named a separate deputy- governor for the region of the colony that lay to the north and east of Cape Fear. The division of the colony into North and South was completed at a meeting of the Lords Proprietors held at Craven House in London on December 7, 1710, although the same proprietors continued to control both colonies. The first colonial Governor of North Carolina was Edward Hyde who served from 1711 until 1712. North Carolina became a crown colony in 1729. Smallpox took a heavy toll in the region among Native Americans, who had no immunity to the disease, which had become endemic in Asia and Europe. The 1738 epidemic was said to have killed one-half of the Cherokee, with other tribes of the area suffering equally.\\"Cherokee Indians \\". Encyclopedia of North Carolina. Historians estimate there were about 5,000 settlers in 1700 and 11,000 in 1715. While the voluntary settlers were mostly British, some had brought Africans as laborers; most were enslaved. In the ensuing years, the settlers imported and purchased more slaves to develop plantations in the lowland areas, and the African proportion of the population rose rapidly. A colony at New Bern was composed of Swiss and German settlers. In the late eighteenth century, more German immigrants migrated south after entry into Pennsylvania. By 1712, the term \\"North Carolina\\" was in common use. In 1728, the dividing line between North Carolina and Virginia was surveyed. In 1730, the population in North Carolina was 30,000. By 1729, the Crown bought out seven of the eight original proprietors and made the region a royal colony. John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville refused to sell; in 1744 he received rights to the vast Granville Tract, constituting the northern half of North Carolina. Bath, the oldest town in North Carolina, was the first nominal capital from 1705 until 1722, when Edenton took over the role, but the colony had no permanent institutions of government until their establishment in the new capital New Bern in 1743. Raleigh became capital of North Carolina in 1792. =Immigration from north= Fry-Jefferson map depicting the Virginia Colony and surrounding provinces in 1752 The colony grew rapidly from a population of 100,000 in 1752 to 200,000 in 1765. The Lord Proprietors encouraged importing of slaves to the Province of North Carolina by instituting a headright system that gave settlers acreage for the number of slaves that they brought to the province. The geography was a factor that slowed the importation of slaves. Settlers were forced to import slaves from Virginia or South Carolina because of the poor harbors and treacherous coastline. The enslaved black population grew from 800 in 1712 to 6,000 in 1730 and about 41,000 in 1767. In the late eighteenth century, the tide of immigration to North Carolina from Virginia and Pennsylvania began to swell. The Scots-Irish (Ulster Protestants) from what is today Northern Ireland were the largest immigrant group from the British Isles to the colonies before the Revolution.David Hackett Fischer, Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America, 1986Table 3a.

Type of Ancestry Response for Regions, Divisions and States: 1980 In total, English indentured servants, who arrived mostly in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, comprised the majority of English settlers prior to the Revolution.\\"Indentured Servitude in Colonial America\\" On the eve of the American Revolution, North Carolina was the fastest-growing British colony in North America. The small family farms of Piedmont contrasted sharply with the plantation economy of the coastal region, where wealthy planters had established a slave society, growing tobacco and rice with slave labor. Differences in the settlement patterns of eastern and western North Carolina, or the low country and uplands, affected the political, economic, and social life of the state from the eighteenth until the twentieth century. The Tidewater in eastern North Carolina was settled chiefly by immigrants from rural England and the Scottish Highlands. The upcountry of western North Carolina was settled chiefly by Scots-Irish, English and German Protestants, the so-called \\"cohee\\". During the Revolutionary War, the English and Highland Scots of eastern North Carolina tended to remain loyal to the British Crown, because of longstanding business and personal connections with Great Britain. The English, Welsh, Scots-Irish and German settlers of western North Carolina tended to favor American independence from Britain. With no cities and very few towns or villages, the colony was rural and thinly populated. Local taverns provided multiple services ranging from strong drink, beds for travelers, and meeting rooms for politicians and businessmen. In a world sharply divided along lines of ethnicity, gender, race, and class, the tavern keepers' rum proved a solvent that mixed together all sorts of locals, as well as travelers. The increasing variety of drinks on offer and the emergence of private clubs meeting in the taverns showed that genteel culture was spreading from London to the periphery of the English world.Daniel B. Thorp, \\"Taverns and tavern culture on the southern colonial frontier,\\" Journal of Southern History, Nov 1996, Vol. 62#4 pp. 661‚Äì88 The courthouse was usually the most imposing building in a county. Jails were often an important part of the courthouse but were sometimes built separately. Some county governments built tobacco warehouses to provide a common service for their most important export crop.Alan D. Watson, \\"County Buildings and Other Public Structures in Colonial North Carolina,\\" North Carolina Historical Review, Oct 2005, Vol. 82 Issue 4, pp. 427‚Äì463, =Slaves= In the early years, the line between white indentured servants and African laborers was vague, as some Africans also arrived under an indenture, before more were transported as slaves. Some Africans were allowed to earn their freedom before slavery became a lifelong racial caste. Most of the free colored families found in North Carolina in the censuses of 1790-1810 were descended from unions or marriages between free white women and enslaved or free African or African-American men in colonial Virginia. Because the mothers were free, their children were born free. Such mixed-race families migrated along with their European-American neighbors into the frontier of North Carolina.Paul Heinegg, Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware. Retrieved 15 February 2008. As the flow of indentured laborers slackened because of improving economic conditions in Britain, the colony was short on labor and imported more slaves. It followed Virginia in increasing its controls on slavery, which became a racial caste of the foreign Africans. The economy's growth and prosperity were based on slave labor, devoted first to the production of tobacco. The oppressive and brutal experiences of slaves and poor whites led to their using escape, violent resistance, and theft of food and other goods in order to survive.Marvin L. Kay, et al. \\"'They Are Indeed the Constant Plague of their Tyrants': Slave Defence of a Moral Economy in Colonial North Carolina, 1748-1772,\\" Slavery & Abolition, Dec 1985, Vol. 6 Issue 3, pp 37-56 =Politics= In the late 1760s, tensions between Piedmont farmers and coastal planters developed into the Regulator movement. With specie scarce, many inland farmers found themselves unable to pay their taxes and resented the consequent seizure of their property. Local sheriffs sometimes kept taxes for their own gain and sometimes charged twice for the same tax. Governor William Tryon's conspicuous consumption in the construction of a new governor's mansion at New Bern fueled the resentment of yeoman farmers. As the western districts were under-represented in the colonial legislature, the farmers could not obtain redress by legislative means. The frustrated farmers took to arms and closed the court in Hillsborough, North Carolina. Tryon sent troops to the region and defeated the Regulators at the Battle of Alamance in May 1771, where several leaders of the movement, including Captain Robert Messer, Captain Benjamin Merrill, and Captain Robert Matear, were captured and hanged. New nation =American Revolution= Signers Monument, Guilford Courthouse National Military Park, Greensboro, North Carolina The demand for independence came from local grassroots organizations called \\"Committees of Safety\\". The First Continental Congress had urged their creation in 1774. By 1775, they had become counter-governments that gradually replaced royal authority and took control of local governments. They regulated the economy, politics, morality, and militia of their individual communities, but many local feuds were played out under ostensibly political affiliations. After December 1776 they came under the control of a more powerful central authority, the Council of Safety.Alan D. Watson, \\"The Committees of Safety and the Coming of the American Revolution in North Carolina, 1774-1776,\\" North Carolina Historical Review, April 1996, Vol. 73 Issue 2, pp. 131‚Äì155 In the spring of 1776, North Carolinians, meeting in the fourth of their Provincial Congresses, drafted the Halifax Resolves, a set of resolutions that empowered the state's delegates to the Second Continental Congress to concur in a declaration of independence from Great Britain. In July 1776, the new state became part of the new nation, the United States of America. In 1775, the Patriots easily expelled the Royal governor and suppressed the Loyalists. In November 1776, elected representatives gathered in Halifax to write a new state constitution, which remained in effect until 1835.Jeffrey J. Crow, A Chronicle of North Carolina during the American Revolution, 1763-1789 (1975) One of the most prominent Loyalists was John Leggett, a rich planter in Bladen County. He organized and led one of the few loyalist brigades in the South (the North Carolina Volunteers, later known as the Royal North Carolina Regiment). After the war, Colonel Leggett and some of his men moved to Nova Scotia; the British gave them free land grants in County Harbour as compensation for their losses in the colony. The great majority of Loyalists remained in North Carolina and became citizens of the new nation.Carole Watterson Troxler, \\"'The Great Man of the Settlement': North Carolina's John Leggett At Country Harbour, Nova Scotia, 1783-1812,\\" North Carolina Historical Review, July 1990, Vol. 67 Issue 3, pp. 285‚Äì314 Local militia units proved important in the guerrilla war of 1780‚Äì81. Soldiers who enlisted in George Washington's Continental Army fought in numerous battles up and down the land.Hugh F. Rankin, The North Carolina Continental Line in the American Revolution (1977) Struggling with a weak tax base, state officials used impressment to seize food and supplies needed for the war effort, paying the farmers with promissory notes. To raise soldiers, state officials tried a draft law. Both policies created significant discontent that undermined support for the new nation.John R. Maass, \\"'Too Grievous for a People to Bear': Impressment and Conscription in Revolutionary North Carolina,\\" Journal of Military History, Oct 2009, Vol. 73 Issue 4, pp. 1091‚Äì1115 The state's large German population, concentrated in the central counties, tried to remain neutral; the Moravians were pacifist because of strong religious beliefs, while Lutheran and Reformed Germans were passively neutral. All peace groups paid triple taxes in lieu of military service.Roger E. Sappington, \\"North Carolina and the Non-Resistant Sects during the American War of Independence,\\" Quaker History, Spring 1971, Vol. 60 Issue 1, pp. 29‚Äì47 The British were punctual in paying their regulars and their Loyalist forces, American soldiers went month after month in threadbare uniforms with no pay and scanty supplies. Belatedly, the state tried to make amends. After 1780, soldiers received cash bounties, a slave \\"or the value thereof,\\" clothing, food, and land (after 1782 they received from 640 to 1,200 acres depending on rank). Since the money supply, based on the Continental currency was subject to high inflation and loss of value, state officials valued compensation in relation to gold and silver.Paul V. Lutz, \\"A State's Concern for the Soldiers' Welfare: How North Carolina Provided for Her Troops during the Revolution,\\" North Carolina Historical Review, July 1965, Vol. 42 Issue 3, pp. 315‚Äì318 Military campaigns of 1780-81 After 1780, the British tried to rouse and arm the Loyalists, believing they were numerous enough to make a difference. The result was fierce guerrilla warfare between units of Patriots and Loyalists. Often the opportunity was seized to settle private grudges and feuds. A major American victory took place at King's Mountain along the North Carolina- South Carolina border. On October 7, 1780, a force of 1000 mountain men from western North Carolina (including what is today part of Tennessee) overwhelmed a force of some 1000 Loyalist and British troops led by Major Patrick Ferguson. The victory essentially ended British efforts to recruit more Loyalists. 1st Maryland Regiment holding the line at the Battle of Guilford. The road to the American victory at Yorktown led by North Carolina. As the British army moved north toward Virginia, the Southern Division of the Continental Army and local militia prepared to meet them. Following General Daniel Morgan's victory over the British under Banastre Tarleton at the Battle of Cowpens on January 17, 1781, the southern commander Nathanael Greene led British Lord Charles Cornwallis across the heartland of North Carolina, and away from Cornwallis's base of supply in Charleston, South Carolina. This campaign is known as \\"The Race to the Dan\\" or \\"The Race for the River.\\" Generals Greene and Cornwallis finally met at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in present-day Greensboro on March 15, 1781. Although the British troops held the field at the end of the battle, their casualties at the hands of the numerically superior Continental Army were crippling. Cornwallis had a poor strategic plan which had failed in holding his heavily garrisoned positions in South Carolina and Georgia and had failed to subdue North Carolina. By contrast, Greene used a more flexible adaptive approach that negated the British advantages and built an adequate logistical foundation for the American campaigns. Greene's defensive operations provided his forces the opportunity to later seize the strategic offensive from Comwallis and eventually reclaim the Carolinas. The weakened Cornwallis headed to the Virginia coastline to be rescued by the Royal Navy.Charles Heaton, \\"The Failure of Enlightenment Military Doctrine in Revolutionary America: The Piedmont Campaign and the Fate of the British Army in the Lower South,\\" North Carolina Historical Review, April 2010, Vol. 87 Issue 2, pp. 127‚Äì157, A French fleet repulsed the British Navy and Cornwallis, surrounded by American and French units, surrendered to George Washington, effectively ending the fighting. By 1786, the population of North Carolina had increased to 350,000. =Early Republic= The United States Constitution drafted in 1787 was controversial in North Carolina. Delegate meetings at Hillsborough in July 1788 initially voted to reject it for anti-federalist reasons. They were persuaded to change their minds partly by the strenuous efforts of James Iredell and William R. Davie and partly by the prospect of a Bill of Rights. Meanwhile, residents in the wealthy northeastern part of the state, who generally supported the proposed Constitution, threatened to secede if the rest of the state did not fall into line. A second ratifying convention was held in Fayetteville in November 1789, and on November 21, North Carolina became the 12th state to ratify the U.S. Constitution. North Carolina adopted a new state constitution in 1835. One of the major changes was the introduction of direct election of the governor, for a term of two years; prior to 1835, the legislature elected the governor for a term of one year. North Carolina's current capitol building was completed in 1840. Transportation In mid-century, the state's rural and commercial areas were connected by the construction of a 129-mile (208 km) wooden plank road, known as a \\"farmer's railroad\\", from Fayetteville in the east to Bethania (northwest of Winston-Salem). Map of the roads and railroads of North Carolina, 1854 On October 25, 1836 construction began on the Wilmington and Raleigh Railroad to connect the port city of Wilmington with the state capital of Raleigh. In 1849, the North Carolina Railroad was created by an act of the legislature to extend that railroad west to Greensboro, High Point, and Charlotte. During the Civil War, the Wilmington-to-Raleigh stretch of the railroad would be vital to the Confederate war effort; supplies shipped into Wilmington would be moved by rail through Raleigh to the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. Rural life During the antebellum period, North Carolina was an overwhelmingly rural state, even by Southern standards. In 1860, only one North Carolina town, the port city of Wilmington, had a population of more than 10,000. Raleigh, the state capital, had barely more than 5,000 residents. The majority of white families comprised the Plain Folk of the Old South, or \\"yeoman farmers.\\" They owned their own small farms and occasionally had a slave or two. Most of their efforts were to build up the farm and feed their families, with a little surplus sold on the market in order to pay taxes and buy necessities.Charles C. Bolton, Poor Whites of the Antebellum South: Tenants and Laborers in Central North Carolina and Northeast Mississippi (Duke University Press, 1994) Plantations, slavery and free blacks After the Revolution, Quakers and Mennonites worked to persuade slaveholders to free their slaves. Some were inspired by their efforts and the revolutionary ideas to arrange for manumission of their slaves. The number of free people of color in the state rose markedly in the first couple of decades after the Revolution.John Hope Franklin, Free Negroes of North Carolina, 1789‚Äì1860, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1941, reprint, 1991 Most of the free people of color in the censuses of 1790-1810 were descended from African Americans who became free in colonial Virginia, the children of unions and marriages between white women and African men.Paul Heinegg, Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware, 1995-2005 These descendants migrated to the frontier during the late eighteenth century along with white neighbors. Free people of color also became concentrated in the eastern coastal plain, especially at port cities such as Wilmington and New Bern, where they could get a variety of jobs and had more freedom in the cities. Restrictions increased beginning in the 1820s; movement by free people of color between counties was prohibited. Additional restrictions against their movements in 1830 under a quarantine act. Free mariners of color on visiting ships were prohibited from having contact with any blacks in the state,Merze Tate, Review: \\" The Free Negro in North Carolina, 1790-1860 by John Hope Franklin\\", The Journal of Negro Education, Vol. 13, No. 1, Winter, 1944 in violation of United States treaties. In 1835, free people of color lost the right to vote, following white fears aroused after Nat Turner's Slave Rebellion in 1831. By 1860, there were 30,463 free people of color who lived in the state but could not vote.Franklin (1941/1991), \\"The Free Negro in North Carolina\\" Most of North Carolina's slave owners and large plantations were located in the eastern portion of the state. Although its plantation system was smaller and less cohesive than those of Virginia, Georgia or South Carolina, significant numbers of planters were concentrated in the counties around the port cities of Wilmington and Edenton, as well as in Piedmont around the cities of Raleigh, Charlotte, and Durham. Planters owning large estates wielded significant political and socio-economic power in antebellum North Carolina, placing their interests above those of the generally non-slave holding \\"yeoman\\" farmers of the western part of the state. \\"By 1860, the state legislature had a higher percentage (85) of politicians owning human beings than any statehouse in the country.\\" While slaveholding was less concentrated in North Carolina than in some Southern states, according to the 1860 census, more than 330,000 people, or 33% of the population of 992,622, were enslaved African Americans. They lived and worked chiefly on plantations in the eastern Tidewater and the upland areas of Piedmont. Civil War to 1900 =Civil War= In 1860, North Carolina was a slave state, in which about one-third of the population of 992,622 were enslaved African Americans. This was a smaller proportion than many Southern states. In addition, the state had just over 30,000 Free Negroes.Historical Census Browser, 1860 US Census, University of Virginia . Retrieved 21 March 2008. There were relatively few large plantations or old aristocratic families. North Carolina was reluctant to secede from the Union when it became clear that Republican Abraham Lincoln had won the presidential election. With the attack on Fort Sumter in April 1861, in Lincoln's call for troops to march to South Carolina, the unionist element virtually collapsed in both of the states, and North Carolina joined the Confederacy. North Carolina was the site of few battles, but it provided at least 125,000 troops to the Confederacy far more than any other state. Approximately 40,000 of those troops never returned home, dying of disease, battlefield wounds, and starvation. North Carolina also supplied about 15,000 Union troops.Classbrain.com Confederate troops from all parts of North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the Army of Northern Virginia, the Confederacy's most famous army. The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at Bentonville, which was a futile attempt by Confederate General Joseph Johnston to slow Union General William Tecumseh Sherman's advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865. In April 1865 after losing the Battle of Morrisville, Johnston surrendered to Sherman at Bennett Place, in what is today Durham, North Carolina. This was the next to last major Confederate Army to surrender. North Carolina's port city of Wilmington was the last major Confederate port for blockade runners; it fell in the spring of 1865 after the nearby Second Battle of Fort Fisher. Elected in 1862, Governor Zebulon Baird Vance tried to maintain state autonomy against Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The Union's naval blockade of Southern ports and the breakdown of the Confederate transportation system took a heavy toll on North Carolina residents, as did the runaway inflation of the war years. In the spring of 1863, there were food riots in North Carolina as town dwellers found it hard to buy food. On the other hand, blockade runners brought prosperity several to port cities, until they were shut down by the Union Navy in 1864‚Äì65. Union captures Fort Fisher, 1865. Even after secession, some North Carolinians refused to support the Confederacy. This was particularly true of non-slave-owning farmers in the state's mountains and western Piedmont region. Some of these farmers remained neutral during the war, while some covertly supported the Union cause during the conflict. Approximately 2,000 white North Carolinians from western North Carolina enlisted in the Union Army and fought for the North in the war. In addition, black men rapidly volunteered to fill two Union regiments raised in the coastal areas of the state that were occupied by Union forces in 1862 and 1863. Bennett Place, historic site of major Confederate surrender in Durham, North Carolina. =Reconstruction era= During Reconstruction, many African- American leaders arose from people free before the war, men who had escaped to the North and decided to return, and educated migrants from the North who wanted to help in the postwar years. Many who had been in the North had gained some education before their return. In general, however, illiteracy was a problem shared in the early postwar years by most African Americans and about one-third of the whites in the state. A number of white northerners migrated to North Carolina to work and invest. While feelings in the state were high against carpetbaggers, of the 133 persons at the constitutional convention, only 18 were Northern carpetbaggers and 15 were African American. North Carolina was readmitted to the Union in 1868, after ratifying a new state constitution. It included provisions to establish public education for the first time, prohibit slavery, and adopt universal suffrage. It also provided for public welfare institutions for the first time: orphanages, public charities and a penitentiary.W.E.B. Du Bois, Black Reconstruction in America, 1860-1180.New York: Harcourt Brace, 1935; reprint, New York: The Free Press, 1998, pp.529-531 The legislature ratified the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In 1870, the Democratic Party regained power in the state. Governor William W. Holden had used civil powers and spoken out to try to combat the Ku Klux Klan's increasing violence, which was used to suppress black and Republican voting. Conservatives accused him of being head of the Union League, believing in social equality between the races, and practicing political corruption. But, when the legislature voted to impeach him, it charged him only with using and paying troops to put down insurrection (Ku Klux Klan activity) in the state. Holden was impeached, and turned over his duties to Lieutenant Governor Tod R. Caldwell on December 20, 1870. The trial began on January 30, 1871, and lasted nearly three months. On March 22, the North Carolina Senate found Holden guilty and ordered him removed from office. He was the first governor in the United States to be removed from office through impeachment. After the national Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 went into effect in an effort to reduce violence in the South, the U.S. Attorney General, Amos T. Akerman, vigorously prosecuted Klan members in North Carolina. During the late 1870s, there was renewed violence in the Piedmont area, where whites tried to suppress minority black voting in elections. Beginning in 1875, the Red Shirts, a paramilitary group, openly worked for the Democrats to suppress black voting. =Post-Reconstruction and disfranchisement= As in other Southern states, after white Democrats regained power, they worked to re-establish white supremacy politically and socially. Paramilitary groups such as the Red Shirts beginning in 1875 worked openly to disrupt black political meetings, intimidate leaders and directly challenge voters in campaigns and elections, especially in the Piedmont area. They sometimes physically attacked black voters and community leaders. Despite this, in the 1880s, black officeholders were at a peak in local offices, where much business was done, as they were elected from black-majority districts.Michael J. Klarman, From Jim Crow to Civil Rights: The Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial Equality, New York: Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 30 White Democrats regained power on the state level. Post-Civil War racial politics encouraged efforts to divide and co-opt groups. In the drive to regain power, Democrats supported an effort by state representative Harold McMillan to create separate school districts in 1885 for \\"Croatan Indians\\" to gain their support. Of mixed race and claiming Native American heritage, the families had been classified as free people of color in the antebellum years and did not want to send their children to public school classes with former slaves. After having voted with the Republicans, they switched to the Democrats.Blu,The Lumbee Problem, 62 (In 1913, the group changed their name to \\"Cherokee Indians of Robeson County\\", \\"Siouan Indians of Lumber River\\" in 1934-1935, and were given limited recognition as Indians by the U.S. Congress as Lumbee in 1956.Paul Heinegg, Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware, 2005 The Lumbee are one of several Native American tribes that have been officially recognized by the state in the 21st century.) In 1894, after years of agricultural problems in the state, an interracial coalition of Republicans and Populists won a majority of seats in the state legislature and elected as governor, Republican Daniel L. Russell, the Fusionist candidate. That year North Carolina's 2nd congressional district elected George Henry White, an educated African- American attorney, as its third black representative to Congress since the Civil War. Democrats worked to break up the biracial coalition, and reduce voting by blacks and poor whites. In 1896, North Carolina passed a statute that made voter registration more complicated and reduced the number of blacks on voter registration rolls. In 1898, in an election characterized by violence, fraud, and intimidation of black voters by Red Shirts, white Democrats regained control of the state legislature. Albert Shaw, The American Monthly Review of Reviews, Vol. XXII, Jul-Dec 1900, p. 274 Two days after the election, a small group of whites in Wilmington implemented their plan to take over the city government if the Democrats were not elected, although the mayor and a majority of city council were white. The cadre led 1500 whites against the black newspaper and neighborhood in what is known as the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898; the mob and other whites killed up to 90 blacks. The cadre forced the resignation of Republican officeholders, including the white mayor, and mostly white aldermen, and ran them out of town. They replaced them with their own slate and that day elected Alfred M. Waddell as mayor. This is the only coup d'√©tat (violent overthrow of an elected government) in United States history. Country store in Gordonton, North Carolina, 1939 In 1899, the Democrat-dominated state legislature ratified a new constitution with a suffrage amendment, whose requirements for poll taxes, literacy tests, lengthier residency, and similar mechanisms disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. Illiterate whites were protected by a grandfather clause so that if a father or grandfather had voted in 1860 (when all voters were white), his sons or grandsons did not have to pass the literacy test of 1899. This grandfather clause excluded all blacks, as free people of color had lost the franchise in 1835. The US Supreme Court ruled in 1915 that such grandfather clauses were unconstitutional. Every voter had to pay the poll tax until it was abolished by the state in 1920. Congressman White, an African-American Republican, said after passage of this constitution, \\"I cannot live in North Carolina and be a man and be treated as a man.\\" He had been re-elected in 1898, but the next year announced his decision not to seek a third term, saying he would leave the state instead.\\"George Henry White\\" , Black Americans in Congress, US Congress He moved his law practice to Washington, DC and later to Philadelphia, where he founded a commercial bank. By 1904, black voter turnout had been utterly reduced in North Carolina. Contemporary accounts estimated that 75,000 black male citizens lost the vote.Richard H. Pildes, \\"Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon\\", Constitutional Commentary, Vol. 17, 2000, pp. 12‚Äì13 In 1900, blacks numbered 630,207 citizens, about 33% of the state's total population,Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia , accessed 15 Mar 2008 and were unable to elect representatives. With control of the legislature, white Democrats passed Jim Crow laws establishing racial segregation in public facilities and transportation. African Americans worked for more than 60 years to regain full power to exercise the suffrage and other constitutional rights of citizens. Without the ability to vote, they were excluded from juries and lost all chance at local offices: sheriffs, justices of the peace, jurors, county commissioners and school board members, which were the active site of government around the start of the 20th century.Klarman (2006), From Jim Crow to Civil Rights, p. 32 Suppression of the black vote and re-establishment of white supremacy suppressed knowledge of what had been a thriving black middle class in the state. The Republicans were no longer competitive in state politics, although they had strength in the mountain districts. 20th century Reacting to segregation, disfranchisement in 1899, and difficulties in agriculture in the early twentieth century, tens of thousands of African Americans left the state (and hundreds of thousands began to leave the rest of the South) for the North and Midwest - for better opportunities in the Great Migration; in its first wave, from 1910‚Äì1940, one and a half million African Americans left the South. They went to Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia; and sometimes further north, to industrial cities where there was work, usually taking the trains to connecting cities. On December 17, 1903, the Wright brothers made the first successful airplane flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In the early 20th century, North Carolina launched both a major education initiative and a major road-building initiative to enhance the state's economy. The educational initiative was launched by Governor Charles Aycock in 1901. Supposedly, North Carolina built one school per day while Aycock was in office. In addition, North Carolina was helped in the 1920s and 1930s by the Julius Rosenwald Fund, which contributed matching funds to local communities for the construction of thousands of schools for African Americans in rural areas throughout the South. Black parents organized to raise the money, and donated land and labor to build improved schools for their children. =World War I= By 1917-1919 because of disfranchisement of African Americans and establishment of a one-party state, North Carolina Democrats held powerful, senior positions in Congress, holding two of 23 major committee chairmanships in the Senate and four of 18 in the House, as well as the post of House majority leader. White Southerners controlled a block of votes and important chairmanships in Congress because, although they had disfranchised the entire black population of the South, they had not lost any congressional apportionment.Richard M. Valelly, The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement University of Chicago Press, 2009, pp. 146‚Äì147 With the delegation under control of the Democrats, they exercised party discipline. Their members gained seniority by being re-elected for many years. During the early decades of the 20th century, the Congressional delegation gained the construction of several major U.S. military installations, notably Fort Bragg, in North Carolina. President Woodrow Wilson, a fellow Democrat from the South who was elected due to the suppression of the Republican Party in the South, remained highly popular during World War I and was generally supported by the North Carolina delegation. During the war, the decrepit shipbuilding industry was revived by large-scale federal contracts landed with Congressional help. Nine new shipyards opened in North Carolina to build ships under contracts from the Emergency Fleet Corporation. Four steamships were made of concrete, but most were made of wood or steel. Thousands of workers rushed to high-paying jobs, as the managers found a shortage of highly skilled mechanics, as well as a housing shortage. Although unions were weak, labor unrest and managerial inexperience caused the delays. The shipyards closed at the end of the war.William N. Still, Jr., \\"Shipbuilding and North Carolina: The World War I Experience,\\" American Neptune, June 1981, Vol. 41#3 pp. 188‚Äì207 The North Carolina Woman's Committee was established as a state agency during the war, headed by Laura Holmes Reilly of Charlotte. Inspired by ideas of the Progressive Movement, it registered women for many volunteer services, promoted increased food production and the elimination of wasteful cooking practices, helped maintain social services, worked to bolster morale of white and black soldiers, improved public health and public schools, and encouraged black participation in its programs. Members helped cope with the devastating Spanish flu epidemic that struck worldwide in late 1918, with very high fatalities. The committee was generally successful in reaching middle-class white and black women. It was handicapped by the condescension of male lawmakers, limited funding, and tepid responses from women on the farms and working-class districts.William J. Breen, \\"Seven Women in the War: The North Carolina Woman's Committee, 1917-1919\\", North Carolina Historical Review, July 1978, Vol. 55#3 pp. 251‚Äì283, The state's road-building initiative began in the 1920s after the automobile became a popular mode of transportation. =Great Depression and World War II= The state's farmers were badly hurt in the early years of the Great Depression, but benefited greatly by the New Deal programs, especially the tobacco program which guaranteed a steady flow of relatively high income to farmers,Anthony J. Badger, Prosperity Road: The New Deal, Tobacco, and North Carolina (1980) and the cotton program, which raised the prices farmers received for their cropsDouglas Carl Abrams, Conservative Constraints: North Carolina and the New Deal (1992) (The cotton program caused a rise in prices of cotton goods for consumers during the Depression). The textile industry in the Piedmont region continued to attract cotton mills relocating from the North, where unions had been effective in gaining better wages and conditions. Prosperity largely returned during World War II. This state supplied the armed forces with more textiles than any other state in the nation. Remote mountain places joined the national economy and had their first taste of prosperity. Hundreds of thousands of young men and a few hundred young women entered the military from this state. Political scientist V. O. Key analyzed the state political culture in depth in the late 1940s, and concluded it was exceptional in the South for its \\"progressive outlook and action in many phases of life\\", especially in the realm of industrial development, commitment to public education, and a moderate-pattern segregation that was relatively free of the rigid racism found in the Deep South.V. O. Key Jr., Southern Politics in State and Nation (1949) p 205 =Education and the economy= North Carolina invested heavily in its system of higher education and also became known for its excellent universities. Three major institutions compose the state's Research Triangle: the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (chartered in 1789 and greatly expanded from the 1930s on), North Carolina State University, and Duke University (rechartered in 1924). Conditions of the public elementary and high schools were not as noteworthy. In the 1960s Governor Terry Sanford, a racial moderate, called for more spending on the schools, but Sanford's program featured regressive taxation that fell disproportionately on the workers. In the 1970s Governor James B. Hunt Jr., another racial moderate championed educational reform. Reformers have stressed the central role of education in the modernization of the state and economic growth. They have also aggressively pursued economic development, attracting out-of-state and international corporations with special tax deals and infrastructure development. In the late 20th century, Charlotte became the nation's number two banking center, after New York. =Civil Rights Movement= In 1931, the Negro Voters League was formed in Raleigh to press for voter registration. The city had an educated and politically sophisticated black middle class; by 1946 the League had succeeded in registering 7,000 black voters, an achievement in the segregated South, since North Carolina had essentially disfranchised blacks with provisions of a new constitution in 1899, excluding them from the political system and strengthening its system of white supremacy and Jim Crow. The work of racial desegregation and enforcement of constitutional civil rights for African Americans continued throughout the state. In the first half of the 20th century, other African Americans voted with their feet, moving in the Great Migration from rural areas to northern and midwestern cities where there were industrial jobs. During World War II, Durham's Black newspaper, The Carolina Times, edited by Louis Austin, took the lead in promoting the \\"Double V\\" strategy among civil rights activists. The strategy was to energize blacks to fight victory abroad against the Germans and Japanese while fighting for victory at home against white supremacy and racial oppression. Activists demanded an end to racial inequality in education, politics, economics, and the armed forces.Jerry Gershenhorn, \\"Double V in North Carolina,\\" Journalism History, Fall 2006, Vol. 32 Issue 3, pp. 156‚Äì167, In 1960, nearly 25% of the state residents were African American: 1,114,907 citizens who had been living without their constitutional rights.Historical Census Browser, 1960 US Census, University of Virginia , accessed 15 Mar 2008 African-American college students began the sit-in at the Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro on February 1, 1960, sparking a wave of sit-ins across the American South. They continued the Greensboro sit-in sporadically for several months until, on July 25, African Americans were at last allowed to eat at Woolworth's. Integration of public facilities followed. During 1963, in Greenville there was a boycott of Christmas lights, known as the Black Christmas boycott to protest the lack of hiring of black employees during the Christmas season. Together with continued activism in states throughout the South and raising awareness throughout the country, African Americans' moral leadership gained the passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Throughout the state, African Americans began to participate fully in political life. In October 1973, Clarence Lightner was elected mayor of Raleigh, making history as the first popularly elected mayor of the city, the first African American to be elected mayor, and the first African American to be elected mayor in a white-majority city of the South. In 1992, the state elected Eva Clayton as its first African-American congressman since George Henry White in 1898. In 1979, North Carolina ended the state eugenics program. Since 1929, the state Eugenics Board had deemed thousands of individuals \\"feeble-minded\\" and had them forcibly sterilized. The victims of the program were disproportionately minorities and the poor. In 2011, the state legislature debated whether the estimated 2,900 living victims of North Carolina's sterilization regime would be compensated for the harm inflicted upon them by the state; no action was taken. In 1971, North Carolina ratified its third state constitution. A 1997 amendment to this constitution granted the governor veto power over most legislation. 21st Century =Recent changes= During the last 25 years, North Carolina's population has increased as its economy has grown, especially in finance and knowledge-based industries, attracting people from the North and Midwest. The number of workers in agriculture has declined sharply because of mechanization, and the textile industry has steadily declined because of globalization and movement of jobs in this industry out of the country.Peter A. Coclanis, and Louis M. Kyriakoudes, \\"Selling Which South? Economic Change in Rural and Small-Town North Carolina in an Era of Globalization, 1940-2007,\\" Southern Cultures, Winter 2007, Vol. 13#3 pp 86-102 Most of the growth in jobs and residents has taken place in metropolitan areas of Piedmont, in Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, Greensboro.Christopher A.

Early life Unwin was born in the town of Bolton upon Dearne, near Barnsley, Yorkshire, on 18 January 1913. He enlisted in the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1929 as an administrative apprentice and, in 1935, was selected for pilot training.Price 1997, p. 68. Upon completion of training he was posted to No. 19 Squadron RAF as a sergeant pilot. RAF career =Spitfire trials= No. 19 Squadron was the first unit to receive the Supermarine Spitfire in 1938, and Unwin was one of the first to fly the machine (K9792) on 16 August.Price 1997, p. 70. Unwin carried out intensive trials in the type, flying 15 different Spitfires. During these trials, on 9 March 1939, Unwin deliberately crashed a Spitfire (K9797) following an engine failure to avoid a children's playground at Acton, Suffolk. =Battle of France= Unwin's first combat experience came during the final phase of the French Campaign during the Battle of Dunkirk. During a nine-day period of patrols between 26 May and 4 June Unwin claimed three kills and a probable during Operation Dynamo. Unwin described his first combat as stage fright: The next day Unwin claimed his first kill, a Henschel Hs 126. The German pilot had used his slow speed and high manoeuvrability to evade the attacks of two fellow pilots, while retreating into Belgian airspace. The order was given to give up and the squadron turned away. As they did so Unwin saw the German straighten out. Feigning radio failure, Unwin dived on the Hs 126 and \\"pumped 240 rounds\\" into it before it burst into flames and crashed. On 1 June Unwin claimed a Messerschmitt Bf 110 and a second as a probable. Unwin then claimed a Heinkel He 111 as a probable.Price 1997, p. 71. =Battle of Britain= During the Battle of Britain stationed in No. 12 Group he was credited with 14 enemy aircraft shot down by the end of 1940 and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal in October 1940 with a Bar award in December.'Aces High' Shores & Williams , page 599 On 15 September Unwin claimed three Bf 109s destroyed (Luftwaffe records indicate they were Bf 109s from JG 77) . On 18 September Unwin added a Bf 110 to his score as his 11th victory.Price 1997, p. 76. On 27 September Unwin destroyed a Bf 109- Wrk Nr 6162 of JG 52, and on 5 November scored a kill against a JG 51 Bf 109- Wrk Nr 4846. Unwin had now destroyed eight 109s.Price 1997, p. 77. On 5 November Unwin shot down his final personal victory, a Bf 110 over the English Channel. Unwin was in turn attacked by Bf 109s and Hauptmann Gerhard Sch√∂pfel of JG 26 claimed Unwin as one of two kills he claimed in that engagement, although Unwin was not shot down.Price 1997, p. 77-78. At the end of 1940 he was rested and sent as an instructor to No. 2 Central Flying School, Cranwell. In July 1941 Unwin was commissioned and then served with 16 EFTS and 2 CIS until October 1943. In April 1944 he began flying DeHavilland Mosquito fighter- bombers with No. 613 Squadron, RAF Second Tactical Air Force until October 1944. He then served at the Central Gunnery School at RAF Catfoss, and subsequently RAF Leconfield until January 1946, when he became Chief Instructor at No 608 Squadron RAuxAF. =Service after the war= Unwin remained in the RAF after the war and transitioned to Bristol Brigand aircraft in 1948. He flew this type during the Malaya conflict in 1952 and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his efforts. He retired from the RAF in 1961 as a wing commander. Later life His service-wide nickname was \\"Grumpy\\"; supposedly after he complained about the noise squadron comrade Douglas Bader made repairing one of his leg prostheses late at night in late 1939. It kept Unwin awake and he let everyone know about it. Another story relates that it was due to his reaction at being left out of the squadron's operations during the Battle of Dunkirk on 26 May 1940, due to a shortage of aircraft. In late May 2006 he was presented with a scale model of his Spitfire by Corgi Toys. George Unwin died of natural causes 28 June 2006 at the age of 93.

It is situated on the north side of the Bardeen Quad on the engineering campus along Springfield Avenue. The Grainger Engineering Library is the largest library in the United States dedicated to the study of engineering. It is one of several \\"departmental\\" libraries that constitute the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign University Library. History The Grainger Engineering Library Information Center was designed to be a model for future academic libraries. This project was made possible by William Wallace Grainger, a University of Illinois electrical engineering graduate, class of 1919. Grainger made his fortune by launching a small, mail- order electrical supplies and components business that eventually grew into W. W. Grainger, a Fortune 500 industrial supply company that is named for the entrepreneur. Grainger felt a professional commitment to make technology accessible to everyone and it was in that same spirit that his son, David Grainger, donated more than $18 million to fund the construction of the new library Information Center.Schlembach, Mary. Assistant Engineering Librarian. Personal interview. 24 October 2007. In recognition to his contribution, a brass relief of Grainger was placed in the first floor lobby of the library. The Grainger Engineering Library was dedicated on the 59th anniversary of the University of Illinois Foundation, October 14, 1994. The dedication proceedings, entitled a \\"Gateway to a New Era\\", established the largest engineering library in the country, with over holding more than 300,000 volumes. In keeping with the building's cutting edge technical advancements, the ribbon cutting ceremony was a purely digital affair. President Stanley Ikenberry, Chancellor Michael Aiken, and David Grainger, representing his father, William Wallace Grainger, pressed assigned areas on a computer touch screen to change a computerized red ribbon into a visual explosion of fireworks. In 1995 Grainger library took home the prize of Project of the Year as awarded by the Illinois Engineering Council. It also received the decoration of \\"Excellence in Masonry Design, Honorable Mention Award\\" from the Illinois/Indiana Masonry Council in 1996. It is widely accepted as one of the most technologically advanced information management centers in the nation with as many as 1,000 available computer hookups, at nearly every table, carrel, and desk. Overview The Grainger Library contains five different levels with the center area and a west area and east area. On the first floor center area there is the south main entrance, the north entrance, the main circulation desk, a computer area, a printing station, and in the fall of 2015, a coffee shop behind the elevators. The west area of the first floor contains quiet study spaces with desks for multiple people to work together, and the east area is mostly administration offices. The second and third floors entirely quiet floors. On the second and third floor, the center area contains a two-story Main Reading Gallery, which can seat 1,254 people. The west and east area both have two sections, a one-story area on each floor and two story reading galleries at the ends which can each accommodate approximately 100 people. The galleries are also used for special events and dinners. Books are mostly located on the third floor west and east areas, with some on the second floor east area. The second floor west area is mostly dedicated to study carrels. The fourth floor contains the Center for Academic Resources in Engineering (CARE), which has tutors and exam study sessions for students to use. The east part of the center area contains an EWS (Engineering Workstation) computer lab with Windows-based computers, while the west part has collaboration tables and frosted glass that act as whiteboards. There are two large rooms dedicated to exam study sessions and are facilitated with tutors. The west area contains more collaboration tables and is surrounded with group study rooms which students can reserve online in advance. The east area is a quiet study carrel area. The basement of Grainger is a quiet floor with large tables in the center area and west area. The east area contains another EWS computer lab staffed by an EWS IT employee and contains both Windows and Linux machines. In addition, the facility contains three large seminar rooms (seating around 50 people) and four smaller conference rooms. When it opened, the building had 60 networked computers, 100 terminals, 7 information kiosks, and 6 servers. The building offers group study rooms, individual study carrels, faculty and scholar studies and conference rooms. In fact, it was so technically advanced that the furniture had to be custom designed because no one had ever had data and power connected to every seat on this scale before. Grainger Engineering Library Computing and technologies The Grainger Engineering Library Information Center provides state-of-the-art computing and information technologies to assist students in research and instruction and to provide patrons access to information resources both held locally and available. The computing facilities include: :*Three computer and multi-media labs with over 100 high-end engineering workstations, which are used for CAD, numerical analysis and modeling, and software development. :*A digital imaging lab housing the Digital Library Initiative Projects, which provides access to 62,000 full-text journal articles; an information retrieval laboratory for visitors and researchers utilizing Grainger and campus resources. :*Two instructional services labs, which serve as high-tech classrooms for information literacy instruction and presentations. In addition, public-use terminals have been placed throughout the building that provide access to a statewide online catalog, Compendex, INSPEC, Aerospace Database, National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 1,000 full-text journals, and a wealth of local information resources. With more than 1.5 million people using the building in 2000, it is currently the second most visited study area on campus, second only to the Illini Union. The Grainger Engineering Library Information Center is dedicated to providing tools to assist people in their pursuit of knowledge and to serve as a showcase for the applications of information technologies. Social and financial resources A big social resource that drove this project was the need for a new library for the engineering department. The college of engineering had almost 5000 students but the current library only had 120 seats and could only house 50,000 books. Grainger Engineering Library was a major improvement over the previous library. The Grainger Engineering Library Information Center opened to the public in March 1994. A $34 million multifunctional facility, Grainger Engineering Library was primarily funded by a gift of $18.7 million from the Grainger Foundation Inc., which is headquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois. An additional $11 million of State and gift funds was expended on the project for the rerouting of steam, electrical, and telecommunications lines, the demolition of several buildings, and the construction of the new Engineering Quad (which had been under consideration since at least 1926). Statue \\"Computing a Future\\" by John Seward Johnson II at South Entrance Design and construction =Design= The library was designed by noted Indiana architect Evans Woollen III and his firm, Woollen, Molzan and Partners, based in Indianapolis. Academic libraries were one of the firm's design specialties.Mary Ellen Gadski, \\"Woollen, Molzan and Partners\\" in =Safety and precautionary Steps= In building the library, the Construction Management and Design Team were asked to make estimates of the construction costs, the schedule of the project and the environmental impact on the surrounding areas. The environmental factors include, but were not limited to noise, dust, water and debris control. In addition, contractors needed to control the amount of pollution they were ejecting into the atmosphere. For that matter, the amount of dust and debris produced were controlled by requiring the contractors to provide proper dust control materials. The noise and dust risks were minimized through the use of muffled hammers and exhausts. The contractors were also required to control the surface water in order to minimize damage to the project and adjacent buildings. They needed to provide and operate hydraulic equipment of adequate capacity to control the surface water. =Issues affecting the cost and schedule= The construction of the library was interrupted when the university experienced a flood. The project was on track and two months away from completion when the flood brought 7 to of water into the basement. The water flushed through the steam tunnels and eventually made its way to Grainger's basement. There was worry that the water's weight could have strained the building structural integrity but since the stress was spread so evenly, the building was not critically damaged. Nevertheless, the basement had to be redone and the project was delayed 3 months. Also, the initial plan in the construction of Grainger did not include a north entrance. It was deemed as an expensive plan to have a second entrance because of the security risk.Schlembach, Mary. In addition to metal detectors and such, both doors must be worked during operating hours of the library. Even so, due to the number of request from faculties and students coming in from the north side, a second entrance was built. Due to the above issues, the project was over budget and was behind schedule by approximately two months. =Personnel involved= There were 3 University clients involved: Capital Programs, Operation and Maintenance, and the Engineering school. The project was done with a construction manager, P.K. DeMars. In addition, there were 28 subcontractor contracts (not including the 20 or so for furniture). Some consultants hired on the project were an acoustician and a lighting specialist. * Architect: Woollen, Molzan and Partners * Structural Engineer: Lemessurier Consultants * Mechanical ‚Äì Electrical Engineer: Henneman, Raufeisen & Associates * University's Project Manager: Tim Kerestes * Lighting Specialist: Bill Lam See also *Grainger College of Engineering References Library buildings completed in 1994 University and college academic libraries in the United States Libraries in Illinois University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign Buildings and structures of the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign Libraries established in 1994 1994 establishments in Illinois W.

Despite a relatively successful run at releasing various genres of music under the Dino label, increasing competition in the Compilation sector forced Dino to close down in 1997 after releasing just over 130 different albums in eight years. Major companies such as EMI and Virgin became fiercely competitive in the wake of their successful Now That's What I Call Music brand, while BMG launched their own Compilation subsidiary Global Television, Warner Music launched warner.esp.tv, Sony Music released their compilations under the Sony Music TV banner and Polygram became Universal in 1999 and their TV advertised material was released on Universal Music TV. However, prior to its demise, Dino did score many hits in varying genres of music. As noted, Dance was a speciality for the label although 1970s revival albums, Love Songs and A.O.R Rock collections all became big sellers for the label. Series released by Dino Entertainment =That Loving Feeling= The first series Dino released were That Loving Feeling which launched in December 1989. Their particular longevity was because Dance compilations dominated the Compilation Chart in 1989 and 1990 and Love Songs made a welcome change to the older Music buyer. *That Loving Feeling Volume 1 (12/89. #3. 14 wks) *That Loving Feeling Volume 2 (03/90. #5. 26 wks) *That Loving Feeling Volume 3 (06/90. #1. 31 wks) *That Loving Feeling Volume 4 (04/91. #4. 14 wks) *That Loving Feeling Volume 5 (10/91. #2. 15 wks) *That Loving Feeling Volume 6 (09/93. #3. 12 wks) *That Loving Feeling Volume 7 (08/94. #4. 10 wks) *The Very Best of That Loving Feeling (12/93. #2. 21 wks) =Hardcore= These Dance compilations released by Dino contained the word Hardcore somewhere in the title and became a very successful series between 1991 and 1992. These albums were released as a single-CD format, with 20 tracks on each. Hardcore albums always contained big dance hits first, and then less well-known, underground tracks at the end, making the series an attractive purchase for mainstream dance fans as well as underground followers of the genre. *Hardcore Uproar (03/91. #1. 9 wks) *Hardcore Dancefloor (07/91. #2. 10 wks) *Hardcore Ecstasy (11/91. #1. 16 wks) *Essential Hardcore (12/91. #1. 10 wks) *Heavenly Hardcore (03/92. #2. 9 wks) =Energy Rush= After a series of one-off Dance compilations including Cold Sweat and Trance Dance, Dino launched a new Dance series called Energy Rush in late 1992 which out-lasted the Hardcore series by many years. The formats were identical, a single-CD release with chart hits at the beginning of the album and more club-orientated material at the end. Like Telstar's earlier Deep Heat series, each release had a suffix naming each volume. The series ended in 1995 when Dance music became less popular, with genres such as Britpop and R&B; gaining more mainstream success. *Energy Rush (10/92. #1. 6 wks) *Energy Rush II (12/92. #7. 7 wks) *Energy Rush Level 3 (01/93. #3. 6 wks) *Energy Rush Presents Dance Hits 93 (04/93. #1. 12 wks) *Energy Rush Phase 4 (06/93. #2. 6 wks) *Energy Rush Factor 5 (09/93. #3. 5 wks) *Energy Rush Presents Dance Hits of the Year (10/93. #3. 13 wks) *Energy Rush Safe Six (12/93. #5. 7 wks) *Energy Rush - Euro Dance Hits 94 (03/94. #5. 4 wks) *Energy Rush 7th Heaven (04/94. #2. 5 wks) *Energy Rush Xtermin8 (05/94. #1. 8 wks) *Energy Rush Dance Hits 94 (08/94. #3. 8 wks) *Energy Rush K9 (02/95. #3. 4 wks) =Pure Swing= This successful series focused on current and past R&B; and Hip hop tracks or \\"new jack swing\\", with the genre becoming more popular with mainstream buyers. The series launched in March 1995 and ran for several volumes until 1996. Usually issued as a single-CD, some of the releases (Pure Swing IV for example) were double-CDs. *Pure Swing (03/95. #3. 9 wks) *Pure Swing II (06/95. #4. 5 wks) *Pure Swing III (09/95. #3. 8 wks) *Pure Swing IV (11/95. #1. 7 wks) *Pure Swing V (01/96. #5. 6 wks) *Pure Swing 96 (04/96. #9. 3 wks) =Drivetime= The Drivetime series brought together popular 'driving anthems', with tracks often made popular through extensive Radio play, hence the title's borrowing of many Radio Stations' evening programme name. Although not a huge success in chart-terms, this series however contained many rare tracks previously difficult to find on CD at the time. The four volumes were all double-CD releases, each containing between 34 and 38 tracks ranging from the 1960s through to more recent radio hits of the time. *Drivetime (04/95. #5. 8 wks) *Drivetime 2 (07/95. #4. 7 wks) *Drivetime 3 (01/96. #4. 6 wks) *Drivetime 4 (08/96. #8. 3 wks) When Dino Entertainment closed in 1997, the brand transferred to Universal Music who released several compilations using the Drivetime name, although these were less successful, failing to track the Compilations Chart Top 20. Other releases *The Rhythm Divine ~ Two double-CD volumes of 1970s Disco hits. *Blues Brother Soul Sister ~ Three double-CD volumes (and a 'Best of' collection) containing Blues and Soul classics. *All Time Rock Classics- Rock hits from the 70s and 80s. *Rock 'n' Roll Lovesongs ~ Two double-CD volumes of classic Rock 'n' Roll hits. *Rock 'N' Roll Is Here To Stay ~ \\"Two CD Collection of 40 Original 50's & 60's Rock 'n' Roll Hits.\\" 2 different versions with different album artwork were available with one being in a dual-style thick jewel case and the other in a 2CD flip-over style jewel case. *Stompin' Party ~ \\"40 Party Hits ranging from the 1950s to 1980s and known as \\"The World's Greatest Party Album\\" as stated on the album artwork.\\" *It's Electric ~ A successful single-CD collection of New Romantic classics.

It was the first novel by Conroy, a retired business and economic Michigan professor. It was first published in hardcover by Lyford Books in June 1995; a Science Fiction Book Club edition followed in August of the same year, and a paperback edition from Presidio Press in 2004. The novel depicts a fictitious German invasion of the United States in 1901, shortly after William McKinley begins his second term as US President.http://www.uchronia.net/label/conr1901xx.html The plot is based on an actual diplomatic crisis that nearly brought the United States and the German Empire into war during the early 20th century. Conroy was inspired by the publication of actual German invasion plans. Plot In 1901, the United States is still basking in its recent victory in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War three years prior. However, the US Army is small; its only large forces occupying the newly won possessions of the Philippines and Cuba. Germany, under Kaiser Wilhelm II, attempts to purchase the US acquisitions to compete with the British Empire. After a refusal, the Germans declare war on the US and begin to invade. They land troops on the southern shore of Long Island, New York. They soon take Brooklyn and Manhattan quickly falls, the German forces soon crossing into Connecticut. President William McKinley, overwhelmed, suffers a heart attack and dies, resulting in Vice President Theodore Roosevelt becoming the new president. Roosevelt begins to retrieve the situation, recalling several generals and giving their command to former comrades from Cuba, including Generals Leonard Wood, John Pershing and Frederick Funston. However, the first major battle against the Germans is lost, and the scattered US fleet is also unable to respond. The United Kingdom quietly furnishes the poorly-equipped Americans with modern firearms and ammunition. Americans slowly recover from the initial shock. At sea, the USS Alabama encounters and sinks three German cruisers bombarding Jacksonville, Florida. Meanwhile, in Connecticut, an American brigade, led by Funston, ambushes a German patrol and inflicts heavy casualties. The victories lift American morale, but the war soon turns into a stalemate. The Germans create a defensive perimeter between the Hudson River and the Housatonic River and fortify Central New York State. General Nelson Miles attacks the German positions along the Housatonic, in the fashion of the American Civil War, but is defeated. Roosevelt decides that the US must become a full-fledged military power if victory is to be achieved. He replaces Miles with 80-year-old former Confederate General James Longstreet and calls General Arthur MacArthur, Jr. from the Philippines to take command of the US Army in the field. Meanwhile, US Army Indian Scouts and other operatives disrupt German lines. At sea, the US Navy launches surprise attacks against German convoys in the English Channel and, closer to the American coast, sinks empty transports returning to Germany. Though the stalemate continues, the attacks hurt German morale. Then, US Navy torpedo boats and the submarine Holland disable three enemy vessels, reducing its fleet from sixteen to thirteen available battleships, and the German supply line is nearly cut. The German high command sends a massive convoy across the Atlantic Ocean, with both reinforcements and supplies, hoping to trap the American fleet. The German plan fails, and the convoy is destroyed. The German Army prepares for a massive ground offensive, hoping to break the American line and turn the American right flank. After a massive artillery barrage, the Germans drive the Americans back and tear a large gap through the American line, forcing the US troops to fall back. Then, a force of four brigades appears, driving in the Germans' exposed flank and capturing the high command. News of the naval and military defeats reaches Germany, and a revolt breaks out that overthrows Wilhelm II and places his son, Wilhelm III, on the throne, as a puppet ruler. The new German government sues for peace, ending the war. While the Americans celebrate their victory over invaders, Germany's new ruling junta, calling themselves the Third Reich, decide that the idea of a colonial empire was foolish and so plan to expand Germany's Lebensraum across Europe, with the Jews and Slavs seen as expendable.

Vassiliev emigrated to the United States, arriving in New York City in 1990 and later lived and worked in St. Paul, Minnesota.  Education  Vassiliev graduated from V.I. Surikov State Art Institute, Moscow, in 1958. In the late 1950s he became influenced by the Russian avant-garde formalists, Vladimir Favorsky (1886‚Äì1964), Robert Falk (1886‚Äì1958), and Artur Fonvizin (1883‚Äì1973).  Biography  From the 1950s through the 1980s, Vassiliev worked with friend and collaborator Erik Bulatov as a children's book illustrator. They developed a unique style of illustration that combined realist painting with graphic elements, such as text. This \\"official\\" source of income provided the means and materials for Vassiliev to take part in the Soviet Nonconformist Art movement, also known as \\"unofficial\\" or \\"dissident\\" art. Along with friends, Ilya Kabakov, Erik Bulatov and Viktor Pivovarov, Vassiliev belonged to a large group of Soviet artists that took advantage of the Nikita Khrushchev \\"thaw\\" in official policy that opened up the Soviet Union to Western culture in the years following Joseph Stalin's death in 1953.  Style  Pered rasvetom (Before the Sunrise), 1964 During this period of time Vassiliev developed his mature style. In his art Vassiliev combines the traditions of Russian Realism (art movement) of the 19th century with the Russian avant-garde of the beginning of the 20th century. \\"Vassiliev‚Äôs principal themes, which were born while he was in Russia and continue to the present day, are his memories of home and houses, roads, forests, fields, friends and family. Vassiliev always starts his creative process from a very personal memory, from his sacred space, the safeguarded inner center, and connects it with the visual image. Vassiliev masterfully incorporates elements from different times and spaces and arranges them throughout his paintings according to the logic and 'energetic' space of the painting.\\"Natalia Kolodzei. \\"The Landscape of Memory and the Question of Identity,\\" Oleg Vassiliev Memory Speaks, (Moscow: Palace Editions, 2004): 8. \\"Leading Soviet graphic artist Vladimir Favorsky was a major influence on Vassiliev's work. Favorsky emphasised the constructive qualities of image-making, understanding painting as a rhythmic organisation of space swirling about time. Such abstract aesthetic thought was alien to mainstream Soviet Realism and demonstrates the liberties afforded graphic designers during this period. With a preoccupation for the structural qualities of a composition, these aesthetics also find their origin in Russian Constructivism of the 1920s. \\"...Vassiliev's recurring preoccupation with light and shade in his oeuvre also points to a psychological dimension, with light symbolising consciousness and dark, the subconscious. Elements of German Romanticism influence his thought. He searches for answers in an unfathomable world, posing questions without obvious answers and leaving the viewer feeling nonplussed, a hallmark of Postmodernist art....\\"Sotheby's Auction Catalogue, London, New Bond Street, February 15, 2007, Modern and Contemporary Russian Art  Public collections  * The State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow, Russia * The State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia * The State Center of Contemporary Art, Moscow, Russia * The Pushkin Museum of Fine Art, Moscow, Russia * Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, Dresden, Germany * Kunstmuseum Bern, Bern, Switzerland * Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey * The Norton and Nancy Dodge Collection of Soviet Nonconformist Art, New Brunswick, New Jersey * Norsk-Russisk kultursenter, Kirkenes, Norway * Art Museum, Murmansk, Russia * Duke University Museum of Art, Durham, North Carolina * Art Museum of the University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky * Denver Art Museum, Denver, Colorado * Kolodzei Art Foundation, Highland Park, New Jersey * The Ludwig Collection, Aachen, Germany * The Costakis Collection, Athens, Greece * Art4.ru, Moscow, Russia  Exhibition history  = Solo exhibitions = * 2014 - 2015 Oleg Vassiliev: Space and Light, Zimmerli Art Museum, New Brunswick, NJ (cat.) * 2011 The Art of Oleg Vassiliev, The Museum of Russian Art, Minneapolis, MN (cat.) * 2008 Oleg Vassiliev: Recent Work, Faggionato Fine Arts, London (cat.) * 2007 Oleg Vassiliev: Drawings, Forum Gallery, New York, NY (cat.) * 2004 Memory Speaks (Themes and Variations), retrospective, The State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow, traveled to The State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg (cat.) * 2000 Recent Works, Galerie Andy Jllien, Zurich * 2000 The Past Isn‚Äôt Dead, It Isn‚Äôt Even Past, University Art Gallery, University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth (cat.) * 1999 Works 1987-1995, Blomquist, Oslo, Norway (cat.) * 1999 On Black Paper, Wake Forest University Fine Arts Gallery, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, traveled to Denison University Art Gallery, Granville, Ohio (cat.) * 1997 Oleg Vassiliev, Phoenix Gallery, Moscow * 1996 Litografier til Tsjekhovs novelle ‚ÄòHusel med Arken‚Äô, Oljemalerier Galleri Cassandra, Drobak, Norway (cat.) * 1995 Windows of Memory, Sloane Gallery, Denver * 1995 Conceptual Posters by Oleg Vassiliev, Art Museum of the University of Kentucky,Lexington * 1993 Recent Works, Phyllis Kind Gallery, New York * 1991 Oleg Vassiliev, Galeria Fernando Duran, Madrid (cat.) * 1968 Oleg Vassiliev, Bluebird Caf√©, Moscow = Group exhibitions = * 2005 Russia!

The inside of the nucleus is called the karyoplasm (or nucleoplasm). Generally, karyopherin- mediated transport occurs through the nuclear pore, which acts as a gateway into and out of the nucleus. Most proteins require karyopherins to traverse the nuclear pore. Karyopherins can act as importins (i.e. helping proteins get into the nucleus) or exportins (i.e. helping proteins get out of the nucleus). They belong to The Nuclear Pore Complex Family in the transporter classification database (TCDB). Energy for transport is derived from the Ran gradient. See Ran for further details. Upon stress, several karyopherins stop shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and are sequestered in stress granules, cytoplasmic aggregates of ribonucleoprotein complexes. Importin beta Importin beta is a specific type of karyopherin that facilitates the transport of cargo proteins into the nucleus. First, it is binding importin alpha ‚Äì another type of karyopherin that binds the cargo protein in the cytoplasm - before the cargo protein is imported into the nucleus through the nuclear pore using energy derived from the Ran gradient. Once inside the nucleus, the cargo dissociates from the karyopherins. Importin beta can also carry proteins into the nucleus without the aid of the importin alpha adapter protein.Poon, I. K.

He was a son of the founder Emperor Gao (Xiao Daocheng) and a brother of Emperor Wu (Xiao Ze).  Background  Xiao Ni was born in 444 as the second son of Xiao Daocheng and his wife Liu Zhirong (ÂäâÊô∫ÂÆπ), four years younger than his older brother Xiao Ze. Because Xiao Daocheng was a Liu Song general who contributed in military campaigns, Xiao Ni served in a number of low level government posts early in his life, including as a county magistrate and as an administrator in the census bureau. Around 466, when his father was given a greater title for his contributions in Emperor Ming of Liu Song's war for the throne with Liu Zixun, Xiao Ni was given his father's old title of Marquess of Jinshou. He later served as a general under his father during the rebellion of Emperor Ming's brother Liu Xiufan (Âäâ‰ºëÁØÑ) the Prince of Guiyang in 474, early in the reign of Emperor Ming's son Emperor Houfei. By 477, the young but violent and arbitrary Emperor Houfei was universally feared by officials and the people, for he was in the habit of roving outside the palace with his guards, killing all humans or animals that they came in contact with. One night, Emperor Houfei and his guards descended on the Xiaos' old house in Qingxi (ÈùíÊ∫™), a suburb of the capital Jiankang, where Xiao Ni was residing. Xiao Ni had his guards perform a sword dance in the courtyard, and as Emperor Houfei saw it, he assumed that Xiao Ni would be ready for any attacks, and so left. Meanwhile, Xiao Ni's father Xiao Daocheng was fearful for his own life and, as suggested by his distant cousin and associate Xiao Shunzhi (Ëï≠È†Ü‰πã), considered going to Guangling (Âª£Èôµ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) to start a rebellion there; Xiao Ni, however, opposed, reasoning that rebellions from afar rarely succeeded, and that because of Emperor Houfei's arbitrary behavior, it would be easier to act against him from within the capital. Xiao Daocheng agreed, and soon was able to conspire with Emperor Houfei's attendant Yang Yufu (Ê•äÁéâÂ§´) to assassinate Emperor Houfei and effectively take over the Liu Song, making Emperor Houfei's brother Liu Zhun emperor (as Emperor Shun), but in actuality his puppet. During this period, as Xiao Daocheng prepared to take over the throne, Xiao Ni carried the title of Duke of Yong'an, and in 478 (after Xiao Daocheng defeated Shen Youzhi, who opposed his seizure of power) was made the governor of the key Jing Province (ËçäÂ∑û, modern central and western Hubei). In 479, Xiao Daocheng had Emperor Shun yield the throne to him, ending Liu Song and starting Southern Qi. He created Xiao Ni the Prince of Yuzhang.  Under Emperor Gao  Soon after the establishment of Southern Qi, Emperor Gao recalled Xiao Ni back to Jiankang to serve as the governor of the capital region, Yang Province (ÊèöÂ∑û, modern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu), a highly important post, and a post that he would retain for the rest of his life. Xiao Ni was very close to his older brother Xiao Ze, who was created the crown prince after Emperor Gao took the throne. In one incident when Emperor Gao got exceedingly angry at Xiao Ze after being informed (while Xiao Ze was outside the capital) that both Crown Prince Ze and his jester Zhang Jingzhen (ÂºµÊôØÁúü) were being overly wasteful and using items that were only appropriate for emperors, it was Xiao Ni who rode on a horse to warn Xiao Ze what the situation was, allowing Xiao Ze to quickly return to Jiankang to react to the incident. Emperor Gao at one point considered replacing Xiao Ze with Xiao Ni, but because Xiao Ni served his brother carefully, their relationship was not affected. In 482, Emperor Gao died. Xiao Ni was said to be mourning so bitterly that his eyes and ears bled. Crown Prince Ze succeeded Emperor Gao, as Emperor Wu.  Under Emperor Wu  Emperor Wu conferred a number of honorific titles on Xiao Ni, and while publicly, Xiao Ni did not participate in policy decisions, in private they often discussed important matters of state, and Emperor Wu almost always listened to Xiao Ni's suggestions. He also frequently visited Xiao Ni's mansion, where both he and Xiao Ni would wear informal wear that brothers would wear while meeting with each other, rather than the formal clothing of an emperor and his subject. As a special honor, Emperor Wu also made Xiao Ni's wife Princess Yu be in charge of the ancestral worship of their parents and grandparents. Xiao Ni was said to be tall and attentive to his appearance, but careful in his actions. Several times he sought to transfer the powerful governorship of Yang Province to Emperor Wu's son Xiao Ziliang (Ëï≠Â≠êËâØ) the Prince of Jingling, who was also a trusted advisor of Emperor Wu, but Emperor Wu refused, telling Xiao Ni that the post was his for life. Initially, Xiao Ni did not have any sons, and probably sometime during Emperor Gao's reign, he adopted Emperor Wu's son Xiao Zixiang (Ëï≠Â≠êÈüø) as his heir apparent  a status that Xiao Zixiang, by Xiao Ni's request, continued to hold even after Xiao Ni had his own sons. However, in 488, after an incident where Xiao Zixiang threw a temper tantrum over not being able to wear the same style as his brothers (because his brothers were princes, while he was just the heir apparent of a prince), the adoption was rescinded, and Xiao Zixiang was returned to Emperor Wu's line and created the Prince of Badong. (Xiao Zixiang was subsequently executed in 490 after he killed a number of his advisors.) In 492, Xiao Ni died and was buried with great honors. In words that he left his five sons, he stated: :As for ability, some are capable and some are less capable. As for official posts, some are fortunate to be promoted while some are blocked. As for fortune, some are rich and some are poor. These are all natural phenomena, and you should not use your position to bully others. The high praise that Xiao Ni received in official histories might be related to the fact that his son Xiao Zixian (Ëï≠Â≠êÈ°Ø) was the official who was later, in the succeeding Liang Dynasty, commissioned to author the official history of Southern Qi, the Book of Qi.

In a career that spanned more than 50 years, Kellie was a member of the rock bands the V.I.P.s, Spooky Tooth and the Only Ones. He was also a prolific session musician and worked with the Who on the film soundtrack of Tommy, Joe Cocker, Traffic, George Harrison, Jerry Lee Lewis, Peter Frampton, the Bee Gees's Maurice Gibb, Gary Wright, Johnny Thunders, Luther Grosvenor, Neil Innes, Steve Gibbons, Chris Jagger, Nanette Workman, Sean Tyla, Jim Capaldi, Pat Travers and Andy Fraser. In 2014, Kellie released his debut solo album Music from The Hidden, while still a member of the Only Ones. He died on 18 January 2017 following a short illness. Early career Michael Alexander Kellie was born on 24 March 1947 in Birmingham, England, into a non-musical family. As a child, he showed an early interest in rhythm, practising on a coal shuttle with hearth brushes to simulate a snare drum. In his teen years, he joined St. Michaels Youth Club band as a drummer. He later played at \\"The Track\\" at Tudor Grange Sports Centre in Solihull. On the basis of this work, he was invited by Brian \\"Monk\\" Ffinch to play with Wayne and the Beachcombers in Birmingham, which started his career as a professional musician. In 1966, Kellie played in Birmingham in a band called the Locomotive with Chris Wood of Traffic, and later with the V.I.P.'s (later Art) in Carlisle. Manager Chris Blackwell found a singer and organist from the New York Times band named Gary Wright, added him to the line-up of Art and launched the band Spooky Tooth with Kellie, Greg Ridley, Jimmy Henshaw, Keith Emerson, Luther Grosvenor and Mike Harrison. After the initial decline of Spooky Tooth, Kellie joined Johnny Hallyday's band for a summer tour of France in 1974, before forming The Only Ones in 1976 with Peter Perrett, Alan Mair and John Perry. The Only Ones, possibly best known for the single \\"Another Girl, Another Planet\\", recorded three albums for CBS, although over time, their catalogue has contained many compilations and other releases, which now outnumber their studio albums. In February 1978, Johnny Thunders moved to London with his family, and began playing with a loose revue dubbed the Living Dead. Kellie became part of this floating line-up (that also included Perrett along with various Sex Pistols including Steve Jones and Paul Cook) and recorded Thunders‚Äô So Alone album together with his signature song \\"You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory\\". Following the Only Ones' farewell in 1981 at London's Lyceum, Kellie moved to the countryside north of Toronto, Canada, where he spent four years away from performing. He used this time to learn the piano and write songs. Break from music and later career Returning to Britain in 1985, Kellie spent several years hill farming in North Wales and Scotland where he became a shepherd. In 1999 Kellie reunited with Mike Harrison, Luther Grosvenor and Greg Ridley under the Spooky Tooth moniker. Together they released the Cross Purpose album. In 2004, Kellie reunited with Mike Harrison and Gary Wright to play dates in Germany as a new incarnation of Spooky Tooth. The band later released the DVD Nomad Poets with live performances from Worpswede and Hamburg, Germany. In 2007, the Only Ones reformed, touring the UK, Europe and Japan as well as performing on BBC TV's Later... with Jools Holland. In 2010, with the Only Ones undergoing another sabbatical, Kellie began recording his own collection of music which become his first solo album. Entitled Music from The Hidden, the album was produced by Kellie who also played drums, organ, bass and acoustic guitars, percussion and sang lead vocals. There are also contributions from Gordon Jackson (acoustic guitar), Finley Barker and Tony Kelsey (guitars), Steve Winwood (organ, mandolin and bass), Bill Hunt, Levi French and Tony Ariss (pianos), Rob Harrison (bass) Steve Gibbons (backing vocals) and Greg Platt Lake (guitar and vocals). Kellie was prominent among the musicians featured on the six-CD Jess Roden Anthology, presented by Hidden Masters. He contributed to the 2011 sessions for the Distractions re-union album, The End of the Pier, which was released on Occultation Records in 2012.

The eastern / southern end of the path was on the West Branch Susquehanna River at what is now the unincorporated village of Allenwood in Gregg Township in Union County. The northern / western end was in Old Lycoming Township just north of what is now the city of Williamsport in Lycoming County. Culbertson's Path followed White Deer Hole Creek west from Allenwood, then left to follow Spring Creek north, crossing North White Deer Ridge and Bald Eagle Mountain and following Mosquito Run to the West Branch Susquehanna River at the modern borough of Duboistown. Here it forded the river at Culbertson's Ripples (approximately the modern location of the Arch Street Bridge). From Allenwood to Spring Creek, Culbertson's Path and the Great Island Path shared the same trail. The Great Island Path led west to the Great Island (modern Lock Haven) and paths there led west to the Allegheny River and beyond. After fording the river, Culbertson's Path crossed the Great Shamokin Path (which also led west to the Great Island and beyond) to the village named \\"French Margaret's Town\\" on the west bank of Lycoming Creek (modern Williamsport). Culbertson's Path then continued north to modern Old Lycoming Township, where it joined the major Sheshequin Path, which lead north up Lycoming Creek towards the North Branch of the Susquehanna River, modern New York, and the Iroquois there. South of Allenwood, there were connections via the Great Island Path to the village of Shamokin (modern Sunbury), as well as the Virginia Road and the Penns Creek and Mahanoy Paths. The path was only wide enough for one person, but the early inhabitants of White Deer Hole valley broadened the trail to DuBoistown to take grain to Culbertson's mill on Mosquito Run (leading them to call it \\"Culbertson's path\\").

It was implemented by its Member States by 16 July 2001. The Directive's overall aim is \\"to prevent or reduce as far as possible negative effects on the environment, in particular the pollution of surface water, groundwater, soil and air, and on the global environment, including the greenhouse effect, as well as any resulting risk to human health, from the landfilling of waste, during the whole life-cycle of the landfill\\".UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs This legislation also has important implications for waste handling and waste disposal. Outline The Directive is applicable to all waste disposal sites and divides them into three classes:European Commission \\"Landfill of Waste\\" * landfills for hazardous waste * landfills for non-hazardous waste * landfills for inert waste Waste disposal into landfills is restricted by banning certain waste types, which may pose a risk. The following wastes may not be disposed of in a landfill and must either be recovered, recycled or disposed of in other ways.The Environment Agency * liquid waste * flammable waste * explosive or oxidising waste * hospital and other clinical waste which is infectious * used tyres, with certain exceptions * any other type of waste which does not meet the acceptance criteria laid down in Annex II. To avoid further risks, allowed wastes are subject to a standard waste acceptance procedure, which dictates the following terms:European Commission \\"Landfill of Waste\\" * waste must be treated before being landfilled * hazardous waste within the meaning of the Directive must be assigned to a hazardous waste landfill * landfills for non-hazardous waste must be used for municipal waste and for non-hazardous waste * landfill sites for inert waste must be used only for inert waste * criteria for the acceptance of waste at each landfill class must be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the general principles of Annex II. The acceptance criteria and the acceptance process are further specified in the Council Decision 2003/33/EC.Council Decision 2003/33/EC Implementation Member States must report to the European Commission every three years on the implementation of the Directive.Council Directive ÔøΩ199/31/ECÔøΩ According to the Directive, the amount of biodegradable municipal waste must be reduced to 50% in 2009 and to 35% in 2016 (compared to 1995 levels). In 2009, 10 years after the enactment of the Landfill Directive, the European Environment Agency published a report, which closely analysed the progress on implementing the Directive in the Member States.EEA Report No 7/2009 Its close analysis focuses on five countries and one sub-national region: Estonia, Finland, the Flemish Region of Belgium, (Germany), Hungary and Italy. According to this report, significant progress has been made, largely due to two core factors: *setting medium- and long-term targets for reducing landfilling enabled Member States to define waste strategies and monitor their progress continuously. *the directive's flexibility allowed Member States to try out different policies and adapt and adjust approaches \\"to match national and regional realities\\".

Upon the arrival of the Prophet Muhammad, Ibn Ubayy became a Muslim, but the sincerity of his conversion is disputed. Because of repeated conflicts with Muhammad, Islamic tradition has labelled him a Munafiq (hypocrite) and \\"leader of the Munafiqun\\".William Montgomery Watt, \\"\`Abd Allah b. Ubayy\\", Encyclopaedia of Islam Position in Medina Abd-Allah was the son of Ubayy ibn Salul and Uzza bint Ka'ab, also from Banu Khazraj. His father's mother was called Salul. Ibn Ubayy was one of the chiefs of the Khazraj, who then were in conflict with the other major Arab tribe of the city, the Banu Aws. During the fidjar, the so-called \\"sacrilegious war\\", Ibn Ubayy had led parts of the Khazraj tribe on the first day of fighting but held aloof on the second day. Also, he did not participate in the Battle of Bu'ath because of a quarrel with another leader over the execution of Jewish hostages.John Bagot Glubb, The Life and Times of Muhammad (2002), p. 142 It appears that at one point during the conflict, his life was saved by his Jewish allies from the tribe of Banu Qaynuqa, as he would later exclaim: \\"300 soldiers armed in mail, and 400 unequipped,  they defended me on the fields of Hadaick and Boath from every foe.\\"Glubb (2002), p. 197f. Ibn Ubayy \\"used every effort to end the fratricidal strife\\" and achieved a partial reconciliation between the two factions, which both recognized the leadership of Ibn Ubayy.Glubb (2002), p. 161, 164f. He occupied a high status in pre-Islamic Medinan society, and his supporters aimed for him to become \\"king\\". The aim was not realized, however, because of the arrival of Muhammad in 622:Maxime Rodinson, Muhammad: Prophet of Islam (2002), p. 156 since the tribal conflict had not been completely resolved, some citizens looked towards another arbitrator and called in Muhammad, whose preaching had made him famous beyond his home town of Mecca. The arrival of a man who claimed to speak in the name of God eclipsed Ibn Ubayy's influence. That provoked his jealousy, which he was careful to conceal, but was mitigated by his moderation and peacefulness. Ibn Ubayy nonetheless remained a well-respected man. According to Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Ubayy was \\"a man of great authority in Medina before the advent of the apostle\\" and \\"remained a continuing thorn in the flesh of his success\\". Ibn Ishaq, The earliest biography of Muhammad¬¥ Conversion After the entry of the Prophet Muhammad in Medina, many of the Arabs converted to Islam. Ibn Ubayy followed suit, according to Maxime Rodinson, as \\"he thought it wiser to join than to stand out against it\\". However, Rudi Paret thinks it probable that he converted very soon after the Hijra, at the same time as Sa'd ibn Mua'dh.Rudi Paret, Mohammed und der Koran, Stuttgart: Kohlhammer Verlag (1957), p. 103. Islamic tradition, which views Ibn Ubayy's conversion as insincere, labelled him \\"leader of the hypocrites\\" (munafiqun).Saif-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri, Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum (2002), p. 285Sayed Ali Asgher Razwy, Restatement of History of Islam However, according to Rodinson, Ibn Ubayy may have converted out of a \\"genuine sympathy with monotheist ideas fostered by his friendly relations with the Jews\\".Rodinson (2002), p. 157 Being second only to Muhammad, Ibn Ubayy became a \\"figurehead for those Arabs of Medina who, openly or secretly, sneered at the Prophet's teaching and complained of the confusion and the danger which the coming of the Muslims had brought to Medina\\". Ibn Ishaq writes that some of the Ansar \\"were not altogether convinced of the political wisdom of supporting the apostle: these came to be regarded as paying lip-service to Islam, but hiding treachery in their hearts, and they were known and reviled as 'the Hypocrites'\\". William Muir opines that tradition \\"makes a scapegoat of Abdallah\\" standing for \\"a great number, who had incurred Muhammad's anger, and some of them much more than Abdallah\\".William Muir, The Life of Muhammad, vol. 3, chapter 14 Military campaigns =Banu Qaynuqa= In 624, the Muslims moved against the Jewish tribe of the Banu Qaynuqa. According to Ibn Hisham, a dispute had broken out between the Muslims and the Banu Qaynuqa, the allies of the Khazraj tribe. When a Muslim woman visited a jeweler's shop in the Qaynuqa marketplace, she was pestered to uncover her face. The goldsmith, a Jew, pinned her clothing such that upon getting up, she was unveiled. A Muslim man, coming upon the resulting commotion, killed the shopkeeper in retaliation and was in turn killed by Jews. As a result of the revenge killings, enmity grew between Muslims and the Banu Qaynuqa..Guillaume 363, ibn Kathir 2 The Muslims besieged the Banu Qaynuqa, and after 15 days, forced them to surrender. Now, Ibn Ubayy was allied to the Qaynuqa and according to Muslim historians, appealed to Muhammad for leniency. He grabbed hold of the top of Muhammad's breast plate as he turned away, provoking his anger.Rodinson (2002), p. 173 \\"Let me go,\\" Muhammad said. Ibn Ubayy replied: Then, Muhammad acceded to his request and gave the Banu Qaynuqa three days to leave the city. Ibn Ubayy's last sentence has been interpreted in various ways. Rodinson considered it as threat against Muhammad, Watt that Ibn Ubayy \\"urged their importance as a fighting unit in view of the expected Meccan onslaught\\". Muslims have traditionally seen the episode as another piece of evidence for Ibn Ubayy's hypocrisy since he insisted that adherence to Islam had not completely severed the old obligations of tribal and personal loyalty.Glubb (p. 197) refers to Ubada ibn al-Samit as an alternative; a Muslim from the tribe of Aws and also an ally of the Qunayqa, he then renounced his friendship the Jews. However, Ibn Ubayy had not defended the Qaynuqa but merely pleaded for mercy. His plea implies that Muhammad intended to put the Qaynuqa to death, as he later did with the Banu Qurayza, but after Ibn Ubayy's intercession, they were merely expelled from Medina, their property falling to Muhammad and the Muhajirun. =Battle of Uhud= In the consultations preceding the approaching Meccan attack on Medina in 625, Ibn Ubayy had favored Muhammad's original plan to defend from the strongholds inside Medina itself: Some young Muslims, however, argued that the Meccans should be fought outside the city. Persuaded by the latter, Muhammad adopted an offensive strategy. According to Islamic tradition, Ibn Ubayy expressed his anger about his advice being rejected: \\"We do not know why we shall kill ourselves\\".al-Mubarakpuri (2002), p. 298 When Muhammad marched out to fight the Meccans, Ibn Ubayy also marched out with 300 of his own men and his remaining Jewish allies, according to al-Waqidi; however, Muhammad ordered him to send the Jews back into the town, calling them \\"idolaters\\". Ibn Ubayy then led his men back to Medina, retiring to the strongholds, while Muhammad resumed his advance. Islamic tradition presumes that Ibn Ubayy turned back to protect the town or his own possessions.Glubb (2002), p. 202-205. According to Watt, Surah interprets Ibn Ubayy's withdrawal as showing \\"cowardice and lack of belief in God and the Prophet\\"Some scholars interpret the Surah to indicate that Ibn Ubayy stayed in the town in the first place; A. Schaade, \\"\`Abd-Allah b. Ubaiy\\", Enzyklop√§die des Islam. Muhammad's 700 men met the 3000 of the Quraish in the Battle of Uhud and were defeated. The Quraish, however, did not succeed in killing Muhammad, and did not attempt to occupy the town of Medina, possibly because they knew it was guarded by Ibn Ubayy.Glubb (2002), p. 215f. Rodinson suggests that the Meccans did not want to reforge the very unity of the population, which had been jeopardised by Muhammad's defeat.Rodinson (2002), p. 182 =Banu Nadir= Ibn Ubay was also involved in Muhammad's conflict with another Jewish tribe, the Banu Nadir. Ibn Ishaq writes that when Muhammad ordered the tribe to leave the city within ten days, \\"certain persons of Medina who were not Believers sent a message to the Banu al-Nadir: 'Hold out, and defend yourselves; we shall not surrender you to Muhammad. If you are attacked we shall fight with you and if you are sent away we shall go with you'\\". Other sources include or even identify the persons with the Muslim Ibn Ubayy. Waqidi reports that Ibn Ubayy, at first, strove to bring about a reconciliation, and Tabari relates that Abd-Allah accused Muhammad of treachery and urged the Nadir to resist by promising aid.William Muir, The Life of Muhammad, vol. 3, chapter 15. However, as the promised help failed to materialize, the Nadir surrendered and Muhammad expelled them from the city.V. Vacca, \\"Nadir, Banu'l\\", Encyclopaedia of IslamHartwig Hirschfeld, \\"Abdallah ibn Ubaiy\\", Jewish Encyclopedia. Watt considered this to be the first instance in which Ibn Ubayy went beyond verbally criticizing Muhammad to intriguing against him, a practice Watt saw as continuing for the next two years. =Controversy during Mustaliq campaign= In 627, Ibn Ubayy participated in a raid against the Banu Mustaliq. On the march home, conflict arose between the Muhajirun and the Ansar when a Bedouin servant of Umar pushed an ally of the Khazraj. Hearing of this, Ibn Ubayy reportedly voiced his discontent: Watt described the phrase as an attempt by Ibn Ubayy \\"to undermine Muhammad's authority and make men think of expelling him\\". Muhammad forestalled any fighting by immediately continuing the march. Ibn Ubayy denied having said so and Muhammad accepted the excuse, but after their return to Medina, the \\"Munafiqun\\" would be reprimanded in Surah . Reportedly, Muhammad rejected the advice of Umar, who counseled to have Ibn Ubayy killed and the offer of Ibn Ubayy's own son, a fervent Muslim, to kill his own father.Akram Diya Al-Umari, The Bonds of Faith Are the Bases of the Links Between Men (1991).Glubb (2002), p. 262f. Later during the march, Muhammad's wife Aisha was rumoured to have committed adultery, and Ibn Ubay was among those spreading the rumour.William Montgomery Watt, \\"Aisha bint Abi Bakr\\", Encyclopaedia of IslamGlubb (2002), p. 264f. One of the chiefs of the Aws asked for the permission to punish the slanderers without incurring a feud, but the Khazraj opposed that. After Muhammad had announced that he had received a revelation confirming Aisha's innocence, he had her three of her accusers, who had come forward, punished by eighty lashes. He did not venture to enforce the sentence against Ibn Ubayy, who had not come forward. Last years According to Watt, after 627, there is no record of Ibn Ubayy \\"actively opposing Muhammad or intriguing against him\\". In 628, Ibn Ubayy participated in the march to Hudaybiyya. According to Rudi Paret, Muhammad's \\"most dangerous rival\\" was now on Muhammad's side.Rudi Paret, Mohammed und der Koran, Stuttgart: Kohlhammer (1957), p. 126. In 630, when Muhammad's launching a campaign against the Byzantine Empire during a time of drought and food shortage created serious discontent in Medina, Ibn Ubayy expressed his sympathy for those criticizing the expedition as untimely. As the army assembled, Ibn Ubayy's troops formed a separate camp and turned back to Medina when Muhammad's forces set out.Glubb (2002), p. 333f. That possibly happened with Muhammad's consent because of Ibn Ubayy's ill health. After Muhammad's return, those criticizing the campaign and had remained behind were chided in Surah . Ibn Ubayy died two months after Muhammad's return, in 631. Despite the various conflicts between the two men, Muhammad did not show signs of vindictiveness towards Ibn Ubayy and attended his funeral and prayed above his grave. With Ibn Ubayy died the faction of the Munafiqun, as \\"there was no one left ... possessed of power or influence\\".  Family Ibn Ubayy married three times and left behind nine children, all of whom became devout Muslims.

Anarchism is often considered a far-left ideologyBrooks 1994, p. xi; Kahn 2000; Moynihan 2007. and much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism, or participatory economics.Guerin 1970, p. 35.

Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism.McLean; McMillan 2003. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.Fowler 1972; Kropotkin 2002, p. 5; Ostergaard 2009, p. 14. Other classifications may add mutualism as a third category while some consider it part of individualist anarchism and others regard it to be part of social anarchism. There are many philosophical differences among anarchists concerning questions of ideology, values and strategy. Ideas about how anarchist societies should work vary considerably, especially with respect to economics.Honderich, Ted (1995). The Oxford Companion to Philosophy. Oxford University Press. . There are also disagreements about how such a society might be brought about, with some anarchists being committed to a strategy of nonviolence while others advocate armed struggle.Carter, April (1978). \\"Anarchism and violence\\".

Definitional concerns  Anarchist schools of thought encompass not only a range of individual schools, but also a considerable divergence in the use of some key terms. Some terms such as socialism have been subject to multiple definitions and ideological struggle throughout the period of the development of anarchism. Others such as capitalism are used in divergent and often contradictory ways by different schools within the tradition. In addition, the meanings of terms such as mutualism have changed over time, sometimes without spawning new schools. All of these terminological difficulties contribute to misunderstandings within and about anarchism. A central concern is whether the term anarchism is defined in opposition to hierarchy, authority and the state, or state and capitalism. Debates over the meaning of the term emerge from the fact that it refers to both an abstract philosophical position and to intellectual, political and institutional traditions, all of which have been fraught with conflict. Some minimal, abstract definitions encourage the inclusion of figures, movements and philosophical positions which have historically positioned themselves outside, or even in opposition to, individuals and traditions that have identified themselves as anarchist. While opposition to the state is central, there is a lot of talk among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.Long 2013, p. 217. While it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing authority and hierarchical organization (including the state, capitalism, nationalism and all associated institutions) in the conduct of all human relations in favour of a society based on voluntary association, freedom and decentralisation, this definition has its own shortcomings as the definition based on etymology (which is simply a negation of a ruler), or based on anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that) or even the anti-authoritarian (which is an a posteriori concussion).McLaughlin 2007, pp 25‚Äì26; Long 2013, p. 217. Nonetheless, major elements of the definition of anarchism include the following:McLaughlin 2007, pp 25‚Äì26. # The will for a non-coercive society. # The rejection of the state apparatus. # The belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society. # A suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy. Usages in political circles have varied considerably. In 1894, Richard T. Ely noted that the term had \\"already acquired a variety of meanings\\". In its most general sense, these included the view that society is \\"a living, growing organism, the laws of which are something different from the laws of individual action\\".Richard Theodore Ely, Socialism: An Examination of Its Nature, Its Strength and Its Weakness (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1894), p. 3. Several years earlier in 1888, the individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker included the full text of a \\"Socialistic Letter\\" by Ernest Lesigne in his essay on \\"State Socialism and Anarchism\\". According to Lesigne, there are two socialisms: \\"One is dictatorial, the other libertarian\\".Tucker, Benjamin. State Socialism and Anarchism: How Far They Agree and Wherein They Differ. As an anti-capitalist and libertarian socialist philosophy, anarchism is placed on the far-left of the political spectrum and much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of left-wing politics such as communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism, or participatory economics. As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview, many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely. As a result, anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally yet maintain the common tenets of anarchism, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism.McLean and McMillan 2003. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism, or similar dual classifications.Anarchism; Fowler 1972; Kropotkin 2002, p. 5; Ostergaard 2009, p. 14. Nonetheless, anti- capitalism is considered a necessary element of anarchism by most anarchists.Anarchist survey highlighting a general opposition to capitalism: = Individualist anarchism vs. social anarchism = Due to the many anarchist schools of thought, anarchism can be divided into two or more categories, the most used being individualist anarchism vs. social anarchism. Other categorizations may include green anarchism and/or left and right anarchism. Terms like anarcho-socialism or socialist anarchism can also be used as synonymous for social anarchism, but this is rejected by most anarchists since they generally consider themselves socialists of the libertarian tradition and are seen as unnecessary and confusing when not used as synonymous for libertarian or stateless socialism vis-√†-vis authoritarian or state socialism.Iverson, Stan.

While most anarcho-capitalists theorists and scholars divide anarchism into social anarchism vis-√†-vis individualist anarchism meaning socialism vs. capitalism, seeing the two as mutually exclusive although accepting all anarchist schools of thought under panarchy on the basis of voluntaryism, anarchist theorists and scholars opposing to anarcho- capitalism reject this, not seeing them as a struggle between socialism and capitalism or as mutually exclusive, but instead as complementary, with their differences mainly being based on the means to attain anarchy, rather than on their ends, arguing against certain anarcho-capitalist theorists and scholars who see individualist anarchism as pro-capitalist and reiterating that anarchism as a whole is socialist, meaning libertarian and anti-statist socialism.

Notwithstanding the name, collectivist anarchism is also seen as a blend of individualism and collectivism.Morriss, Brian (1993). Bakukunin: The Philosophy of Freedom. Black Rose Books Ltd. p. 115. Anarchism is generally considered an individualist philosophy, opposing all forms of authoritarian collectivism, but one which does see the individual or the community as complementary rather than mutually exclusive, with anarcho- communism and social anarchism in particular most rejecting the individualist‚Äìcollectivist dichotomy. Finally, social anarchism is a term used in the United States to refer to Murray Bookchin's circle and its omonymous journal.Bookchin, Murray (1995). \\"Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm\\".

Schools of thought such as anarcha-feminism, anarcho-pacifism, anarcho-primitivism, anarcho-transhumanism and green anarchism have different economic views and can be either part of individualist anarchism or social anarchism. To differentiate it from individualist anarchism, anarchists prefer using social anarchism, a term used to characterize certain strides of anarchism vis-√†-vis individualist anarchism, with the former focusing on the social aspect and generally being more organisational as well as supporting decentralised economic planning and the latter focusing on the individual and generally being more anti-organisational as well as supporting a free-market form of socialism, respectively, rather than seeing the two categories as mutually exclusive or as socialism vis-√†-vis capitalism, leading to anarchism without adjectives.Esenwein, George Richard (1989). Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868-1898. p. 135. \\"Anarchism without adjectives referred to an unhyphenated form of anarchism, that is, a doctrine without any qualifying labels such as communist, collectivist, mutualist, or individualist. For others, [...] [it] was simply understood as an attitude that tolerated the coexistence of different anarchist schools\\". Mutualism is seen as the middle or third category between social anarchism and individualist anarchism, although it has been considered part of both social anarchism and individualist anarchism. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon spoke of social individualism and described mutualism and the freedom it pursued as the synthesis between communism and property.Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1848). What Is Property?. From a materialist perspective, individualist anarchism is the anarchist form in the pre-capitalist and largely agrarian and merchantilist capitalism before the Industrial Revolution, during which individualist anarchism became a form of artisanal and self-employed socialism, especially in the United States. Instead, social anarchism is anarchism in an industrial society, being the form of industrial or proletarian socialism, with post-left anarchy and its criticism of industrial technology and anti-workerism arising in a post-industrial society. Some anarchists may see such categorisations in these terms.\\"G.1.4 Why is the social context important in evaluating Individualist Anarchism?\\". An Anarchist FAQ. Despite their differences, these are all forms of libertarian socialism. Before socialism became associated in the 20th century with Marxist‚ÄìLeninist states and similar forms of authoritarian and statist socialism, considered by critics as state capitalism and administrative command economies rather than planned economies, the word socialism was a broad concept which was aimed at solving the labour problem through radical changes in the capitalist economy.Brooks, Frank H. (1994). The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty (1881‚Äì1908). Transaction Publishers. p. 75. This caused issues between traditional anarchists and anarcho-captalists, whose understanding of socialism is that of the 20th century Marxist‚ÄìLeninist states and whose school of thought is generally not recognized as part of anarchism.: \\"In fact, few anarchists would accept the 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice, Their self-interested, calculating market men would be incapable of practising voluntary co-operation and mutual aid. Anarcho-capitalists, even if they do reject the State, might therefore best be called right-wing libertarians rather than anarchists.\\"; \\"Within Libertarianism, Rothbard represents a minority perspective that actually argues for the total elimination of the state. However Rothbard's claim as an anarchist is quickly voided when it is shown that he only wants an end to the public state. In its place he allows countless private states, with each person supplying their own police force, army, and law, or else purchasing these services from capitalist venders. [...] [S]o what remains is shrill anti-statism conjoined to a vacuous freedom in hackneyed defense of capitalism. In sum, the \\"anarchy\\" of Libertarianism reduces to a liberal fraud.\\"; \\"The philosophy of \\"anarcho-capitalism\\" dreamed up by the \\"libertarian\\" New Right, has nothing to do with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement proper.\\"; : \\"'Libertarian' and 'libertarianism' are frequently employed by anarchists as synonyms for 'anarchist' and 'anarchism', largely as an attempt to distance themselves from the negative connotations of 'anarchy' and its derivatives. The situation has been vastly complicated in recent decades with the rise of anarcho-capitalism, 'minimal statism' and an extreme right-wing laissez-faire philosophy advocated by such theorists as Murray Rothbard and Robert Nozick and their adoption of the words 'libertarian' and 'libertarianism'. It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition.\\"; : \\"It is important to distinguish between anarchism and certain strands of right-wing libertarianism which at times go by the same name (for example, Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism). There is a complex debate within this tradition between those like Robert Nozick, who advocate a 'minimal state', and those like Rothbard who want to do away with the state altogether and allow all transactions to be governed by the market alone. From an anarchist perspective, however, both positions‚Äîthe minimal state (minarchist) and the no-state ('anarchist') positions‚Äîneglect the problem of economic domination; in other words, they neglect the hierarchies, oppressions, and forms of exploitation that would inevitably arise in a laissez-faire 'free' market. [...] Anarchism, therefore, has no truck with this right-wing libertarianism, not only because it neglects economic inequality and domination, but also because in practice (and theory) it is highly inconsistent and contradictory. The individual freedom invoked by right-wing libertarians is only a narrow economic freedom within the constraints of a capitalist market, which, as anarchists show, is no freedom at all\\".See also the following sources: * K, David (2005).

Ends and means  Among anarchists, there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence in revolutionary struggle. For example, Mikhail Bakunin, Peter Kropotkin, Emma Goldman and Errico Malatesta wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. At the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism, see Bakunin's \\"The Program of the International Brotherhood\\" (1869) and Malatesta's \\"Violence as a Social Factor\\" (1895). Other anarchists such as Leo Tolstoy, Dorothy Day and Mahatma GandhiSnow, Edgar. \\"The Message of Gandhi\\". have been advocates of pacifism. Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, possibly due to a number of high-profile violent actions, including riots, assassinations, insurrections and terrorism committed by some anarchists as well as persistently negative media portrayals.Albert, Michael. Anarchism?! . Z Communications. Retrieved 6 September 2006. Late 19th-century revolutionaries encouraged acts of political violence, called propaganda of the deed, such as bombings and the assassinations of heads of state to further anarchism. However, the term originally referred to exemplary forms of direct action meant to inspire the masses to revolution and propaganda of the deed may be violent or nonviolent. While all anarchists consider antimilitarism (opposition to war) to be inherent to their philosophy,\\"War is the Health of the State\\". Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power both domestically and in foreign lands and subscribe to Randolph Bourne's view that \\"war is the health of the state\\". anarcho- pacifists take this further by following Tolstoy's belief in pacifism. Although numerous anarchist-related initiatives have been based on the tactic of nonviolence (see Earth First! and Food Not Bombs), many anarchists reject pacifism as an ideology, instead supporting a diversity of tactics. Authors Ward Churchill (Pacifism as Pathology, 1986) and Peter Gelderloos (How Nonviolence Protects the State, 2005; \\"The Failure of Nonviolence\\",\\"The Failure of Nonviolence\\" 2013) have published influential books critical of pacifist doctrine which they view as ineffectual and hypocritical. In a 2010 article, author Randall Amster argued for the development of a \\"complementarity of tactics\\" to bridge the pacifist and more militant aspects of anarchism. As a result of anarchism's critical view of certain types of private property, many anarchists see the destruction of property as an acceptable form of violence or argue that it is not in fact violence at all. In her widely cited 1912 essay Direct Action, Voltairine de Cleyre drew on American historical events, including the destroying of revenue stamps and the Boston Tea Party as a defense of such activities.de Cleyre, Voltairine (1912). Direct Action. Many anarchists participate in subversive organizations as a means to undermine the establishment, such as Food Not Bombs, radical labor unions, alternative media and radical social centers. This is in accordance with the anarchist ideal that governments are intrinsically evil and that only by destroying the power of governments can individual freedoms and liberties be preserved. However, some anarchist schools in theory adopt the concept of dual power which means creating the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, hierarchical one. = Participation in statist democracy = Anarchist street art in Madison, Wisconsin declaring: \\"Our dreams cannot fit in their ballot boxes\\" While most anarchists firmly oppose voting, or otherwise participating in the state institution, there are a few that disagree. The prominent anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon stood for election to the French Constituent Assembly twice in 1848. In the 1890s, Paul Brousse developed the concept of libertarian municipalism in Switzerland which involved participating in local elections.Smith, George H. \\"The Ethics of Voting\\". Anarchists have opposed voting for multiple reasons. Taking part in elections has historically resulted in radicals becoming part of the system they oppose rather than ending it.\\"J.2 What is direct action?\\". Voting acknowledges the state's legitimacy.Peacott, Joe, \\"Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?\\" . BAD Broadside #8, Boston Anarchist Drinking Brigade, 1992; Ward, Colin \\"The Case Against Voting\\", originally published in New Society on 15 May 1987; reprinted in Freedom, Vol. 48, No. 6, June 1987; \\"Choose and Lose ‚Äì The anarchist case against voting and electoralism\\" . Infoshop.org. During the 2004 United States presidential election, the anarchist collective CrimethInc. launched \\"Don't Just Vote, Get Active\\", a campaign promoting the importance of direct action rather than electoral change. Anarchists in other countries often engage in similar anti-voting campaigns and advocate a more pragmatic approach, including voting in referenda.\\"Thinking about anarchism ‚Äì Referendums\\" . Workers Solidarity No 69, published in March 2002. Retrieved 7 September 2006. Other prominent anarchists like Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky have pledged their support for progressive candidates such as Ralph Nader. In addition to merely voting, some anarchists such as Proudhon and more recently Icelandic activist Sm√°ri McCarthy have stood for and won elections to national legislative bodies. American individualist anarchist Lysander Spooner argued that voting was a legitimate means of self-defense against the state and noted that many supporters of the state consider both voting and abstention to be acknowledgments of the state's legitimacy.Spooner, Lysander, No Treason, no. 2, part 1. Spooner's essay \\"No Treason\\" offers an individualist anarchist rebuttal to the argument that existing democratic governments are justified by majority consent. During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, there was debate within anarchist circles about whether to take an abstentionist position, vote for independence, or to vote to remain in the United Kingdom, thus anarchists rarely fitted into the easy binary of Yes/No voters of the referendum, with all seeking to go beyond the choices offered at the ballot box. There was also a debate about what Scottish independence would mean for the anarchist movement and social struggle. Groups like the Anarchist Federation in Scotland (mainly in Edinburgh and Glasgow) took a critical stance skeptical of the benefits of Scottish independence. Within the United Kingdom, there was considerable debate around the Brexit vote in 2016. Anarchists are traditionally opposed to the European Union, yet the vote was seen as one imposed by two factions of the right-wing. Yet again, there was debate about whether to vote to Remain in the European Union, abstain (some left communists argued for abstaining) or vote to Leave since the United Kingdom government (the Conservative Party) was mostly in favour of remain while UK Independence Party and far-right parties favoured Leave. There was also debate within the left amongst anarchists and those who considered themselves to have a Lexit (Left Exit position). The victory of the Leave side united anarchists whether voters or abstainers against the racist incidents and rise of right-wing populism and neo-nationalism which was considered to have happened following the result of the vote. Many anarchists and anti- authoritarian leftists argue Brexit was negative for social struggles and migrants in particular and considerable efforts were made to analyze why the Leave result happened. = Democracy in anarchism = For individualist anarchists, \\"the system of democracy, of majority decision, is held null and void. Any impingement upon the natural rights of the person is unjust and a symbol of majority tyranny\\".Horowitz, Irving Louis (2005). The Anarchists. Aldine Transaction. p. 49. Libertarian municipalist Murray Bookchin criticized individualist anarchists for opposing democracyBookchin, Murray. The Democratic Dimensions of Anarchism and said majority rule is consistent with anarchism.Bookchin, Murray. \\"Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm\\". While preferring the term assembly rather than democracy, Bookchin has in turn been accused of municipal statism, i.e. non- anarchism.Black, Bob. \\"Anarchy after Leftism\\". Chapter 5. Later, Bookchin renounced anarchism to identify himself as an advocate of Communalism. = Violence and non-violence = Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts including riots, assassinations and insurrections involving anarchists. However, the use of terrorism and assassination is condemned by most anarchist ideology, although there remains no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence. Some anarchists have opposed coercion while others have supported it, particularly in the form of violent revolution on the path to anarchy.Fowler, R. B. The Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 25, No. 4. (December 1972), pp. 743‚Äì744. Some anarchists share Leo Tolstoy's Christian anarchist belief in nonviolence. These anarcho-pacifists advocate nonviolent resistance as the only method of achieving a truly anarchist revolution. They often see violence as the basis of government and coercion and argue that as such violence is illegitimate, no matter who is the target. Some of Pierre- Joseph Proudhon's French followers even saw strike action as coercive and refused to take part in such traditional socialist tactics. Other anarchists advocate Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication that relates to peoples fundamental needs and feelings using strategies of requests, observations and empathy yet providing for the use of protective force while rejecting pacifism as a compromising strategy of the left that just perpetuates violence. Other anarchists such as Mikhail Bakunin and Errico Malatesta saw violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force. Malatesta took the view that it is \\"necessary to destroy with violence, since one cannot do otherwise, the violence which denies [the means of life and for development] to the workers\\" (Umanit√† Nova, number 125, 6 September 1921).\\"The Revolutionary \\"Haste\\". Between 1894 and 1901, individual anarchists assassinated numerous heads of state, including: * French President Sadi Carnot (1894) * Empress consort Elisabeth of Austria (1898) * King Umberto I of Italy (1900) * United States President William McKinley (1901) Such propaganda of the deed was not popular among anarchists and many in the movement condemned the tactic. President William McKinley's assassin Leon Czolgosz claimed to be a disciple of Emma Goldman. Goldman disavowed the act, although she did not condemn Czolgosz's motivations in doing it. Goldman included in her definition of anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself did not oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the Red Army. From then on, Goldman condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, but she still supported most other forms of revolutionary violence throughout her life. In a debate with a pacifist five years before her death, she countered that \\"the organized force used against the followers of Gandhi has finally forced them to use violence, much to the distress of Gandhi\\" and concluded that \\"as a method of combating the complex social injustices and inequalities, non-resistance cannot be a decisive factor\\" (non-resistance was the term for nonviolence used by Tolstoy and other early 20th century pacifists). Goldman at this time was an information officer for the anarchist militias of the Spanish Revolution which were committed to armed struggle.Porter, David, ed. (2006). Vision on Fire: Emma Goldman on the Spanish Revolution . AK Press. p. 226‚Äì228. Depictions in the press and popular fiction (for example, a malevolent bomb-throwing anarchist in Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent) helped create a lasting public impression that anarchists are violent terrorists. This perception was enhanced by events such as the Haymarket riot, where anarchists were blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in Chicago. More recently, anarchists have been involved in protests against World Trade Organization (WTO) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) meetings across the globe which the media has described as violent or riots. Traditionally, May Day in London has also been a day of marching, but in recent years the Metropolitan Police have warned that a \\"hardcore of anarchists\\" are intent on causing violence. Anarchists often respond that it is the police who initiate violence at these demonstrations, with anarchists who are otherwise peaceful sometimes forced to defend themselves. The anarchists involved in such protests often formed black blocs at these protests and some engaged in property destruction, vandalism, or in violent conflicts with police, although others stuck to non-violent principles. Those participating in black blocs distinguish between violence and property destruction as they claim that violence is when a person inflicts harm to another person while property destruction or property damage is not violence, although it can have indirect harm such as financial harm. Most anarchists do not consider the destruction of property to be violent as do most activists who believe in non-violence.  Pacifism  Anarchist protesters in Boston opposing state-waged war Most anarchists consider opposition to militarism to be inherent in their philosophy. Some anarchists take it further and follow Leo Tolstoy's belief in non-violence (note that these anarcho-pacifists are not necessarily Christian anarchists as Tolstoy was), advocating nonviolent resistance as the only method of achieving a truly anarchist revolution. Anarchist literature often portrays war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands. Many anarchists subscribe to Randolph Bourne's view that \\"war is the health of the state\\". Anarchists believe that if they were to support a war, they would be strengthening the state‚Äîindeed, Peter Kropotkin was alienated from other anarchists when he expressed support for the British in World War I. = Individualism vs. collectivism = While some anarchists favour collective property or no property, others such as some American individualist anarchists like Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner support private property while opposing property titles to unused land. Tucker argues that collectivism in property is absurd: \\"That there is an entity known as the community which is the rightful owner of all land, [...] I maintain that the community is a non- entity, that it has no existence\\".Martin, James J. Men Against the State. p. 220. He was particularly adamant in his opposition to communism, even to the point of asserting that those who opposed private property were not anarchists: \\"Anarchism is a word without meaning, unless it includes the liberty of the individual to control his product or whatever his product has brought him through exchange in a free market‚Äîthat is, private property. Whoever denies private property is of necessity an Archist\\".The New Freewoman, p. 218. Similarly, Albert Meltzer argued that since individualist anarchists like Tucker promote the idea of private armies, they actually support a \\"limited State\\", contending that it \\"is only possible to conceive of Anarchism which is free, communistic and offering no economic necessity for repression of countering it\\". Anarcho-communists reject the criticism, pointing to the principle of voluntary association that underpins their theory and differentiates it from state communism.\\"A.3.1 What are the differences between individualist and social anarchists?\\". An Anarchist FAQ. Some individualist anarchists are willing to recognize such communism as a legitimate form. Kevin Carson writes that \\"free market, libertarian communist, syndicalism, and other kinds of collectivist anarchists must learn to coexist in peace and mutual respect today, in our fight against the corporate state, and tomorrow, in the panarchy that is likely to succeed it\\".Carson, Kevin. \\"Mutualist FAQ: Getting There\\". Some forms of anarcho-communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism, believing anarcho- communism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom. Hence, most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism itself as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society. Furthermore, post-left anarchists like Bob Black went as far as to argue that \\"communism is the final fulfillment of individualism. [...] The apparent contradiction between individualism and communism rests on a misunderstanding of both. [...] Subjectivity is also objective: the individual really is subjective. It is nonsense to speak of \\"emphatically prioritizing the social over the individual,\\" [...]. You may as well speak of prioritizing the chicken over the egg. Anarchy is a \\"method of individualization.\\" It aims to combine the greatest individual development with the greatest communal unity\\".Black, Bob (2010). \\"Nightmares of Reason\\". Max Baginski has argued that property and the free market are just other \\"spooks\\", what Stirner called to refer mere illusions, or ghosts in the mind, writing: \\"Modern Communists are more individualistic than Stirner. To them, not merely religion, morality, family and State are spooks, but property also is no more than a spook, in whose name the individual is enslaved ‚Äî and how enslaved! [...] Communism thus creates a basis for the liberty and Eigenheit of the individual. I am a Communist because I am an Individualist. Fully as heartily the Communists concur with Stirner when he puts the word take in place of demand ‚Äî that leads to the dissolution of property, to expropriation. Individualism and Communism go hand in hand\\".Baginki, Max (May 1907). \\"Stirner: The Ego and His Own\\". Mother Earth (2: 3). Peter Kropotkin argued that \\"Communism is the one which guarantees the greatest amount of individual liberty ‚Äî provided that the idea that begets the community be Liberty, Anarchy [...]. Communism guarantees economic freedom better than any other form of association, because it can guarantee wellbeing, even luxury, in return for a few hours of work instead of a day's work\\".Kropotkin, Peter (1901). \\"Communism and Anarchy\\". Dielo Truda similarly argued that \\"[t]his other society will be libertarian communism, in which social solidarity and free individuality find their full expression, and in which these two ideas develop in perfect harmony\\".\\"Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists\\" (1926). Dielo Truda. In \\"My Perspectives\\" of Willful Disobedience (2: 12), it was argued as such: \\"I see the dichotomies made between individualism and communism, individual revolt and class struggle, the struggle against human exploitation and the exploitation of nature as false dichotomies and feel that those who accept them are impoverishing their own critique and struggle\\".\\"My Perspectives\\". Willful Disobedience (2: 12). The Right to Be Greedy is a book published in 1974 by an American Situationist collective called For Ourselves: Council for Generalized Self-Management which Black describes it in its preface as an \\"audacious attempt to synthesize a collectivist social vision of left-wing origin with an individualistic (for lack of a better word) ethic usually articulated on the right\\".Black, Bob (1974). \\"Preface to The Right to be Greedy by For Ourselves\\" . Its authors say that \\"[t]he positive conception of egoism, the perspective of communist egoism, is the very heart and unity of our theoretical and practical coherence\\".The Right To Be Greedy: Theses On The Practical Necessity Of Demanding Everything. The book was highly influenced by the work of Max Stirner, with Black humorously suggesting that it was a synthesis of Marxism and Stirner's philosophy which may be called Marxism‚ÄìStirnerism just as he wrote an essay on Groucho-Marxism, writing in the preface to The Right to be Greedy: \\"If Marxism-Stirnerism is conceivable, every orthodoxy prating of freedom or liberation is called into question, anarchism included. The only reason to read this book, as its authors would be the first to agree, is for what you can get out of it\\". Although commonly misconcepted, Marxism rejected egalitarianism in the sense of greater equality between classes, clearly distinguishing it from the socialist notion of the abolition of classes based on the division between workers and owners of productive property. Marx and Engels believed that an international proletarian revolution would bring about a socialist society which would then eventually give way to a communist stage of social development which would be a classless, stateless, moneyless, humane society erected on common ownership. However, Marx's view of classlessness was not the subordination of society to a universal interest (such as a universal notion of equality), but it was about the creation of the conditions that would enable individuals to pursue their true interests and desires, making his notion of communist society radically individualistic. Marx was a proponent of two principles, the first (\\"To each according to his contribution\\") applied to socialism and the second (\\"From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs\\") to an advanced communist society. Although his position is often confused or conflated with distributive egalitarianism in which only the goods and services resulting from production are distributed according to a notional equality, Marx eschewed the entire concept of equality as abstract and bourgeois in nature, preferring to focus on more concrete principles such as opposition to exploitation on materialist grounds and economic logic.Nielsen, Kai (August 1987). \\"Rejecting Egalitarianism\\". Political Theory (15: 3). pp. 411‚Äì423. He is a believer in human freedom and human development. For Marx, the \\"true realm of freedom\\" consists in the \\"development of human powers as an end in itself\\".Marx 1991, p. 959. He conceives of a communist society as one in which \\"the full and free development of every individual forms the ruling principle\\".Marx 1990, p. 739. Marx justified the forms of equality he did advocate such as the communal ownership and control of the economy on the grounds that they led to human freedom and human development rather than simply because they were egalitarian, writing that in such a society there are \\"[u]niversally developed individuals, whose social relations, as their own communal relations, are hence also subordinated to their own communal control\\". This communal control includes \\"their subordination of their communal, social productivity as their social wealth\\".Marx 1993, p. 158, p. 162.  Identity politics  = Gender = Emma Goldman Anarcha-feminism is a kind of radical feminism that espouses the belief that patriarchy is a fundamental problem in society, but it was not explicitly formulated as such until the early 1970s during the second-wave feminist movement.\\"Anarcho- Feminism ‚Äì Two Statements ‚Äì Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto\\". Early first-wave feminist Mary Wollstonecraft held proto-anarchist views and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. Early French feminists such as Jenny d'H√©ricourt and Juliette Adam also criticised the misogyny in the anarchism of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon during the 1850s. While most anarchists of the period did not take these ideas seriously, others such as Florence Finch Kelly and Moses Harman held gender equality as a topic of significant importance.Marsh, Margaret S. Anarchist Women, 1870‚Äì1920. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1981. Anarcha-feminism garnered further attention through the work of early 20th-century authors and theorists including Emma GoldmanMarshall, p. 409.Intimate, p. 94. and Voltairine de Cleyre.Presley, 1979.Falk 2003, p. 195. In the Spanish Civil War, an anarcha- feminist group called Mujeres Libres organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas. = Ethnicity = Black anarchism opposes the existence of a state, capitalism and subjugation and domination of people of color and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society.Ribeiro, Pedro. Senzala or Quilombo: Reflections on APOC and the fate of Black Anarchism.\\"Black Anarchism\\". Anarchist Panther. @narchist Panther Zine (October 1999). 1st ed. Vol. 1. Theorists include Ashanti Alston, Lorenzo Komboa Ervin and Sam Mbah. Some of these theorists have had past experiences with the Black Panther Party and came to anarchism after they became critical of the Black Panther Party's brand of Marxist‚ÄìLeninism. Anarchist People of Color (APOC) was created as a forum for non-Caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. Anti-Racist Action is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved. It focuses on publicly confronting antisemites, racists, supremacists and others such as the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazi groups and the like. Most modern and historical anarchists describe themselves as anti- racists. Many early anarchists, notably Lucy Parsons (a person of color and formerly an enslaved American), viewed racism as one of many negative side- effects of capitalism and expected that it would vanish in a post-capitalist world. However, among modern anarchists anti-racism plays a more prominent role and racism is typically viewed as one of several forms of social hierarchy and stratification which must be destroyed. No anarchist organizations has ever included racism as part of its platform and many‚Äîparticularly modern formations‚Äîinclude explicit anti-racism, with the national-anarchist movement being rejected as part of anarchism for his perceived racism, among other reasons. For instance, American anarchists were alone in opposing racism against Chinese and Mexican workers in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Since the late 1970s, anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of neo-fascist groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom, some anarchists worked within militant anti-fascist groups alongside members of the Marxist left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state. Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within anarchism in the United States. Anti- Racist Action is one of the largest grassroots anti-fascist and anti-racist organizations in North America today and counts many anarchists among its members. Their tactics, centered around directly confronting neo-fascist and white-supremacist groups, are considered controversial both within the anarchist movement (where they are sometimes portrayed as well-intentioned, but ineffective) and in mainstream society (where they are often portrayed as violent and disruptive). Many anarchists also oppose the concept of race itself, arguing that it has no biological basis in science and is a social construction designed to divide the working class and preserve capitalism. A minority of historically prominent anarchists have been accused of racism, e.g. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Mikhail Bakunin.Bakunin quoted by Shlomo Avineri in Radical Theology, the New Left, and Israel, p. 245‚Äì246. \\"An article in Auschwitz. Beginning of a New Era? Reflections on the Holocaust\\", edited by Eva Fleishner, KTAV Publishing House, Inc.; The Cathedral Church of St. John Divine; Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, 1977, p. 241‚Äì254. = Religion = From Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Mikhail Bakunin to the Spanish anarcho- syndicalists, most anarchists have questioned or opposed organized religion, believing that most organized religions are hierarchical or authoritarian and more often than not aligned with contemporary power structures like the state and capital. Nonetheless, others reconcile anarchism with religion. Christian anarchists believe that there is no higher authority than God and oppose earthly authority such as government and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings and the practice of the early Church were clearly anarchistic. Some of them feel that the teachings of the Nazarenes and other early groups of followers were corrupted by contemporary religious views, most notably when Theodosius I declared Nicene Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire. Christian anarchists who follow Jesus' directive to turn the other cheek are usually strict pacifists, although some believe in a limited justification of defense, especially defense of others. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was Leo Tolstoy, author of The Kingdom of God Is Within You, who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom. Christian anarchists tend to form experimental communities (such as the Catholic Worker). They also occasionally resist taxation. Buddhist anarchism originated in the influential Chinese anarchist movement of the 1920s. Taixu, one of the leading thinkers and writers of this school, was deeply influenced by the work of Christian anarchists like Tolstoy and by the ancient Chinese well-field system. In the late 19th century, the Ghadar movement in India (see Har Dayal), influenced by Buddhist thought and by Swami Dayananda Saraswati (founder of Arya Samaj), saw anarchism as a way of propagating the ancient culture of the Arya (not to be confused with the much later appropriation of Aryan identity by Nazism).Ghadar Movement: Ideology, Organisation and Strategy, Harish K. Puri, Guru Nanak Dev University Press, Amritsar: \\"The only account of Hardayal's short stay in that island Martinique, comes from Bhai Parmanand, a self exiled Arya Samajist missionary from Lahore, who stayed a month with him there. Har Dayal used that time, says Parmanand, to discuss plans to found a new religion: his model was the Buddha. He ate mostly boiled grain, slept on the bare floor and spent his time in meditation in a secluded place. Guy Aldred, a famous English radical and friend, tells us of Hardayal's proclaimed belief at that time in the coming republic \\"which was to be a Church, a religious confraternity ... its motto was to be: atheism, cosmopolitanism and moral law' Parmamand says that Har Dayal acceded to his persuasion to go to the USA and decided to make New York a centre for the propagation of the ancient culture of the Aryan.\\" (p. 55) and \\"the ideal social order would be the one which approximated to the legendary Vedic period of Indian history because, as Har Dayal affirmed, practical equality existed only in that society, where there were no governors and no governed, no priests and no laymen, no rich and no poor.\\" (p. 112), referencing The Social Conquest of the Hindu Race and Meaning of Equality. Buddhist anarchism was later revived in the 1960s by writers such as Gary Snyder; an incarnation of this school of thought was popularized by Jack Kerouac in his book The Dharma Bums. With its focus on the environment and equality along with its often decentralized nature, Neopaganism has led to a number of Neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is Starhawk, who writes extensively about both spirituality and activism. Discussing the anarchist movement in Britain in 2002, Adam K. has argued that it \\"has an especially ignorant and hegemonistic perception of the Muslim community\\" which he attributed to \\"the [A]nglo-centric nature of the movement\\". Quoting the statement that \\"Islam is an enemy of all freedom loving people\\" from an anarchist magazine, he argues that this is \\"no different to the bigoted rhetoric of George Bush or even BNP leader Nick Griffin\\".\\"Anarchist Orientalism and the Muslim Community in Britain\\". Retrieved 3 May 2007.  Capitalism  Throughout all of its history, anarchism has been defined by its proponents in opposition to capitalism which they believe can be maintained only by state violence.Fernandez, Frank (2001). Cuban Anarchism: The History of a Movement. See Sharp Press. p. 6. Anarchists generally follow Pierre- Joseph Proudhon in opposing ownership of workplaces by capitalists and aim to replace wage labor with workers' associations. These anarchists also agree with Peter Kropotkin's comment that \\"the origin of the anarchist inception of society [lies in] the criticism [...] of the hierarchical organisations and the authoritarian conceptions of society\\" rather than in simple opposition to the state or government.Anarchism, p. 158. They argue that the wage system is hierarchical and authoritarian in nature and consequently capitalism cannot be anarchist.Morris, Brian, Anthropology and Anarchism, \\"Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed\\" (no. 45); Mckay, Iain, The legacy of Voltairine De Cleyre, Anarcho-Syndicalist Review, no. 44; L. Susan Brown, The Politics of Individualism. Conversely, anarcho-capitalists generally support wage labor and oppose workplace democracy which most anarchists support, claiming that wage labor is voluntary. However, most anarchists argue that certain capitalist transactions, including wage labor, are not voluntary and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion which violates both anarchist principles and anarcho-capitalism's non- aggression principle itself. Anarchists who support wage labor do so as long as the employers and employees are paid equally for equal hours workedCheyney, Ryan C. (November 1980). \\"Social Justice and the Right to the Labor Product\\". Political Theory (8: 4). p. 506. and neither party has authority over the other. By following this principle, no individual profits from the labor of another. Those anarchists describe the wages received in such an employer- employee relationship as the individual laborer's full product and generally envisione that in such a society every worker would be self-employed and own their own private means of production, free to walk away from employment contracts. Some supporters argue that anarcho-capitalism is a form of individualist anarchism.Outhwaite, William.

However, most early individualist anarchists considered themselves \\"fervent anti-capitalists [who see] no contradiction between their individualist stance and their rejection of capitalism\\".Brown, Susan Love, The Free Market as Salvation from Government: The Anarcho- Capitalist View, Meanings of the Market: The Free Market in Western Culture, edited by James G. Carrier, Berg/Oxford, 1997, p. 107 and p. 104) Many defined themselves as socialists. These early individualist anarchists defined capitalism in various ways, but it was often discussed in terms of usury: \\"There are three forms of usury, interest on money, rent on land and houses, and profit in exchange. Whoever is in receipt of any of these is a usurer\\".James J. Martin. Men against the State. p. 208. Excluding these, they tended to support free trade, free competition and varying levels of private property such as mutualism based on occupation and use property norms.Non- capitalist market anarchists support private possession along Warren's, Proudhon's, or similar lines. In contrast, anarcho-capitalists support private property along Lockean or similar lines. It is this distinction which has led to the rift between anarchism and anarcho-capitalism. Historically, anarchists considered themselves socialists and opposed to capitalism, therefore anarcho- capitalism is considered by many anarchists today as not being a form of anarchism.As Peter Marshall notes in his history of anarchism, \\"few anarchists would accept the 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice.\\" Demanding the Impossible, p. 565. Furthermore, terms like anarcho-socialism or socialist anarchism are rejected by most anarchists since they generally consider themselves socialists of the libertarian tradition, but they are nevertheless used by anarcho-capitalism theorists and scholars who recognize anarcho- capitalism to differentiate between the two.Byldun, Per (19 March 2019). \\"The Trouble With Socialist Anarchism\\". Mises Institute. Retrieved 31 March 2019. Ultimately, anarcho-capitalist author Murray Rothbard, who coined the term itself and developed such philosophy through the 1970s, stated that individualist anarchism is different from capitalism due to the individualist anarchists retaining the labor theory of valueRothbard, Murray. \\"Are Libertarians 'Anarchists'?\\". LewRockwell.com. and many writers deny that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism at all, or that capitalism itself is compatible with anarchism. seeing it instead as a form of New Right libertarianism. Anarchist organisations such as the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (Spain) and the Anarchist Federation (Britain and Ireland) generally take an explicitly anti-capitalist stance. In the 20th century, several economists began to formulate a form of radical American libertarianism known as anarcho-capitalism. This has met resistance from those who hold that capitalism is inherently oppressive or statist and many anarchists and scholars do not consider anarcho-capitalism to properly cohere with the spirit, principles, or history of anarchism.Peter Marshall, Demanding the Impossible; John Clark, The Anarchist Moment; Albert Meltzer, Anarchism: Arguments for and Against; Noam Chomsky, Understanding Power, David Weick, Anarchist Justice; Brian Morris, \\"Anthropology and Anarchism,\\" Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed (no. 45); Peter Sabatini, Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy; Donald Rooum, What is Anarchism?; Bob Black, Libertarian as Conservative While other anarchists and scholars regard anarchism as referring only to opposition to the non-privatisation of all aspects of the state and do consider anarcho-capitalism to be a form of anarchism,1) Perlin, Terry M.

Indeed, proponents of this approach strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support anti-capitalist, anti-corporatist, anti- hierarchical and pro-labor positions in economics; anti-imperialism in foreign policy; and thoroughly radical views regarding such cultural issues as gender, sexuality and race.Gary Chartier and Charles W.

For anarcho-capitalists, capitalism mean the free market rather than actually existing capitalism (of which they are critics, arguing that the problem rests on corporatism and state capitalism, a term coined by German socialist Wilhelm Liebknecht, but whose concept can be traced back to anarchists like Mikhail BakuninGouldner, A.

However, the term socialism originally included any opponent of capitalism, a term coined in the 18th century to mean a construed political system built on privileges for the owners of capital.\\"L'Angleterre a-t-elle l'heureux privil√®ge de n'avoir ni Agioteurs, ni Banquiers, ni Faiseurs de services, ni Capitalistes ?\\".

University of Chicago Press. p. 252. Contra anarcho-capitalists, anarchists argue that capitalism necessarily rest on the state to survive and state capitalism is seen as the inevitable result of both capitalism and state socialism. Furthermore, the free market itself for classical economists such as Adam Smith did not necessarily refer to a market free from government interference as it is now commonly assumed or how anarcho-capitalists see it, but rather free from all forms of economic privilege, monopolies and artificial scarcities, implying that economic rents, i.e. profits generated from a lack of perfect competition, must be reduced or eliminated as much as possible through free competition. While anarcho- capitalists who argue for private property which supports absentee and landlordism ownership rather than occupation and use property norms as well as the homestead principle are considered right-libertarians rather than anarchists (this is due to anarchism generally viewing any absentee ownership and ownership claims on land and natural resources as immoral and illegitimateMcElroy, Wendy (1995). \\"Intellectual Property: The Late Nineteenth Century Libertarian Debate\\".

As a whole, anarchism is seen part of the socialist tradition, with the main divide being between anti-market anarchists (most social anarchists, including anarcho- communists, anarcho-syndicalists and collectivist anarchists) who support some form of decentralised economic planning and pro-market anarchists (certain individualist anarchists, including free-market anarchists and mutualists) who support free-market socialism. As such, Chartier has argued that anarcho- capitalists should reject capitalism and call themselves free-market advocates,\\"Advocates of Freed Markets Should Embrace \\"Anti-Capitalism\\". writing that \\"it makes sense for [freed-market advocates] to name what they oppose \\"capitalism.\\" Doing so calls attention to the freedom movement's radical roots, emphasizes the value of understanding society as an alternative to the state, underscores the fact that proponents of freedom object to non- aggressive as well as aggressive restraints on liberty, ensures that advocates of freedom aren't confused with people who use market rhetoric to prop up an unjust status quo, and expresses solidarity between defenders of freed markets and workers ‚Äî as well as ordinary people around the world who use \\"capitalism\\" as a short-hand label for the world-system that constrains their freedom and stunts their lives\\". Another major issue and divide within anarchism and anarcho-capitalism is that of property, more specifically the issues of private property. By property, or private property, ever since Proudhon's book What is Property?, published in 1840, anarchists meant possession (or what other socialists, including Marxists and communists, distingue as personal property) which he considered as liberty (\\"Property is liberty\\") versus productive property (such as land and infrastructure, or what Marxists terms the means of production and the means of labor) which he considered as theft (\\"Property is theft\\"), causing him to also say \\"Property is impossible\\".Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1840). What is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government. Individualist anarchists like Tucker started calling possession as property, or private property. Anarcho- capitalists generally make no such distinction. Such distinction is extremely important to anarchists and other socialists because in the capitalist mode of production private and personal property are considered to be exactly equivalent. They make the following distinctions: * Personal property, or possession, includes items intended for personal use (e.g. one's toothbrush, clothes, homes, vehicles and sometimes money). It must be gained in a socially fair manner and the owner has a distributive right to exclude others. * Anarchists generally agree that private property is a social relationship between the owner and persons deprived (not a relationship between person and thing), e.g. artifacts, factories, mines, dams, infrastructure, natural vegetation, mountains, deserts and seas. In this context, private property and ownership means ownership of the means of production, not personal possessions. * To anarchists and socialists alike, the term private property refers to capital or the means of production while personal property refers to consumer and non-capital goods and services. = Globalization = Many anarchists are actively involved in the anti-globalization movement, seeing corporate globalization as a neocolonialist attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the World Bank, World Trade Organization, Group of Eight and the World Economic Forum. Globalization is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Many anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or cultural imperialism (which they may see as related). Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use globalization to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene. Anarcho-capitalists and market anarchists also see the worldwide expansion of the division of labor through trade (globalization) as a boon, but they oppose the regulation and cartelization imposed by the World Bank, World Trade Organization and \\"managed trade\\" agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). Many also object to fiat money issued by central banks and resulting debasement of money and confiscation of wealth. Groups such as Reclaim the Streets\\"Reclaim the Streets\\" Donnacha DeLong, RT√â News Online 2002.

Anarchists typically discourage the concept of left-wing theories of anarchism on grounds of redundancy and that it lends legitimacy to the notion that anarchism is compatible with capitalism or nationalism. Syndicalist Ulrike Heider categorized anarchism into left anarchism, right anarchism and green anarchism.Heider, Ulrike. Anarchism: Left, Right and Green. San Francisco: City Lights Books. 1994. The terms right anarchism, or right-wing anarchism, have been used to refer to schools of thoughts which are not generally considered part of anarchism, including anarcho-capitalism ,national anarchism and anarcho-conservatism(social anarchism+social & cultural conservatism]Griffin 2003; Goodrick-Clarke 2003; Macklin 2005; Sykes 2005; Sunshine 2008; Sanchez 2009.  Nationalism  Anarchism has a long history of opposing imperialism, both in the core nations (the colonizers) and the periphery nations (the colonized). In general, anarchists have preferred to focus on building revolutions at home and doing solidarity work for comrades in other countries, e.g. Guy Aldred was jailed for printing Shyamji Krishnavarma's The Indian Sociologist. Another example of this was Rudolf Rocker, a prominent German anarchist and anti-fascist who was particularly active amongst Jewish workers. In his Nationalism and Culture, he argued for a \\"federation of European peoples\\" which would include Jews. Rejecting biological theories of race and the concept of nation, he argued that since it was European states that had conquered and colonized the rest of the world, successful libertarian organization amongst Europeans was \\"the first condition for the creation of a world federation which will also secure the so-called colonial peoples the same rights for the pursuit of happiness. Many modern anarchists and other anti-imperialists share this approach.\\"Precarity, or Why 69 is Pink (w/Mondo Foti!)\\". Daily Kos. Retrieved 3 May 2007. Historically, anarchism was supportive of the anationalist movement as well as of the Esperanto language,Firth, Will. \\"Esperanto kaj anarkiismo\\". \\"Anarkiistoj estis inter la pioniroj de la disvastigo de Esperanto.

The so-called national-anarchist movement is not recognized as part of anarchism by anarchists and scholars due to anarchism opposition to nationalism, the nation state, tribalism and neo-tribalism and national-anarchism's perceived racism and sexism, arguing that it represents a further evolution in the thinking of the radical right rather than an entirely new dimension.Griffin 2003.Goodrick- Clarke 2003.Macklin 2005.Sykes 2005. Some accuse national-anarchists of being white nationalists who promote ethnic and racial separatism while others argue they want the militant chic of calling themselves anarchists without the historical and philosophical baggage that accompanies such a claim.Sunshine 2008.Sanchez 2009. During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, there was debate within anarchist circles about whether to take an abstentionist position, vote for independence, or to vote to remain in the United Kingdom, therefore anarchists rarely fitted into the easy binary of Yes/No voters of the referendum, with all seeking to go beyond the choices offered at the ballot box. There was also a debate about what Scottish independence would mean for the anarchist movement and social struggle. Groups like the Anarchist Federation in Scotland (mainly in Edinburgh and Glasgow) took a critical stance skeptical of the benefits of Scottish independence. Scottish anarchists argued that Scottish independence and Scottish nationalism diverted energy away from grassroots struggles and that the movement for Scottish independence sucked people towards Scottish nationalism and electoral politics.  Environment  The environment and sustainability have been an issue for anarchists from at least as far back as Peter Kropotkin's 1899 book Fields, Factories and Workshops, but since the late 1970s anarchists in English- speaking world and European countries have been agitating for the natural environment. Eco-anarchists or green anarchists often embrace deep ecology, a worldview that strives to cultivate biodiversity and sustainability. Eco- anarchists often use direct action against what they see as Earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the Earth First! movement that takes action such as tree sitting. The more militant Earth Liberation Front which grew out of Earth First! also has connections with the anarchist movement. Another important component is ecofeminism which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Murray Bookchin's work on social ecology, David Watson's work with Fifth Estate magazine, Steve Booth's work in the United Kingdom publication Green Anarchist and Graham Purchase's writings on green syndicalism have all contributed to the broad variety and scope of green anarchist/eco-anarchist thought and action. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism and for some green anarchists (including anarcho-primitivists) civilization itself.  Relations with the left  While many anarchists (especially those involved in the anti- globalization movement) continue to see themselves as a leftist movement, some thinkers and activists believe it is necessary to re-evaluate anarchism's relationship with the traditional left. Like many radical ideologies, most anarchist schools of thought are to some degree sectarian. There is often a difference of opinion within each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools. Many anarchists draw from a wide range of political perspectives, such as the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, the Situationists, ultra-leftists, autonomist Marxism and various indigenous cultures. A movement called post-left anarchy seeks to distance itself from the traditional left‚Äîcommunists, socialists, social democrats and the like‚Äîand to escape the confines of ideology in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary leftist movements and single issue causes (anti-war, anti-nuclear and so on). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. Important groups and individuals associated with post-left anarchy include CrimethInc., the magazine Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed and its editor Jason McQuinn, Bob Black, Hakim Bey and others. The term post-anarchism was originated by Saul Newman, first receiving popular attention in his book From Bakunin to Lacan, a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including autonomism, post-left anarchy, Situationism, postcolonialism and Zapatismo. By its very nature, post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. Key thinkers nonetheless associated with post-anarchism include Saul Newman, Todd May, Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari.\\"Post anarchist clearing house\\". Some activists calling themselves insurrectionary anarchists are critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations and advocate informal organization, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles. Proponents include Wolfi Landstreicher and Alfredo M. Bonanno, author of works including Armed Joy and The Anarchist Tension. This tendency is represented in the United States in magazines such as Willful Disobedience and Killing King Abacus. = Communism = While communism is proposed as a form of social and economic organisation by many anarchists, other anarchists consider it a danger to the liberty and free development of the individual.Kropotkin, Peter, \\"Communism and Anarchy\\" . Most schools of anarchism have recognized a distinction between libertarian and authoritarian forms of communism.Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order) (1881‚Äì1908); 3 September 1881; 1, 3; APS Online, p. 3; Tucker uses the terms \\"voluntary\\" and \\"compulsory\\" communisms. Some market anarchists reject the distinction. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon said of communism that \\"whether of the utopian or the Marxist variety, that it destroyed freedom by taking away from the individual control over his means of production\\",\\"Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph\\" (2006). Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. adding: \\"Communism is exploitation of the strong by the weak\\".Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. \\"What Is Property?\\" p. 221. Mikhail Bakunin stated: \\"I hate Communism because it is the negation of liberty and because for me humanity is unthinkable without liberty. I am not a Communist, because Communism concentrates and swallows up in itself for the benefit of the State all the forces of society, because it inevitably leads to the concentration of property in the hands of the State\\".Quoted in Paul Thomas, Karl Marx and the Anarchists, Routledge (1980), p. 303. However, Bakunin was speaking of authoritarian and statist forms of communism and socialism (see also state capitalism and its origins and early uses of the term) as verified by the last line which mentions state property‚Äîanarcho-communists explicitly reject state property and authority, especially centralized authority‚Äîand famously proclaimed: \\"We are convinced that freedom without Socialism is privilege and injustice, and that Socialism without freedom is slavery and brutality\\".Maximov, G. P., ed. (1953).The Political Philosophy of Bakunin. New York: The Free Press. p. 269. Even American individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker, who insisted on the voluntary nature of all association and opposed communism along with majority rule, organized religion and the institution of marriage due to their compulsory nature,Madison, Charles A. \\"Anarchism in the United States\\". Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol 6, No 1, January 1945, p. 56. argued: \\"Whoever denies private property is of necessity an Archist. This excludes from Anarchism all believers in compulsory Communism. As for the believers in voluntary Communism (of whom there are precious few), they are of necessity believers in the liberty to hold private property, for to pool one's possessions with those of others is nothing more or less than an exercise of proprietorship\\". Karl Marx's communist society is actually based on free association which he called a community of freely associated individuals.Marx, Karl (1846). The German Ideology. \\"It follows from all we have been saying up till now that the communal relationship into which the individuals of a class entered, and which was determined by their common interests over against a third party, was always a community to which these individuals belonged only as average individuals, only insofar as they lived within the conditions of existence of their class ‚Äî a relationship in which they participated not as individuals but as members of a class. With the community of revolutionary proletarians, on the other hand, who take their conditions of existence [...] under their control, it is just the reverse; it is as individuals that the individuals participate in it. [...] Communism differs from all previous movements in that it overturns the basis of all earlier relations of production and intercourse, and for the first time consciously treats all natural premises as the creatures of hitherto existing men, strips them of their natural character and subjugates them to the power of the united individuals. Its organization is, therefore, essentially economic, the material production of the conditions of this unity; it turns existing conditions into conditions of unity. The reality, which communism is creating, is precisely the true basis for rendering it impossible that anything should exist independently of individuals, insofar as reality is only a product of the preceding intercourse of individuals themselves\\". Marx's communist society is one in which \\"the full and free development of every individual forms the ruling principle\\" and \\"the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all\\".Marx, Karl (1848). The Communist Manifesto. \\"Chapther II. Proletarians and Communists\\". Hence, Marx justified the forms of equality he did advocate such as the communal ownership and control of the economy on the grounds that they led to human freedom and human development, arguing that \\"the realm of freedom actually begins only where labor which is determined by necessity and mundane considerations ceases; thus in the very nature of things it lies beyond the sphere of actual material production.Marx, Karl (1894). Capital, Volume III. \\"Part VII. Revenues and their Sources\\". According to Allen Woods, a communist society is one that has transcended class antagonisms and \\"would not be one in which some truly universal interest at last reigns, to which individual interests must be sacrificed. It would instead be a society in which individuals freely act as the truly human individuals they are\\", making Marx's communist society radically individualistic. Although Peter Kropotkin, one of the leading proponents of anarcho-communism while also opposing statist communism, argued for an economic model of free distribution between all individuals, many individualist anarchists oppose communism in all its forms on the grounds that voluntary communism is not practicable. Individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker, Victor Yarros and Henry Appleton have denied that communism is a genuine form of anarchism.For instance, Benjamin Tucker says: \\"Yes, genuine Anarchism is consistent Manchesterism, and Communistic or pseudo-Anarchism is inconsistent Manchesterism\\".

Henry Appleton says: \\"All Communism, under whatever guise, is the natural enemy of Anarchism, and a Communist sailing under the flag of Anarchism is as false a figure as could be invented\\". Appleton, Henry. \\"Anarchism, True and False\\". Liberty 2.24. no. 50. 6 September 1884. p. 4.; Clarence Lee Swartz says: \\"One of the tests of any reform movement with regard to personal liberty is this: Will the movement prohibit or abolish private property? If it does, it is an enemy of liberty. For one of the most important criteria of freedom is the right to private property in the products of ones labor.

In the opinion of Appleton, \\"Communism, being opposed to natural law, must necessarily call upon unnatural methods if it would put itself into practice\\" and employ \\"pillage, brute force, and violence\\".Appleton, Henry. \\"The Boston Anarchists\\". . Liberty, Vol. 4, No. 3, May 26, 1886, Whole No. 81. As a response, Albert Meltzer argued that since individualist anarchists like Tucker promote the idea of private armies, they actually support a \\"limited State\\", contending that it \\"is only possible to conceive of Anarchism which is free, communistic and offering no economic necessity for repression of countering it\\". Anarcho-communists also reject the criticism, pointing to the principle of voluntary association that underpins their theory and differentiates it from statist communism. Some individualist anarchists are willing to recognize such communism as a legitimate form. Kevin Carson writes that \\"free market, libertarian communist, syndicalism, and other kinds of collectivist anarchists must learn to coexist in peace and mutual respect today, in our fight against the corporate state, and tomorrow, in the panarchy that is likely to succeed it\\". As a response, there emerged in the 1980s United States the tendency of post-left anarchy which was influenced profoundly by egoism in aspects such as the critique of ideology. Jason McQuinn says that \\"when I (and other anti-ideological anarchists) criticize ideology, it is always from a specifically critical, anarchist perspective rooted in both the skeptical, individualist-anarchist philosophy of Max Stirner\\".\\"What is Ideology?\\" by Jason McQuinn Bob Black and Feral Faun/Wolfi Landstreicher also strongly adhere to Stirnerist egoism. A reprinting of The Right to be Greedy in the 1980s was done with the involvement of Black who also wrote the preface to it. In the book's preface, Black has humorously suggested the idea of \\"Marxist Stirnerism\\" just as he wrote an essay on \\"groucho-marxism\\", writing: \\"If Marxism-Stirnerism is conceivable, every orthodoxy prating of freedom or liberation is called into question, anarchism included. The only reason to read this book, as its authors would be the first to agree, is for what you can get out of it\\". Hakim Bey has said: \\"From Stirner's \\"Union of Self-Owning Ones\\" we proceed to Nietzsche's circle of \\"Free Spirits\\" and thence to Charles Fourier's \\"Passional Series\\", doubling and redoubling ourselves even as the Other multiplies itself in the eros of the group\\".Bey, Hakim (1994). Immediatism. AK Press. p. 4. Bey also wrote: \\"The Mackay Society, of which Mark & I are active members, is devoted to the anarchism of Max Stirner, Benj. Tucker & John Henry Mackay. [...] The Mackay Society, incidentally, represents a little-known current of individualist thought which never cut its ties with revolutionary labor. Dyer Lum, Ezra & Angela Haywood represent this school of thought; Jo Labadie, who wrote for Tucker's Liberty, made himself a link between the American \\"plumb-line\\" anarchists, the \\"philosophical\\" individualists, & the syndicalist or communist branch of the movement; his influence reached the Mackay Society through his son, Laurance. Like the Italian Stirnerites (who influenced us through our late friend Enrico Arrigoni) we support all anti-authoritarian currents, despite their apparent contradictions\\". = Marxism = Anarchism has had a strained relationship with Marxism since Karl Marx's life. The dispute between Marx and Mikhail Bakunin highlighted the differences between anarchism and Marxism, with Bakunin criticizing Marx for his authoritarian bent. Bakunin also argued‚Äîagainst certain ideas of a number of Marxists‚Äîthat not all revolutions need to be violent. For instance, he strongly rejected Marx's concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a concept that vanguardist socialism, including Marxist‚ÄìLeninism, would use to justify one-party rule from above by a party representing the proletariat.Woodcock, George (1962, 1975). Anarchism, p. 158. Harmondsworth, England: Penguin Books. . Bakunin insisted that revolutions must be led by the people directly while any \\"enlightened elite\\" must only exert influence by remaining \\"invisible [...] not imposed on anyone [...] [and] deprived of all official rights and significance\\". He held that the state should be immediately abolished because all forms of government eventually lead to oppression. Bakunin has sometimes been called the first theorist of the concept of a new class, meaning that a class of intellectuals and bureaucrats running the state in the name of the people or the proletariat‚Äîbut in reality in their own interests alone. Bakunin argued that the \\"State has always been the patrimony of some privileged class: a priestly class, an aristocratic class, a bourgeois class. And finally, when all the other classes have exhausted themselves, the State then becomes the patrimony of the bureaucratic class and then falls‚Äîor, if you will, rises‚Äîto the position of a machine\\". Bakunin also had a different view as compared to Marx's on the revolutionary potential of the lumpenproletariat and the proletariat. As such, \\"[b]oth agreed that the proletariat would play a key role, but for Marx the proletariat was the exclusive, leading revolutionary agent while Bakunin entertained the possibility that the peasants and even the lumpenproletariat (the unemployed, common criminals, etc.) could rise to the occasion\\". Bakunin \\"considers workers' integration in capital as destructive of more primary revolutionary forces. For Bakunin, the revolutionary archetype is found in a peasant milieu (which is presented as having longstanding insurrectionary traditions, as well as a communist archetype in its current social form‚Äîthe peasant commune) and amongst educated unemployed youth, assorted marginals from all classes, brigands, robbers, the impoverished masses, and those on the margins of society who have escaped, been excluded from, or not yet subsumed in the discipline of emerging industrial work. [...] [I]n short, all those whom Marx sought to include in the category of the lumpenproletariat\\".Thoburn, Nicholas. \\"The lumpenproletariat and the proletarian unnameable\\". Deleuze, Marx and Politics. While both anarchists and Marxists share the same final goal, the creation of a free, egalitarian society without social classes and government, they strongly disagree on how to achieve this goal. Anarchists, especially social anarchists, believe that the classless, stateless society should be established by the direct action of the masses, culminating in social revolution and refusing any intermediate stage such as the dictatorship of the proletariat on the basis that such a dictatorship will become a self-perpetuating fundament. However, libertarian Marxists argue that Marx used the phrase to mean that the worker control at the point of production and not a party would still be a state until society is reorganized according to socialist principles. For Bakunin, the fundamental contradiction is that for the Marxists \\"anarchism or freedom is the aim, while the state and dictatorship is the means, and so, in order to free the masses, they have first to be enslaved\\". Ultimately, the main divide between anarchism and Marxism is between decentralisation and centralisation, with anarchists favouring decentralisation and Marxists arguing that due to the Industrial Revolution and later stages of the Industrial Revolution a certain degree of authority and centralisation has become necessary or inevitable. Anarchists and many non-Marxist libertarian socialists reject the need for a transitory state phase, claiming that socialism can only be established through decentralized, non-coercive organization. The phrases barracks socialism or barracks communism became a shorthand for this critique, evoking the image of citizens' lives being as regimented as the lives of conscripts in a barracks. Ironically, the term barracks communism\\"–ö–∞–∑–∞—Ä–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏–∑–º\\". Great Soviet Encyclopedia . ()Duncan, Graeme Campbell (1973). Marx and Mill: Two Views of Social Conflict and Social Harmony. p. 194. was coined by Marx himselfMarxism versus Anarchism (2001). p. 88. to refer to a crude, authoritarian, forced collectivism and communism where all aspects of life are bureaucratically regimented and communal. Originally, Marx used the expression to criticise the vision of Sergey Nechayev outlined in \\"The Fundamentals of the Future Social System\\"Glavnyye osnovy budushchego obshchestvennogo stroya (–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–µ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤—ã –±—É–¥—É—â–µ–≥–æ –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å—Ç—Ä–æ—è).

The term barracks here does not refer to military barracks, but to the workers' barracks-type primitive dormitories in which industrial workers lived in many places in the Russian Empire of the time.Busgalin, Alexander; Mayer, G√ºnter (2008). \\"Kasernenkommunismus\\". Historisch-kritisches W√∂rterbuch des Marxismus. 7: I. Spalten. pp. 407‚Äì411 (PDF text) Later, political theorists of the Soviet Union applied this term to China under Mao Zedong. Still later during the Soviet perestroika period, the term was used to apply to the history of the Soviet Union itself. Noam Chomsky is critical of Marxism's dogmatic strains and the idea of Marxism itself, but he still appreciates Marx's contributions to political thought. Unlike some anarchists, Chomsky does not consider Bolshevism \\"Marxism in practice\\", but he does recognize that Marx was a complicated figure who had conflicting ideas. While acknowledging the latent authoritarianism in Marx, Chomsky also points to the libertarian strains that developed into the council communism of Rosa Luxemburg and Anton Pannekoek. However, his commitment to libertarian socialism has led him to characterize himself as an anarchist with radical Marxist leanings. As a response to those critiques, libertarian Marxism refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the anti-authoritarian aspects of Marxism. Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as left communism, emerged in opposition to Marxism‚ÄìLeninismGorter, Herman; Pannekok, Anton; Pankhurst, Sylvia; Ruhl, Otto (2007).

Libertarian Marxism is also often critical of reformist positions, such as those held by social democrats.

He was considered a \\"reporter's reporter\\" and an \\"enduring role model.\\" He won two Pulitzer Prizes as a war correspondent, as well as most of the other major journalism awards. Early life and education Bigart was born in Hawley, Pennsylvania to Homer S. Bigart, a woolens manufacturer, and Anna Schardt Bigart. To author Karen Rothmeyer, he confided near the end of his life: > I decided that I would become an architect because it sounded so prestigious > and so easy. Especially easy.

Journalism career He got a part-time job as a night copy boy at the Herald Tribune, then dropped out of school to work full-time at the newspaper. He had a stutter and a painfully slow typing speed which didn't stop him from being promoted to general assignment reporter after four years. =World War II= In 1942, with World War II raging, Bigart was asked to become a war correspondent. He stated that, although he never liked the war, when he was assigned to London: > [T]hose first few months were about the happiest ones I think I've ever > spent in journalism. I liked the people and I liked the city. There was sort > of a lull in the air raid war so you had the excitement of being in a war > area without any real danger. He and seven other reporters flew bombing missions over Germany as part of \\"The Writing 69th\\". On one such mission to Wilhelmshaven in March 1943, the B-17 bomber formation in which he and reporters Walter Cronkite and Gladwin Hill were flying suffered heavy losses to enemy fighters. He also covered the fighting in North Africa, Italy, and southern France. When Germany surrendered, he went to the Pacific and was one of the first reporters to enter Hiroshima after the atomic bombing.

Newsweek called him \\"the best war correspondent of an embattled generation.\\" He left the Herald Tribune in 1955, a decade before its demise, for The New York Times. He covered the trial of Nazi Adolf Eichmann in 1961. =Vietnam War= In 1962, Bigart was sent to South Vietnam, where he stayed for six months. He soon realized that the war was a mistake, stating \\"I never thought we'd be stupid enough to send ground troops over there in the first place, after the experience in Korea\\". He made enemies by bucking the pressure to report optimistically. He was expelled from South Vietnam by President Ngo Dinh Diem for persistently criticizing him, his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu, and sister-in-law Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu. =Civil rights movement= The New York Times dispatched Bigart to cover some of the most significant events of the struggle of southern blacks for civil rights.

Early career L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga was a knight of the military Order of Santiago, and from 1553 to 1559, governor of Galicia. He was named Peruvian viceroy in late 1560 by King Philip II to replace Andr√©s Hurtado de Mendoza, 3rd Marquis of Ca√±ete, who had been recalled. L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga arrived in Lima and took up the office on February 20, 1561. After his arrival in Peru but before reaching the capital, he sent impertinent messages to his predecessor, just before the death of the latter. Some said that the recall and the insulting communications from L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga had brought about the death of Hurtado de Mendoza. Viceroy of Peru Viceroy L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga On December 14, 1561 he ordered G√≥mez de Tordoya to explore the River Tono, and on December 24, 1561 he commissioned Juan Nieto to conquer the territory of Caman√°. In 1562, the city of Santiago del Estero (today in Tucum√°n province, Argentina) was founded by Francisco de Aguirre on orders of the viceroy. The following year the Audiencia of Quito was established. L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga also founded the city of Safia (Santiago de Miraflores) and directed Crist√≥bal de Valverde to found San Ger√≥nimo de Ica. He founded the town of Arnedo (now Chancay) with the intention of moving the University of San Marcos there, for its tranquility. He began the construction of the entrances that surround the Plaza Mayor in Lima. These were destroyed in the earthquake of October 20, 1687, but later rebuilt. In addition, he directed the separation of the diocese of Chile from that of Peru. He organized and improved schools for the sons of Indigenous leaders. Do√±a Ana de Sol√≥rzano founded a school for poor girls in 1562. L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga favored the monasteries, ordered the construction of an aqueduct to bring potable water to Lima, and passed laws for the improvement of the government of the colony. During his term in office he sent 651,000 ducats to the royal treasury in Spain. He was the first viceroy of Peru to introduce the pomp of a viceregal court, with much attention paid to details of etiquette, ceremony and precedence. Death On February 1, 1564 he issued an edict setting a curfew for 10 p.m. in the city of Lima. On the following February 20, at midnight, four figures with their faces completely covered were seen violating the curfew. They entered the street of Trapitos and took up positions outside one of the houses there. At night this street was one of the most deserted in the city. The block in question was made up of four houses, none of which opened on Trapitos. There were no doors, but there were some balconies overlooking the street. Shortly after the arrival of the masked men, a rope ladder was thrown down from one of these balconies, and a man wrapped in a cape began to descend. Just before he reached the street, the four men lying in wait began to beat him with sandbags. There was a single witness to these events, a young man taking the air on the balcony of the Z√°rate family residence nearby. This man was thought to be Pedro de Z√°rate. He called to his slaves, and together with them he went to investigate the incident. When they arrived, they found the victim dead and the assailants gone. And they discovered that the victim was in fact Viceroy L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga y Velasco, apparently returning from a late-night tryst. Z√°rate was the son of one of the judges of the Audiencia of Lima, and this court was assembled to decide what action to take. The decision was made to move the body to the viceregal palace, and to announce that the viceroy had died of a sudden attack of apoplexy. This was done, but rumors circulated concerning the other explanation of the viceroy's death. It was said that the woman involved was Catalina L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga, a cousin of the viceroy and wife of Rodrigo Manrique de Lara. The later was said to have hired the assassins. This account is the one currently accepted, but it is not certain that it is true. The viceroy was known for his affairs, so perhaps his reputation alone generated the rumors. At least one medical paper (see the fourth reference below) claims to have found evidence that the viceroy died of a stroke, presumably in his palace. The body of L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga y Velasco was interred in the church of San Francisco, and later transferred to Spain.

Robert was dean of Dunkeld as early as 1253, when he was elected to the bishopric of St Andrews on 28 June that year. His election was opposed by the king, Alexander III, and by the bishopric's C√©li D√© chapter. The prior and the canons sent Robert to Rome, but a delegation of the king, including Abel de Golynn, was also sent, and the result was that Robert's election was quashed. Robert remained dean in Dunkeld. In 1273, after the death of Bishop Richard de Inverkeithing, Robert was elected to succeed him. In the following year, the Pope commanded the Bishop of Moray, the Bishop of Aberdeen and the Bishop of Glasgow to investigate his election. The investigation was successful and led to his consecration. Robert probably died in 1283. References *Dowden, John, The Bishops of Scotland, ed. J.

This line of electric guitar pickups was used exclusively by Fender from 1987 to 1996. Lace Sensors are true single-coil pickups; however, internally they are different from classic single coils. The chief difference is that, like the pickups used on the Fender Jaguar, the coil is surrounded by metal barriers which are designed to reduce electro-magnetic interference such as power line hum. According to the manufacturer, these barriers also help concentrate the magnetic field, allowing weaker magnets to be used, which results in less string pull. Less string pull, in turn, means truer pitch and intonation, and superior sustain.  Ratings  Four types of Lace Sensor pickups for Stratocaster were originally manufactured (denoted with an * following the model name), followed by five newer models, each with a different output rating and tone. Lace Sensors are also available for Telecaster, Precision Bass, Fender Jazz Bass and Jazz Bass V.  Dually  A Lace Sensor \\"Dually\\" is effectively a double- coil unit combining two Lace Sensor single-coil pickups in a humbucker configuration. The terminal leads of both pickup coils are accessible individually, so that they can be wired for a coil-splitting option or any other configuration. The humbucking Lace Sensors were used as a standard equipment material on the original Jeff Beck Stratocaster, the Telecaster Plus/Deluxe Plus and the Stratocaster Ultra, manufactured by Fender in the early '90s, as well on some Custom Shop models such as the Set Neck and Contemporary Stratocaster guitars. Usually a humbucker needs to comprise at least two coils with equal output, in order to produce the noise-cancelling effect. Lace Sensors are able to use mismatched coils because both coils are already low in noise even if used as single-coils.  Lace Alumitone  Invented by Jeff Lace and introduced in 2007, Lace Alumitone pickups feature a new design which is aluminum based, rather than copper. The result is less resistance, higher output coupled to a \\"current driven design\\" as opposed to conventional voltage based pickups. The water-jet-cut aluminum exoskeleton is then mated to a micro winding using 90% less fine copper wire. A low- impedance/high-performance pickup is then created. Due to this design, Alumitones can be produced into a variety of shapes and sizes. This makes it possible to fit Alumitones into almost any standard pickup or humbucker routing. Lace produces Alumitones for guitar, bass, pedal steel, extended range guitars and basses, cigar box guitars, and more. Sonically, the pickups produce more bass than traditional single coils, more volume, mids are slightly more than conventional pickups. Highs are balanced and articulate. Early Alumitone pickups were only available with single conductor wiring, all contemporary models offer twin conductor wiring options. http://www.lacemusic.com/alumitone_single_coil.php A Nitro-Hemi Lace Sensor on a hand-made Girouard Guitar.

Often there is sudden onset of pain and walking is difficult. In a complete rupture the ability to extend that knee is decreased. A pop may be felt when it occurs. Injury to the patellar tendon generally requires a significant force such as falling directly on the knee or jumping from a height. Risk factors include patellar tendinitis, kidney failure, diabetes, and steroid or fluoroquinolone use. There are two main types of ruptures: partial and complete. In most cases, the patellar tendon tears at the point where it attaches to the knee cap. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, examination, and medical imaging. Small tears may be treated with rest and splinting, followed by physiotherapy. Larger tears typically require surgery within a couple of weeks. Outcomes are generally good. Rates in the general population are not clear; however, in certain high-risk groups it occurs about 1 in 10,000 per year. They occur most often in those under the age of 40. Signs and symptoms The sign of a ruptured patella tendon is the movement of the patella further up the quadriceps. When rupture occurs, the patella loses support from the tibia and moves toward the hip when the quadriceps muscle contracts, hindering the leg's ability to extend. This means that those affected cannot stand, as their knee buckles and gives way when they attempt to do so. Mechanism The upper part of the patellar tendon attaches on the lower part of the knee cap, and the lower part of the patella tendon attaches to the tibial tubercle on the front of the tibia. Above the knee cap the quadriceps muscle via the quadriceps tendon attaches to the top of the knee cap. This structure allows the knee to flex and extend, allowing use of basic functions such as walking and running.  Diagnosis  Patellar tendon rupture can usually be diagnosed by physical examination. The most common signs are: tenderness, the tendon's loss of tone, loss of ability to raise the straight leg and observation of the high-riding patella. Radiographically, patella alta can be detected using the Insall and Salvati method when the patella is shorter than its tendon. Partial tears may be visualized using MRI scans.Insall and Salvati Method Wheeless Online accessed 22 July 2015  Treatment  Patellar tendon rupture must be treated surgically. With a tourniquet applied, the tendon is exposed through a midline longitudinal incision extending from the upper patellar pole to the tibial tuberosity. The tendon is either avulsed (detached) from the lower patellar pole or lacerated. Even so, the continuity and tone of the tendon should be restored, taking into consideration the patellar height. A cast or brace is then put over where the operation took place. The cast or brace remains for at least 6 weeks followed by an unidentified time of rehabilitation of the knee. The usual risks of surgery are involved, including: infection, stiffness, death, suture reaction, failure of satisfactory healing, risks of anesthesia, phlebitis, pulmonary embolus, and persistent pain or weakness after the injury and repair. If the tendon rupture is a partial tear (without the two parts of the tendon being separated), then non-surgical methods of treatment may suffice. The future of non-surgical care for partial patella tendon ruptures is likely bioengineering. Ligament reconstruction is possible using mesenchymal stem cells and a silk scaffold. These same stem cells have been shown to be capable of seeding repair of damaged animal tendons. In 2010, a clinical study proved that mechanical loading of the tendon callus during the remodelling phase leads to healing by regeneration.

The PTO has been used in both military and civil courts, though they are applied in different ways. Generally, Arab residents of the West Bank or Gaza, being as they are subject to the Military Administration, are tried in military courts due to the lack of citizenship of a sovereign state. (The Palestinian National Authority [PNA] has only an administrative function, as the responsibility of Palestinian representation in the international community is still controlled by the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]). The PTO is also used very rarely in the case of Israeli residents who committed terror attacks, such as members of the 1980s Jewish Underground, as well as Arab Israelis who collaborate with Palestinian terror groups.  The Ordinance  The Ordinance was promulgated in September 1948 in the wake of the assassination by the Jewish underground group Lehi of the United Nations mediator Folke Bernadotte. It was used to forcibly disband not only Lehi but also the larger group the Irgun.  Famous Defendants  Early Years Since the prosecution of fedayoun leaders in the 1950s, many landmarks have been made in the use of this controversial statute. Kozo Okamoto, a member of the Japanese Red Army who committed the 1971 Lod Airport machine gun attack on behalf of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, was given a life sentence and was released in 1997, long after the JRA itself had faded from the spotlight in Japan. Convictions under the law increased exponentially throughout the 1970s, though most of the defendants were low- ranking PLO insurgents caught by patrols. Domestic and Foreign Terror The Gush Emunim Underground became the first Israeli organization to be charged with offences under the act. In the mid-1980s they were convicted for a series of car bombing attempts against Arab mayors in the West Bank, all of whom survived but were severely maimed. The Makhteret legal procedures coincided with the detention of many members of the Hizbullah organization, a Lebanese Islamist group that committed numerous attacks against IDF forces in southern Lebanon as well as civilians within Israel. Though it is unverified whether any Hizbullah members were convicted in civil courts, senior members of the group, including Mustafa Dirani and Sheikh Hassan Obeid, were convicted of security offenses in military courts due to the group's policy of kidnapping Israeli soldiers to ransom for captured comrades. Machteret legal teams used the Israeli policy of releasing senior Hizbullah officials and other terror convicts as justification for their own release, a process in the end succeeded, as by 1992 none of the group's suspects were still behind bars. In the 1990s, as the Shabak began to warn against the proliferation of right- wing, messianic Jewish groups that rejected the authority of the Israeli government as heretical, the Attorney General's Office and Ministry of Justice considered using the law to prevent the growth of violent tendencies within Israel's Jewish population. In 1994, when Kach activist Baruch Goldstein committed the suicidal Hebron massacre, the Rabin government cracked down on the group's activities, as the Shabak increased its surveillance of activists, and leading figures such as Noam Federman, Baruch Marzel, and Itamar Ben-Gvir were put under house arrest. Though the legality of these measures has always been in question, the results have passed the test of time, as the effectiveness of Jewish terror groups in carrying out coordinated or group operations has been minimal, except for \\"lone wolf\\" attacks such as the 2005 Shfaram massacre.  Modern Enforcement  The eruption of the First Intifada in 1987 created the first situation where many residents of the West Bank and Gaza were brought to trial under the law. This situation was even more controversial than the 1970s trials of PLO terror suspects, because there were even defendants convicted of offences such as stone throwing. Since start of the Second Intifada in 2001, many famous defendants have found themselves on the dock in Israeli courts. By far the most famous of them, and maybe in the history of the law itself, is Tanzim and Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades founder Marwan Barghouti was convicted in 2004 on five counts of murder and three of attempted murder, in addition to membership in a terror organization in a civil court. The difficulty of the trial of Barghouti, as with many senior terror suspects as opposed to their \\"foot soldiers\\", is in proving that they have knowledge or acquiescence to the offences connected to them. Barghouti was also accused of over twenty other murder charges that in the end were dropped for lack of proof. Barghouti's trial, though deemed fair, has sparked an international campaign to free him, as the Palestinian National Authority challenges Israeli jurisdiction over him. The trial of Ahmad Saadat, chairman of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, will probably follow a similar course, though as opposed to Barghouti's his is expected to take place in a civil court. Israeli Arabs have also been charged under the act numerous times since 2001, including the murderers of Israeli Minister of Tourism Rehavam Ze'evi \\"Gandhi\\", as well as those who have been caught and charged for conspiracy to assassinate former Sephardi Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yoseph in April 2005, most of whom in both cases are residents of East Jerusalem and therefore hold Israeli citizenship.  Activities Included  In many trials throughout the history of the prosecution of the law, much of the case of the prosecution was based on suspects' membership in the organization and not necessarily on violent or other criminal offences. For example, Fouad Shoubaki (arrested in March 2006), a businessman who funded the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades and helped organize the Karine A weapons shipment will probably be tried for his financial support for terror activities. Israeli Knesset Member Azmi Bishara, the leader of the National Democratic Assembly, was charged in 2001 under the act as well as the Emergency Regulations (Foreign Travel) act for his visits to Syria, a state that is defined as being at war with Israel. He also made two speeches that same year justifying Palestinian terror attacks against Israel. In February 2006 Bishara was cleared of all charges. In an even more bizarre case, in 2004 peace activist Tali Fahima was charged with assistance to a terror organization for her role in complicating IDF operations aimed toward locating and arresting Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades Jenin leader Zakaria Zubeidi. Though it couldn't be proven that Fahima had knowledge of attacks that Palestinian terror groups had planned, the fact that she served as a human shield for Zubeidi and his staff resulted in her conviction. As of June 28, 2006 the IDF has arrested over ten members of the Palestine Legislative Council who are members of the Hamas or are wanted for security offenses as part of Operation Summer Rains, and will be charged as members of a terror organization. Previously there fourteen members of the PLC serving time in Israel jails for security offenses. Among those who are most eligible for prosecution are Foreign Minister Mahmoud al-Zahar, a long-time member of the Hamas's military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, as well as four members of the assembly representing Hamas in East Jerusalem, including Mohammed Abu-Tir, who have lately had their residency revoked. Unlike the cases listed above, most of those arrested will have a difficult time avoiding conviction in an Israeli court, as many of them planned or assisted in terror attacks when they were members of Izzedine al-Qassam.

Early life Ariyoshi was born in Hawaii in 1914 to Japanese immigrant parents. Ariyoshi grew up helping his family make a living on a small eight-acre coffee plantation. He attended Konawaena High School before he worked for six years to help pay off the family debt. Around then, Ariyoshi became interested in labor politics. He attended the University of Hawaii, but became alienated by his perception of institutional bias against labor unions and liberal thought. He transferred to the University of Georgia on scholarship. In Georgia, where he was befriended by the parents of the novelist Erskine Caldwell, Ariyoshi became determined to ease the plight of the sharecroppers he met and to improve labor conditions for the working class. In 1941, Ariyoshi graduated from the University of Georgia with a Bachelor of Arts in journalism (A.B.J.) from the Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication. After graduation, Ariyoshi traveled to San Francisco, where he befriended Karl Yoneda, a founder of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. On December 7th, 1941, the Japanese navy attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Soon afterward, Ariyoshi was placed in the Manzanar War Relocation Center, a Japanese American internment camp. Second World War Ariyoshi met and married his wife, Taeko Ariyoshi, at Manzanar. He decided to help the war effort by working as a language specialist with the United States Army Military Intelligence. He was soon transferred out of the internment camp and into India, Sri Lanka, and Burma because of his ability to translate Japanese. While stationed in the British Colonies, Ariyoshi witnessed what he believed to be the inequality of the colonial system. He was later transferred to China, where he was exposed to the communists. =Dixie Mission= While stationed at the Dixie Mission in Yan'an, Ariyoshi met and worked with both Chinese and Japanese Communists, including Mao Zedong and Sanzo Nosaka. His primary duties in Yan'an were to learn more about the Communist efforts to train Japanese prisoners of war, translate Japanese source materials and develop Allied propaganda against the Japanese. In China, Ariyoshi saw the differences between the peasants' meager lifestyle under the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China and left China with an appreciation for what communism or at least progressive socialism could accomplish. =Other wartime activities= Ariyoshi came into contact with members of the Korean independence movement and the Japanese dissident Kaji Wataru.From Kona to Yenan: The Political Memoirs of Koji Ariyoshi by Koji Ariyoshi Page 107 - 134 Postwar Ariyoshi returned to Hawaii in 1948 and, inspired by the progressive Japanese-language paper, Hawaii Hochi, began publishing a labor-oriented newspaper, the Honolulu Record. As editor, Ariyoshi lambasted labor conditions for the working class and addressed what he considered to be other social inequalities in the islands. His socialist views bolstered the growth of the local labor movement and the Democratic Party in Hawaii. However, at the height of the Second Red Scare and McCarthyism, he and six other progressives (including Jack Hall, the head of the Hawaii Longshoremen's Union) were arrested under charges of attempting to overthrow the American government under the Smith Act. The case later became known as the Hawaii Seven. Ariyoshi spent one night in jail, and after his release, he continued to promote his socialist views through his paper. The court found him guilty, but he appealed the ruling and was eventually acquitted of all charges. Madame Sun Yat-sen, the widow of Sun Yat-sen, \\"the George Washington of China ,\\" had donated her mother's wedding dress to be sold to provide funds for Ariyoshi's legal defense. In 1958, Ariyoshi was forced to close his newspaper for lack of funds. He became a florist, earning himself the nickname, \\"The Red Florist.\\" In 1969, he was appointed a member of the Hawaii Foundation for History and the Humanities. Ariyoshi was later appointed president of the organization, a position that he held for three years. With the American opening to China, Ariyoshi was one of the first Americans invited to return to that country, even before President Nixon's visit. He wrote a series of articles for the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, and a television documentary on Chinese arts and crafts, which helped to repopularize cloisonne in the country. He was a founder of the Hawaii-China People's Friendship Association to improve relations between China and the United States. He served on the national steering committee of the U.S.-China Friendship Association from its founding in 1974 until his death. In later life, Ariyoshi began teaching at the University of Hawaii in the Ethnic Studies Department. In 1976 the Hawaii Legislature honored Ariyoshi for his life's work and apologized for the things that had been done to him in the McCarthy era. Koji Ariyoshi died later that year, and an annual award in his name was established by the U.S.-China Peoples Friendship to honor an outstanding figure in promoting U.S.-China friendship. In film On May 5, 2005, he was featured in the Biography Hawaii series airing on PBS Hawaii. The documentary featured original footage of Ariyoshi during his time in Yen'an and explored his persecution during the 1950s.

The company produced a range of coloured glassware in the 1920s, initially with opaque shades, but moving on to transparent shades by the end of the decade. Unable to compete with mass-produced glassware, the company closed briefly in 1954, but was reopened in 1955. However, financial difficulties persisted, and, after several ownership changes, the factory closed for good in 1958. Imperial Glass Company purchased the Cambridge Glass molds two years later, and would use them for another three decades until that company went bankrupt in 1984. Early history The Cambridge Glass Company was chartered in 1873 by a group of Cambridge, Ohio businessmen. But it was not until 1899, when the site was purchased by the newly formed National Glass Company, that funds became available to start the construction of this new glass factory. In 1901, The Cambridge Glass Company was organized by Myron Case, Casey Morris, Addison Thompson, Andy Herron and Fred Rosemond, who were owners of the National Glass Company of Pennsylvania. Under Arthur J. Bennett's Leadership During construction of the plant, Arthur J. Bennett, a native of England, was hired to manage this new factory. Having experience in the china and glass trades, Mr. Bennett proved to be an excellent choice for the position. He was funded to come to America by his father who was a plumber in England. (Nicole Orme) The first piece of glass, a three pint pitcher, was produced in May 1902. A variety of heavy pressed patterns were produced during the next five years. Many of the patterns were of Mr. Bennett's own design. Sometime around 1903-1904 the company's first trademark came into being, the words \\"Near Cut\\" pressed into the glass. Cambridge Glass soon became known worldwide for quality in both \\"crystal and colors, pressed and blown.\\" In 1907, the National Glass Company experienced financial problems that ended in receivership for the company. By supplementing his life savings with local bank financing, Mr. Bennett was able to raise the necessary $500,000 to purchase the Cambridge Glass Company in its entirety. The company continued to prosper under his ownership, and in 1910 was expanded to include an additional plant at nearby Byesville, Ohio ‚Äì under the name of The Byesville Glass and Lamp Co. Many of the deep plate etched patterns were introduced during this time period, some of which were Marjorie and Betty, named after members of Mr. Bennett's family. Through these early years, the company operated its own coal mines and consumed 50 tons daily producing raw gas to fire its melting pots. It also used natural gas produced from its own wells. The abundant supply of natural resources had been one of the main reasons for locating this factory in Ohio. During 1916, things slowed quite a bit, and in 1917 it was decided to close the factory in Byesville and transfer those operations back to the Cambridge plant. The 1920s were years of expansion and heralded a new trademark - the letter \\"C\\" enclosed within a triangle. Mr. Bennett decided to introduce a variety of opaque colored items into their line. With as many as 700 employees working three shifts a day, very strong lines of colored ware and complete dinner services were added to the production from the 56 pots of glass being used. Figural shapes became popular in the occasional pieces. The company was also producing a complete line of pharmaceutical items. It was said, \\"If it will sell, Cambridge will produce it.\\" The 1930s were perhaps the most prolific years of Cambridge development, with the new colors (Carmen, Royal Blue, Crown Tuscan and Heatherbloom), and new patterns, (#3400 line, Caprice line, Statuesque stem line, Rose Point etching) being developed. Leadership change During the peak of the Cambridge Glass Company, Mr. Bennett served as president of the company, his son-in-law, Wilber L. Orme was vice president; Mrs. Bennett as director; William C. McCartney as secretary; G. Roy Boyd as treasurer and K.C. Kelley as factory superintendent. In July 1939, Mr. Bennett sold the controlling interest of the company to his son-in- law, Wilber L. Orme, who continued to develop designs and colors. However, Mr. Bennett continued as president until his death in February 1940. In 1950, the Cambridge Square pattern won top honors across the United States for its modern design. In the early 1950s the demand for fine handmade glassware began to decrease, and the competition of foreign and machine-made glass began taking its toll. In 1954, Mr. Orme decided to close the plant, ending one of the best and most prosperous glass companies the world has ever known. Cambridge Colors Color played a significant role in the success of Cambridge Glass Co. They produced opaque glass and then moved onto transparent colors. The opaque shades were produced in early 1920s with colors such as helio, jade, primrose, azurite and ebony. In the latter of the 1920s there was a shift to transparent colors in light colors. In the 1930s, the company moved to darker colors such as forest, amethyst and royal blue. Towards the end of the 1930s, most of the lines made were done in crystal. One of the darker colors they started to use was the amethyst which they invented and patented (reliable source the granddaughter.) Sidney Albert, Imperial Glass Shortly after closing in 1954, the company was sold to a firm headed by Sidney Albert of Akron, Ohio. The plant reopened in March 1955. Sales were very poor, and in 1956 Morrison Industries Ltd. of Boston, Massachusetts, acquired possession. Sales continued to be slow and with management problems. The company closed its doors for the final time in 1958. In November 1960, Imperial Glass Company of Bellaire, Ohio, acquired the Cambridge molds and equipment. 1984 saw Imperial forced into bankruptcy. At this time the National Cambridge Collectors purchased many of the molds, all of the etching/decorating plates and other assets of Cambridge Glass from Imperial. These items are now located on the museum grounds. The N.C.C., due to a lack of funds and miscommunication, could not purchase all of the molds. Some are now owned by other glass companies. Demolition of factory The Cambridge Glass factory building was demolished in 1989 when the owners decided the factory had deteriorated beyond repair. All the buildings were razed.

They play an important ecological role when they run during the rainy season.  Climate  The Kavango Region has a long dry season from April to November and a subsequent wet period from December to March. In the dry season in winter, the humidity is at 30% and the daily maximum daytime temperatures are above 25 ¬∞C. The temperature on cold nights can fall to less than 5 ¬∞C, but is usually around 12 ¬∞C. The rainy season in summer is marked by a humidity of 60% and daily highs typically between 30¬∞ and 40 ¬∞C. Even at night the temperature does not fall below 15 ¬∞C. The annual precipitation average is 550 millimeters, with 80% during the months December to March.  Vegetation  The dominant vegetation in the park is species-rich, high and short dry forest and dry acacia forest. Trees can reach a height of up to 10 m and have a relatively dense undergrowth. The species range includes Pterocarpus angolensis,Baikiaea plurijuga, Burkea africana and Guibourtia coleosperma. In contrast to the dry high forest the trees in the lower forest reach less than 5 meters height. Species include Lonchocarpus neisii and Terminalia serica, interspersed with Faidherbia albida and Grewia. Along the Omiramba is denser acacia dry forest, often with very large population of thorn bushes including Acacia erioloba, Acacia fleckii, Acacia hebeclada and Acacia tortilis together with occasional Combretum imberbe and Combretum hereroense. The bed of the Omiramba is peaty-boggy and consists of dense Reed including Phragmites and more infrequently, water lilies. Terminalia prunoides (blood fruit trees) also dominate.  Fauna  The unspoiled nature of the reserve encourages a rich and varied wildlife in the dry forest. The ideal time for seeing wildlife is from June to October. From November to March more than 320 species of birds inhabit the area, including parrots and more than 50 birds of prey. Big game can be found in the park occasionally, more than 500 African bush elephants, many Angolan giraffes and many antelope, including roan antelope, kudu, lyre antelope, eland and reedbuck. Even the stock of prey animals is high. Besides the smaller cats, there is a larger population of lions, but also leopards, spotted hyenas, jackals, occasionally cheetahs and even Cape wild dogs. Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit together with Caprivi Game Park.IUCN Cat Specialist Group (2006). Conservation Strategy for the Lion Panthera leo in Eastern and Southern Africa. IUCN, Pretoria, South Africa.  Tourism  Khaudum is isolated.

It is styled after Disney's 1999 film Tarzan. Disneyland version In February 1999, Disneyland closed its version of the Swiss Family Treehouse and Imagineers re-themed the attraction to coincide with the soon- to-be released Tarzan film. The giant artificial tree received a comprehensive makeover, including 6,000 replacement vinyl leaves, a suspension bridge entrance from a new neighboring tree, and a variety of hands-on interactive features. The tree is currently 70 feet tall and weighs 150 tons. On June 23, 1999, Tarzan's Treehouse began welcoming park guests, just as Disney's animated Tarzan premiered in movie theaters. Tributes to the Swiss Family Treehouse are featured in the attraction including the \\"Mind Thy Head\\" sign and the \\"Swisskapolka\\", which can be heard playing on a vintage gramophone. Hong Kong Disneyland version When Hong Kong Disneyland opened on September 12, 2005, it included Tarzan's Treehouse built on Tarzan's Island.

The program issued loans from 1965 until it was ended in 2010. Similar loans are now provided under the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, which are federal loans issued directly by the United States Department of Education. The FFEL was initiated by the Higher Education Act of 1965 and was funded through a public/private partnership administered at the state and local level. In 2007-08, FFEL served 6.5 million students and parents, lending a total of $54.7 billion in new loans (or 80% of all new federal student loans). Since 1965, 60 million Americans have used FFEL loans to pay for education expenses. Following the passage of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 on January 5, 2010 the program was terminated, and no subsequent loans were permitted to be made under the program after June 30, 2010. Overview In the FFEL Program, private lenders made federally guaranteed student loans to parents and students. Commercial lenders (e.g. Sallie Mae; now Navient) would use their private capital to finance loans under the FFELP but received subsidies from the federal government. These subsidies were used to maintain interest rates at the federally mandated levels, pay down fees associated with the loans and cover expenses associated with collection and defaults. The government also guaranteed a large portion of the loans, insuring private lenders against default. If a parent or student defaults, the private lender was reimbursed by the government for its losses. In contrast, under the Direct Loan program, the government lends directly to students using federal funds provided to it by the US Treasury. Loan types The FFELP offers four types of loans: the subsidized Federal Stafford Loans, unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans, the Federal PLUS Loan for graduate students and for parents of dependent undergraduate students, and consolidation loans. The main federal student loan is the Stafford Loan. There are two types of Stafford loans: *Subsidized. For students who meet a financial needs test, the government pays all interest costs on behalf of borrowers while they are in school, and during grace and deferment periods. Repayment begins six months after graduation or the student withdraws to a less than half time status. *Unsubsidized. Students who do not meet a financial needs test or who need to supplement their subsidized loans may receive unsubsidized Stafford loans. Borrowers may defer payment of interest during school, grace, and deferment periods, but they are responsible for all interest that accrues. Repayment begins six months after graduation or the student withdraws to a less than half time status. =Interest rates= Interest rates are set by law, as follows: *For most Stafford loans made before July 1, 2006: Variable rate applies (changing annually with an 8.25% cap). *Stafford loans made beginning July 1, 2006: 6.8%. *New subsidized Stafford loans to undergraduates beginning July 1, 2008 (per recent budget reconciliation law): 6.0% for a loan first disbursed between July 1, 2008, and June 30, 2009 5.6% for a loan first disbursed between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010 4.5% for a loan first disbursed between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2011 3.4% for a loan first disbursed between July 1, 2011, and June 30, 2012 *Interest rate under the new law does not extend to loans disbursed after June 30, 2012. The rate for these new loans will revert to 6.8%. The law did not affect new unsubsidized Stafford loans. The rate remains 6.8% *PLUS loans made beginning July 1, 2006: 8.5% in FFEL Program; 7.9% in DL Program. For PLUS loans made before July 1, a variable rate applies (with a 9.00% cap). * The House passed a resolution in May 2013 to tie student loan rates to free market loan rates. Every year, student loan interest rates will adjust to fit the market. subsidized and unsubsidized rates will cap at 8.5%. Servicers The United States Department of Education awards contracts to private companies to administer FFLP loans and receive payments from borrowers. 90% of the loans are administered by four organizations: * Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency * Navient Corporation (formerly part of Sallie Mae) * Nelnet * Great Lakes Higher Education Corporation (subsidiary of Nelnet) There are also five smaller non-profit loan servicers: * Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri * Higher Education Services Corp. (New York) * Granite State Management and Resources (New Hampshire) * Oklahoma Student Loan Authority * CornerStone Education Loan Services (Utah) Loan forgiveness Because they are private loans, loans granted under the FFEL program are not eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. There have been media reports of many FFEL borrowers unaware their loans were ineligible. FFEL borrowers can gain access to loan forgiveness by consolidating an existing loan with the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, but payments made before consolidating do not count toward loan forgiveness. End of new loans On 24 April 2009, President Barack Obama called for an end to the FFEL program, calling it a wasteful and inefficient system of \\"taxpayers...paying banks a premium to act as middlemen‚Äîa premium that costs the American people billions of dollars each year....a premium we cannot afford.\\" A Congressional Budget Office review in July 2009 showed that if the government did the direct lending itself, rather than use private sector lenders via FFEL, it would save $80 billion over ten years.http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/104xx/doc10479/hr3221.pdf That estimate was later downgraded to $61 billion after the Congressional Budget Office revised its estimates for 2010.http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/113xx/doc11379/amendreconprop.pdf America's Student Loan Providers, an industry lobbying group representing private lenders, issued a prepared statement on April 6, 2009 stating \\"a growing consensus\\" among legislators \\"that large scale changes in the financial aid delivery system should be carefully considered.\\"http://studentloanfacts.org/NR/rdonlyres/81D7AFB7-FAC8-4F0F-8675-0F71DA0F478F/10746/HouseSenateBudgetVotes04.pdf The program was ended according to the provisions of the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which passed in 2010 as a rider bill to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

It opened on May 14, 2005, with the daughter of celebrated baseball player Babe Ruth in attendance. After ten years of operation the museum closed abruptly on October 12, 2015 after failing to reach an agreement with the Maryland Stadium Authority for the continued use of Camden Station. The museum was adjacent to the main gate of Oriole Park at Camden Yards and had artifacts and interactive exhibits profiling Maryland‚Äôs sports history. Exhibits included such area teams as the Baltimore Orioles, Baltimore Ravens, Baltimore Colts, Maryland Terrapins, Baltimore Elite Giants, Baltimore Black Sox, and the Baltimore Blast. The museum was housed in the former Camden Station, originally constructed in 1857 by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) as its main passenger station in Baltimore. After being vacant since the 1980s, the depot's exterior was restored in the 1990s as part of the development of the Camden Yards Sports Complex. Later interior renovations and remodeling were made to accommodate the building's adaptive reuse as a sports museum. Geppi's Entertainment Museum, which opened in September 2006, was located on the upper level of the building, directly above where Sports Legends at Camden Yards was, until 2018. The nearby Babe Ruth Birthplace & Museum remains in existence as a separate museum on Emory Street, two and a half blocks from Camden Station. A replica of the Vince Lombardi Trophy from Super Bowl V is part of the museum's collection. The original trophy from the Colts' 1971 Super Bowl victory was taken by former owner Carroll Rosenbloom after he traded the Colts for the Los Angeles Rams in 1972.

It opened at its current location on Main Street, U.S.A. on October 2, 2009. From 1987-2007 it was located in New Orleans Square above the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction. The Gallery is a changing exhibition area focused primarily on artwork from Walt Disney Imagineering created in the designing of the Disneyland theme park. Merchandise relating to the current exhibition is usually available for purchase as well. History =The Royal Suite= In the early 1960s, as construction of New Orleans Square was proceeding, Walt Disney decided he needed a bigger entertaining facility for various VIPs that came to the Park. He already had an apartment above the Fire Station on Main Street, U.S.A., but it was too small to host extensive events. Walt decided to place the suite in New Orleans Square, away from the hustle and bustle of the park. Walt brought in set designer Dorothea Redmond, famous for the sets in Gone with the Wind, to help him with the apartment layout. To furnish and decorate the area, Walt left his wife Lilly and Walt Disney Studio set decorator Emile Kuri to collaborate, as they had on other projects (Club 33, the Firehouse Apartment, etc.). The project was christened The Royal Suite, after the street in New Orleans Square (Royal Street) the apartment's entrance is on. Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966. As a consequence, many projects at Walt Disney Productions were either put on hold or abandoned. The Royal Suite was abandoned at the request of the surviving brother, Roy. He felt that the family could not really enjoy The Royal Suite with Walt gone. The Suite was fairly close to completion at the time of Walt's death, including infrastructure and plumbing. =New tenants= The Insurance Company of North America (INA) took over the location after the Disney apartment was abandoned. They retained Emile Kuri to decorate the space to approximate the look of the Disney apartment. INA renamed the apartment 21 Royal Street, after the apartment's numerical address. It served as a hospitality suite for INA employees and clients during their day at the park. INA moved out of the suite in 1974 and Disneyland International moved in, using the space as executive offices. DLI helped plan Tokyo Disneyland with the Oriental Land Company. There was even a large scale model of the park placed in one of the rooms so the Japanese executives could physically see the layout of their new park. =The Gallery= DLI moved out in the mid-1980s when they outgrew their headquarters. The space was left with an uncertain future. At the same time, Imagineer Tony Baxter was put on a project to improve guest traffic around the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction. The queue for Pirates would get so long at times that it would block the walkway into New Orleans Square and Bear Country. Baxter finally decided on the current configuration, with the queue going underneath a themed footbridge, thereby freeing the walkway. He then set his sights on Walt's old Royal Suite, just above the queue. Baxter designed a pair of ornamental staircases that would hug the footbridge and create a unique frame for the building exterior. Baxter had thought that a beautiful place like Walt's suite was going to waste not being seen by park guests. Baxter asked recently elected Walt Disney Company President and COO Frank Wells what the plans were for the upstairs area. Wells said that Club 33 was vying for the space in order to add more membership slots. Baxter came to Wells with an idea for an art gallery open to park guests. The Imagineers had always wanted a place to display their artwork for the theme parks, which went largely unseen by the public. The Disney Gallery was born. The gallery is unique in all of Disneyland because it is the only location in the entire park that is listed as both an attraction and a merchandise location on the park's map. The cast members who work the location are from the Disneyland Merchandise division, but are specially trained to run the gallery as a museum. Cast Members are encouraged to give guests free tours of the gallery, informing visitors of the facility's rich history and the current exhibition. The Gallery's New Orleans Square location closed its doors on August 7, 2007. The space was turned into the Disneyland Dream Suite. Imagineers converted the space into a two-bedroom, two-bath guest suite, using the original 1960s designs created by designer Dorothea Redmond and set decorator Emile Kuri in consultation with Walt Disney. Walt Disney Imagineering Art Director Kim Irvine says that the suite would \\"be filled with things that might have inspired Walt as he dreamed of Disneyland.\\" Each of the bedrooms feature a special nighttime lighting effect, activated at the push of a button. =Current location= The Gallery opened at its current location on Main Street U.S.A. on October 2, 2009 in the space previously occupied by the Annual Passport Center/Bank of Main Street U.S.A. New Orleans Square Gallery layout The Disney Gallery comprised several rooms and antechambers, as it was designed to be living quarters for the Disney family. Each room contained its own set of artwork and usually revolved around a certain theme that pertained to the overall exhibit. =Front Room/Formal Sitting Room= The first room guests walked into was known as the Front Room. This was the introductory room to the exhibit and set the stage for what lay ahead. Artwork in this room was usually more broad, getting more specific as guests progressed through the room. As the Royal Suite, this room was known as the Formal Sitting Room. This is where Walt's guests would have spent most of their time, both before and after a meal. The guest entrance from the staircase was originally just another window when the building was first constructed. The balcony with the Pirates of the Caribbean marquee on the front was originally a false balcony and had to be reinforced to accommodate people. =Vestibule= To the left of the front room was the vestibule. This miniature hallway contained two rooms that were off-limits to guests. Upon entering the vestibule, the door on the right led to the print room, which was the nerve center for the gallery's Art-on-Demand system. When the gallery opened this room was an administrative office, used for training and other purposes. The room on the left led to a small office that was used by the management of the gallery. The two rooms were originally designed for two very distinct purposes. The manager office was intended to be a men's smoking lounge. Walt Disney was a smoker for most of his life (and actually died from causes related to lung cancer) and planned on having a separate, ventilated room where he and his friends could light up without making anyone else uncomfortable. The print room's intended use is not clearly known, though it is presumed the room was going to be used as a guest room or a room for Walt's grandchildren to play in. =Collector's Room/Informal Sitting Room= The room to the right of the Front Room was known as the Collector's Room. The retail operation of the Gallery was located here. The merchandise changed with the exhibition, but some mainstays of the Gallery have been miniature, matted, vintage attraction posters and books about Disney art and Disney history. The Art-on-Demand kiosks were also located here, allowing guests to choose a specific picture and have that picture custom printed for them. The system has been popular with longtime guests and offers a less-expensive alternative to lithographs, giclees, and other expensive pieces. The prints come in different sizes, with prices ranging from $15 ‚Äì $50. Framing for these and other pieces is also available. This room was originally known as the Informal Sitting Room. Often compared to a modern-day den, the Informal Sitting Room was a place for Walt and his guests to sit and relax before and after dinner. It is likely that the television would have gone in this room. There was also going to be a wet bar (used as a cash register area for the Gallery), where Walt could have mixed fancy drinks and served appetizers for his guests. Cast Members like to point out the Sub-Zero miniature refrigerator, as it is the same one installed in 1966, and it still works. =Balcony= The Collector's Room was the only way to access the Gallery's expansive balcony. Guests could sit up in the Balcony and people watch as long as they want. In the evening, the Gallery Balcony was used as a hard-ticket seating area for the Fantasmic! river show. The seats included an all-you-can-eat dessert buffet with unlimited soft drinks and coffee. The price was very steep and usually coincides with the price of Park admission. The Balcony holds very distinctive evidence that the Disney brothers were going to share The Royal Suite. Within the wrought iron of the Balcony's barrier are the initials \\"WD\\" and \\"RD\\", for \\"Walt Disney\\" and \\"Roy Disney\\". The initials are so expertly crafted that they do not stand out from the rest of the ironwork. The balcony is the only area in the entire gallery where Walt Disney actually stood. =Back Hallway/Grand Entrance= Traveling through the Collector's Room, guests would find the Back Hallway. This area was originally used to display collector's lithographs and other framed artwork. Sample Art-on-Demand pieces also hung in this area. In the later days of the Gallery this area was used as another exhibit room displaying artwork for viewing. The Back Hallway was originally the Grand Entrance to the Disney apartment. The door at the rear is connected to the ground floor by a nondescript flight of stairs located in a small courtyard (the Royal Courtyard is currently occupied by an extension of the Pieces of Eight shop). The marker that denotes the address of the apartment still stands. The staircase and back door is considered off-limits to guests. =Blue Room/Formal Dining Room= The room to the right of the Back Hallway was known as the Blue Room. The name came from the color of the wall when the Gallery first opened. This was the largest exhibit area until early 2007, when the room was divided in half. One half was given to Club 33 as storage space which was then turned into Club 33's kitchen. The half that remained as the Gallery was a more intimate space. When the Blue Room was whole, a side balcony on the far side of the room was used as a VIP seating area for Fantasmic! This balcony was off-limits to guests at all times, and was only reserved for special guests of The Walt Disney Company. This room would have been The Royal Suite's Formal Dining Room. Originally rectangular in shape, it would have accommodated a large dining room table that could have probably seated 15 - 20 guests. On the far side of the room was an outline for a doorway that would have led to the Club 33 kitchen. The Royal Suite had no real kitchen, so it was necessary for the Club's chefs to provide all the meals. =Patio= Patio area of the Disney Gallery The Patio was the \\"hub\\" of the Gallery, with almost every room attached to it. The Patio contained tables and chairs, where guests could bring up food and have a meal away from the bustling crowds of the rest of the Park. Originally conceived by Lillian Disney, the Patio was a place where Lilly could be outdoors, but away from the Park guests. Lilly also purchased the bronze fountain head sculpture, as well as other antiques located throughout the Gallery. Since she was a lover of plants, Lilly had planters installed wherever possible. Walt also had a hand in the design of the Patio. There are air conditioning ducts located on the eaves of the roof, surrounding the patio. This was a system that Walt was experimenting with to provide air conditioning outdoors. The ducts in the eaves would provide an invisible barrier, while the ducts located underneath the eaves would actually regulate the temperature. It was never hooked up and never used. =Green Room/Master Bedroom= To left of the patio, cut off from the rest of the Gallery was the Green Room, named for the same reason as the Blue Room. This room changed little since the Gallery opened and was the largest display area in the Gallery The room was tucked away from the rest of the Gallery because it was going to be used as the Master Bedroom. Lilly enjoyed her privacy and wanted the bedroom to be essentially off-limits to their guests. A large bay window was located next to the bedroom door (later covered by another display wall) so that Lilly could look out onto her garden patio, even when inside the room. The Master Bedroom also had a bathroom with a marble sink top, a shower alcove, and a toilet; there was no tub. The bathroom space was used as a merchandise stockroom and remained locked at all times. Exhibition history Since its opening on July 11, 1987, The Disney Gallery had changing exhibits to keep things fresh and current. The length of the exhibits ranged from ten years to three months. Other locations The first Walt Disney Gallery was opened outside of the park next to the Disney Store, Main Place Santa Ana mall in California on November 4, 1994 and was operated by Disney Store, under Doug Murphy, vice president of the Walt Disney Gallery. The prototype store was designed by Disney Imagineering. The 3,100-square-foot store used a museum shop method for its products organized into four sections, The Animation Gallery, The Contemporary Gallery, Vintage Disney and The Gallery Shop. Doug Murphy was hired by Disney Store as manager of new business development in September 1991 promoted to head business development in April 1993 then appointed vice president of the Walt Disney Gallery for Disney Store in December 1994. In late May 1995, the store held a meet and discussion with Beauty and the Beast musical costume designer Ann Hould-Ward and offering some of her work, limited edition lithographs, original watercolor sketches, line drawing and works-in-progress collages, plus film's animation. The main product lines are Disney animation art, collectibles, fashions and home accessories. This location was stocked with high-priced animation art, dinnerware, flatware, Lladr√≥ figures, fashion, laser discs and research books. The feature artists included Amadio-Smith Raku, Bob Kliss and Paul Butler. The store was later closed. Fashion items included marcasite cuff links and necklaces by Judith Jack, Kathrine Baumann designed pave minaudi√®re and purse accessories, sterling silver by Judy Kuo and Bill Schiffer and G√©rald Genta designed watches. Also, Nicole Miller designed a collection sold there that included backpack, eyewear case and toiletry kit. Items from Disney's private label were of higher quality. Baumann's limited edition minaudieres‚Äî-crystal covered purses shaped in the heads of Mickey and Minnie Mouse generated the most conversation. At $1,600, these jewelry boxes have been purchased by cereal heiress Mercedes Kellogg Bass, Michael Eisner's wife, Jane, diet guru Jenny Craig and others. By 2006, another location opened in Downtown Disney, Orlando.

History  Dr. Phillips High School opened in fall of 1987 and was built for approximately 2,500 students in the Dr. Phillips area of southwest Orange County, Florida. The campus is situated on in the Orlando city limits and unincorporated Orange County. The school's first principal, Bill Spoone, went on to be elected to the Orange County School Board. The football stadium is named after him. The school's gymnasium is named after its second principal, Larry Payne, and is nicknamed \\"The House of Payne.\\" The school opened with enrollment above capacity and began using portable classrooms on the North Campus, formerly known as the 9th Grade Center. Due to overflow from main campus, many non-freshman classes were moved into additional portable classrooms at the 9th Grade Center. Because the students attending classes at the 9th Grade Center were of mixed grade level, the name was changed to North Campus, with the main campus renamed the South Campus. Portable classrooms are still used on the North Campus and are primarily for freshman-level classes. As of the 2014-15 school year the school had 3,641 students, of whom 35% were Caucasian, 32% African American, 24% Hispanic, 7% Asian, and 2% multiracial.Student Teacher Ratio Dr. Phillips High School - Orlando, Florida - FL The school underwent a series of renovations which finished in 2015. A new building has been added, along with new VPA classrooms on the South Campus.  Athletics  The press box at Bill Spoone Stadium is dedicated to Mike Murray, \\"The Voice of the Panthers\\" since the school opened its doors in 1987. A full-time employee of a large aerospace contractor and not formally employed by the school, Murray was elected to their Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001. The school's baseball facility is John Barbati Field. In 1992, the baseball facilities were completely renovated with a state of the art press box, team office and facilities. The new facilities were designed and constructed by William P. Riegert, CEO of Cox Associates, Architects, and donated to the OC School Board in a dedication ceremony on February 22, 1992. Accepting for the OC School Board were Assistant Superintendent Dave Wofford, Assistant Superintendent Dave Sojourner, Superintendent Don Shaw, Bill Spoone, and Bill Thompson. Today the Press Box is dedicated to Scott Muhlhann, a baseball player and 1992 school valedictorian who died of cancer in 1998.

N. Findlay, was a South African philosopher. Education and career After reading classics and philosophy as a boy and at the University of Pretoria, Findlay received a Rhodes scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford for the years 1924‚Äì1926. He completed Oxford's classics course (also known as \\"Greats\\") in June 1926, and stayed on for a fragment of a third year before returning to a lectureship appointment in South Africa. He later completed his doctorate in 1933 at Graz, where he studied under Ernst Mally. From 1927 to 1966 he was lecturer or professor of philosophy at the University of Pretoria, the University of Otago in New Zealand, Rhodes University College, Grahamstown, the University of Natal, Pietermartizburg, King's College, Newcastle, and King's College London. Following retirement from his chair at London (1966) and a year at the University of Texas at Austin, Findlay continued to teach full-time for more than twenty years, first as Clark Professor of Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics at Yale University (1967‚Äì1972), then as University Professor and Borden Parker Bowne Professor of Philosophy (succeeding Peter Bertocci) at Boston University (1972‚Äì1987). Findlay was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1955 to 1956 and president of the Metaphysical Society of America from 1974 to 1975, as well as a Fellow of both the British Academy and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was also an Editorial Advisor of the journal Dionysius. A chair for visiting professors at Boston University carries his name, as does a biennial award given for the best book in metaphysics, as judged by the Metaphysical Society of America. Findlay betrayed a great commitment to the welfare and formation'\\"I owe to [Findlay‚Äôs] teaching, directly or indirectly, all that I know of either Logic or Ethics\\" (A. N. Prior). of generations of students (Leroy S. Rouner was fond of introducing him as \\"Plotinus incarnate\\"), teaching philosophy in one college classroom after another for sixty-two consecutive academic years. On 10 September 2012 Findlay was voted the 8th \\"most underappreciated philosopher active in the U.S. from roughly 1900 through mid-century\\" in a poll conducted among readers of Leiter Reports: A Philosophy Blog, finishing behind George Santayana, Alfred North Whitehead, and Clarence Irving Lewis. Findlay's autobiographical essay, 'Confessions of Theory and Life', is printed in Transcendence and the Sacred, ed. by A. M. Olson & L. S. Rouner, Notre Dame & London: University of Notre Dame Press, 1981, pp. 176‚Äì92. Work =Rational mysticism= At a time when scientific materialism, positivism, linguistic analysis, and ordinary language philosophy were the core academic ideas, Findlay championed phenomenology, revived Hegelianism, and wrote works that were inspired by Theosophy,\\"[My Gifford Lectures] ... represent my attempt to cull an eternal, necessary theosophy from the defective theosophic teaching of my adolescence\\" (Studies in the Philosophy of J. N. Findlay, p. 45). Findlay's Gifford Lectures also may well constitute the most comprehensive defense of the doctrine of the transmigration of the soul (reincarnation) in 20th-century academic philosophy. Buddhism, Plotinus, and Idealism. In his books published in the 1960s, including two series of Gifford Lectures, Findlay developed rational mysticism. According to this mystical system, \\"the philosophical perplexities, e.g., concerning universals and particulars, mind and body, knowledge and its objects, the knowledge of other minds,\\". as well as those of free will and determinism, causality and teleology, morality and justice, and the existence of temporal objects, are human experiences of deep antinomies and absurdities about the world. Findlay's conclusion is that these necessitate the postulation of higher spheres, or \\"latitudes\\", where objects' individuality, categorical distinctiveness and material constraints are diminishing, lesser in each latitude than in the one below it. On the highest spheres, existence is evaluative and meaningful more than anything else, and Findlay identifies it with the idea of The Absolute. In 2012 Findlay's major work on Plato along with both collections of his \\"cave lectures\\" returned into print courtesy of the Routledge Revivals series ; and as of 2019 both volumes of Findlay's published journal articles along with his major works on Hegel, Wittgenstein, and value theory remain in print thanks to the Routledge Library Editions series . =Husserl= Findlay translated into English Husserl's Logische Untersuchungen (Logical Investigations ), which he regarded as the author's best work, representing a developmental stage when the idea of phenomenological bracketing was not yet taken as the basis of a philosophical system, covering in fact for loose subjectivism. To Findlay, the work was also one of the peaks of philosophy generally, suggesting superior alternatives both for overly minimalistic or naturalistic efforts in ontology and for Ordinary Language treatments of consciousness and thought. Findlay also contributed final editing and wrote addenda to translations of Hegel's Logic and Phenomenology of Spirit. And in 2013 Oxford University Press added Findlay's Kant book to the list of works it now reprints on demand . =Wittgenstein= Findlay was first a follower, and then an outspoken critic , of Ludwig Wittgenstein. He denounced his three theories of meaning, arguing against the idea of Use, prominent in Wittgenstein's later period and in his followers, that it is insufficient for an analysis of meaning without such notions as connotation and denotation, implication, syntax and most originally, pre-existent meanings, in the mind or the external world, that determine linguistic ones, such as Husserl has evoked. Findlay credits Wittgenstein with great formal, aesthetic and literary appeal, and of directing well-deserved attention to Semantics and its difficulties.

Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (also called FDLP, FDSLP, and Direct Loan Program) provides \\"low-interest loans for students and parents to help pay for the cost of a student's education after high school. The lender is the U.S. Department of Education ... rather than a bank or other financial institution.\\" It is the largest single source of federal financial aid for students and their parents pursuing post-secondary education and for many it is the first financial obligation they incur, leaving them with debt can be paid over a period that can be a decade or more as the average student takes 19.4 years. Following the passage of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the Federal Direct Loan Program is the sole government-backed loan program in the United States. Guaranteed loans‚Äîloans originated and funded by private lenders but guaranteed by the government‚Äîwere eliminated because of a perception that they benefited private student loan companies at the expense of taxpayers, but did not help reduce costs for students. The Federal Direct Loan Program has accumulated a very large outstanding loan portfolio of about $1.5 trillion and this number will continue to rise along with the percentage of defaults. A common concern associated with the program is the effect on the economy and repercussions for students that must repay these loans. History President George H. W. Bush authorized a pilot version of the Direct Loan program, by signing into law the 1992 Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Higher Education Act was passed to give greater college access to women and minorities. President Bill Clinton set a phase-in of direct lending, by signing into law the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993,Federal Education Budget Project although in 1994 the 104th Congress passed legislation to prevent the switch to 100% direct lending. Funding for new direct loans in the Federal Direct Student Loan Program increased from $12.6 billion in 2005 to $17.8 billion in 2008.Congressional Budget Office. Costs and Policy Options for Federal Student Loan Programs. https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/111th- congress-2009-2010/reports/03-25-studentloans.pdf President Obama organized all new loans under the Direct Loan program by July 2010. The switch to 100% Direct Lending effective July 1, 2010 was enacted by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. In 1940, only about 500,000 Americans attended college, but by 1970 that number was near 7.5 million and now in 2018 that number is estimated to be around 14 million. Since 1970, family incomes for 80% of Americans have failed to make inflation-adjusted gains. With college costs skyrocketing, the lack of wage increases forced most students to rely on student aid and student loans. In comparison, other countries have also experimented with government-sponsored loan programs. New Zealand, for instance, now offers 0% interest loans to students who live in New Zealand for 183 or more consecutive days (retroactive for all former students who had government loans),Inland Revenue. \\"Interest-free student loans - eligibility and what you need to do (About student loans).\\" who can repay their loans based on their income after they graduate.Inland Revenue. \\"Student loan repayment threshold (Making repayments).\\" This program was a Labour Party promise in the 2005 general election. Types of Loans There are four types of direct loans: * _Direct PLUS Loan_ : The direct PLUS loan is a federal loan that graduate or professional students and parents of undergraduate students can use to pay for their education. These loans can be used to help pay for education expenses not covered by financial aid. The Direct PLUS loan is not based on financial need, but credit is necessary. Eligibility is determined by the school and once the student has signed, he or she has entered into a legally binding agreement to repay all the loans. In a parent PLUS loan, the parent can authorize the school to use the loan for other educationally related charges after tuition and room and board. * _Direct Subsidized_ : A direct subsidized federal loan is for eligible students to cover costs at a four year institution, community college, or vocational school. Only students with demonstrated financial need are eligible and the amount is determined by the school. The US Department of Education pays the interest on the loan while the student is in school and he or she gets a grace period of six months after graduating. * _Direct Unsubsidized_ : Unlike Subsidized loans, these federal loans do not require students to demonstrate financial need and they are responsible for paying interest on the loan during all periods. If the student chooses not to pay the interest while in school, the interest will accumulate and be added to the principal. * _Direct Consolidation_ : These loans enable the student to consolidate multiple federal loans into one loan at no added cost. If a student has multiple loans, he or she can consolidate multiple monthly payments into one monthly payment at the average rate of the loans being consolidated. One disadvantage is that students cannot lower their interest rates. The interest rate is equal to a weighted average of the interest rates on their current federal student loans, rounded up to the nearest 1/8%. Current program size Currently, there are 1.2 trillion dollars in principal and interest on direct loans remained outstanding (borrowed by 34.5 million individuals). At the end of 2019, there were 657 billion in outstanding Direct Loan program loans for 32.1 million recipients.The Federal Student Aid (FSA), which is responsible for managing the outstanding loan portfolio, reported that at the end of 2009 there were 1,510.3 billion dollars of loans outstanding which is spread out over 42.9 million unduplicated recipients. In 10 years, the loan program experienced 230% growth in the loan portfolio and 130% growth in the loan recipients. Student loan debt in 2019 is the highest it has ever been. According to the latest loan debt statistics, student loan debt has become the second highest consumer debt category behind mortgage debt. The government combats this large outstanding balance with student loan forgiveness which come in several forms, the two most popular being Public Service Loan Forgiveness and Teacher Student Loan Forgiveness. Looking at Public Service Loan Forgiveness, there are 890,516 borrowers and 41,221 submitted applications, only 423 of these applications were approved. This translated into about $12.3 million of forgiven loans, leaving the rest of the hundreds of millions left to be paid. Unsurprisingly, the states with the largest populations have the largest proportions of debt. California, Florida, Texas, and New York represent more than 20% of all student debt ($340 million). Loan portfolio balances managed by the FSA for the Federal Family Education Loan Program are slowly and steadily shrinking as new loans offered to students by the U.S. Department of Education originate under the FDSL program. Most of the growth in FDSL loan portfolio balances can be attributed to new loan originations, while being the sole government program for student loans. Another contributor to the rapid escalation in loan balances is due to the cost of higher education increasing rapidly, faster than inflation. Students are spending and borrowing more to finance their higher-priced, higher education.  Default  Graphic 1: Total number of dollars (in billions) entering default, 2009-2018, data source: CRS Graphic 2: This graph portrays the changes in the interest rate for direct subsidized loans, 2004-2019 Default and delinquency are increasingly common and are a large risk the government bears when giving out low-interest rate loans. Delinquency is the first step which is missing a payment. It will result in the late payments or missing payments being reported to the credit bureaus and credit scores being adjusted accordingly. Default is one step further and the consequences are much more severe. A borrower is considered to have defaulted when he or she fails to make required payments for 270 days. When a loan is in default, the principal and interest are due in full a well as collection costs. The current default rate for the 1.56 trillion total outstanding dollars of debt among 44.7 million borrowers is 11.4%. According to estimates made in 2018 from the Department of Education reports, 40% of borrowers are expected to default on their loans by 2023. Over the average length of repayment which is 19 years, 250,000 students default on their loans each quarter while 1.5 trillion outstanding dollars are still supposed to be paid. Defaulting can disqualify a student for any additional Title IV federal student aid in the future. In many instances, the payment of federal student loans will cover any interest accruing between payments. However, if interest accrues between payments of the loan then the lender can capitalize the accrued interest by increasing the principal balance of the loan. The growing principal balance results in higher interest payments and a greater overall cost of the loan. Pew Charitable Trusts research highlights the increasing number of student loan borrowers who encounter repayment problems or interruptions. As of October 2018, the number of student loan borrowers in default in the United States was more than 8 million, which equates to about 1 in 5 federal student loan borrowers. The numbers may even be understated because of the large number of students still in school or within the grace period. As previously mentioned, default consequences are severe and can include damaged credit, ineligibility for future student loans, garnishment of wages, high collection fees, loss of federal income tax refunds or Social Security and prohibition from other federal assistance programs. Additionally, the increasing number of defaults has an impact on the taxpayer. The federal government spent more than $600 million in 2016 and projects costs to exceed more than $1 billion in the near future. For comparison, a study published in 1997 that draws back from the 1980s established that one-fifth of undergraduates borrow in the Stafford Loan previously known as the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. Freshmen could only borrow $2625, $3500 for sophomores, and $5500 for each year thereafter without collateral or credit. Now Freshmen can borrow $5500, Sophomores $6500, and juniors $7500. The study predicted that students failing to repay those loans would be a huge cost to the government, Associated problems and proposed solutions Some believe that the growth of student loan debt is reaching problematic levels. Economists point to a drag on the economy as a whole because of high levels of student debt. One way that has been suggested to help students with loan repayment is to lower interest on balances. U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal urged, \\"We must reduce the student loan interest rate back to 3.4 percent immediately, and then even lower, and develop ways for past students to reduce and erase the $1 trillion in existing debt. The failure of Congress to act now threatens our all too slow and fragile economic recovery and job creation.\\" Another way to deal with debt to income levels is to require higher learning accountability. \\"Only recently have government regulators demanded accountability for the educational benefits universities produce and the efficiency with which they produce them: What does college cost? How many students are admitted? How many graduate? How long does it take them to graduate? How many get good jobs? At the same time, accrediting bodies have changed their measurement emphasis from inputs and activities to outcomes...Students want not just high-paying jobs, but an acceptable ratio of starting salary to student debt. Governments likewise care not just about the number of graduates but the total cost of producing each graduate.‚Äù These questions warrant consideration in the future conversations about the Federal Student Loan Program. Another solution to the problem was discussed in the 2020 Presidential Election. Candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren both offered programs for loan forgiveness. Senator Bernie Sanders proposed canceling all $1.6 trillion of outstanding student loan debt in the United States while Senator Elizabeth Warren proposed canceling $640 billion of the debt. Both have goals to make public university tuition free, reducing the need for borrowing. According to the Department of Education, 45% of student loans are used to attend public colleges and universities. The department also reports that 40% of loans are taken out to attend graduate or professional school, meaning most loans are taken out for post-graduate education or private schools. So even if all debt is wiped out, the rate at which it grows would remain the same. These plans would also have unintended consequences, demonstrating that future debt could be forgiven as well. The Stafford Student Loan Program is a subsidized loan that has been criticized for its lack of reform. Its structure has not changed much since its creation in 1965. The problems are that it is too costly, a wasteful subsidy for middle-income students, acts as disincentive for students to save, and providing an incentive for colleges to raise tuition. The issue that it is a disincentive for students to save is widely cited. The government is issuing cheap loans that are widely available and more than ever, students are attending expensive schools and are less worried about their ability to repay the debt. Students are not incentivized to attend schools with lower tuition. This is exacerbated by the fact that federal financial aids provides less support for students going to community college. They are low cost institutions to begin with but are disadvantaged by both state and federal aid. Data was collected by the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) and the results of the study revealed that the percentage of lower- income students receiving federal aid awards significantly favored private proprietary and non-profit 2-year students and institutions. The average federal grant allocation to students attending public community colleges was 49% lower than federal awards granted to private baccalaureate institution students. Also, only one in three public community college students from the lowest income group received federal grant aid while three out of every four students at private baccalaureate institutions received this aid. It is apparent that at the individual level student loan debt affects students when it comes to their credit worthiness and future financial stability. In aggregate, the large portfolio of loans can hamper economic growth.

Fraser was the last survivor of the St. Laurent-class destroyer, which were the first Canadian designed and built warships. Design and description Two St. Laurent-class destroyers in their original configuration. Fraser is on the left The need for the St. Laurent class came about in 1949 when Canada joined NATO and the Cold War was in its infancy. The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) was assigned responsibility for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and controlling sea space in the western North Atlantic. The St Laurent class were built to an operational requirement much like that which produced the British Type 12, and were powered by the same machinery plant. The rounded deck-edge forward was adopted to prevent ice forming. The vessels were designed to operate in harsh Canadian conditions. They were built to counter nuclear, biological and chemical attack conditions, which led to a design with a rounded hull, a continuous main deck, and the addition of a pre-wetting system to wash away contaminants. The living spaces on the ship were part of a \\"citadel\\" which could be sealed off from contamination for the crew safety. The ships were sometimes referred to as \\"Cadillacs\\" for their relatively luxurious crew compartments; these were also the first Canadian warships to have a bunk for every crew member since previous warship designs had used hammocks. As built, the ships were long overall with a beam of and a draught of . The destroyer escorts displaced standard and at deep load.Conway's says 2,000 tons standard displacement, 2,600 deep load. The destroyer escorts had a crew of 12 officers and 237 enlisted. =Armament= The St. Laurent class was fitted with twin /L50 calibre guns in two mounts for engaging both surface and air targets. The ships were also fitted with two single-mounted guns. The class's anti- submarine armament consisted of a pair of triple-barreled Mk. NC 10 Limbo ASW mortars in a stern well. The stern well had a roller top to close it off from following seas. As with the British Type 12 design, the provision for long- range homing torpedoes (in this case BIDDER [Mk 20E] or the US Mark 35 were included. However, they were never fitted. =Machinery= The vessels of the St. Laurent class had two Babcock & Wilcox water tube boilers installed. The steam produced by these boilers was directed at two geared steam turbines which powered two shafts, providing to drive the ship at a maximum speed of . The ships had an endurance of at . =DDH conversion= Following successful trials aboard the frigate and sister ship , plans to convert the St. Laurent class took shape. The development of the beartrap, installed in during her 1962‚Äì63 conversion, finalised the concept. By keeping the aircraft secure, the beartrap eliminated the need for deck handling from landing to the hangar, or from hangar to takeoff. In the conversion to a helicopter-carrying vessel, Fraser was gutted except for machinery and some forward spaces. The hull was strengthened, fuelling facilities for the helicopter and activated fin stabilizers installed. The fin stabilizers were to reduce roll in rough weather during helicopter operations. All seven St Laurents were fitted with helicopter platforms and SQS 504 Variable Depth Sonar (VDS). The single funnel was altered to twin stepped funnels to permit the forward extension of the helicopter hangar. To make room for the helicopter deck, the aft 3-inch mount and one of the Limbos were removed. The two 40 mm guns were also removed. Following the conversion, the displacement remained the same at standard load but at full load, it increased to . =DELEX program= In the late 1970s, under the Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX) program was commissioned to upgrade ten of the St. Laurent-class ships with new electronics, machinery, and hull upgrades and repairs. However, only enough was done to keep the ships in service into the late 1980s. For the St. Laurents, this meant hull and machinery repairs only. Service history Frasers keel was laid down on 11 December 1951 at Burrard Dry Dock in North Vancouver, British Columbia. The ship was launched on 19 February 1953 and commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 28 June 1957, initially carrying the hull number DDE 233 as a destroyer escort. Following her commissioning, the destroyer escort joined the Second Canadian Escort Squadron at Esquimalt, British Columbia. While transiting to Pearl Harbor in November 1960, the destroyer escort aided the crippled yacht Red Witch. Fraser remained with the vessel until the arrival of the United States Coast Guard. On 6 February 1965, Fraser underwent the first of two shock trials off the coast of Hawaii. The destroyer escort returned in April to undergo the second one, passing both of them. Fraser began conversion to a destroyer helicopter escort on 2 July 1965 at Canadian Vickers in Montreal, Quebec, the last of her class to undergo the transformation. The refit finished, the ship was officially reclassed with hull number DDH 233 on 22 October 1966. The first helicopter landing aboard Fraser, made by a CH-124 Sea King, was performed on 15 June 1967. In October 1967, Fraser demonstrated the Canadian \\"beartrap\\" helicopter haul-down system during a visit to Washington, DC. In 1969, the ship represented Canada during the Spithead Review. In May 1973, the ship was placed in reserve, but was reactivated on 11 March 1974. The ship was sent to Davie Shipbuilding in Quebec and returned to operational service in Fall 1974. In 1976, Fraser was assigned to security duties associated with the 1976 Summer Olympics held in Montreal. On 28 November 1980, Fraser rescued twelve British fisherman from the fishing vessel St Irene off the coast of the Netherlands. While on deployment in December with STANAVFORLANT, the NATO fleet in the Atlantic, Fraser was held at Portsmouth for use in the Skagerrak if NATO had needed to respond to a Soviet incursion into Poland. In 1981, Fraser returned to Canadian Vickers in Montreal on 19 October 1981 to undergo the DELEX refit. The ship completed this refit on 28 May 1982. Following the refit, Fraser became a test ship. In 1986, the vessel was the testbed for the Experimental Towed Array Sonar System. In 1987, Fraser was the first Canadian ship to carry and was the first to test the NIXIE torpedo decoy system. The warship followed that with testing the TACAN antenna, for operating jointly with aircraft in combat areas. In 1988, the ship became the first to operate a HELTAS Sea King, a Sea King helicopter equipped with passive array sonar. On 18 October 1993, Fraser was among the Canadian vessels deployed off the coast of Haiti to enforce United Nations sanctions. The destroyer escort returned to Canada in December before sailing to Haitian waters again in January 1994. On 10 January, the ship suffered a minor boiler room fire. Fraser continued to her patrol area until being relieved by on 25 March. In July 1994, Fraser intercepted and seized the American fishing vessels Warrior and Alpha Omega II on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland after they were caught illegally fishing. On 13‚Äì14 September, while performing a fisheries patrol, the ship aided the sailing vessel Maja Romm, which had broken down. The destroyer was decommissioned from active service in the Canadian Forces on 5 October 1994 and placed in category C reserve. The ship was used as a floating classroom at Halifax, replacing Assiniboine. Fate =Purchase by Artificial Reef Society of Nova Scotia= Fraser was declared surplus in the late 1990s by the Canadian Forces and given to the Artificial Reef Society of Nova Scotia (ARSNS) in 1998. ARSNS had never considered sinking Fraser as an artificial reef diving attraction and she was towed to Bridgewater where she was stored for possible use as a museum ship. ARSNS had purchased the government wharf in Bridgewater on the east bank of the Lahave River, which became Frasers home for close to 12 years. The society made the vessel available to for possible conversion to a museum ship, should funding be secured. The ship never opened as a museum, although guided tours were offered by appointment in 2003 and 2004. During that period, some groups such as the Sea Cadets, LaHave River Tourism Association, Atlantic Lighthouse Council, Bridgewater Fire Department, and Katimavik used the ship for events and the wardroom hosted meetings with visiting politicians. The ship was also used for some years as the site for the annual Canada Day fireworks display in Bridgewater. HMCS Fraser at Bridgewater, 1999. In 1997, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada recognised the St. Laurent Class as being historically significant to Canadians and in 2000 installed a bronze plaque aboard HMCS Fraser which reads: The Government of Nova Scotia and the Town of Bridgewater were taken to court by the ARSNS over Fraser being assessed for commercial property taxes. ARSNS fought this litigation in the Supreme Court of Canada and then Appeals Court, arguing that vessels could not be assessed as commercial property. Although the society was legally successful in its argument, the court challenge caused significant financial hardship and resulted in the vessel's exterior paint deteriorating considerably in the absence of funding over this 12-year period. The vessel became an irritant to local residents whose waterfront properties faced the former warship and the \\"deplorable state\\" of the ship brought complaints from residents, municipal politicians, and naval veterans. The condition of Fraser became a local issue in the Nova Scotia's 2009 provincial election when signs appeared around Bridgewater criticising ARSNS chair Rick Welsford who was running as a Liberal candidate for the neglect of the ship. =Purchase by Government of Canada= After a year of negotiations and a proposal made to the Department of National Defence (DND) by the Artificial Reef Society of Nova Scotia, Minister of National Defence Peter MacKay announced in a press release on 30 January 2009 that DND had reached an agreement with the ARSNS to re-purchase the ship and transfer ownership of the warship back to the federal government. The release stated that \\"\\"DND may sink her to create an artificial reef, or scrap her, or move her to preserve her for heritage purposes.\\" At the time, DND indicated that it would purchase the vessel from ARSNS by 1 June 2009. Rick Welsford, chairman of the Society, as well as being the ship's strongest supporter and a constant target of criticism relating to the vessel's appearance, stated in February 2009 that the ship could still be restored for less than the cost of scrapping. On the morning of 21 July 2009, two MARCOM tugboats from CFB Halifax entered the Lahave River. While a Canadian Forces officer exchanged a cheque in the amount of $1.00 from the Government of Canada to the Artificial Reef Society of Nova Scotia, receiving a ceremonial key to the vessel, the two tugboats took Fraser in tow and returned her to Halifax Harbour in approximately 12 hours. Fraser was secured in the Bedford Basin pending further discussions over her fate; she was subsequently moved to the Shearwater Jetty. =Scrapping= On 27 August 2010, DND announced that Fraser would be sold to the Marine Recycling Corporation and towed to MRC's facility in Port Colborne, Ontario for scrapping; historic artefacts had been removed from the ship by DND and placed at the Maritime Command Museum at CFB Halifax. Later that day, ARSNS filed a lawsuit against DND in the Federal Court of Canada citing breach of contract. A clause in the December 2008 agreement between DND and ARSNS had stated that should DND decide to scrap the ship, the society would receive \\"first consideration\\" to present a proposal to turn it into an artificial reef and that DND must find the proposal acceptable. ARSNS stated that its claim exceeded $50,000 not including interest and court costs. As a result of the lawsuit, the Federal Court of Canada ordered that the former HMCS Fraser be arrested at its berth at Jetty Lima at HMC Dockyard Annex in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. DND was given 30 days to file its defence.

The purpose of the loan is used by the lender to make decisions on the risk and may even impact the interest rate that is offered. For example, if an applicant is refinancing a mortgage after having taken some cash out, the lender might consider that an increase in risk and increase the interest rate that is offered or add additional conditions. Loan purpose is important to the process of obtaining mortgages or business loans that are connected with specific types of business activities. Pertaining to mortgages and their risk based pricing factors, the loan purpose factor is sub-categorized by purchase, rate and term refinance and cash-out refinance. Lenders assess that a purchase loan contains the least amount of risk and thus 'price' purchase loans most favorably (i.e. no interest rate increase or a risk-based pricing improvement in the order of .25%). Rate and term refinances are priced similar to purchase loans, with no interest rate increase. Cash received by the borrower at closing may not exceed $2000 to maintain rate and term status. The purpose is, as the name implies, to reduce the interest rate, payment, and/or overall term of the mortgage. Cash-out refinances are deemed to have a higher risk factor than either rate & term refinances or purchases due to the increase in loan amount relative to the value of the property. Risk-based pricing typically mandates a .25% to .5% increase in interest rate if a borrower needs to draw equity out of the subject property.

In this action on 18 November 1962, 114 Indian soldiers out of a total of 120 were killed. A memorial in Rewari, where most of the Ahir soldiers came from, mentions that 1,300 Chinese soldiers were killed in the battle.

Dating from the 13th to the 7th centuries BC., there was thought to be over 5,000 tombs, although the most recent estimate suggests a figure of just under 4,000. They extend around the flanks of a large promontory located at the junction of the Anapo river with its tributary, the Calcinara, about northwest of Syracuse. Together with the city of Syracuse, Pantalica was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005. Geography Pantalica is located on a limestone promontory surrounded by a deep gorge formed by the Anapo and Calcinara rivers between the towns of Ferla and Sortino in south-eastern Sicily. In addition to its archaeological interest it is an important nature reserve (Riserva Naturale Orientata Pantalica), with a variety of local flora and fauna and natural caves (notably the Grotta dei Pipistrelli (Bat Cave)). Various pathways facilitate visitor access, including a disused railway track (dismantled in 1956) along the Anapo valley bottom. The promontory can be accessed directly by car from Ferla, or by walking down the old mule track from the parking place on the road from Sortino and crossing over the Calcinara stream. Square rock-cut tombs in Pantalica Tomb entrance in Pantalica History In the 13th century BC, some Sicilian coastal settlements were abandoned, possibly due to the arrival of the Sicels on the island and the onset of more unsettled conditions. New large sites, like Pantalica, appeared in the hilly coastal hinterlands, probably chosen for defensive reasons. Pantalica evidently flourished for about 600 years, from about 1250 to 650 BC. The current name of the site probably dates from the Early Middle Ages or Arab period. The ancient name of the site is uncertain, but is associated by some archeologists with Hybla, after a Sicel king named Hyblon, who is mentioned by Thucydides in connection with the foundation of the early Greek colony at Megara Hyblaea in the year 728 BC. For several centuries before Greek colonization, Pantalica was undoubtedly one of the main sites of eastern Sicily, dominating the surrounding territory, including subsidiary settlements. By about 650 BC, however, it seems to have been a victim of the expansion of the city of Syracuse, which established an outpost at Akrai (near Palazzolo Acreide) at this time. Nevertheless, it was still occupied during classical antiquity, since finds of the 4th and 3rd centuries BC (Hellenistic period) are attested, as well as during the late antique or Byzantine periods. After the 12th century it was probably largely deserted, and overshadowed by Sortino. The remains visible today consist mainly of numerous prehistoric burial chambers cut into the limestone rock, sometimes provided with a porch or short entrance corridor in front of the burial chamber, originally sealed with stones or a slab. There are also some larger rock-cut houses of uncertain date, often said to be Byzantine, but possibly of earlier origin. The so-called anaktoron, or princely palace, located near the top of the hill, is also controversial. Thought by some archeologists originally to have been a Late Bronze Age building, inspired by palatial buildings of the Greek (Mycenaean) Bronze Age, it was more certainly occupied in the Byzantine period. The remains of a large ditch, cut into the limestone, are clearly visible at Filiporto on the western side of the promontory, nearest to Ferla. This probably dates to the 4th century BC, and represents a defensive work of Greek military design, possibly in line with a policy of Dionysius of Syracuse, designed to secure allied sites in the hinterland. There are also three small medieval rock-cut chapels known respectively as the Grotta del Crocifisso (near the North cemetery), the Grotta di San Nicolicchio (on the southern side), and the Grotta di San Micidario (at Filiporto), which preserve very faint traces of frescoes, and attest the presence of small monastic communities. The site was mainly excavated between 1895 and 1910 by the Italian archeologist, Paolo Orsi, although most of the tombs had already been looted long before his time. The finds excavated by Orsi are on display in the Archaeological Museum in Syracuse. They include characteristic red-burnished pottery vessels and metal objects, including weaponry (small knives and daggers) and items of dress, such as bronze fibulae (brooches) and rings, which were placed with the deceased in the tombs. Most of the tombs contained between one and seven individuals of all ages and both sexes. Many tombs were evidently re-opened periodically for more burials. The average human life span at this time was probably around 30 years of age. The size of the prehistoric population is hard to estimate from the available data, but might have been 1000 people or more. Main monuments Pantalica has five cemeteries spread over a large area: * The necropolis of Filiporto consists of almost 1000 tombs, located on the southwestern side of the promontory (accessed by road from Ferla). In the same area are the remains of a defensive rock-cut ditch of later date (probably 4th century BC) traversing the promontory at its narrowest point. * The North West necropolis is one of the earliest (12th and 11th century BC), and is traversed by the tarmac road from Ferla. * The Cavetta necropolis has tombs and rock-cut houses of the prehistoric and later periods, and can be seen from the road and designated viewing platforms. * The North necropolis is a spectacular cemetery of about 1000 tombs covering very steep slopes overlooking the Calcinara river, best seen from the track coming from Sortino and from viewing platforms near the path. Remains of large rock-cut dwellings are on the gentler slopes to the east. * The South necropolis extends along the Anapo river for over 1 kilometre and is easily seen from the trackway at the bottom of the valley (a path leads down to it from the anaktoron). The old railway station, restored, has information about local fauna and flora. The so-called Anaktoron (a Mycenaean princely palace) on the top of the hill is a multi-roomed building of large blocks, with various rectangular rooms, excavated in the 19th century by Paolo Orsi. Its origins are obscure (see above) but it was certainly used in the Byzantine period, as attested by roof tiles and pottery. Since no other prehistoric houses have been found on the hilltop, which is rather eroded, the location of the original prehistoric residential quarters remains uncertain. There may have been various clusters of habitation associated with each major burial zone. Bibliography * L. Bernabo Brea Sicily before the Greeks. (London: Thames and Hudson 1957). * R.

It existed 96 years from its opening during the Japanese colonial era, to its official closing on Sunday, 2 July 2006 after years of decline in resulting from two conflagrations in the 1990s and an unsuccessful project to revitalize the market in 2003. After numerous attempts at re-planning and reopening, the building at the site was eventually demolished in 2016 and a public plaza and park opened in 2017.  History  The original night market was a circular structure located on a roundabout between Nanjing West Road (Âçó‰∫¨Ë•øË∑Ø) and Chongqing North Road (ÈáçÊÖ∂ÂåóË∑Ø). It covered an area of 1,722 square meters and dated to the Japanese colonial era. =Beginnings= Remnants of the Japanese era reservoir at Chien-Cheng Circle. The circle started out as a fish pond at the intersections of the two roads which the Japanese Government at the planted with trees at the edges and turned into a park. Due to its location, the park attracted a wide variety of cart-based food vendors turning it into the most popular night market in northern Taiwan during the Japanese rule, with the vendors operating well beyond 4am. A bomb shelter was also constructed there during World War II and the pond used as a reservoir for water to put out fires from air raids. Following the war, the reservoir was drained and vendors began setting up permanently at the park, growing into and organizing the space among themselves organically, eventually converting all the park space into restaurants. The 1960s and 1970s were the heyday of the night market with booths numbering close to 200 and serving Taiwanese snacks and delicacies such as glutinous rice dumplings, oyster omelettes, fish ball noodles, and unfried spring rolls. = Reconstruction = Two fires in 1993 and 1999 contributed to the market's decline, and in March 2001 Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou ordered the demolition of Chien-Cheng Circle. He proposed its reconstruction as part of several projects to revitalize Taipei's older districts. At 10 AM on 29 March 2001, the Chien-Cheng Circle was demolished to make way for its new construction located five meters further south of the original site. The new two-storey cylindrical glass building was designed by Taiwan-based architect C. Y. Lee and cost the Taipei city government NT$160 million in construction fees. An additional NT$50 million in compensation was paid to vendors of the former building. The roundabout was transformed into a crossroad and the surrounding trees were moved to an elementary school in the Xinyi district. During the reconstruction, the engineering team unearthed an old reservoir built by Japanese soldiers during World War II at the center of the circle. The city government decided to make the reservoir the 105th historic spot in Taipei. The glass structure at the Chien-Cheng Circle from 2001 to 2016 The new Chien-Cheng Circle was opened in the evening of 4 October 2003, housing 20 food booths and a performing arts center at the top of the building. To promote the opening, the city government gave away 700 food- tasting coupons worth NT$100 each and organized a tour led by Chuang Yung-ming (ËéäÊ∞∏Êòé), vice-chairman of the municipal research department and professor at the Taipei Medical University. Although the new building was intended to revitalize the market, food vendors had complained that the modern building did not reflect the market's history and lacked a traditional, cultural feeling. They also said that a lack of promotion and assistance from the city government had hurt business. = Closing = Taipei City Councilwoman Chen Yu-mei held a press conference on Thursday (29 June 2006) to announce the closure and called residents to visit the facility before the official closing on Sunday. The Chien-Cheng Circle had been in decline since its reopening in 2003 and prior to its closing all the stalls on the second floor and five stalls on the first floor had closed with only six stalls on the first floor still in operation. The Taipei City Markets Administration Office in a written statement on 1 July 2006 stated that the renovation project had failed to regain its competitiveness due to the building's design and also problems with vendors. It has given each vendor a sum of NT$800,000 in relocation subsidies. = Planned reopening = In 2008, the Taipei City Government announced that the Chien-Cheng Circle is undergoing a replanning. It was scheduled to reopen in June 2009. However, as of summer 2010 the structure remains derelict and some have postulated the Circle may not return to its former commercial prosperity. In May 2011, the reopening of the Circle was once again postponed due to disputes on lease. Older tenants of the Taipei Circle have blamed the government of the then mayor Ma Ying-jeou for causing the demise of business at the circle. = Public plaza = In 2016, the glass building at the Chien- Cheng Circle was slated for demolition with plans to begin in November 26, 2016 and completed in March 2017. The public plaza, with green space and fountain was completed in July 2017.

Audio company Pioneer used Gemballa vehicles in their advertisements and brochures for several years. The prices for these vehicles were often mentioned as being incredibly expensive for the time period at US $250K-$375K+. Robert Van Winkle, also known as Vanilla Ice, was a famous owner of Gemballa Porsches. In the 1990s Gemballa's body kits were more subtle compared to the 80s.

It is located about 4 miles north of the city of Reading. As of the 2010 census, the population was 1,424 residents.https://www.census.gov/# Originally a streetcar suburb of Reading, South Temple retains the look of a 1920s residential community, with decent- sized properties, mature trees, sidewalks, and much variation in housing styles. The houses are well-kept and the gardens meticulously groomed. The community was originally serviced by a street-running trolley on Kutztown Road and an interurban trolley stop (the pavilion at 11th & Park is still standing). Boundaries The traditionally-accepted boundaries of South Temple are the 5th Street Highway (U.S. Route 222 Business) on the west, Sharp Ave. on the south, 11th Ave on the east, and Darby Ave. on the north. South Temple lies entirely within the 19560 ZIP code and is served by the \\"Temple\\" post office. Residents use \\"Temple\\" as their mailing address. The community is served by the Muhlenberg School District. History South Temple was started by a local developer by the name of Sharp, as a \\"Restricted Residential Community\\" with distinctive custom-built homes targeted at the emerging upper- middle class. The houses that Sharp built are known for their wonderful curb appeal and architectural character. One of his houses along 7th Avenue even won a design award. Most of the houses are modest in size and have a Craftsman Bungalow style to them, which is distinctive of the 1920s. Some houses are more notable, including five U-shaped duplex houses that are almost Mediterranean in style. During World War II, development was halted (a nationwide reality) and Sharp moved on to other projects, leaving many lots still open for development, particularly on the southern end of the town. In the 1950s, a builder by the name of Sheidy finished developing the area. Sheidy's homes are characterized as modest red-brick Cape Cods (see Cape Cod (house). Ironically, it was Sheidy (not Sharp) that built the homes along Sharp Avenue. Today South Temple is still regarded as a very desirable and affordable area of Muhlenberg Township. South Temple is home to two churches, both on North Temple Blvd: the Faith Evangelical Congregationalist Church, and Epiphany Lutheran Church. There is a municipal swimming pool at 4th & Darby. Originally a public pool, built by William A. Sharp and named the \\"South Temple Pool,\\" it became the members-only Muhlenberg Swimming Association until its closing in 2014. A favorite summer hangout of many families in Muhlenberg Township, the pool came under new ownership and reopened as a public pool in the summer of 2018. The town is adjacent to the campus of the Muhlenberg School District, making it within easy walking distance for students. The local elementary school (now the Muhlenberg Elementary Center), was at one time much smaller and named the \\"South Temple Elementary\\".

Most of these were in Texas, but there were \\"Latin Settlements\\" in other states as well. These German intellectuals, so-called freethinkers and \\"Latinists\\" (German \\"Freidenker\\" and \\"Lateiner\\"), founded these communities in order to devote themselves to German literature, philosophy, science, classical music, and the Latin language. History =Texas= Ubi libertas, ibi patria inspired Carl Schurz's emigration to the United States in 1852. He was a Forty-Eighter and lived on a farm in Wisconsin for a time. As a consequence of their political struggle in the German states during the revolutions of 1848, many professors and students saw no other option but to emigrate to North America in order to avoid being arrested and prosecuted or to implement their political ideal of a \\"free German nation\\" in the fairly new state of Texas in the United States, which at the time was still a growing nation itself, or both: \\"Ubi libertas, ibi patria\\", Latin for \\"Where there is freedom, there is my homeland, my country\\". These refugees of the post-1848 era later came to be called \\"Forty- Eighters\\", in the tradition of earlier political refugees being called \\"Drei√üiger\\", which is German for \\"Thirtiers\\". From as early as 1832‚Äì1833 onwards, German intellectuals had been emigrating to North America. Since many of them went to North America organized in groups and with the support of emigration organizations such as the Gie√üener Auswanderungsgesellschaft (i.e. the Emigration Association of Gie√üen) or the \\"Mainzer Adelsverein\\" (i.e. the Association of Noblemen of Mainz), most of them settled down in self-contained communities, which were called \\"Latin Settlements.\\" These settlements, however, were not destined to survive for very long. The settlers were young adventurers or classically educated intellectuals, so-called \\"Latinists\\" or \\"Latin Ones\\" (German \\"Lateiner\\"), sometimes both, but by no means farmers. It is therefore no wonder that most of them went to bigger cities like San Antonio or Houston after the Civil War and the phenomenon of \\"Latin Settlements\\" gradually disappeared. One very telling description of the German settlers' ways of life at that time can be found online in an article of the Karl May foundation: Frederick Law Olmsted (1822‚Äì1903), a landscape architect and traveler in Texas, went to visit these Germans. He described them and their peculiarities. According to this article, they had valuable madonnas hanging on wooden walls, they drank coffee out of tin cups which they placed upon saucers of fine Dresdner porcelain, they played the piano and had trunks half filled with potatoes and half filled with books. After dinner, they would walk miles to meet in a log cabin to play music, to sing and to dance. On his journey to Texas in 1867, German-American author Friedrich Kapp met a former university friend of his, who explained his situation to him thus: \\"I am not happy in the true sense of the word, but neither I am unhappy, for I live freely and without coercion. I do not depend on anything except on my oxen and on the weather. There is nothing hindering me in expressing my revolutionary thoughts, except that there is no one listening to me.\\" The evening after this encounter, Kapp attended a meeting of the \\"Latin farmers.\\" The original purpose of the meetings had been to revive aspects of their former student life in Heidelberg, with its traditions, its songs and its drinking sessions, but the meeting ended in meaningless conversations: \\"Our life here would actually be quite bearable, if we only had a bowling lane.\\" =Illinois= A. B. Faust speculates that the appellative \\"Latin settlement\\" or \\"Latin farmers\\" was first used in connection with some German settlers of Belleville, Illinois, a large group of men who had been members of the \\"Burschenschaften,\\" the German student fraternities of a political cast, which had been made special objects of vengeance by the arbitrary governors of the reactionary period in Germany. Many friends of gymnasium or university days gathered together within the radius of a few miles. Such were George Engelmann, G. Bunsen, A. Berchelmann, Gustav K√∂rner, Theodor Hilgard, Theodor J. Krafft, Georg Neuhoff, Theodor and Adolf Engelmann, Karl Schreiber, Karl Friedrich, Ernst Decker, Wilhelm Weber, August Dilg. In 1849 there was added Friedrich Hecker, the leader of the insurrectionary forces in Baden during the revolution of 1848‚Äì49. At the university Hecker had fought a duel with Gustav K√∂rner; now these men extended to one another the hand of comradeship in their new home. The German immigrants of St. Clair County, Illinois, were interested and wide awake in politics. In Belleville, with over 15,000 inhabitants, it happened that for years no native-born American sat in the city council, and that all civic offices were filled by German immigrants. The county officers likewise were generally German immigrants, and their influence extended beyond the county limits. Eduard Retz was three times state treasurer, and Gustav K√∂rner was lieutenant-governor of Illinois in 1852. Under Julius Raith, a company of German immigrants was recruited for the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and during the Civil War all men capable of bearing arms fought for the cause of the Union.

It seems to use a symbiotic bacteria, Wolbachia pipientis, to weaken the tick's immune system. Description Ixodiphagus hookeri is a small wasp which has the typical morphology of a chalcid wasp and is blackish in colour, it measures 0.8-0.9mm in length and has a wing length span of 1.5mm. Its head is dorsally flattened with very large compound eyes. In females, the antennae have eleven segments and the antennae are club shaped; while in males they have ten segments and are thread-like. Biology Ixodiphagus hookeri has a short flight period in the summer in Europe. The female normally oviposits an egg into the body of an unfed nymph of Ixodes ricinus, but has been recorded ovipositing in the adults of Rhipicephalus sanguineus. The egg remains in diapause until the nymph engorges on vertebrate blood, at which point the egg becomes active. Some eggs are not successful, as the tick's immune system can encapsulate the egg, which results in the egg becoming melanised and dying. The bacteria Wolbachia is symbiotic with the wasp, and its presence in ticks is a possible indicator of infestation by tick wasps; Wolbachia may have a role in suppressing the host's immune system response to the wasp. The wasp larvae then exist as koinobiont parasitoids in the tick for 28 to 70 days before emerging. Ticks from the genera Ornithodoros, Amblyomma, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, Ixodes and Rhipicephalus are recorded as having been infected by I. hookeri. In Europe, Ixodes ricinus appears to be the preferred species and the marsh tick Dermacentor reticulatus is not used as a host. Because of the potential importance of I. hookeri as a natural enemy of ticks, it has been extensively researched. Different populations of I. hookeri around the world show different host preferences, complicating attempts to use this species as a biological control for ticks. A Female habitus.

In 1933, after 95 league games in which he scored 19 times for Torquay, Birkett moved to Arsenal for a fee of ¬£1,588, joining the Highbury side during one of the most impressive periods in their history. His First Division debut came on 2 September 1933 against Sheffield Wednesday, at Hillsborough,Daily Herald, 4 September 1933 and initially he established himself in the team, winning a League Championship medal in his first season at the club (1933-34). The following season he struggled to make the first team, after an initially bright start; he scored twice in Arsenal's 1934 Charity Shield win, 3-0 over Everton. However, his first-team opportunities became limited, thanks to the good form of Joe Hulme (whom Birkett had been signed to replace) and new signing Alf Kirchen. Birkett left for Middlesbrough in March 1935, after only 19 league appearances for Arsenal, in which he scored 7 goals.

He was the American author of numerous amateur radio and radio engineering texts. He is best known as the author of The W6SAI Antenna Handbook and fondly remembered for the 1959 Radio Handbook. Early life and education Bill grew up in New York, where he was an only child. His father took little interest in him and did not encourage him in activities that involved other children. Bill's mother encouraged his early interest in amateur radio. Bill taught himself morse code, and in his early teens held the amateur license of W2HCE, later changing to W6SAI. After earning his degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at Berkeley, he was hired to work on innovative radar systems for combat airplanes during WWII. After the war Orr was involved in engineering for the tube manufacturer Eitel- McCullogh (EIMAC). In addition, to working for EIMAC, Bill penned columns for the CQ Magazine and Ham Radio Magazine. His application notes for EIMAC tubes were favorite reading for amateur radio home builders worldwide. He was active in amateur radio throughout his life. A well known DXer and a DXCCHonor Roll member, he also conducted a few personal DXing epeditions to exotic locations like Monaco, St. Pierre, and Miquelon. Project \\"OSCAR\\" In early 1960, William Orr joined a group of radio amateurs (mostly electronic engineers) working to launch a private satellite.

The wire loops are almost invisible, suspended on the ends of the crossed supports. A quad antenna is a type of directional wire radio antenna used on the HF and VHF bands. Like a Yagi‚ÄìUda antenna (\\"Yagi\\"), a quad consists of a driven element and one or more parasitic elements; however in a quad, each of these elements is a loop antenna, which may be square, round, or some other shape. It is used by radio amateurs on the HF and VHF amateur bands.  History  The quad antenna is a development of several inventions. *In 1924, Moses Jacobson patented a loop antennas with rhombic shape.U.S. Patent 1747008, Antenna. http://www.google.com/patents/US1747008 *In 1938, George Brown et al. patented a loop antenna with rhombic shape and quarterwave sides.U.S. Patent 2207781, Ultra high frequency antenna. http://www.google.com/patents/US2207781 *In 1951 Clarence C. Moore, W9LZX, a Christian Missionary and engineer at HCJB (a shortwave missionary radio station high in the Andean Mountains) developed and patented U.S. Patent 2537191. http://www.google.com/patents/US2537191a two-turn loop antenna that he called a \\"quad\\". He developed this antenna to resolve issues caused by large coronal discharges while using a beam antenna in the thin air of higher altitudes. Moore describes his antenna as \\"a pulled- open folded dipole\\". While the main point of Moore's patent was the two turn single loop design which is not the antenna termed \\"quad\\" today, the patent does include a mention and illustration of a two element unidirectional \\"quad\\", and describes the time when the full wave loop concept was developed: :Moore's design eliminated interference from coronal discharge. \\"End effect\\", which is inherent with the Yagi, is absent in a quad because its elements have no ends. But other advantages appeared. The higher impedance mentioned in the quote above translates to lower current and thus lower loss on the transmission lines, and gain is higher than that of a Yagi. *In 1957 James Sherriff McCaig patented what we know as a \\"cubical\\" (two-element) multi-band quad antenna.GB Patent 850974 Improvements relating to composite aerials. http://www.puertobalsillas.com/radio/GB850974A.pdf GB850974A *In 1960 Rudolf Baumgartner patented the Swiss quadSwiss Patent 384644, Vollgespeiste Richtantenne f√ºr Kurz- und Ultrakurzwellen. http://www.puertobalsillas.com/radio/384644.pdf 384644Die Swiss-Quad-Antenne DL-QTC, 1963/10, page 454. *In 1969 Werner Boldt invented the DJ4VM quad.Ham Radio August 1969 page 41-46 *In 1971 Hans F. Ruckert invented the \\"Mono-Loop Tri-Band Cubical Quad\\" .CQ, Januari, 1971,page 41-43.  Advantages over a Yagi‚ÄìUda  Rigorous testing of the quad antenna show the following advantages over a Yagi‚ÄìUda antenna.Orr, William I, & Stuart D. Cowan. (1959). All About Cubical Quad Antennas. Radio Publications. , , LCCN 82080282. =Polarization= It is easy to change polarization from vertical to horizontal. =Multiband antenna= It is easier to design a multiband quad antenna than a multiband Yagi antenna. = Higher gain = The 2-element quad has almost the same gain as a 3-element Yagi: about 7.5 dB over a dipole. Likewise, a 3-element quad has more gain than a 3-element Yagi. However, adding quad elements produces diminishing returns. Quoting from William Orr, \\"Whereas parasitic beams having twenty or thirty parasitic directors are efficient, high gain antennas, it would seem ... that maximum practical number of parasitic loop elements for the quad array is limited to four or five.\\" (Orr, p. 48) = Radiation resistance = Radiation resistance is affected by antenna height above ground, element spacing, and environmental conditions. However, values will be higher than for a Yagi and more closely matched to a 50 Ohm coaxial feed. = Lower boom height = \\"A two-element, three-band quad, with elements mounted only 35 feet above ground, will give good performance in situations where a triband Yagi will not.\\"ARRL. The ARRL Antenna Book. 17th edition, Chapter 12, p. 12-1 to 12-13. = Shorter boom = William Orr's book shows a 10-15-20 meter, 2-element Quad with boom length of 6‚Ä≤10‚Ä≥. = Internally stackable = Interaction between antennas of a multiband quad are quite low, even when fed with a single feed line. (Orr, 1959, pg. 63) = Lower radiation angle = According to K0SRARRL. (Jan/Feb 2008). National Contest Journal. p. 5. the false claim that quads \\"open the band earlier\\", which suggests that they exhibit a lower angle of radiation than Yagis, has persisted for 50 years computer models agree. He posits that the vertical sides of each element actually radiate the low angle component. Disadvantages compared to other antennas = Bandwidth = If tuned for maximum gain, the bandwidth for a 3-element quad antenna is limited: Deviation from the design frequency will unbalance the near-resonance condition of the parasitic elements. However, lengthening the director elements, thereby sacrificing approximately 1 dB gain, allows for much broader bandwidth. = Maintenance = A quad is a 3-dimensional antenna so maintenance can be difficult. Even with a tilt-over tower, tall ladders or a bucket truck may be needed. There are devices that will allow the tilting of the tower to the ground to work on a cubical quad antenna, rotator, or tower. It works by letting the quad loops swivel out of the way. When the tower is in the operational position the elements are locked into position (the locking mechanism is powered by gravity).

Team- based learning methodology can be used in any classroom or training sessions at school or in the workplace.  How it works  Team-based learning consists of modules that can be taught in a three-step cycle: preparation, in-class readiness assurance testing, and application-focused exercise. It consists of five essential components, with an optional last stage called peer evaluation. = Individual pre-work = Students are expected to peruse a set of preparatory materials, which can take the form of readings, presentation slides, audio lectures or video lectures. They should be set at a suitable level for the students of the course. = Individual Readiness Assurance Test (IRAT) = In class, students complete an individual quiz called the IRAT, which consists of 5‚Äì20 multiple-choice questions based on the pre-work materials. = Team Readiness Assurance Test (TRAT) = After submitting the IRAT, students form teams and take the same test and submit answers‚Äîon a scratch card or using TBL-enabled software‚Äîas a team. Both IRAT and TRAT scores count toward the student's final grade. = Clarification session = After taking both the IRAT and TRAT, students will have the opportunity to raise points of clarification or question the quality of multiple-choice questions in the tests. Instructors can then address the questions and facilitate a discussion regarding the topics and concepts covered. = Application exercises = Finally, students work in teams to solve application problems that allow them to apply and expand on the knowledge they have just learned and tested. They must arrive at collective response to the application question and display their answer choice in an e-gallery walk in the classroom. Instructors then facilitate a discussion or debate among teams to consider the possible solutions to the application problem. = Peer evaluation = This last stage is an optional component of the team-based learning process. At the middle or end of the course, some faculty members do a peer evaluation for their teams.  Principles  The implementation of TBL is based on four underlying principles according to Michaelsen & Richards, 2005: # Groups should be properly formed and groups should have an evenly distributed number of talented people among them. According to Michaelsen, \\"most of the reported \\"problems\\" with learning groups (free-riders, member conflict, etc.) are the direct result of inappropriate group assignments\\". # Students are accountable for their pre-learning and team work. # Team assignments should promote learning and team development. # Students must receive frequent and immediate feedback.  Benefits  Team-Based Learning has been suggested to help students who seem uninterested in subject material, do not do their homework, and have difficulty understanding material. TBL can transform traditional content with application and problem solving skills, while developing interpersonal skills. Its implementation in education can also be important for developing skills and abilities that are useful for businesses, organizations, careers, and industries where many projects and tasks are performed by teams. Learning how to learn, work, interact, and collaborate in a team is essential for success in this kind of an environment.Howard Hills (2001) Team Based Learning Gower Publishing Company Many of the medical schools have adopted some version of TBL for several of the benefits listed above, and also for greater long-term knowledge retention. According to a study done by the Washington University School of Medicine, individuals who learned through an active team based learning curriculum had greater long-term knowledge retention compared to a traditional passive lecture curriculum. Evidently, faculty of professional schools are thus directing their focus towards developing application and integration of knowledge beyond the content-based curricula, rather than simple course objectives such as simply memorizing a concept. Michaelsen adds that \\"assignments that require groups to make decisions and enable them to report their decisions in a simple form, will usually generate high levels of group interaction\\" and are: * significant (correlated to important course objectives, meaningful to the future work that the course might prepare a student for), * the same for all teams in the course, * about making a decision ‚Äì providing a simple answer ‚Äì based on complex analysis of data or application of course principles, and * simultaneously reported to the whole class and evaluated then and there by the instructor. Controlled studies of initial implementations of team learning have shown increases in student engagement and mixed results for other outcomes. The World Economic Forum identified Top 10 skills required in its \\"The Future of Jobs and Skills\\" report, namely complex problem solving, critical thinking, creativity, people management, coordinating with others, emotional intelligence, judgement and decision making, service orientation, and negotiation, and cognitive flexibility. TBL is often compared to the traditional one-way lecture format that does not develop those skills in students. On the other hand, TBL can engage students and provide an environment of collaborative learning and discussion. More than 500 publications in the Education Resource Information Center (ERIC) provide evidence for the positive educational outcomes of TBL- use in the classroom. TBL is resource efficient. In digitally-enabled classroom settings, the use of TBL cuts the amount of paper used for the lesson. Instructors also do not need to prepare the materials in hardcopy and can easily make changes to the questions to be discussed in class, remotely or on the go. Since most of the learning happens in the form of discussions and feedback sessions in class, unnecessary paperwork is left out of the equation altogether. In addition, instructors can gather data on the performance of a class and automate student grading.  Prevalence  = Academic = Team- Based Learning has been gaining traction in academic institutions, especially in the field of medicine in the US. Out of all 144 medical schools there, at least 83% use TBL pedagogy. 44 of those institutions also have faculty or staff who are part of the Team-Based Learning Collaborative (TBLC), an international collaborative that focuses on connecting TBL practitioners, sharing TBL resources, and promoting best practices. Within the top 50 medical schools in the US, 92% use TBL pedagogy. = Training / coaching = Given its effectiveness in most teaching scenarios, team-based learning can also be used in institution-wide training programmes. History Team-based learning has in recent years been advanced by Duke Corporate Education and PricewaterhouseCoopers.Hospitals Show How to Accelerate Learning In 2005, Judy Rosenblum, then President of Duke Corporate Education, and Tom Evans, Chief Learning Officer of PricewaterhouseCoopers, began to explore the learning environment in teaching hospitals and its possible transferability to corporate environments.

It opened in 2011 as the first international \\"named branded development\\" of The Trump Organization. At 70 stories, it is the tallest building in Panama and the tallest building in Central America. Building The project was designed by Colombian architects Arias - Serna - Saravia S.A. It includes a five-star hotel of 369 hotel condominium units, 628 residential condominium units, 1500 parking spaces, 36 retail shops, 10 story office tower, a casino operated by Sun International,, daily ferry service to the Pearl Islands, yacht club and pier, wellness spa, gym, pool deck, meeting and event spaces, and a business center. The 13-story base is topped by a tower resembling the Burj Al Arab, a hotel in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; before its completion the developer asked for a preemptive injunction against lawsuits by Jumeirah Group over the similarity. The interior was designed by Hirsch Bedner Associates. Construction began in May 2007. When built, the tower was the tallest building in Latin America; it remains the tallest in Central America and still remains the largest mixed use building of its kind in Latin America. History Donald Trump arranged financing for the project from the investment bank Bear Stearns - a $230 million bond offering  for which he received a $2.2 million commission. During the financing, Ivanka Trump falsely claimed that over 90% of the units had been sold, and that their sale price was five times that of comparable units. Ivanka Trump also exaggerated demand for the units, claiming in 2009 they were selling out even as potential buyers were being offered substantial discounts. During the development, Donald Trump falsely implied that the Trump Organization had a financial stake in the project, and that it was acting as the developer, neither of which were true. The building was developed by Roger Khafif, President of the K Group, a Panama resort developer and three Colombian partners by Newland International Properties Corp. Khafif first conceptualized the project in 2005, and arranged a meeting with Donald Trump via Marvin Traub. A contract was signed initiating the project in New York City in 2006. Ivanaka Trump was given a lead role in developing the project. The hotel opened on July 6, 2011, approximately one year behind schedule, in a ceremony attended by President Ricardo Martinelli. In September 2011 Fitch Ratings downgraded $220 million in bonds that Newland International Properties Corp. was using to finance construction of the building from B-sf to CCsf because of \\"continued uncertainty over the willingness and ability\\" of buyers to take possession of apartment units. Newland licensed the Trump brand name for an initial fee of $1 million, the hotel was the first international Trump \\"name branded\\" development to open. Donald Trump reportedly personally profited between $30 million and $55 million from the project. The Trump Organization managed the hotel under contract until March 2018, when Cypriot businessman Orestes Fintiklis, who had bought a majority stake in the hotel condominium association, legally ousted them and had the Trump name removed from the building in 2015 and from the hotel March 5, 2018. The hotel was renamed The Bahia Grand Panama.http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/business/article207159979.html On March 22, the Panamanian law firm Britton and Iglesias unsuccessfully petitioned Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela to intercede and restore the Trump Organization's management team. On June 28, 2018, it was announced that the hotel would become a JW Marriott. It was officially renamed on September 26, 2018. In June 2019 Fintiklis accused Trump companies of tax evasion.

The book depicts a young boy's dream journey through a surreal baker's kitchen where he assists in the creation of a cake to be ready by the morning. In the Night Kitchen has been described by Sendak as part of a trilogy of books based on psychological development from In the Night Kitchen (toddler) to Where the Wild Things Are (pre-school) to Outside Over There (pre-adolescent). It was a Caldecott Honor recipient in 1971. It was adapted into a five-minute animated short film on January 1, 1987 by Gene Deitch. Plot summary The main character is a young boy named Mickey who, while sleeping in his bed, is disturbed by noise on a lower floor. Suddenly, he begins to float, and loses all of his clothes as he drifts into a surreal world called the \\"Night Kitchen\\". He falls naked into a giant mixing pot that contains the batter for the \\"morning cake\\". While Mickey is buried in the mass, three identical bakers (who closely resemble Oliver Hardy) mix the batter and prepare it for baking, unaware (or unconcerned) that there is a little boy inside. Just before the baking pan is placed into the oven, the boy emerges from the pan, protesting that he is not the batter's milk. To make up for the baking ingredient deficiency, Mickey (now wearing a body suit of batter from the neck down) constructs an airplane out of bread dough so he can use the measuring cup as a hat and fly to the mouth of a gigantic milk bottle. Upon reaching the bottle's opening, he dives in and briefly revels in the liquid. After his covering of batter disintegrates, making him naked again, he pours the needed milk in a cascade down to the bakers who joyfully finish making their morning cake. With dawn breaking, the naked Mickey crows like a rooster and slides down the side of the bottle, back into his bed, where he is magically clothed again, \\"cake free and dried\\". Controversy When Mickey (who looks to be about three years old) enters the Night Kitchen, he loses his pajamas and is fully naked in some parts of the story. Critics object to Mickey's nudity which depicts not only his buttocks, but also his genitals. Some also interpret sexual innuendo in the events, with the nudity, free-flowing milky fluids, and a giant (allegedly phallic) milk bottle. As a result, the book proved controversial in the United States on its release and has continued to be so. The inclusion of child nudity has been frequently raised as morally problematic; consequently, this book remains on lists of books either challenged or banned. The book has been ranked 25th on the \\"100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-2000\\" list compiled by the American Library Association. Artwork Sendak's illustrations here are rather different in style from Where the Wild Things Are, his best known book, which makes much use of cross hatching not found here. However, Sendak continues to utilize specific color tones and drawing a dream environment around a young child. Sendak's unique style captures the spirit and feeling of a dream, as Mickey floats, flies and dances from one panel to the next. The book may be defined as a comic story, at least if one uses the definition of comics proposed in Scott McCloud's acclaimed Understanding Comics ‚Äî the storytelling is mainly pictorial (albeit clarified by captions) and the images mainly sequential, and speech balloons are used throughout the entire book. In fact, the imagery is very similar to Winsor McCay's Sunday comic strip series Little Nemo from the early 20th century. Maurice Sendak has cited these comics as influential in his work, and on page five of Night Kitchen, one of the ingredients shown has a subtitle saying \\"Chicken Little, Nemo, mass\\", a nod to this influence.Some examples of similarities between Little Nemo and Sendak's In the Night Kitchen. In an interview on NPR's Fresh Air, Sendak said that his depiction of the cooks in In the Night Kitchen (with their Hitler-esque mustaches) and the fact that they tried to cook the boy in their ovens were references to the Holocaust, a subject high in his thoughts, especially due to his Jewish heritage. Sendak also said the story dealt with the things that happen after a child goes to bed.

After university he worked for a time for Shirley Williams, then President of the SDP. Later he worked for BBC Television. His first book was Vera Brittain: A Life, co- written with Paul Berry and published in 1995. This biography of the writer and peace campaigner Vera Brittain was shortlisted for the two major non- fiction prizes of its day, the Whitbread Prize and the NCR Book Award as well as the Fawcett Prize. Bostridge's next Brittain project was a collaboration with Alan Bishop. Their edition of her letters was published in 1998 as Letters from a Lost Generation, and Bostridge adapted the letters for a BBC Radio Four series starring Amanda Root as Brittain and Rupert Graves as Roland Leighton, who was killed in the First World War. Bostridge's Lives For Sale, an anthology of biographers' tales, was published in 2004. In 2008 he published Florence Nightingale: The Woman and Her Legend, the first major biography of Florence Nightingale in over half a century, which was awarded the 2009 Elizabeth Longford Prize for Historical Biography and named as a Wall Street Journal Best Book of 2008 and an Atlantic Magazine top book of the year. In 2008, Bostridge also published Because You Died, a selection of Vera Brittain's First World War poetry and prose, to mark the ninetieth anniversary of the Armistice. In May 2009 Screen Daily reported that he was working closely with BBC Films on a screen adaptation of Brittain's Testament of Youth. In December 2014 Bostridge's study Vera Brittain and the First World War, containing new research about Testament of Youth's evolution, and an account of the dramatisations of the book culminating in the new film version starring Alicia Vikander as Vera Brittain and Kit Harington as Roland Leighton, was published by Bloomsbury.

In June 2016 Bostridge was one of a group of biographers, historians, and other academics who signed a letter to The Times protesting at the erection of a statue to Mary Seacole at St Thomas' Hospital in London. In interviews Bostridge explained that he was not opposed to a statue to Seacole but to the siting of it at the hospital where Florence Nightingale founded her nurse training school in 1860, influencing the development of nursing throughout the world. Bostridge argues that Seacole was not a \\"pioneer nurse\\" as some of the statue campaigners maintain. He also points to the way in which Nightingale's enormous contributions to public health are now commonly and mistakenly attributed to Seacole by a wide range of British institutions that, he says, should \\"frankly know better\\". In an article published in the Times Literary Supplement in January 2020, Bostridge revealed that he has recently donated his diary to the Bodleian Library in Oxford.

Hysiae and Oenoe are mentioned as the frontier demi of Attica in 507 BCE, when they were both taken by the Boeotians. From this time Hysiae continued to be a Boeotian town; but Oenoe was recovered by the Athenians, and was fortified by them before the commencement of the Peloponnesian War. In 411 BCE, the Boeotians again obtained possession of Oenoe; but it must have been recovered a second time by the Athenians, as it continues to be mentioned as an Attic demus down to the latest times. Oenoe was situated on the Pythian Way, so called because it led from Athens to Delphi: this road apparently branched off from the Sacred Way to Eleusis, near the tomb of Strato. Near Oenoe was a Pythium, or temple of Apollo Pythius, in consequence of the sanctity of which Oenoe obtained the epithet of the Sacred.Liban. Declam. 16, in Dem. Apol. i. p. 451. This Pythium is said to have formed the northern boundary of the kingdom of Nisus, when Attica and the Megaris were divided between the four sons of Pandion II. At the northwest extremity of Attica there is a narrow pass through Mount Cithaeron, through which ran the road from Thebes and Plataeae to Eleusis. This pass was known in antiquity by the name of the Three Heads, as the Boeotians called it, or the Oak's Heads, according to the Athenians. On the Attic side this pass was guarded by a strong fortress, of which the ruins form a conspicuous object, on the summit of a height, to the left of the road. They now bear the name of Ghyft√≥kastro, or gipsy castle, a name frequently given to such buildings among the 19th century Greeks. The site of Oenoe is near modern Ino√Ø (Myupolis).

For thousands of years ship designers and builders of sailing vessels used rules of thumb based on the midship-section area to size the sails for a given vessel. The hull form and sail plan for the clipper ships, for example, evolved from experience, not from theory. It was not until the advent of steam power and the construction of large iron ships in the mid-19th century that it became clear to ship owners and builders that a more rigorous approach was needed. Definition Ship resistance is defined as the force required to tow the ship in calm water at a constant velocity. Components of resistance A body in water which is stationary with respect to water, experiences only hydrostatic pressure. Hydrostatic pressure always acts to oppose the weight of the body. If the body is in motion, then there are also hydrodynamic pressures that act on the body. Froude's experiments When testing ship models and then comparing the results to actual ships, the models tend to over predict the resistance of the ship. Froude had observed that when a ship or model was at its so called Hull speed the wave pattern of the transverse waves (the waves along the hull) have a wavelength equal to the length of the waterline. This means that the ship's bow was riding on one wave crest and so was its stern. This is often called the hull speed and is a function of the length of the ship V=k\\\\sqrt{L} where constant (k) should be taken as: 2.43 for velocity (V) in kn and length (L) in metres (m) or, 1.34 for velocity (V) in kn and length (L) in feet (ft). Observing this, Froude realized that the ship resistance problem had to be broken into two different parts: residuary resistance (mainly wave making resistance) and frictional resistance. To get the proper residuary resistance, it was necessary to recreate the wave train created by the ship in the model tests. He found for any ship and geometrically similar model towed at the suitable speed that: There is a frictional drag that is given by the shear due to the viscosity. This can result in 50% of the total resistance in fast ship designs and 80% of the total resistance in slower ship designs. To account for the frictional resistance Froude decided to tow a series of flat plates and measure the resistance of these plates, which were of the same wetted surface area and length as the model ship, and subtract this frictional resistance from the total resistance and get the remainder as the residuary resistance. Friction In a viscous fluid, a boundary layer is formed. This causes a net drag due to friction. The boundary layer undergoes shear at different rates extending from the hull surface until it reaches the field flow of the water. Wave-making resistance A ship moving over the surface of undisturbed water sets up waves emanating mainly from the bow and stern of the ship. The waves created by the ship consist of divergent and transverse waves. The divergent waves are observed as the wake of a ship with a series of diagonal or oblique crests moving outwardly from the point of disturbance. These waves were first studied by William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, who found that regardless of the speed of the ship, they were always contained in the 19.5 degree (each side: see \\"Principles of Yacht Design\\") symmetric wedge following the ship. The divergent waves do not cause much resistance against the ships forward motion. However, the transverse waves appear as troughs and crests along the length of a ship and constitute the major part of the wave-making resistance of a ship. The energy associated with the transverse wave system travels at one half the phase velocity or the group velocity of the waves. The prime mover of the vessel must put additional energy into the system in order to overcome this expense of energy. The relationship between the velocity of ships and that of the transverse waves can be found by equating the wave celerity and the ship's velocity. See also * William Froude References * E. V.

In other words, for any point selected on the boundary of one of the lakes, the other two lakes' boundaries also contain that point. More than two sets with the same boundary are said to have the Wada property; examples include Wada basins in dynamical systems. This property is rare in real-world systems. The lakes of Wada were introduced by , who credited the discovery to Takeo Wada. His construction is similar to the construction by of an indecomposable continuum, and in fact it is possible for the common boundary of the three sets to be an indecomposable continuum. Construction of the lakes of Wada First five stages of the Lakes of Wada The Lakes of Wada are formed by starting with a closed unit square of dry land, and then digging 3 lakes according to the following rule: *On day n = 1, 2, 3,... extend lake n mod 3 (=0, 1, 2) so that it is open and connected and passes within a distance 1/n of all remaining dry land. This should be done so that the remaining dry land remains homeomorphic to a closed unit square. After an infinite number of days, the three lakes are still disjoint connected open sets, and the remaining dry land is the boundary of each of the 3 lakes. For example, the first five days might be (see the image on the right): # Dig a blue lake of width 1/3 passing within /3 of all dry land. # Dig a red lake of width 1/32 passing within /32 of all dry land. # Dig a green lake of width 1/33 passing within /33 of all dry land. # Extend the blue lake by a channel of width 1/34 passing within /34 of all dry land. (The small channel connects the thin blue lake to the thick one, near the middle of the image.) # Extend the red lake by a channel of width 1/35 passing within /35 of all dry land. (The tiny channel connects the thin red lake to the thick one, near the top left of the image.) A variation of this construction can produce a countable infinite number of connected lakes with the same boundary: instead of extending the lakes in the order 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, ...., extend them in the order 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...and so on. Wada basins Wada basins of attraction for all three disconnected open basins have the same boundary Wada basins are certain special basins of attraction studied in the mathematics of non-linear systems. A basin having the property that every neighborhood of every point on the boundary of that basin intersects at least three basins is called a Wada basin, or said to have the Wada property. Unlike the Lakes of Wada, Wada basins are often disconnected. An example of Wada basins is given by the Newton‚ÄìRaphson method applied to a cubic polynomial with distinct roots, such as see the picture. A physical system that demonstrates Wada basins is the pattern of reflections between three spheres in contact‚Äîsee chaotic scattering. Wada basins in chaos theory In chaos theory, Wada basins arise very frequently. Usually, the Wada property can be seen in the basin of attraction of dissipative dynamical systems. But the exit basins of Hamiltonian system can also show the Wada property. In the context of the chaotic scattering of systems with multiple exit, basin of exit shows the Wada property. M. A. F. Sanju√°n et al. had shown that in the H√©non- Heiles system the exit basins have this Wada property.

It is located at about 40 km southwest of Ipoh on the main Ipoh-Lumut highway. The adjacent towns are Tronoh, a once- famous mining town and Bota. Universiti Teknologi Petronas, a branch campus of Universiti Teknologi MARA and Kolej Profesional MARA are located in Seri Iskandar.  History  The town was named after Paduka Seri Sultan Iskandar Shah, who ruled the state of Perak from 1918 until 1938. Several institutions started the township in the mid-eighties before it got its name. The Engineering Branch Campus of Universiti Sains Malaysia started its operation on a disused tin mine at about 5 km south of Tronoh in 1986. A religious secondary school, SMKA Sultan Azlan Shah, occupied a newly built school buildings at about 7 km east of Bota Kanan in 1987. A radio transmission station and a teachers living quarters were built soon after within this area. In 1988, the state government came out with a plan of a township with its own name. A large industrial park, a university with commercial parks and housing estates with an airport were parts of the plan of the township. However, progress was slow and the investors were slow to come in. The eastern part of Seri Iskandar was an extension of Tronoh Mines prior to the 1980s. In the early 1990s, USM Engineering Campus was surrounded by disused mining pools. Except for a school, palm oil plantations covered the western part at this time. To travel from Tronoh to Bota, one must go through Seputih and Parit, to reach Bota. It was not until the construction of a highway between Ipoh and Lumut that connected Tronoh to Bota directly, that further development took off. Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP) started its operation in the USM Campus buildings in 1996. USM Engineering Branch was to move to a new campus in Penang and the move was completed by 2001. PETRONAS acquired lands adjacent to the USM campus to build a new campus for UTP. The new campus was completely built by 2003. The Universiti Teknologi MARA (Perak Campus) also moved from Seri Manjung to Seri Iskandar by 2001. The numbers of food stalls and restaurants surged due to the sudden increase of population especially from the two new universities and the supporting industries. Residential areas were established starting with Taman Maju (1994), RPA Changkat Sodang (1995), JKR & Teachers' Quarters (1996), Bandar Universiti (2001), Desa Seri Iskandar (2002), Bandar Seri Iskandar (2003), Taman Gemilang (2008) and Puncak Iskandar (2012). A number of public facilities were also established in Seri Iskandar starting with a primary school (1993), followed by the district office (1996), a vocational school (1996), a secondary school (1998), a health office (1999),a petrol station (2003) and a mosque (2006). Two institutions of higher learning, Institut Kemahiran Belia Negara (IKBN) and Kolej Professional MARA started operations in 2002 and 2005 respectively to build the reputation of Seri Iskandar as a 'Bandar Ilmu' (The Town of Knowledge).  Layout  Seri Iskandar is a combination of satellite towns, most of them with several rows of shophouses and residential housing areas. The satellite towns are: # Bandar Seri Iskandar (commonly referred to as SIDeC, the property developer) # Bandar Universiti # Bandar Baru Seri Iskandar # Taman Maju # Desa Seri Iskandar (includes RPA Changkat Sodang) # Seri Iskandar is located halfway between the state capital, Ipoh city and Lumut.

The system of song-based magic is similar to that seen in the earlier Spellsinger Cycle by Alan Dean Foster. Books *The Soprano Sorceress (1997) Anna Marshall is transported from her life in modern Iowa, to the medieval world of Erde. On Earth, Anna was a classical singer and professor of music. On Erde, singing is a rare skill, whose only use is sorcery. She must find a place for herself and learn sorcery before she is destroyed by powerful leaders who fear her. The society is intensely patriarchal, even misogynistic. As an unmarried woman who wants to remain independent, she is opposed by various male and female characters. She also finds allies, again from both genders. With each of her successes, the stakes get higher. Her arrival coincided with invasions by neighbouring countries. Anna's role becomes decisive in these wars. *The Spellsong War (1998) Anna is now regent for the young heir to the kingdom of Defalk. The society is feudal and patriarchal and, as a female head of state, Anna is reviled by many, inside and outside of Defalk. She uses diplomacy where she can, and force of arms (and war sorcery) when she cannot. She begins to build national infrastructure (river bridges, postal mail, tax accounting, a school for noble heirs). When possible, she tries to improve the lot of the commoners, especially of women. Her innovations are often opposed and her successes often backfire. She defends her kingdom from treachery by her country's nobles, from peasant revolt, and from foreign invasion. Her sorcery becomes ever more powerful but at increasing personal cost. *Darksong Rising (1999) Anna is the most powerful sorceress on the continent. She is, again, subduing rebellious Defalkan lords and hostile neighbouring countries. Out of necessity, she acts ever more ruthlessly, eventually levelling an entire city. She suffers, from self-questioning as well as from the after-effects of sorcery. At the end of the book, she achieves an uneasy peace with the neighbouring countries and her nation-building efforts bring some prosperity to her subjects. She must remain forever vigilant and she can never return to her own children on Earth but she makes a life for herself on Erde that includes a little happiness. *The Shadow Sorceress (2001) For decades, Anna was a source of stability, propping up the (now adult) king. She regularly used sorcery to eliminate opponents covertly. Anna trained her adopted daughter, Secca, and created an official position for Secca as a sorceress to the kingdom. Upon Anna's death, those who opposed her reforms seize the initiative. For Secca, losing Anna is very painful but matters unravel with frightening speed. To survive, and to preserve the society which Anna molded, Secca must fill Anna's shoes. As the story progresses, Secca matures and her self-confidence grows. She draws on Anna's teaching, discovering deeper meanings. She subdues rebellion, defeats new external enemies, and defends her position as Anna's heir. In so doing, she experiences the same dilemmas which Anna did, decades earlier. *Shadowsinger (2002) Secca faces the ultimate enemy: an island nation of misogynist sorcerers, who have been instigating much of the strife on Erde, since before Anna's time. Secca acts boldly. She takes the fight to them and reduces their entire country to ashes, killing off most of the population.

Pawnee was the territorial capital for exactly five days ‚Äì the legislature met there from July 2 to July 6 ‚Äì before legislators voted to move the capital to Shawnee Mission, which is located in present-day Fairway. It may be the shortest-lived capital of any U.S. state or territory (Colorado City also served as the capital of the newly established Colorado Territory for five days in 1862 but was not federally recognized). History =Early history= For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized. =Establishing the town= Pawnee, named after a native tribe that had inhabited its land, was located on the far western frontier of Kansas Territory, between the new settlement of Manhattan, Kansas, and the U.S. Army post at Fort Riley. Pawnee was first laid out in 1854. Fort Riley's commander, Colonel William R. Montgomery, authorized the acquisition by the Pawnee Town Association investors of 400 acres believed to be part of the military reservation. In December 1854 or January 1855, the site was selected as capital by recently-commissioned first Territorial Governor Andrew Reeder, after his delayed arrival from Pennsylvania. Governor Reeder had an economic stake in the site, since he was one of the investors and a new landowner in the settlement, and he was not disappointed: Within six weeks of his announcement, hundreds of people arrived in the town. It quickly sprouted new homes, stores, and hotels, and he soon built a 2-story log cabin there that became known as the \\"Governor's Mansion\\". =Electing the Territorial Legislature= The Governor had failed to take an accurate territorial census before the first election of representatives to help ensure valid results. The February 1855 census showed 36 residents in Pawnee, but 75 votes were cast there in the March 30 election, held at the home of Robert Klotz. The number reflected emigrants who had arrived within that month, and election returns indicated no illegal voters at Pawnee. But the same could not be said at polling places throughout much of the rest of the territory, as more than 800 illegal votes were identified in both Lawrence and Leavenworth and more than 4,000 territory-wide. Free-state interests had been bolstered by the arrival of new settlers from New England who were aided by the Emigrant Aid Company. But many free-staters felt that Reeder had intentionally delayed the spring election until pro-slavery men from neighboring Missouri could arrive and cast votes they should not have been allowed. Missouri residents overran the polling places and threatened legitimate voters who were residents or planned to be such. Ultimately, only 8 of the 39 men elected had free-state intentions. =One week of action= The Territorial Legislature first met in Pawnee on July 2, 1855, composed mostly of the pro-slavery delegates fraudulently elected. They were unhappy that Governor Reeder had put the capital over 100 miles from the Missouri border, feeling that the location favored the free-state advocates in Kansas Territory. What the legislators feared was precisely Reeder's intention, as he believed a free Kansas favored his personal land interests throughout the territory. Undiscouraged, the pro- slavery legislators' first action was to unseat all but one of the free-state men, and one who lost his position exclaimed that they were, \\"lighting the watchfires of war\\". The only free-state legislator who remained, Martin Conway, appeared also to be at odds with Reeder, standing during the Governor's opening address to denounce the body and proclaim that he was prepared to dishonor any of its laws. Despite the Governor and Conway, another quick action the legislators took was a successful vote to move the capital to Shawnee Mission, on the Missouri border. Governor Reeder vetoed the measure, recalling the expense the town of Pawnee had already taken to build the capital city. The Territorial Legislature overrode his veto, and next met in Shawnee on July 16. Nevertheless, Reeder continued to insist Pawnee was the capital, vetoing any legislation that reached him, believing that the lawmakers were not in legal session. Because of its unscrupulous origin and actions, the group became known as the Bogus Legislature. The pro-slavery men had never intended to reside in Pawnee, ignoring the nearby boarding houses available and arriving prepared to camp outside. After the vote to relocate, the Kansas Legislature never stayed in Pawnee againJuly 6, 1855 was its last day as capital cityit served only five days. =Destruction= Soon after Pawnee lost its function as capital, in September 1855, Jefferson Davis, the Secretary of War, surveyed the settlement and showed the results to U.S. President Franklin Pierce. On the resulting map, the survey indicated the eastern boundary of Fort Riley both with and without Pawnee, and the lines excluding the town were accepted. It was ordered to be destroyed and its land reincorporated back into Fort Riley. Notices signed by Pierce were posted on every structure instructing everyone to leave by October 10. A Major Cook with 1,000 of his Texas troops were charged with evacuating the residents, many of whom were unwilling to leave. By the night of the 10th, some residents still remained. The Governor's Mansion, abandoned by its first tenant who unhappily left for Shawnee, was pulled down with its next residents still inside. In another home, a woman with her infant was carried out on a mattress and taken across the border line of the reservation. Most of the buildings, including all of its houses, were demolished, meaning financial ruin for many families. Other Kansas towns developed under similar circumstances but lacking significant free-state aspirants did not suffer the same fate. Pawnee later and today Many residents left town with the legislators immediately after their adjournment on July 6. Those who did not were faced with a cholera outbreak in August. Fort Riley was also affected. Union Pacific Railroad lines reached the abandoned town in 1866 ‚Äì as part of a transcontinental route approved by the Pawnee legislature ‚Äì passing just yards away from the north side of the capitol. Its passage through Pawnee was due in part to the unreliability of the nearby river for navigation. =First Territorial Capitol State Historic Site= The capitol under construction. Davis had determined most of the town to be within the boundaries of Fort Riley; its eastern edge at the mouth of Onemile Creek. Only the capitol building was spared from demolition. During its brief service by the legislature, it was a very uncomfortable meeting space due partly to the fact that it was not complete. The floor boards were not nailed down, and a hole in the exterior wall left for construction purposes still remained at the second floor. After the legislature departed, townspeople entered the building and found, according to one of them, \\"...a room full of confusion and disorder. Torn pamphlets, scraps of papers, and rubbish of all descriptions were scattered about.\\" The awkward edifice was used shortly afterward as a warehouse. The structure, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is within the current boundary of the military reservation, and has since served a variety of other uses. It has also functioned as a church, a bachelor's club, housing and a carpentry shop. In the 1920s the Kansas Historical Society and Union Pacific took over responsibility for the building and repaired it. It was rededicated in 1928 with a grand celebration and became a history museum. In 1961, the state legislature met in the Pawnee capitol again, for one day, during statehood centennial celebrations. Today the museum features exhibits on Kansas Territory, rail and river travel in the region, and the history of Pawnee. Because it is now part of a military installation, arrangements must be made in advance for the general public to visit the museum. A driving tour of the base is available, featuring several historic sites, including the First Territorial Capitol.

The libretto was written in Russian by Vladimir Khachaturov, based on the 1732 novel The Devil in Love by Jacques Cazotte. Completed in 1989, it was premiered on 15 February 2019 at the Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre in Moscow.  History  Alexander Vustin composed The Devil in Love to a libretto in Russian by Vladimir Khachaturov, based on the 1732 novel The Devil in Love by Jacques Cazotte. He worked on the opera for around 15 years, from 1975 to 1989. The work was first intended to be a short chamber opera, but grew due to the inclusion of more plot lines. It became a work in three acts and eight scenes. Vustin used similar musical material as in other compositions written during the same period. It was published by Boosey and Hawkes. The opera was premiered in a two-act version on 15 February 2019 to mark the centenary season of the Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre in Moscow. The conductor was Vladimir Jurowski and the director Alexander Titel. The production team won the 2019 Onegin Award.  Plot and scoring  As in the play, the devil is attracted to a young man, Alvare, and assumes several incarnations, including a girl, Biondetta. The topic is reminiscent of the Faust myth, but in the play and the opera, the devil becomes more and more human, and the girl is ultimately freed by her love from supernatural powers. The opera requires two sopranos, mezzo-soprano, two contraltos, two tenors, two baritones, two basses, a small chorus and dancers. The core instrumentation follows Stravinsky's L'Histoire du soldat, employing clarinet, trumpet, trombone, percussion, violin and double bass. It ultimately consisted of 2 flutes (II = piccolo), 5 clarinets (II = bass clarinet, III = alto saxophone, IV = tenor saxophone, V = bass saxophone), trumpet, trombone, percussion (7 players; percussion 1: wood blocks / temple blocks; percussion 2: cymbals / gongs / tam-tams; percussion 3: tom-toms / drums; percussion 4-7: tubular bells / vibraphone / marimba / castanets / 5 tartafruge / whip (instrument) / hammer / guiro / ratchet / washboard / 2 maracas / rattle / hi- hat / flexatone / tambourine / tamburo (side drum) / cassa (bass drum) / pedal timpani / flauto a culisse / large siren / ruggitso del leone) / keyboards (piano / celesta / harpsichord / electronic organ / synthesizer), 12 violins, 1 double-bass. Vustin assigned certain instruments and singing styles to the characters. Alvare uses declamation, and is accompanied by violin and trumpet, while Biondetta is songful, accompanied by three saxophones. In an extended love duet, Alvare turns more to singing, and the instrumental colours are more and more mixed. The composer characterised the opera as a \\"scene for voices and instruments with games and dancing ad libitum\\". While the beginning has lively action such as billiard games, disputes and transformations, the inner world of the protagonists becomes the focus for most of the opera.

He is particularly known for discovering Da Costa's syndrome (also known as soldier's heart), an anxiety disorder combining effort fatigue, dyspnea, a sighing respiration, palpitation and sweating that he first observed in soldiers in the American Civil War and documented in an 1871 study. He was born into the small community of Sephardi Jews on St. Thomas, then still a Danish colony. At the age of four, Da Costa left the island for mainland Europe, where he attended gymnasium. As a result of his childhood travel and international education, Da Costa originally wanted to enter the foreign service. However, his mother encouraged him to attend medical school. He applied to enter Jefferson Medical College (now Thomas Jefferson University) and earned his medical degree in 1852. During the Civil War he served as a physician at the Military Hospital as well as Turner's Lane Hospital, Philadelphia. It was during this period that he gathered much of the evidence that used in his 1871 study of anxiety disorders. He later taught at the Jefferson Medical College (now Thomas Jefferson University), where he became a respected and sought after lecturer. Da Costa's interest in the humanities remained with him throughout his life. He believed that a truly gifted physician required a knowledge of both science and art. In 1883, he told the graduating class of Jefferson Medical College that, > I think that the cultivation of the humane letters has the most distinct > bearing on the cultivation and appreciation of science. Science is nothing > without imagination; and imagination is most readily kept fresh by > literature. What little good there is a mere descriptive person, and in the > small facts which with painful toil he accumulates. But let these facts be > welded together by thought, their bearing traced by imagination, experiments > devised by the mind projecting itself in advance of them, and the plodder is > likely to become the great discoverer. In 1860 he married Sarah Brinton, the sister of his friend and colleague, Professor John Hill Brinton (1832-1907). Their only son, Charles Frederick, became a lawyer. He died on September 12, 1900, and was buried at Woodlands Cemetery (photo: here).  Irritable Heart  Jacob Da Costa worked at Satterlee Hospital in Philadelphia during the American Civil War. While there, he studied over 400 patients with non-specific cardiac complaints. As a result of these studies, he identified a new condition he termed \\"irritable heart\\" (sometimes called Da Costa Syndrome) in 1862. By 1871 he published his landmark study of the condition.

The reservation is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation. The portion of the reservation between the Charles River Dam and the Eliot Bridge is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. This includes the park in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston known as the Esplanade. The Charles River above the Watertown Dam is managed as the Upper Charles River Reservation. Features Features of the reservation include the Charles River Dam, the Charles River Basin, the Boston and Cambridge Esplanades, and John F. Kennedy Park. =Charles River Dam= The 1978 Charles River Dam, located behind the TD Garden, controls the water level in the river basin. An earlier dam (see Charles River Dam Bridge), located beneath the Museum of Science, was completed in 1910 with the purpose of creating a fresh water river basin and riverfront park in Boston and Cambridge. As part of the dam construction, fill was added between the Longfellow Bridge and Charlesgate and dedicated as the Boston Embankment, now universally known as the Esplanade. The modern dam houses six pumps that provide flood control protection. The dam's lock system permits travel of recreational and commercial vessels from the river to the harbor year round. A fish passage allows for passage of anadromous fish (alewife, rainbow smelt and shad) during the migration season in late spring. =Charles River Basin and Esplanades= Created in 1910 by damming the formerly tidal river and permanently flooding the tidal marshes and mud flats, the Charles River Basin was designed to provide a \\"water park\\" for city dwellers, with access to outstanding river scenery and recreational opportunities on both water and land. The character of the Basin changes along this stretch, forming three discernible zones: the Lower Basin, from the 1910 Charles River Dam to the Boston University Bridge; the Middle Basin, from the BU Bridge to Herter Park, and the Upper Basin, from Herter Park to the Watertown Dam. The Lower Basin is long and up to wide. The panoramas in the Lower Basin define the image of Boston and Cambridge. The Longfellow Bridge is a powerful presence in the Lower Basin, as are the slope of Beacon Hill and the gold dome of the State House. Particular park sections within the reservation, such as Magazine Beach and Herter Park, provide intensely used open space for the bordering urban neighborhoods. Charlesbank The Middle Basin is a zone of transition from urban and formal to rural and more natural. Parkways lining the Charles River Basin separate the esplanades in Boston and Cambridge from the nearby neighborhoods. The largest open space is between the Harvard University athletic fields on the south and Mount Auburn and Cambridge cemeteries on the north. Together, these areas form a critical oasis for migrating birds. Frederick Law Olmsted's 1889 design for Charlesbank created the first public space along the river. It included a promenade along the water's edge, as well as the first public outdoor gymnasiums in the United States, one for women and girls near the Longfellow Bridge and one for men and boys near Leverett Street (now Leverett Circle). =John F. Kennedy Park= The John F. Kennedy Park located near Harvard Square is landscaped with plants that bloom at the time of the President's May birthday and a memorial fountain. The park, designed by Carol R. Johnson Associates of Boston, uses materials indigenous to New England including native trees, and the granite fountain and the entrance pillars are inscribed with quotations from the President's speeches. =Riverbend Park= Riverbend Park extends on the north side of the Charles, from the Eliot Bridge to Western Ave. in Cambridge. In 1974 Isabella Halsted (who lived on Memorial Drive) circulated a letter asking if neighbors would support closing the Drive to vehicles on Sundays from spring to fall. She may have been familiar with the closing of sections of Rock Creek Parkway in Washington, D.C. A portion of the drive was blocked off for the first time the following year. For nine years, the private Trust for Riverbend Park raised funds to cover the cost of the road closing. In 1985 the state legislature authorized and funded the permanent closing of the road from April to November. Recreation The reservation's multiple recreational opportunities include cycling on the Charles River Bike Paths, motorized and non-motorized boating, playgrounds, picnicking, swimming pools, tennis courts, ice skating, and concerts at the Hatch Memorial Shell.

They are often produced by governmental entities, or local authorities in locations where production costs or distribution problems might otherwise make regular newspaper distribution either difficult or unnecessary. Twentieth-century usage =Soviet Russia and Soviet Union= During the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War, which followed, the use of wall newspapers came into vogue in Soviet Russia. These so-called \\"placard newspapers\\" are said to have begun due to a chronic shortage of newsprint paper resulting from war conditions, blockade, and economic dislocation.\\"Placard Newspapers\\", Russian Review, vol. 3, no. 8 (April 15, 1925), p. 183. The papers were first used in military barracks as a means of disseminating official government information, but their use was soon common in factories, schools, and other locations where large numbers of people congregated. These wall poster newspapers soon came to be seen as efficient vehicles for publicity and propaganda in a factory setting even after the end of the newsprint shortage, as one early account noted: > It is by no means the ambition of the placard newspaper to supplant the > printed periodical. Its object is rather to throw light on such questions as > cannot be treated in the columns of the general newspapers, for lack of > space. ... Each labor community ... has found it advisable to encourage a > public discussion of the current problems of its specific production, and to > induce all its workers, even the most backward,to take part in this > discussion. The placard newspaper is particularly devoted to these specific > interests of each industry. Early Soviet wall newspapers were frequently produced by an editorial board of 3‚Äì5 people, who frequently made use of the news reports of so-called \\"worker- correspondents\\". Wall poster newspapers were also used in small or remote villages in Soviet Russia, in which no other news source was available. These village wall papers sought to build literacy among a largely illiterate population and to inculcate pro-regime values among the rural population. =Germany= criticism and self-criticism\\" Wall newspapers were frequently used in factories of Communist East Germany during the second half of the 20th century as a mechanism for publicity and propaganda. The form of these publications was at times more akin to a bulletin board than a formal newspaper. =People's Republic of China= Under the reign of Mao Zedong, wall newspapers were \\"forward and full of pathos-filled propaganda about current events\\" and the \\"large victories for our grand nation\\", according to Qiu Xiaolong.Klassekampen, 2011-09-03 page 3 by Astrid Hygen Meyer: \\"Mao Zhedong ... veggaviser med ublyg og patosfylt propaganda om de siste tiders hendelser og de \\"storsl√•tte seirer for v√•rt storsl√•tte land\\".\\" =United States of America= In the United States wall newspapers were sometimes used by the Communist movement as a training vehicle in youth and adult education groups, simultaneously teaching the elements of journalism while reinforcing the party's values and ideology among readers. Wall newspapers also periodically emerged in a factory setting as a means of spreading information within the workplace, particularly during times of labor discord and strikes.

Examples A variety of factors can lead to missing markets: A classic example of a missing market is the case of an externality like pollution, where decision makers are not responsible for some of the consequences of their actions. When a factory discharges polluted water into a river, that pollution can hurt people who fish in or get their drinking water from the river downstream, but the factory owner may have no incentive to consider those consequences. Coordination failure can also prevent market formation. Again considering the pollution example, downstream residents might seek to be paid by the factory owner who pollute their water, but because of the free rider problem it may be difficult to coordinate. Another barrier to pollution markets could be technology. If the river has several factories along its banks, it may be difficult or impossible to monitor which factory is responsible for downstream pollution. High transaction costs might also deter market formation. It may be the case that both sides could benefit from an exchange of goods, but that setting up such an exchange is prohibitively expensive. Markets can also be missing if there is a failure of trust or information. In non zero-sum interactions, it is possible that the Nash Equilibrium for individuals acting independently will be sub-optimal, in that both parties could benefit from cooperating, but on their own will choose not to. An example could be a shortage in footwear, where one person would like to open a factory to make shoes, and the other would like to produce socks, but because they are complementary commodities, neither has incentive to start producing unless he knows that the other will do the same (see also: prisoner's dilemma). The same applies to alternative automotive fuels: few filling station owners will be interested in offering the fuel until alternate-fuel cars are on the road, but people will not buy alternate-fuel cars until filling stations exist to service them. Solutions In many cases of missing markets, it may be possible for the government or another actor to create circumstances that make market exchange possible. In the case of pollution, one popular solution is for the government to assign property rights in order to allow Coase Bargaining. In cases of information failure, futures markets can help to signal willingness to cooperate. An ownership solution is for one party to integrate into both activities, thereby internalizing the benefits, or to use the surplus generated on one side of the market to subsidize transactions on the other (see two sided markets).

Leggatt criticised the then existing system for administrating many tribunals, in particular he observed that some tribunals were not independent of the administrative bodies over which they were supposed to exert control; and that there was no uniformity of administration between the many tribunals. The Leggatt report was followed by a white paper in July 2004, entitled Transforming Public Services: Complaints, Redress and Tribunals, which, amongst other recommendations, proposed bringing together a number of tribunals under the administrative of a newly created agency. The government's plans came to fruition in April 2006, when the Tribunals Service was created out of the 16 tribunals that were already administered by the Department for Constitutional Affairs, together with a number transferred from other government departments. An example of the latter is the Social Security and Child Support Appeals Tribunal which was supplied with administrative support by the Appeals Service, which was formerly an executive agency in its own right, reporting to the Department for Work and Pensions. In 2010 it was announced that the service would merge with Her Majesty's Courts Service to form a new unified body for all courts and tribunals in England and Wales. this merger took place on 1 April 2011 with the formation of Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service.

It is a humorous look at life in a women's college at the turn of the 20th century. Patty Wyatt, the protagonist of this story is a bright, fun-loving, imperturbable young woman who does not like to conform. The book describes her many escapades on campus during her senior year at college. Patty enjoys life on campus and uses her energies in playing pranks and for the entertainment of herself and her friends. An intelligent young woman, she uses creative methods to study only as much as she feels necessary. Patty is, however, a believer in causes and a champion of the weak. She goes out of her way to help a homesick freshman, Olivia Copeland, who believes she will be sent home when she fails three subjects in the examination. The end of the book sees Patty reflecting on what her life after college might be like. She plays hooky from chapel and meets a bishop. In a chat with the bishop, Patty realizes that being irresponsible and evasive at a young age could adversely affect her character as an adult and decides to try to be a more responsible person. This is Jean Webster‚Äôs earliest published work, and not as popular as her better-known novels Daddy-Long-Legs (1912) and Dear Enemy (1915). Webster later wrote Just Patty (1911), which describes Patty's school days, and predates this story by around five years.

Seaman, is a rare manganese boron phosphate mineral with formula Mn3[B(OH)4](PO4)(OH)2. The yellow to pink mineral occurs as small, needle-shaped crystals. It was first discovered in 1917 from a mine in Iron County, Michigan, United States and identified in 1930. , seamanite is known from four sites in Michigan and South Australia. History In 1917, Arthur E. Seaman collected a mineral sample from the Chicagon Mine in Iron County, Michigan. He correctly believed it to be a new mineral species based on a qualitative analysis of its composition by F. B. Wilson. World War I delayed further study of the mineral until 1929. A study in 1930 proved it to be a new mineral and named it seamanite in honor of Seaman. They cited his career as a professor of geology and mineralogy and his contributions to the field as reasons for the naming.Kraus, p. 220. The original analysis of the mineral in 1930 suggested seamanite to be a hydrated salt.Kraus, p. 223‚Äì5 However, in 1971, the mineral was determined to be the coordination compound Mn3[B(OH)4](PO4)(OH)2.Moore, p. 1527. Description Seamanite is a transparent, yellow to pink mineral that occurs as needle- shaped crystals. Seamanite is a brittle mineral with a mohs hardness of 4. It is found in the crevices of fractured siliceous rock.

Avery founded the farm implement business after the Civil War. His company built a large line of products, including steam engines, beginning in 1891. The company started with a return flue design and later adapted the undermount style, including a bulldog design on the smokebox door. Their design was well received by farmers in central Illinois. They expanded their market nationwide and overseas until the 1920s, when they failed to innovate and the company faltered. They manufactured trucks for a period of time, and then automobiles. until they finally succumbed to an agricultural crisis and the Depression. Origins in Civil War prison camp Robert Hanneman Avery (16 January 1840, Galesburg, Illinois - 13 September 1892, Peoria, Illinois) was heavily influenced during his childhood by his great-uncle Riley Root, who invented a rotary fan blower to clear railroad tracks of snow. Robert attended Knox College and after graduation, worked part-time at the Brown Manufacturing Company, which built a line of corn planters. Robert taught school before enlisting in 1862 as a Union Soldier in the American Civil War, in Company A, 77th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He was captured in 1864 and spent a number of months in various prisoner-of-war camps, before being sent to the now infamous Confederate Andersonville Prison for about eight months.1886 Portrait & Biographical Album of Knox County, Illinois. There he passed the time devising an improved seed drill by sketching a design in the sand. After the war he worked on a farm his brother John had bought for the two of them. Robert continued to work on several inventions, and, during the winters when the farm was idle, he worked in a Galesburg, Illinois, machine shop. He used that money and the experience to design and develop patterns and castings for a riding cultivator. =Company founded by brothers= Bird's Eye view of Avery Company, Peoria, IL Robert's brother Cyrus Avery thought the invention had huge potential. To fund their company, Cyrus invested some capital, and Robert sold his share of the farm to his brother John and borrowed additional money. They began business as R.H. & C.M. Avery Company. Sales did not take off and the brothers' company teetered on bankruptcy. Robert moved his family to Kansas and took advantage of the Homestead Act of 1862 to obtain more farm land. He invented a new spiral corn stalk cutter and this time sales increased quickly. In 1872, Robert moved back to Galesburg and with his brother Cyrus' help, restarted the Avery Company. By 1874 he had a full size working model of his corn planter built. The original planter is now in the Edison Institute Museum at Ford's Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan. Avery Thresher One of their inventions was the Avery Thresher, a popular threshing machine in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The thresher was driven from the flywheel of a steam traction engine. A belt from the flywheel drove a wheel found on the thresher, separating the wheat kernels from the wheat stalks. Robert was the inventor while Cyrus managed the business aspects. They operated out of Galesburg, Illinois until 1882, when they needed better access to railroad transportation and wider markets. They bought into the oldest foundry in Peoria, owned by Joseph Frost. They then purchased in Peoria, Illinois and moved the business there to North Adams and North Jefferson Streets adjacent to a railroad spur. They built a three-story manufacturing facility, producing check rowers, stalk cutters, corn planters, cultivators and hand tools. In 1883 the company was capitalized at US$200.000 and renamed the Avery Planter Company. Page from the Avery Company catalog describing their \\"65hp Single Cylinder Straight Flue Steam Traction Engine\\"When they began manufacturing powered tractors, they hired Albert Espe, one of the premier tractor designers in the country. In 1899, the company was reincorporated, the capital stock increased to US$600,000, and it was renamed the Avery Manufacturing Company. In 1891, they enlarged their product line to include steam traction engines and grain threshers, which would become up the majority of their business for the next 30 years. Their tractors used the best steam engines of the day, and the boilers were reinforced to withstand extra pressure. The line included unique tractors with top-mounted steam engines resembling locomotives more than typical farm tractors of the day. One of their yellow wood threshers were nicknamed the Yellow Fellow and remained a large part of the company's business for the next thirty years. Avery made a variety steam engines, including , , and hp models. They also made Corn King and Corn Queen cultivators, separators, wagons, horse stalk cutters and a steel-mounted water tank. In 1892, Robert died and Cyrus became president. John B. Bartholomew, who started with the company on December 8, 1879 driving a team to haul lumber for a US$1.10 per day, was made vice-president. He was also the brother of Cyrus' wife, Minnie. =Reputation for innovation= In 1894, Avery introduced a mechanical corn picker which tractor expert Jack Norbeck described as 'so different and unusual that at the time farmers wouldn't buy it because it would put too many people out of work.' Avery also invented removable piston sleeves for its gas tractors starting in 1916. Other tractor manufacturers eventually adopted the same practice. It also offered the first farm toy ever manufactured as a favor: they gave away miniature Avery tractors, high and of cast iron, made by Hubley. Capitalization growth In 1900 the company's stock was valued at US$1,000.000. In 1902, Avery purchased the Hannah Wagon Co., and it continued to grow until 1912 when it was valued at US$2,500,000. Cyrus Avery left active management of the company in 1902 and built a new home in Galesburg. In September, 1905, Cyrus M. Avery died. His son, George Luzerne Avery, had served as his father' secretary and was made a director of the company upon his father's death. George's uncle, J. B. Bartholomew, became president. An Avery tractor pulling three sod cutters on a farm near Larned, Kansas around 1916. The Avery company made many traction engines, such as the 1907 steam tractor model. At that time steam was the only form of power and the tractor resembled a miniature locomotive. In 1909, Avery began manufacturing gasoline tractors. They shortly gained a reputation for producing huge tractors, including the very large for its day Avery steam traction engines, weighing each. Large tractors were needed across the prairie from North Dakota to Texas to turn the virgin sod, often with roots as thick as a man's thumb, into tillable soil. Even teams of 16 horses were not strong enough to pull gang plows through the dense bunch grasses whose roots grew as deep as into the earth. The first small steam traction engines, adapted from the design of stationary engines used to thresh wheat and gin cotton, weren‚Äôt strong enough and broke down repeatedly. The competitive landscape changed during that same year, 1909, when the Holt Manufacturing Company of Stockton, California, arrived in Peoria. Holt, a builder of steam-powered harvesters and traction engines and already a leader in crawler tractors, purchased the bankrupt Colean Manufacturing Company, which had manufactured farm implements and steam traction engines across town. Holt established their eastern manufacturing branch there, under the name Holt Caterpillar Company‚Äîthe predecessor to Caterpillar Inc.. In the same year, Avery's first tractor was a huge model with a 12- by 18-inch bore and stroke. The competition included the 15-30 Model O Quincy tractor, made in 1911; the Fairbanks-Morse 15-25 of the same year and the 20-hp International Harvester Company Mogul of 1909. Unfortunately, their first tractor failed to perform, and they pulled it from the 1910 Winnipeg Tractor Demonstration. Broad line of products manufactured Avery (drawbar)- (belt pully) horsepower tractor. An advertisement for the Avery Company in Tractor and Gas Engine Review, January 1921. Its product line for 1921 included tractors, trucks, threshers, plows, motor cultivators, and other implements. In 1912, the entire Avery Company plant covered more than twenty-seven acres. The company, progressive for its time, established a dispensary on site that was staffed five hours each day by two doctors. It also started its own insurance company about the same time. The main factory building and the associated warehouses covered another six and a half acres. The sections of the plant were joined by a company-designed trolley system used to transport parts. At the time, it manufactured steam and gasoline traction engines, mounted steel water tanks, self-lift plows, farm wagons, corn planters, traction hauling wagons, traction steam shovels, threshing machinery and all required attachments, riding and walking cultivators, single and double row stalk cutters and gasoline tractors. At its height, it called itself \\"The Largest Tractor Company in the World\\" and employed 2,600 men, manufacturing eight different tractors along with motor cultivators and trucks. The company offered a broad line of tractors and engines, ranging from one-row cultivator to a huge tractor. =Truck manufacturing= Avery truck with cast steel rim wheels used by Standard Oil Company, circa 1917. Avery started building agricultural trucks in 1910. Early truck manufacturers were uncertain how to market their product and whether they should just be used to haul goods or should also be useful in the field. Avery described its truck as a 'gasoline farm wagon' and 'general farm power machine' for city, town, and country hauling. Their advertising suggested the farmer could use it to haul livestock, grain, hay, and other loads, as to pull plows, road graders, harrows, discs, binders, and other farm machinery, as well as loaded wagons. The truck weighed and featured a four- cylinder engine, open cab and chain drive. Its wheels had wooden spokes and rims, while the steel tires were x wide. Avery figured farmers could get the most use out of the machines during the harvest season. Their tractor trucks included a large belt pulley that could be attached to the front crank shaft, useful for powering grain separators and other belt-driven machines. Early models had cast steel wheels with holes. Wooden plugs were driven into the holes to provide added traction. When the wooden plugs wore down, the owner simply replaced them with new wooden plugs. Avery shipped products to most of the United States and some foreign countries. They opened branch offices in Omaha, Nebraska; Des Moines, Iowa; Kansas City, Missouri; Minneapolis, Minnesota; St. Louis, Missouri, Indianapolis, Indiana; Grand Forks, North Dakota; Fargo, North Dakota, Aberdeen, South Dakota; and Winnipeg, Canada. They had customers in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Russia, what was then Austria-Hungary, the Philippines, Portugal, China, Sweden, Cuba and Egypt. In 1912, Avery added and trucks with solid rubber tires. Closed cabs were added a year later, and in 1917 they introduced a cab-over-engine design featuring an enclosed chain drive. The style of Avery trucks became more conventional, but the new six-cylinder model introduced in 1921 didn't last long because within five years the company was bankrupt. =Track-type tractors gain favor= They introduced a locomotive style, double-under mounted steam traction engine to the market. However, by this time track-type tractors and a combination combine-harvester were becoming more popular over the large steel tire wheel tractor and the stationary threshing machine. Continuing to grow, the company in 1916 purchased a former plant of the Kingman Plow Co., and in 1917 they acquired the Davis Manufacturing Co. engine plant in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, enabling Avery to build its own engines. J. B. Bartholomew had for several years been President of the Bartholomew Company, which manufactured Glide automobiles in Peoria Heights. In 1920 he decided to bring the plant into the Avery Co. fold and it was utilized to manufacture trucks. Avery employed four thousand people by this point. When the agricultural depression of the early 1920s struck, Avery's varied product offerings were expensive, and when farmers defaulted on their notes held by Avery dealers, the company's liberal credit policy badly hurt its finances. Farmers also showed increasing preference for track-type farm implements, and Avery failed to innovate with new products. They built one track-type tractor named the \\"Trackrunner,\\" but were unsuccessful at perfecting it. Some machinery sold did not work as advertised, and Avery failed to fix the problems. Avery cut its work force in August 1920 by 90 per cent, to 250 workers. They replaced the tubular radiator style with an improved tubular cellular design, but it was not enough. Bankruptcy and receivership Lacking research and design resources and unable to manufacture competitive products, the company entered bankruptcy and went into receivership in 1923. One year later President J. B. Bartholomew died. Former officers of the bankrupt Avery company organized a new, smaller firm in late 1925 as the Avery Power Machinery Co., acquiring a large portion of the original plant in Peoria. They developed and manufactured a new line of advanced all-steel threshers and combine harvesters employing anti-friction bearings. They also manufactured parts for all of the previous Avery machines, for which there was still considerable demand. The competition for track-type farm equipment increased in 1925 when the Holt Manufacturing Co. and the C. L. Best Co. of San Leandro, California merged to form the Caterpillar Tractor Co. When wheat dropped to 25 cents a bushel in 1931, farmers could not afford new farm implements and the new Avery Power Machinery company could not pay its debts. Banks with an interest in the company placed a manager in charge in late 1931, who gradually liquidated the company's assets. As the Depression waned, the company was restarted in 1936 as the Avery Farm Machinery Co. It primarily manufactured combines, separators, and replacement combine cylinder teeth. Two years later, in 1938, it produced the Avery Ro-Trac tractor, which had an unusual front-axle design that could be converted from a narrow- to a wide-front tractor. It was the first Avery tractor in a dozen years, but this was its last tractor. World War II interrupted production again, and the company closed its doors for the last time. Collector value Avery tractors are considered very rare and are highly prized among collectors today. A large model 40-80 built from 1913-1920 in premier condition can fetch over $100,000 at auction.

No subspecies are currently recognized. Geographic range P. bairdi is found in the United States in the Big Bend region of western Texas, as well as in northern Mexico in the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Tamaulipas. Known to be elusive and hard to find in the wild. Etymology The specific name, bairdi, as well as several of the common names, are in honor of American zoologist Spencer Fullerton Baird.Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Pantherophis bairdi, p. 14). Description Head Adults of P. bairdi may reach in total length (body + tail). The dorsal color pattern consists of an orange-yellow to bright yellow, or a darker salmon ground color, overlaid with four stripes that run from the neck to the tail. The belly is generally gray to yellow, darkening near the tail. Diet The primary diet of P. bairdi consists of rodents, although they will also prey on birds. Juveniles often eat lizards. Behavior Baird's rat snake is typically more pleasantly tempered than other rat snake species. Reproduction P. bairdi is oviparous. Adult females may lay a clutch of up to 10 eggs that take about 3 months to hatch. Habitat P. bairdi prefers semi-arid, rocky habitats. Common names Baird's rat snake, Baird's ratsnake, Baird's pilot snake, Baird's Coluber, Great Bend rat snake. Taxonomy Pantherophis bairdi has sometimes been considered a subspecies of Pantherophis obsoletus, to which it is closely related. Pantherophis bairdi has often been placed in the genus Elaphe, but recent phylogenetic analyses have resulted in its transfer to the genus Pantherophis.Utiger U, Helfenberger N, Sch√§tti B, Schmidt C, Ruf M, Ziswiler V (2002). \\"Molecular Systematics and Phylogeny of Old and New World ratsnakes, Elaphe Auct., and related genera (Reptilia, Squamata, Colubridae)\\".

While completing her doctoral studies, between 2003 and 2004, Magnanti supplemented her income by working as a London call girl known by the working name Taro. Her diary, published as the anonymous blog Belle de Jour: Diary of a London Call Girl, became increasingly popular as speculation surrounded the identity of Belle de Jour. Remaining anonymous, Magnanti went on to have her experiences published as The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl in 2005 and The Further Adventures of a London Call Girl in 2006. Her first two books were UK top 10 best-sellers in the nonfiction hardback and nonfiction paperback lists. In 2007 Belle's blogs and books were adapted into a television programme, Secret Diary of a Call Girl starring Billie Piper as Belle, with the real name Hannah Baxter. In November 2009, fearing her real identity was about to come out, Magnanti revealed her real name and occupation as a child health scientist. She is honoured in BBC's 100 Women in 2013 and 2014. Early life Born in the United States to an Italian American father and Jewish American mother, Magnanti was born and grew up in Clearwater, Florida. She graduated from the private Clearwater Central Catholic High School where she was named a National Merit Scholar in 1992.Eric Deggans: Subject of Showtime's 'Secret Diary of a Call Girl' grew up in Florida . Tampa Bay Times, 1 April 2011 She entered university at the age of 16, going on to receive a B.S. in 1996 from Florida State University. Relocating to the United Kingdom, Magnanti studied for a master's degree in genetic epidemiology and PhD in forensic science from the University of Sheffield in England.Zo√´ Corbyn: Prostitution did not finance Belle de Jour's PhD at the website of Times Higher Education, 19 November 2009 Identity =Pseudonym= Magnanti's pseudonym was derived from the 1928 novel Belle de jour by Joseph Kessel and the 1967 film of the same name starring Catherine Deneuve, directed by Luis Bu√±uel. In the film, \\"Belle de Jour\\" is an expression translating literally as \\"daytime beauty\\", as Deneuve's character frequented the brothel during the daytime, when her husband was absent from home. The expression is a pun on the French phrase \\"belle de nuit\\", which translates as \\"lady of the night\\", i.e. a prostitute.AFP: 'Belle de Jour' scientist backed by boss.

Guesses as to who Belle was ranged from Rowan Pelling to Toby Young according to The Telegraph. In 2004 The Sunday Times featured a front-page headline incorrectly identifying Sarah Champion as the author of the blog based on erroneous textual analysis by Donald Foster. According to The Guardian a fellow British blogger guessed her identity in 2003 but kept it secret. He made a page on his blog containing the googlewhack of Belle de Jour and Brooke Magnanti that allowed him to see if anyone googled the two names. In 2009 he identified IP addresses originating from Associated Newspapers that had accessed the page at which point he contacted Magnanti to alert her. Around the same time tabloid reporters had been escorted from the hospital where she worked for breaking into her office. =Revelation of identity= On 15 November 2009, The Sunday Times revealed in an interview that the author's real name is Brooke Magnanti, who was 34 years of age at the time. The Guardians Paul Gallagher described it as the revelation of \\"one of the best kept literary secrets of the decade\\". The Daily Telegraphs Stephen Adams said it had been \\"the new millennium's equivalent of the 1980s' search for the golden hare\\". Such was the nature of the secret that Magnanti's colleagues did not know until one month before she went public, her publishers had been unaware of her true identity until the previous week and her parents found out on that weekend. After signing her first book deal and starting writing articles for newspapers, only two other people were aware of her identity, her agent Patrick Walsh and her accountant, who handled the financial transactions via a shell corporation.Ryan Hagen: A Few Questions for Belle de Jour, Call Girl and Scientist ‚Äì Freakonomics blog. Retrieved 21 November 2009 Magnanti commented that she had thought a former boyfriend was on the verge of outing her, and later reported him to the police for threats and harassment against her and her partner. Writing on her blog on the day of the revelation, Magnanti stated: A spokesperson for the University of Bristol stated, \\"This aspect of Dr Magnanti's past is not relevant to her current role at the university\\", while her publisher said, \\"It's a courageous decision for Belle de Jour to come forward with her true identity and we support her decision to do so\\". Career =Diary of a London Call Girl= Magnanti worked for 14 months as a ¬£300-an-hour prostitute called Taro for a London escort agency from 2003, after submitting her PhD thesis. She did so due to lack of funds before her viva voce at the University of Sheffield in 2003 and is estimated to have earned more than ¬£100,000 in that period. She had previously been a science blogger using her real name and started blogging about sex work under a pseudonym. Diary of a London Call Girl was voted Blog of the Year by The Guardian newspaper in 2003. Awards judge Bruce Sterling called it \\"Archly transgressive, anonymous hooker is definitely manipulating the blog medium, word by word, sentence by sentence far more effectively than any of her competitors ... She is in a league by herself as a blogger.\\" Shortly after receiving the award she signed with literary agency Conville and Walsh who negotiated a publishing deal with Weidenfeld & Nicolson. Reviews of the books compared her writing to the works of Martin Amis and Nick Hornby, and she frequently quotes from the poems of Philip Larkin. Themes of the blog and books include isolation and personae. \\"Solitude as much as sex propels these books ... Belle's prickly disbelief in any lasting togetherness picks up an almost existential heft.\\" She writes in Playing the Game \\"it's not all about the sex ‚Äì never has been ‚Äì it's about the heart of darkness.\\" =Later writing= Magnanti's publisher, Orion Books, printed her first two books as part of its \\"Non Fiction/Memoir\\" line. Her third book was classified as fiction and represents a fictional continuation from the first two. Her books have been published in the UK, US, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia, France, Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, Romania, Russia, and China. In 2016 her first thriller The Turning Tide was published in the UK. It attracted positive reviews, with The Guardian listing it among the best recent crime novels and The Times noting \\"Magnanti's writing is lively and entertaining. When her victims are laid out on that slab, her unspeakably detailed descriptions are good enough to put the wind up Patricia Cornwell.\\" From November 2005 until May 2006, Magnanti contributed a regular column in The Sunday Telegraph. Since her identity had been revealed she has written about UK libel laws and their effect on science for The Guardians website Comment Is Free. On 25 February 2010 Magnanti appeared on the BBC political affairs programme This Week to discuss the subject of sex education. She is also an occasional guest on The Book Show broadcast on Sky Arts and has spoken at a number of venues including The Sunday Times Oxford Literary Festival in conversation with India Knight. She has also spoken on internet and forensic identity as part of the Bristol Festival of Ideas and was a guest on the Stephen Fry 2011 series Fry's Planet Word. In 2012 Magnanti was selected as ambassador for the Inverness Whisky Festival and was ambassador for the festival's gin section in 2015. Magnanti, along with Tobias Hill, acted as a judge for Fleeting Magazine's 2012 Six-Word Short Story Prize. She was interviewed on Hardtalk on the BBC in October. Since 2012 she has been contributing blogger to The Daily Telegraph. =Scientist= Magnanti's PhD thesis, awarded from the University of Sheffield Department of Forensic Pathology, was entitled Macrobioinformatics: the application of informatics methods to records of human remains. It was submitted in September 2003 and the degree was awarded in 2004. After moving to London and while blogging as Belle de Jour she also worked as a computer programmer in cheminformatics at InforSense. She blogged about this career at Cosmas. Magnanti went on to work as a biostatistician in the Newcastle University Paediatric and Lifecourse Epidemiology Research Group (PLERG), researching a possible link between the occurrence of thyroid cancer in under-25s in NE England and radioiodine fallout exposure from Chernobyl in Ukraine. After her pseudonymous publishing career Magnanti was identified to be working as a research associate in developmental neurotoxicology and cancer epidemiology at the Bristol Initiative for Research of Child Health (BIRCH) at the University of Bristol. Specifically she was part of the EU-funded Henvinet consortium, researching the policies for assessing the risks of developmental neuropathology from exposure to organophosphates. She collaborated on several EU project policy documents regarding human developmental risks of environmental exposure to chlorpyrifos, phthalates, and DecaBDE and HBCD. =Activism= Brooke Magnanti talking about her book The Sex Myth at Leeds Skeptics In early 2012, Magnanti published a non-fiction popular science book under her real name entitled The Sex Myth. It covered topics in sexuality studies and sociological research in the effects of adult entertainment and sex work. Reviewing for The Observer Catherine Hakim wrote \\"Magnanti offers a pretty sharp analysis of sexual politics: who fabricates the myths and why, the role of both rightwing and leftwing media in building up moral panics, the vast sums obtained by the pressure groups that profit from them, and, more recently, too, by the pharmaceutical companies that plan to profit from newly invented sexual diseases.\\"The Sex Myth: Observer review.

The independent London newspaper the Camden New Journal highlighted Magnanti's criticism of the Lilith findings. In May 2016 Magnanti, alongside Paris Lees, was called to give evidence about sex work conditions in the UK to the Home Affairs Committee investigating prostitution laws in Britain. The resulting recommendations by the committee headed by Keith Vaz, released in July 2016, implemented the pair's suggestions to eliminate criminal records of those arrested for prostitution-related crimes. Sex worker nonprofits called the apparent U-turn decision \\"a stunning victory for sex workers and our demands for decriminalisation\\" and \\"a giant step forward for sex workers' rights in the UK.\\" =Secret Diary of a Call Girl= A television series loosely based on the first book was in development with Channel 4 in the UK, but eventually aired on ITV2 as Secret Diary of a Call Girl. The first series aired from 27 September 2007 to 15 November 2007 starring Billie Piper as Hannah Baxter (Belle).

The first Wakatomika was located along the Muskingum River, near present-day Dresden, Ohio. In August 1774, during Dunmore's War, Wakatomika and four other Shawnee villages in the area were destroyed by Virginia colonial militia in an expedition led by Angus McDonald.

This law has been substantially changed as of March 16, 2013, the effective date of the first-to-file provisions of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), although this procedure is still available in patent applications entitled to effective filing dates before this date. The pre-AIA law granted a one-year grace period from when the invention became known in certain ways to when an inventor had to file their patent application.Pre-AIA 35 USC 102(b) If, in the course of patent application examination, a patent examiner cites a reference that predates the filing date of the patent application by less than a year, an inventor may still get a US patent if they can swear back of the publication date of the reference. Procedure To effectively swear back of a reference, an inventor submits a declaration to the US patent office, with written evidence that shows they fully conceived of the invention before the effective date of the reference. They must also show they were diligent in either reducing the invention to practice or in filing a patent application. Documentary evidence must support all factual assertions in the swear back. A copy of a notebook page that describes the invention, signed by the inventor, dated, and preferably witnessed by a third party can serve as written evidence. A written declaration by a witness that attests to when the invention was conceived can also be adequate. Similar evidence may be used to support the assertion of diligence. It can be very difficult to demonstrate diligence. The inventor, for example, must work continuously on the invention. If the inventor works on another invention before the first one is reduced to practice, that destroys the continuity and the inventor is deemed to not have been sufficiently diligent to be entitled to a patent. Many other restrictions apply as well.

Introduced in 1992 as a lonely divorc√©e, she becomes besotted with married Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) while he tends her garden. She leaves in 1993 once her affair with Arthur is discovered by his wife Pauline (Wendy Richard). Storylines Christine is first seen in February 1992, as a client of Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) who is hiring himself out as a gardener. After Arthur advertises for a new gardening assistant, he is shocked when Christine arrives in Walford, enquiring about the job. She wants it for her son Jonathan (Jonny Lee Miller), but when he proves lazy and unreliable, an embarrassed Mrs Hewitt takes his place as Arthur's assistant. In May 1992, a phonecall from New Zealand brings news that Kenny Beale (Michael Attwell) has been in a car crash, so Arthur's wife Pauline (Wendy Richard) decides to go there to tend to her crippled brother. While Pauline is away, Christine becomes a regular visitor to Albert Square, causing a certain amount of gossip, and it is clear that she is becoming very fond of Arthur. Arthur is oblivious, but Pauline's brother, Pete Beale (Peter Dean) is more astute and he tries to remind Christine that Arthur is a married man. However, Christine manages to win him round and Pete starts taking her out for a while instead. In August, things come to a head when Christine actually makes a pass at Arthur. He turns her down and she disappears, sending him a letter and a photo conveying her feelings. Arthur visits her at her house, and tells her that he feels something for her too, but is married and loves his wife. They say goodbye and the matter seems to be over. When Pauline comes home, however, she learns all about Christine from gossips such as Dot Cotton (June Brown). She initially believes Arthur when he feigns innocence, but all that changes when she discovers Christine's letter and photo. A furious Pauline then visits Christine to discover the truth, and finds her to be a sad, lonely figure who drinks too much of an afternoon. Pauline is then persuaded to forgive and forget, but Arthur cannot resist one last rendezvous with Christine himself, which gives her renewed hope. Over the next few weeks, Arthur keeps finding excuses to drop in on Christine, until she tells him not to come unless he means business. On Christmas Eve, Arthur sneaks away from home to be with Christine and finally the inevitable happens and they end the night having sex together. The affair continues during 1993 with Arthur continuously running between Christine and Pauline. Christine becomes more needy and manipulative, cooking up absurd lies and a fake burglary to lure Arthur round, then hitting the bottle if he refuses to come. Kathy Beale's (Gillian Taylforth) decision to open the caf√© in the evenings as a bistro gives Christine an opportunity to see more of Arthur ‚Äî she applies to be the cook and gets the job. However, working in Walford is not enough for Christine, and she begins to make greater demands on Arthur, asking him to choose between her and Pauline. Arthur manages to put her off and begins having second thoughts about their affair, after which Christine's behaviour becomes more erratic. She begins stalking Arthur around the Square, drunkenly declaring her love for him, buying inappropriate gifts for his son Martin (Jon Peyton Price) and threatening to tell Pauline unless he tells her first. In September, under severe pressure, Arthur finally tells Pauline the truth, and tries to tell her that he wants her and not Christine. Hurt, embarrassed and angry, Pauline refuses to listen and throws him out, but not before hitting him on the head with a frying pan. This spells the end for Christine, as Arthur then decides he wants nothing more to do with her, and in October she disappears to face a lonely future, divorced by her husband Greg, (Robert Swann) and ditched by her lover. In December of the same year Christine sends a wreath to Pete Beale's funeral. The wreath is only seen by Dr Legg, (Leonard Fenton) and Ethel Skinner, (Gretchen Franklin). Ethel doesn't know who Christine is and Dr Legg is hesitant to tell her, but tells Ethel that Christine used to work in the Cafe. Creation and development Elizabeth Power was offered the role by one of the programme's producers, Leonard Lewis, for whom she'd worked with previously on Juliet Bravo and Softly, Softly.\\"Stepping out in comic style\\", TheNorthernEcho.

Power filmed her scenes for the five episodes and thought that would be the end of it; however, she was subsequently contacted by Leonard Lewis and asked to reprise the role.

Reception  The unlikely affair between Christine and Arthur was dubbed the 'Bonk of the Year' by tabloids in the British press. According to Power, director, Russell Mulcahy was a fan of EastEnders and while in Hollywood he used to get friends to video the Arthur and Mrs Hewitt scenes. It was due to his like of the storyline and characters that he cast Power and Treacher opposite one another again in the film Tale of the Mummy.

Life  He was employed by the Carl Zeiss Jena, who, on a suggestion by the German astronomer Max Wolf, started work on the first projection planetarium in 1912. This work was stopped by military needs during World War I, but resumed after the war. Bauersfeld completed the first planetarium, known as the Zeiss I model in 1923, and it was initially placed on the roof of a Zeiss building in the corporate headquarters town of Jena. This model projected 4,900 stars, and was limited to showing the sky only from Jena's latitude. Subsequently, Bauersfeld developed the Model 2 with 8,956 stars, and full latitude capability. Over a dozen were installed before World War II again suspended planetarium work. These inter-war planetariums were constructed in Berlin and D√ºsseldorf in Germany, as well as Rome, Paris, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York. The Zeiss I planetarium in Jena is also considered the first geodesic dome derived from the icosahedron, 26 years before Buckminster Fuller reinvented and popularized this design. Bauersfeld was awarded the Franklin Institute's Elliott Cresson Medal in 1933 and the Werner von Siemens Ring in 1941. Post-war, the Zeiss firm, like Germany, divided in two. Bauersfeld remained with the core firm in Jena, East Germany, where after 1953 he developed the ZKP-1 (Zeisskleinplanetarium, the Zeiss Small Planetarium #1). This was intended for small dome planetariums, and while it had latitude change capabilities, the operator had to turn a hand crank to accomplish this. The ZKP-2 added a motor for latitude change. Bauersfeld retired shortly after the ZKP-2 was introduced. He died on 28 October 1959 in Heidenheim an der Brenz.

By accurate estimating prevailing and emerging traffic conditions, this technology is expected to allow variable pricing, together with improved overall traffic management, including the provision of information in advanced to alert drivers about conditions ahead, and the prices being charged at that moment. The pilot results show overall prediction results above 85 percent of accuracy. Furthermore, when more data was available, at peak hours, average accuracy raised near or above 90 percent.

He is the designer of the award-winning games Cloud, Flow, Flower, and Journey, and is co-founder of Thatgamecompany. Chen is from Shanghai, where he earned a bachelor's degree in computer science with a minor in digital art and design. He moved to the United States, where he earned a master's degree from the University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division. While there he created Cloud and Flow, and met fellow student Kellee Santiago. After a brief period at Maxis working on Spore, he founded Thatgamecompany with Santiago and became the company's creative director. The company signed a three-game deal with Sony Computer Entertainment, and has sold Flow, Flower, and Journey through the PlayStation Network. As Chen was born in a culture other than the culture he lives in, he tries to make games that appeal universally to all people. His goal with his games is to help video games mature as a medium by making games that inspire emotional responses in the player that other games are lacking. Although he and Thatgamecompany can and have made more traditional games, he does not plan on commercially developing any of them, as he does not think that it fits with their goals as an independent video game developer. Biography Chen was born in Shanghai on October 8, 1981, and lived there until 2003. His parents were \\"a middle-class family\\". His father worked in the software development industry, having previously worked on \\"one of the earliest giant computers in China\\". Although Chen was interested in art and drawing as a young child, his father influenced him towards computers, entering him in programming contests from when he was 10 years old. He found himself interested in video games that he saw there, but was not as enthusiastic about programming. While a teenager, he had deep emotional experiences with games that he played, including The Legend of Sword and Fairy, which he ascribes to the fact that he was not as exposed to books, films, or life events that other people would have had those experiences with. These experiences drove him to try to create those types of feelings in games as an adult, when more emotional maturity had caused his \\"standards to rise\\" in what would move him in a game. It was during high school that he chose the English name Jenova after a character in Final Fantasy VII, wanting a name that would be unique anywhere he used it as there were \\"thousands of Jason Chens\\". He earned a degree in Computer Science & Engineering in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, which due to his background in computers he found \\"quite easy\\", but describes himself as spending much of his time there teaching himself digital art and animation, and later did a minor in digital art and design at Donghua University. Still interested in video games, he was involved in making three video games as part of a student group while in school. Upon graduating, he had trouble finding a job in the Chinese video game industry that combined his interests of \\"engineering, art, and design\\", and additionally felt that \\"very few games [had] actually achieved those qualities that would be interesting to an adult\\". He also considered working in digital animation for films. Chen went to the United States to earn a master's degree in the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California. Chen studied in the Interactive Media Program, a new division of the School of Cinematic Arts. His intention at the time was to use the degree to get the kind of job he wanted back in China. At USC, he became inspired when he went to the Game Developers Conference, where he positively compared the games he had made in college with the student work present at the Independent Games Festival portion of the conference. While at USC he met Kellee Santiago, another student in the same program, and the two decided to work together on games that would be outside of the mainstream. Their first game, which won a grant of twenty thousand dollars from USC to produce, was Cloud, released in 2005, which \\"focuses on a young hospital patient who soars in his mind despite being trapped indoors\\". The idea was partially based on himself, as when he was a child he was often hospitalized for asthma. It was designed as an attempt to \\"expand the spectrum of emotions video games evoke\\". At a student showcase at the Game Developers Conference, Chen and Santiago showed the game to a representative from Sony, John Hight, saying that it was the first game in the \\"Zen\\" genre. Hight was interested, though no deal was forthcoming. The game won the Best Student Philosophy award at the Slamdance Guerilla Games Competition and a Student Showcase award at the Independent Games Festival, and was showcased on Spike TV, G4TV, and CBS Sunday. Chen felt that the reason that Cloud had been so warmly received was because the emotions it sparked in players were different than any other game available at the time, and believed that it was his \\"calling\\" to make more games that changed what people saw video games as. Chen went on to do his master's thesis the following year in the concept of dynamic difficulty adjustment, where the game adjusts how it reacts to the player based on the past and present actions of that player. Chen illustrated his ideas with Flow, a Flash game made with Nicholas Clark. The game involves the player guiding an aquatic microorganism through various depths of the ocean, consuming other organisms and evolving in the process. It was released in March 2006; it received 100,000 downloads in its first two weeks and by July had been downloaded over 650,000 times. A PlayStation 3 version was announced in May 2006 as a downloadable game via the PlayStation Store, and was released in February 2007. A version for the PlayStation Portable, developed by SuperVillain Studios, was released in March 2008. Flow became the most downloaded game on the PlayStation Network in 2007, and won Best Downloadable Game at the Game Developers Choice Awards. After graduating, Chen and Santiago formed their own company, Thatgamecompany, in Los Angeles. They signed a deal with Sony for three PlayStation Store games. The PS3 version of Flow was the first, and while it was in development Chen worked for Maxis on the game Spore. Upon Flows release, Chen returned to Thatgamecompany and began working on their second game. =Thatgamecompany= The next game, Flower, was Chen and Thatgamecompany's \\"first game outside the safety net of academia\\". Chen was the creative director in charge of the game, while Santiago was the producer and Clark was the lead designer. The company ranged in size from six to nine people at varying stages of the game's development. Flower was intended by Chen to provoke positive emotions in the player, and to act as \\"an emotional shelter\\". Chen described the game as \\"an interactive poem exploring the tension between urban and nature\\". He decided on a \\"nature\\" theme early in the development process, saying that he \\"had this concept that every PlayStation is like a portal in your living room, it leads you to somewhere else. I thought; wouldn't it be nice if it was a portal that would allow you to be embraced by nature.\\" Chen designed the game around the idea that the primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience, and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. To make Flower have the \\"emotional spectrum\\" that he wanted, Chen looked at the development process as creating a work of art, rather than a \\"fun\\" game, which would not provoke the desired emotions. In 2008, during Flowers development, Chen was named to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT Technology Review Innovators Under 35 list, as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35. Flower was released to critical praise and awards. Chen and Thatgamecompany moved on to their next game, Journey. Journey was intended by Chen to focus on the element of communication and social interaction in video games. Since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals, in Journey Chen intended for the player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players, but not be able to communicate with them directly. Instead, players have to build relationships with each other through their actions, helping each other or leaving as they choose. Journey was released on the PlayStation Network on March 13, 2012, and has received critical acclaim. Chen also worked as creative director in the first mobile game of thatgamecompanySky which is popular and critically acclaimed. Influences and philosophy Chen plays a wide variety of video games, but he names his greatest influences as Katamari Damacy, Ico and Shadow of the Colossus. He also names Final Fantasy VII as an influence, and the game that he took his adopted name from. He personally plays games \\"competitively\\", including titles such as Street Fighter IV and StarCraft. He feels he has a competitive nature, which he has turned towards \\"winning\\" at being a game designer by creating games that are unlike what is in the market rather than towards creating competitive games. As he was raised in China and works in America, Chen feels that he cannot fully relate to either culture as a game designer. As such, instead of trying to make games that fit perfectly with one culture he tries to make games that tap into feelings that are universal and independent of culture. When Chen quit Maxis to re-join Thatgamecompany, he did so knowing that it would mean taking less pay and having a less stable career. He felt, though, that it was important to the industry and medium as a whole to create games that provoked different emotional responses in the player than just excitement or fear. While Chen is not opposed to making action games, and his company has made internal \\"exciting\\" games that were well received at Sony, he feels that there is no point to Thatgamecompany commercially producing games like that instead of working for existing game developers, as they would not be making anything new that justified the cost of remaining an independent studio. Similarly, Chen does not intend for Thatgamecompany to make \\"big budget blockbuster games\\", as the pressure on profits that entails would stifle the innovation that he wants Thatgamecompany to focus on. Chen believes that for video games to become a mature medium like film, the industry as a whole needs to create a wide range of emotional responses to their games, similar to how film has thriller, romance, and comedy genres based on the emotions they provoke. He feels that there are only three ways for video games to impact adults in the same way they do children: \\"intellectually, whereby the work reveals a new perspective about the world that you have not seen before,\\" by \\"emotionally touching someone,\\" and \\"by creating a social environment where the intellectual or emotional stimulation could happen from other people.\\" References External links *Chen's website *Chen's thesis *Thatgamecompany's website Chinese video game designers American video game designers Video game producers Thatgamecompany 1981 births Living people Businesspeople from Los Angeles Businesspeople from Shanghai Shanghai Jiao Tong University alumni Donghua University alumni USC Interactive Media & Games Division alumni Artists from Shanghai Independent video game developers ","title":"Jenova Chen"},{"id":"5775144","text":"The narrownose chimaera (Harriotta raleighana) is a longnose chimaera of the family Rhinochimaeridae, the longnose chimaeras, consisting of eight species belonging three genera. This species is found in temperate seas worldwide, at depths between 200 and 2,600 m. Its length is between 1.0 and 1.5 m, including a long, tapering snout and a long, filamentous tail.  Taxonomy  This species was first described by George Brown Goode and Tarleton Hoffman Bean in 1895. The genus Harriotta refers to Thomas Harriot and the species name references Sir Walter Raleigh.  Description  Narrownose chimaeras have elongate rostra, slender tails, large pectoral and pelvic fins, large eyes, and two dorsal fins, the first being preceded by a spine. They possess two pairs of non-replaceable tooth plates in the upper jaw and a one pair in the lower jaw.Didier, Dominique A. \\"Phylogeny and classification of extant Holocephali.\\" Biology of sharks and their relatives 4 (2004): 115-138. Male H. raleighana are estimated to reach 62.8 cm and female 75.8 cm at maturity, respectively.  Habitat  The narrownose chimaera is found off Nova Scotia and in much of the rest of the Atlantic Ocean, and in parts of the Pacific Ocean to depths of 3100 metres. Very little is known of their biology due to their deep water habitats.  Reproduction  Longnose chimaeras are members of the class Chondrichthyes, diverging from their closest relatives (sharks, rays, and skates) approximately 400 million years ago. Like many other Chondrichthyes, longnose chimaeras reproduce by laying eggs. Egg cases consist of a central chamber surrounded by a web-like structure. Female longnose chimaeras lay a pair of eggs several times per season.  Conservation status  The IUCN has classified this species as being of least concern. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the narrownose chimaera as \\"Not Threatened\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

Kalumburu Community is the northernmost settlement in Western Australia. According to the 2011 census, it has a population of 412 people50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. and is inhabited mostly by Aboriginal people from the Wunambal and Kwini language groups. Kalumburu Community is remote from any main roads  the nearest is the Gibb River Road, 270 km to the south via the Kalumburu Road. It was the site of a World War II airbase, which was attacked by Japanese planes in 1943. History In 1905, the Order of Saint Benedict (OSB) decided to establish a mission near the Drysdale River. The mission was established in 1908, 20 kilometres north-east of the present site, at Pago, near the southern end of Napier Broome Bay, by Benedictine monks from New Norcia. In 1937, water supply problems forced the missionaries to move to the present site at Kalumburu Pool, on the King Edward River. =World War II= Following the outbreak of World War II, the Australian government commissioned an airfield at the mission. After Japanese forces occupied the Dutch East Indies in 1942, Drysdale became a frontline Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base, acting as a staging post for Allied squadrons based further south. The airfield was a refuelling and ammunition depot for the RAAF anti-submarine aircraft operating between Darwin and Fremantle. On 19 February, the mission provided assistance to the crew and passengers of the merchant vessel Koolama, which had been attacked by Japanese planes. In February 1943, Allied signals intelligence suggested that Japanese aircraft would be built up in Timor for attacks on Darwin. Eight Beaufighters from No. 31 Squadron RAAF were despatched to Drysdale River, to prepare for a pre-emptive strike.http://www.aussieheritage.com.au/listings/wa/Kalumburu/KalumburuAirfield/20706 On 28 February, it was confirmed that the enemy aircraft had arrived at Penfui, near Kupang. An early morning strike destroyed 12 Japanese aircraft on the ground and damaged another 10. Two Beaufighters were damaged by Japanese fighter aircraft but returned to Drysdale River. On 27 September 1943, the base and settlement were attacked by 21 Japanese Kawasaki Ki-48 bombers, based at Kupang, Timor, with a fighter escort. The Superior of the mission, Father Thomas Gil O.S.B, aged 45 years, and five Aboriginals ranging from the age of 1 year to 45 years were killed. This included a mother and son. All victims were buried together on mission grounds, the Aboriginals on either side of Father Thomas, following the funeral at the damaged church. Many buildings at the mission were also destroyed or severely damaged during the raid. In April 1944, Flt Lt D. S. Askew, the commanding officer of No. 58 Operational Base Unit, reported 367 aircraft movements during that month, the busiest period since operations had begun. He also wrote: \\"Approximately 250 operational hours were flown from Drysdale resulting in approximately 60,000 lb of bombs being dropped on enemy territory\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20060821012044/http://peoplesvoice.gov.au/stories/wa/kalumburu/kalumburu_w.htm The military significance of the airfield declined once Truscott Airfield was constructed, about 32 km (20 mi) north, in 1944. =Post-war= In 1951, Drysdale River Mission was officially renamed Kalumburu. Management of the community was later taken over by Kalumburu Aboriginal Corporation, on behalf of the Kalumburu Community Council. The community retains strong links with the OSB, including a priest and several Benedictine nuns.Father Anscar McPhee publishes a book for Kalumburu heroes ABC Kimberley radio, 17 Aug 2011. =Medical services= Kalumburu is 568 km via a poor quality road to the nearest hospital. During the dry season, this takes about 12 hours. There is a small clinic staffed by two remote area nurses with a visiting Doctor once per week. This community has been extensively studied and published in regards to the Aboriginal Health (e.g. Trachoma and Kidney disease). In 2008 a new clinic was being built, in collaboration with the Australian Army and Western Australia Health. There is provision for a small dialysis unit, although staffing and equipment are yet to be finalized. The RFDS land on the Kalumburu strip to the north of the town. There is also the old Truscott Airbase which can be used in cases of emergency. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 412 people in Kalumburu. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 91.4% of the population. * 97.3% of people were born in Australia and 88.1% of people spoke only English at home. * The most common response for religion was Catholic at 89.5%.  Town planning  Kalumburu Layout Plan No.2 was prepared in accordance with State Planning Policy 3.2 Aboriginal Settlements. Layout Plan No.2 was endorsed by the community in 2004 and the WAPC in 2005. The layout plan map-set and background report can be viewed at Planning Western Australia official site.

It houses the Mus√©e de la L√©gion d'honneur (\\"Museum of the Legion of Honour\\") and is the seat of the L√©gion d'honneur, the highest French order of merit. The building is also known as the H√¥tel de Salm. It is located at 64 rue de Lille, next to the old Orsay railway station (now the Mus√©e d'Orsay) in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. History Construction of the original H√¥tel de Salm Diamond breast plaque of the L√©gion d'honneur The original H√¥tel de Salm was constructed between 1782 and 1787 by the architect Pierre Rousseau (1751‚Äì1810) for the German prince Frederick III, Prince of Salm-Kyrburg. The revolutionary government nationalised the building, and from 13 May 1804, it was renamed the \\"Palais de la L√©gion d'honneur\\" and became the seat of the newly created L√©gion d'honneur. The interior was remodeled for that purpose by Antoine- Fran√ßois Peyre, and new exterior sculptures were added by Jean Guillaume Moitte and Philippe-Laurent Roland. An additional building was added in 1866 along the then-new rue de Solf√©rino, but the palace was burned in 1871 by the Paris Commune. A replica was rebuilt soon afterwards under Anastase Mortier, with painters Jean-Paul Laurens and Th√©odore Maillot providing interior decoration. An additional building was added from 1922‚Äì1925 on rue de Bellechasse in order to house a museum of the L√©gion d'honneur. Influences The H√¥tel de Salm was a favorite of Thomas Jefferson, who singled it out as a model for the American public buildings of Washington, DC. He had observed its construction during his stay in Paris in 1784‚Äì1789, and his design for Monticello, his own estate, was based on it. The California Palace of the Legion of Honor, a three-quarter scale replica of the H√¥tel de Salm, was constructed in San Francisco in 1924; it houses a fine arts museum. In Haarlem in the Netherlands, the banker Henry Hope had his Villa Welgelegen built to resemble the H√¥tel de Salm. In Rochefort-en-Yvelines (near Paris), there is a larger-scale replica of the H√¥tel de Salm. It was built between 1899 and 1904 for the wealthy business magnate Jules Porg√®s by the architect Charles Mew√®s, and it is known as the Ch√¢teau Porg√®s de Rochefort-en-Yvelines; today, it is a golf club.
