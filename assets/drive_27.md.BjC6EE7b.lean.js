It has a surface area of approximately and is situated in Lehman Township, Jackson Township, and Plymouth Township. The lake is situated on Pikes Creek. It has a volume of approximately 3 billion gallons and is used as a water supply reservoir. As of 2013, it is inhabited by fifteen fish species. The reservoir is owned by the Pennsylvania-American Water Company, but shoreline fishing is permitted at designated spots. Hydrology, geography and geology The elevation of Pikes Creek Reservoir is above sea level. The reservoir is situated on Pikes Creek. It is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Harveys Lake. The lake is located approximately northwest of the city of Wilkes-Barre. Pikes Creek Reservoir has a surface area of . It has a typical volume of approximately three billion gallons. Pikes Creek Reservoir is in the vicinity of Pennsylvania Route 29. A Pennsylvania American Water representative has described Pikes Creek Reservoir as \\"a very good source, very good quality\\". Water quality tests are done on the reservoir's water on a daily basis by the company. History Pikes Creek Reservoir was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1183732. The reservoir is also known as Pike Creek Reservoir or Ceasetown Reservoir. Pikes Creek Reservoir existed by the 1930s. In around 1932, 80 percent of the reservoir's water supply became exhausted, causing water restrictions to be put in place in Wilkes-Barre. The reservoir was opened to fishing with some limitations in 1998. As of 2013, the Pennsylvania-American Water Company owns Pikes Creek Reservoir. In the spring of 2013, Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission biologists did a fish survey of the reservoir. The main purpose of the reservoir is as a supply of potable water. The Pennsylvania-American Water Company has a facility on the reservoir capable of processing 16 million gallons of water per day, but it normally processes around 9 million gallons. As of 2010, Pikes Creek Reservoir serves a total of 70,000 customers in 14 municipalities, from Shickshinny to Wilkes-Barre. The nearby Harveys Creek is used as an emergency backup water source during droughts, although, as of 2010, it has not been needed since around 2000. Biology In 2013, a total of fifteen fish species were observed in Pikes Creek Reservoir. Largemouth bass was the most common predatory fish, with 105 individuals long being caught. The most common fish species overall was bluegill; 106 bluegills were caught, with sizes ranging from . In addition to bluegills, the main panfish species in the reservoir were black crappies and yellow perch. A total of 56 black crappies measuring in length were caught, as were 43 yellow perch measuring in length. Walleyes were also common; 55 walleyes between in length were caught. Other fish species included white sucker (34 individuals caught), chain pickerel (32 individuals caught), brown bullhead (25 individuals caught), and yellow bullhead (20 individuals caught). Other species were less common in the reservoir, including smallmouth bass (ten individuals caught), channel catfish (three individuals caught), golden shiner (two individuals caught), green sunfish (one individual caught), and bluespotted sunfish (one individual caught). The second-heaviest reported yellow perch caught in 2009 was caught in Pikes Creek Reservoir; it was long and weighed .

After the Johnstown flood of 1936, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers undertook a study with the aim of redesigning Johnstown's infrastructure to permanently remove any future threat of serious flooding. Work began in August 1938 with extensive dredging and flood control measures. On November 27, 1943, Colonel Gilbert Van B. Wilkes, Chief of the Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District, told a Johnstown audience the flood problems had been effectively solved. The city's residents began to feel secure that any flooding issues had been resolved and even promoted the area as \\"flood free\\" for many years. However, the Corps of Engineers had designed the flood control measures for protection against a standard project flood; protection to the 500-year level was not economically viable. In 1974, the Corps issued a report titled \\"The Potential for Future Flooding in the Johnstown Area\\", which failed to grasp the attentions of town leaders and the people of Johnstown. On July 19, 1977, a deluge of rain hit the area around Johnstown during the night. Nearly 12 inches (300 mm) of rain fell in 24 hours when a thunderstorm stalled over the area, and six dams in the area over-topped and failed. The largest dam to fail was the Laurel Run Dam, releasing over 101 million gallons (382,000 m3) of water that poured through the village of Tanneryville, killing 41 people. The combination of the other five damsDam safety:Number of failures in 1977, Retrieved 2016-01-01 released another 27 million gallons (100,000 m3), not counting the water from rains. Well over 128 million gallons (485,000 m3) of water from the dams alone poured down the valley, and by dawn Johnstown was inundated with six feet of water. The channel improvements were designed to carry 81,500 cubic feet (2,300 m3) per second, but the 1977 flood discharge was measured as 115,000 feet (3,250 m3) per second.NOAA flood discharge, pg. 9, Retrieved 2016-01-01 Ron Shawley, executive director of Laurel Highland's Historical Village, returned to Johnstown on July 20 and stated \\"It was like somebody dropped an atomic bomb on Johnstown\\" and that \\"I questioned what kind of force it would take to do that.\\" History =Johnstown= A Swiss immigrant named Joseph Schantz started farming at the confluence of the Little Conemaugh River and the Stoneycreek River around 1794. He laid out plans for a town and chose the name Conemaugh after a Native American village that occupied the same site. The plan accounted for the fact that a new county named Cambria would be taken from Somerset County but lobbying for the new town to be the county seat failed as Ebensburg was chosen. The town was situated within the Conemaugh River sub-basin (Ohio River Basin)Ohio River Basin reference, Retrieved 2016-01-01 and was prone to flooding. =Surrounding area= After the flood of 1889, no significant flood measures were undertaken. In 1936, Congress was looking at flood control bills. During this time heavy snow run-off and three days of continuous rainfall caused the Saint Patrick's Day flood of 1936. On April 27, 1937, Congress passed sweeping flood control legislation and in 1938 work began. On November 27, 1943, the Johnstown Channel Improvement Project was completed, with 9.1 miles (14.6 km) of improvements that included the Conemaugh River, Stony Creek, and the Little Conemaugh River.1977 Johnstown area flood control, pg. 7-9, Retrieved 2016-01-01 =Dam failures= Laurel Run dam failure The Laurel Run Dam on Laurel Run was an old earthen dam owned by the Bethlehem Steel company and sold to the Johnstown Water Company. This dam had a 42.5-foot (13 m) high spillway, and when it failed about 101 million gallons (382,000 m3) of water was released. After the dam failed, water rushed through the Tanneryville neighborhood. The Sandy Run Dam, a 28-foot (8.5 m) high, a 63-year old earthen dam with a spillway owned by the Highland Water and Sewer Authority, released a little more than 18 million gallons of water. When the dam failed the flood waters entered the Conemaugh between St. Michael and South Fork at Ehrenfeld. The Salix Water Dam on Otto Run, owned by the Adams Township Water Authority, was a 25-foot (7.6 m) earthen dam that held 2 million gallons (7,600 m3) of water. When the dam failed, the flood waters ran into the South Fork Little Conemaugh River which joins the Conemaugh River in Sidman. The Cambria Slope Mine #33, on Sanders Run, had a spillway height of 32 feet (9.8 m) and was leased by the Bethlehem Mines Corporation, and held 7 million gallons (26,500 m3) of water. Sanders Run flows adjacent to and joins Howells Run, skirting Ebensburg draining into City Reservoir.

In a city that relied so heavily on the steel industry in its economy, the effects of this disaster would be felt for some years to come. The Bethlehem Steel Company had roots into the industry within Johnstown. As the company continued to face a decline in profits in the years after the flood, they looked to Johnstown for solutions. With continuous cutbacks, Johnstown had ranked as the area with the least profit made. Over 2,300 steel jobs were terminated in Johnstown as a part of cutbacks by CEO of Bethlehem Steel, Donald Trautlein.

It is located seventeen miles north of Cape Girardeau and is part of the Cape Girardeau-Jackson, MO-IL Metropolitan Statistical Area. Etymology Neely's Landing was named after Jacob Neely, who owned and operated a store and ferry at the landing in 1808. The landing was a stop for Mississippi River steam boats carrying passengers and freight on the Mississippi River. The name was given to the town because it was the name known to river boat pilots. The town has been locally referred to simply as Neelys and is often written without the apostrophe.State Historical Society of Missouri: Cape Girardeau County Place Names http://shs.umsystem.edu/manuscripts/ramsay/ramsay_cape_girardeau.html  History  The land around Neely's Landing was owned by John Hays in 1805. Hays operated a ferry known as Hay's Ferry. Jacob Neely started a ferry and store at the landing in 1808. By 1876, the town had 20 residents, and by 1898, the population had risen to 50. The first post office was established in 1860 by R. W. Harris. When the Frisco Railroad came through the town in 1904, the population had doubled due to the need for railroad workers. The Neely's Landing Quarry is located north of the town and extracts limestone. On October 27, 1869, a tragedy occurred at Neely's Landing when the steamboat The Stonewall, which was carrying 300 passengers and heavily laden with tons of cargo and 200 head of livestock, caught fire. The exact location of the disaster was known to local residents as the Devil‚Äôs Tea Table and was even mentioned by Mark Twain in his Life on the Mississippi. The Stonewall was traveling southbound on the Mississippi River near Neely's Landing, its destinations being Cape Girardeau, Memphis and New Orleans. The exact cause of the fire is not known, but reports stated that either a candle fell over on a bale of hay or a lantern had overturned or a match was dropped by accident by a passenger onto hay on the lower deck. By the time the fire was discovered, the fire had spread out of control. When the mate and assistant mates were unable to extinguish the fire, the pilot on orders by the captain turned the boat to shore just below the mouth of Indian Creek, but struck a sandbar in the river. The steamboat then turned with the north wind flaming the fire. The panicked passengers were caught between the flames and the icy cold water, with the Missouri shore only laying 150 feet away. Between 200 and 300 passengers and crew perished in the disaster from either drowning or burning. Local residents pulled bodies out of the water and wrote down the hair color, clothing type, sex and apparent age so families could identify them. Between 60 and 70 victims who were never claimed by relatives were buried in a mass grave on the nearby Cotter farm.

The reserve has a number of hikes and trails, archaeological sites with the Bloubos spruit flowing through the area. History Prehistory saw the area inhabited by stone age man who hunted in the area with the location claimed to have the highest concentration of identified Iron Age sites on the Witwatersrand with the discovery of artefacts dating back 250,000 years. The Sotho-Tswana peoples would later settle in the area in the 1400s and would leave the location around 1800 when possibly climate changes and the movement of more militant tribes into the area saw their departure to Botswana. Their lifestyle consisted of animal husbandry and the growing millet, sorghum and later maize imported into Africa by the Portuguese traders. Around 1850, Voorttrekker Sarel Marais bought land on a western portion of the Rietvlei farm part of which is the reserve today, and used it for grazing and peach farming. His descendants would eventually sell the farm in 1914 to the Quilliam family who used it for dairy farming and as a piggery. By 1939, the Quilliam family had sold the land to the City of Johannesburg. After the discovery of gold in the Witwatersrand, the shortage of water saw a proposal to build a dam in the northern part of the reserve. To be called the Vierfontein Dam, work ended on it as the Second Boer War broke out and all that remains across the spruit is the remains of a weir. After the war the proposal was found to be uneconomical and the Rand Water Board chose the Vaal Dam barrage as a better option. During the Second Boer War, the hills around the reserve were used by Boers in the defence of Johannesburg against the southern advance of the British forces under Lord Roberts from the direction of Vereeniging. In the late 1970s residents of the area petitioned the Johannesburg City Council to declare the area as nature reserve. The council asked the residents to form an association to assist the council in the proposed reserves management and was formed as the Klipriviersberg Nature Reserve Association and the nature reserve was proclaimed in 1984. Fauna and flora Large mammals such as Black Wildebeest, Blesbok, Springbok, Red Hartebeest and Zebra are found in the reserve with approximately 240 of these large animals. Also found are numerous small mammals. 215 species of bird life have been recorded in the reserve as well as snakes, geckos, lizards, skinks and terrapins. It is also a haven for insect life such as butterflies and spiders. There is said to be between 650‚Äî700 species of plants in the reserve. What has been catalogued are over 340 wild flowers, 67 tree and shrub types as well as 70 grasses species. Recreation The fenced reserve is open all year round from dawn to dusk. The ruins of Marais' farmhouse, wagon shelter and family cemetery can still be seen today. There is also nine trails to hike consisting of in total. To the north of the reserve is the Silent Pool, the result of a hole dug during the construction of the proposed dam. The reserve can be entered at two points: * The main entrance in Peggy Vera Road, Kibler Park. * Silent Pool entrance in from Frandalph Drive, Mondeor.

William R. Walker (April 14, 1830 ‚Äì March 11, 1905) was an American architect from Providence, Rhode Island, who was later the senior partner of William R. Walker & Son. Early life Major- General William Russell Walker was born on April 14, 1830, in a part of Seekonk, Massachusetts that is presently part of East Providence, Rhode Island, to Alfred and Huldah Walker. He attended the public schools, and graduated from the Seekonk Classical Seminary in 1846. For three years he was a builder's apprentice in Providence, and studied architectural drawing at Scholfield's Commercial College in his free time. In 1850 he went to Augusta, Georgia, but returned to Pawtucket the following year, where he would live for the rest of his life. In 1861 he was commissioned first lieutenant of Company E of the 1st Rhode Island Detached Militia. The regiment mustered out three months later in August.Grieve, Robert. An Illustrated History of Pawtucket, Central Falls, and Vicinity. 1897. Architectural career In 1864, Walker established himself as an architect in Providence's Merchants Bank Building, moving to the Reynolds Building (37 Weybosset) by 1871.Providence Directory. 1871. In 1874 his son, W. Howard Walker, entered the office as a student and draftsman.Greive, Robert and John P. Fernald. The Cotton Centennial, 1790-1890. 1891. Walker practiced alone until January 1876, when he made Thomas J. Gould, draftsman since 1868, partner in Walker & Gould.American Architect and Building News 16 Feb. 1884: 75. In about 1878, Walker & Gould moved into their new Vaughan Building, on Custom House Street. Walker & Gould was dissolved as of January 1881, and the Walkers formed a new firm, William R. Walker & Son. Gould established Gould & Angell with Frank W. Angell, another Walker draftsman. During the 1880s to 1890s, Walker & Son grew to become one of the state's largest firms. Walker continued in his position as senior partner until his death in 1905. His son (died 1922) and grandson (died 1936) each operated the firm until their deaths.Jordy, William H. and Christopher P. Monkhouse. Buildings on Paper: Rhode Island Architectural Drawings, 1825-1945. 1982. Personal life In 1852, Walker married Eliza B. Hall, who died in 1895. They had two children, George Clinton (1853-1883) and William Howard (1856-1922), the latter of whom was associated with him in his business. Walker was politically active. He was a member of the North Providence town council, as well as that of Pawtucket when it incorporated as an independent town, and served two terms in the Rhode Island general assembly. He was active in the state militia for twenty years, retiring with the rank of major-general. It was through his many political connections that Walker obtained so many public commissions throughout the state. Walker died on March 11, 1905. He is buried at Swan Point Cemetery.

Fronting on Interstate 10, it is freely open to the public Monday through Saturday from 9 am to 5 pm. The museum consists largely of trophies and awards that Zaharias accumulated during her career, as well as memorabilia, newspaper clippings, and photographs. The museum also functions as a visitor center for Beaumont. Money raised by the museum helps fund scholarships for female students at Lamar University. Described by George E. McLeod as \\"a big trophy case\\", the museum prominently features a silver cup trophy that Zaharias won at a meet in Chicago in 1932, as well as her three medals from the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The museum also showcases a set of her golf clubs. More of her trophies are on display at the Babe Zaharias Golf Course's clubhouse in Tampa, Florida. Born in Port Arthur in 1911, Zaharias was perhaps the world's premier female athlete from the 1930s to the 1950s; she won two gold medals and a silver medal at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and excelled in basketball, golf, and track and field. In basketball, she was a three-time All-American. She also competed in sports as diverse as billiards, bowling, diving, and roller skating. In 1950, Zaharias helped to found the Ladies Professional Golf Association along with her husband, the wrestler George Zaharias. The couple also founded the Babe Didrikson Zaharias Foundation, which continues to help fund cancer research and support women's athletics as well as the museum. In 1956, Babe Didrikson Zaharias died suddenly of colon cancer at the age of 45; she was buried in Beaumont, which honors her with an annual golf tournament in addition to the museum.

It was discovered on 21 December 1997, by Japanese amateur astronomer Naoto Sato at his Chichibu Observatory near Tokyo, central Japan. The S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 4.8 hours and possibly an elongated shape. It was named for the South Korean city of Gongju.  Orbit and classification  Gongju is a member of the Nysa family (), the largest asteroid family of the main belt, consisting of stony and carbonaceous subfamilies. The family, named after 44 Nysa, is located near the 3:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter, a depleted zone that separates the inner from the intermediate asteroid belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 2.0‚Äì2.9 AU once every 3 years and 10 months (1,394 days; semi-major axis of 2.44 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 3¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its observations as at ESO's La Silla Observatory in October 1989, more than 8 years prior to its official discovery observation at Chichibu.  Physical characteristics  Based on the Moving Object Catalog (MOC) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Gongju has a spectral type of a stony S-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In October 2012, a rotational lightcurve of Gongju was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer John Ruthroff at the Shadowbox Observatory in Indiana. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 4.829 hours with a high brightness amplitude of 0.80 magnitude, indicative of a non-spherical shape (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Gongju measures 4.675 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.353, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.21 and calculates a diameter of 5.04 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 13.8.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the South Korean city of Gongju, located in Chungcheongnam-do Province. It has a population of approximately 120,000 and was the capital of Baekje dynasty in the 5th century AD and the seat of the provincial government until 1932.

His paintings, sculptures, and installations are reflective of his experiences of racial and institutional power structures in the South and prompt viewers to consider social responsibility.  Early life  Juan Logan was born in Nashville, Tennessee, to John Louie Logan, a minister and founder of John Calvin Presbyterian Church, and Madge Sarah Jane Grier, an elementary school teacher. When his father became ill, the family moved from Nashville to his father's home town in Marion, North Carolina in 1949. John Louie Logan died later that year. Madge Grier remarried in 1950, and four years later the family moved to her birthplace, Belmont, North Carolina. Juan and his family moved into a new house built by his grandfather James W.W. Grier and several other family members. Logan's interest in art began in 1960 while attending Reid High School, the black high school in Belmont at the time. = Education = Growing up in a black farming community was critical to Logan's ability to see and create \\"things\\". The process of making objects was very important to his stepfather, as well as his grandfather James William Washington Grier. The family took pride in finding innovative solutions for creating objects instead of purchasing them, and stressed the importance of self-sufficiency. After graduating high school in 1964, Logan attended Howard University in Washington, D.C. His hope was to major in science like his older brother John, who had majored in chemistry. Logan began his academic career with the intention of focusing on biology with a specialization in microbiology. He came to realize that his interest was not in science, but in art. At the university, he was exposed to James A. Porter, James Wells, and Lois Mailou Jones, who influenced his creative development. After a brief stay at Howard, Logan moved on to Clark College (now Clark Atlanta University) to study art. Floyd Coleman was the chairman of the department, and was very supportive of Logan. \\"Floyd Coleman was the first artist I'd ever encountered who was really dealing with political issues in an in-your-face kind of way. His paintings provided me with the impetus to explore both social and political concerns.\\" Logan later realized he could do this through the use of color, image, symbol and metaphor, elements which remain a critical part of his work. After leaving Clark, Logan joined the US Air Force in 1967 and served as a jet engine mechanic active in the Vietnam War. His military experience was crucial to shaping his exploration of American social and political constructs in his artwork. A number of his paintings, including I Am Black and Black American Dream from the late 60s and early 70s, responded to that experience. Logan's choice to use the language of abstraction in these and subsequent works provided him with an opportunity to explore ideas more broadly than realism, in his opinion, provided. Logan received his MFA in 1998 from the Maryland Institute College of Art, Mount Royal School in Baltimore, where the focus of his studies was painting and mixed-media sculpture.  Career  In addition to creating his own work, Logan is the Conservation Manager at Vollis Simpson Whirligig Project, where he actively restored 31 large-scale sculptures created by artist Vollis Simpson for the city of Wilson, North Carolina. He is a retired professor of studio art at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. Logan was selected as one of the designers for the original iteration of the North Carolina Freedom Monument Project,North Carolina Freedom Monument Project a public park in Raleigh. He has had solo exhibitions including in New Orleans at the Ogden Museum of Southern Art; in Miami at N'Namdi Contemporary; in Greensboro, North Carolina at the Weatherspoon Art Museum; in Charlotte, North Carolina at the Gantt Center; in Duluth, Minnesota at Tweed Museum of Art; in Colorado at the Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art; in Washington D.C. at The World Bank; and in New York at the June Kelly Gallery. Logan was a 2001 Artist-in-Residence at the McColl Center for Art + Innovation in Charlotte, NC.20 years of Artists-In-Residence McColl Center His work is in many public and corporate collections such as Whitney Museum of American Art, Philadelphia Museum of Art, National Museum of African Art, Mint Museum of Art, Baltimore Museum of Art, and the Art in Embassies Program in Togo and South Africa. Logan was selected for support from many foundations including the Pollination Project for his interactive, traveling Waiting Project. Logan's work appeared in the exhibition REMIX at the Columbia Museum of Art in 2016.  Personal life  Logan currently resides in Belmont, North Carolina. He is married to curator Jonell Logan.

Early life  Moni was born to Muzaffar Ali (a divisional forest officer) and Jamila Khatun (a housewife). After attaining his BSc (Hons) and MSc in physics from the University of Dhaka with first class, Moni joined as a lecturer of theoretical physics at the same institution.  Career  = Sports = Moni did not continue his teaching profession for long and soon became deeply involved in sports at multiple levels in the mid-1970s. Moni had played cricket for local teams. He started contributing to the management and organisation of various sports like cricket, football, badminton, hockey, judo, table tennis and others. Being a supporter of the Mohammedan Sporting Club, he became a part of the club's management committee where he held different positions including the role of the vice-president. Moni and his fellow sports organisers in the 1970s and 1980s modernised the sports industry of Bangladesh. He along with others translated international rules, regulations and bylaws for the local context. This helped to build the foundations of Bangladesh cricket. Moni became a member of Bangladesh Cricket Board where he initially served as a joint secretary. He, with the help of a few other members of the board, started the annual Nirman School Cricket tournament. It was a success and has produced many star cricketers. Moni had served as the General Secretary of the Bangladesh Cricket Board during 1991‚Äì1997. As described by Bangladesh Cricket Board Director Ahmed Sajjadul Alam Bobby in his memorial article in The Daily Star, \\"There were a number of things that he did for Bangladesh's cricket but to me his landmark achievement was when he managed to install two Astroturfs for the Dhaka Cricket League. One was at the Abahani ground, while the other was at the Bangabandhu National Stadium.\\" \\"The sole intention behind that was that the 1997 ICC Trophy was going to be played on AstroTurf in Malaysia. So our players got two full seasons on those turfs and the result was phenomenal. We won the 1997 ICC Trophy from where our cricket never looked back. It's a legendary story now.\\" Also echoed in the ESPN Cricinfo website, \\"He was the board's general secretary from 1991 to 1996 and is one of the chief planners of Bangladesh's 1997 ICC Trophy campaign which they eventually won and by virtue qualified for their first World Cup appearance in 1999.\\" Moni was appointed as the convener of Bangladesh Cricket Board's Domestic Cricket Structure Review Body in 2007. He was later appointed as a Director of BCB during 2009‚Äì2012 and chaired the Local Game Development committee.  Death  Moni was diagnosed with cancer and other health issues towards the end of his life. He remained in the ICU of United Hospital in Dhaka in the last few weeks leading to his death on June 1, 2015 (as reported by his brother-in-law Zahiruddin Ahmed). A large number of sports and media personalities attended his funeral in Mohammedan Sporting Club.

VAH-3 was then designated as a Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) for the A3D for the Atlantic Fleet, inheriting a mix of aircraft from HATULANT including R4D-7s, P2V-3Bs, F9F-8Ts and A3D-2Tshttp://skaneateles.org/ChuckHuber/cerebralhush/USNavyHeavyAttack/page5.html (redesignated as TC-47K, P-2C, TF-9J and TA-3B in 1962). VAH-3 received its first A3J-1 Vigilantes in June 1961 (redesignated as A-5A in September 1962), and began a \\"sole site\\" Fleet Replacement Squadron role for the Vigilante for both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets concurrent with its existing Atlantic Fleet FRS role for the A3D-2 (redesignated as A-3Bs in September 1962) for the Atlantic Fleet VAH squadrons. VAH-3 also provided concurrent FRS training support for the A3D-2P (redesignated as RA-3B in 1962) for Heavy Photographic Squadron 61 (VAP-61) based at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida and the A3D-2Q (redesignated as EA-3B in 1962) training for Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 2 (VQ-2) based at Naval Station Rota, Spain. In December 1963, VAH-3 received its first RA-5C Vigilante aircraft and commenced training support for this conversion of the A-5A from a nuclear strike bomber to that of a high speed carrier-based tactical reconnaissance aircraft. With the graduation of the last A-3B Skywarrior class in January 1964, VAH-3 divested itself from A-3B, RA-3B, and EA-3B FRS responsibilities, transferring all Skywarrior training for both the Atlantic Fleet and Pacific Fleet to VAH-123 at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington until VAH-123's disestablishment in 1971. With FRS functions subsequently focused on RA-5C training for both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets, VAH-3 was redesignated as RVAH-3 in 1964. However, the squadron would continue to operate the TA-3B in support of RA-5C Vigilante training for Naval Flight Officers until RVAH-3's disestablishment in 1979. =RVAH-3= Following VAH-3's redesignation as RVAH-3 in 1964, the squadron was tasked with performing all RA-5C FRS functions for both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets at Naval Air Station Sanford. In this capacity, RVAH-3 provided initial, recurrent and transition training for Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers in the RA-5C through a combination of ground school, flight simulator events in operational flight trainers and weapon system trainers, and training syllabus flights in the RA-5C, as well as the TF-9J (later replaced by the TA-4F and A-4 SkyhawkTA-4J Skyhawk II ) for pilots and the TA-3B for Naval Flight Officers. Maintenance training for enlisted maintenance personnel and a small cohort of officers was conducted via the RA-5C Fleet Replacement Aircraft Maintenance Program (RA-5C FRAMP), collocated with RVAH-3 under the cognizance of a collocated Naval Air Maintenance Training Detachment. RVAH-3 would also provide training for those enlisted personnel outside of the aircraft maintenance specialties (e.g., photographers mate, photographic intelligenceman (later renamed intelligence specialist), yeoman, operations specialist, data systems technician, data processing technician, illustrator/draftsman) who would support the Integrated Operational Intelligence Centers, later renamed Carrier Intelligence Centers, aboard all aircraft carriers upon which the RA-5C and its associated RVAH squadrons would embark.http://rvahnavy.ning.com/photo/first-ioic Budget constraints of the Vietnam War required the Department of Defense to close several stateside air bases during the late 1960s, and it was under such pressures that Naval Air Station Sanford was identified for closure in 1968. As a result, RVAH-3 relocated in May 1968 to the former Turner Air Force Base, renamed Naval Air Station Albany, Georgia, joining Reconnaissance Attack Wing One (RECONTAKWING ONE) and other Fleet RVAH squadrons that would incrementally relocate to Naval Air Station Albany throughout that year.http://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-squadron-history.html RVAH-3 would remain at NAS Albany for six years, to include the end of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam. Post-Vietnam defense budget reductions again compelled the Department of Defense to close more stateside air bases, and NAS Albany was marked for closure in 1974. Once again, RVAH-3, RECONATKWING ONE and the Fleet RVAH squadrons relocated, this time to Naval Air Station Key West, Florida beginning in January 1974. RVAH-3 would continue to conduct RA-5C fleet replacement training at Naval Air Station Key West until August 1979. Attrition of airframes and the increasing maintenance and flight hour costs of the RA-5C in a constrained post-Vietnam defense budget environment forced the Navy to incrementally retire the RA-5C and sunset the RVAH community beginning in mid-1974. With the RA-5C was marked for retirement from the active Navy inventory, all RVAH squadrons to be disestablished by 1980. Although the Navy's light photographic squadron (VFP) community provided interim replacement for RVAH assets utilizing the RF-8G Crusader from 1978 until 1987, the Navy's tactical reconnaissance mission was eventually fully transferred to the fighter (VF) community to be performed by F-14 Tomcat aircraft equipped with the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System. RVAH-3 was subsequently disestablished at Naval Air Station Key West on 23 August 1979, following over 23 years of active naval service.

There are difficulties in identifying the names, territorial boundaries, and language groups of the Aboriginal peoples of South Australia, including poor record-keeping and deliberate obfuscation, so only a rough approximation can be given here. Its people The following groups' lands include at least partly South Australian territory which includes: Adnyamathanha, Akenta, Amarak, Bungandidj, Diyari, Erawirung, Kaurna, Kokatha Mula, Maralinga Tjarutja, Maraura, Mirning, Mulbarapa, Narungga, Ngaanyatjarra, Ngadjuri, Ngarrindjeri, Nukunu, Parnkalla, Peramangk, Pitjantjatjara, Ramindjeri, Spinifex people, Warki. Colonial intent The South Australia Act 1834 described the land as \\"waste\\" and \\"uninhabited\\", but unlike other colonies in Australia, the British settlement of South Australia did not assume the principle of terra nullius (Latin for nobody's land) when the colonists originally arrived. The Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia issued in February 1836 \\"Provided always that nothing in those our Letters Patent contained shall affect or be construed to affect the rights of any Aboriginal Natives of the said Province to the actual occupation or enjoyment in their own Persons or in the persons of their descendants of any lands there in now actually occupied or enjoyed by such Natives\\". The Proclamation of South Australia read out on Proclamation Day, the 28th of December 1836, at the founding of the permanent settlement that became Adelaide, granted Aboriginal people and British settlers equal protection and rights as British Subjects under the law.

He was also to give them a knowledge of Christian religion.'Moorhouse, Matthew (1813‚Äì1876)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/moorhouse-matthew-4239/text6843, published first in hardcopy 1974, accessed online 4 January 2016. Massacres There have been a number of documented conflicts that resulted in mass deaths of Aboriginal people throughout the continent, now sometimes referred to as \\"frontier wars\\". In South Australia, the government tried to strengthen laws in an attempt to avoid the violence that befell earlier Australian settlements, and Aboriginal people were declared British subjects and afforded the same privileges. However, the laws were rarely enforced, and as the frontiers of settlement spread, dispossessed Aboriginal people responded with aggression. In July 1840, there was a massacre of Europeans by Aboriginal men in South Australia, when about 26 shipwrecked passengers and crew members of the ship Maria were murdered. The ship had run aground somewhere in the southern Coorong and all aboard made it safely to shore. They were initially assisted by the Ngarrindjeri people, until a misunderstanding or disagreement led to the murders. A punitive expedition was mounted by Governor Gawler, who gave permission to execute up to three suspects without formal trial. Major O'Halloran carried out the order. In 1841, at least 30 Aboriginal people were killed in an incident known as the Rufus River Massacre, after a series of skirmishes in the Central Murray along the old Aboriginal route recently made into the overland stock route. A party of which included police and the SA Protector of Aborigines, Matthew Moorhouse, and overlanders bringing cattle to market in Adelaide from New South Wales, became involved in a clash with the local Maraura people. Although the location was and still is in New South Wales, not South Australia, the official party was sent out from Adelaide on the orders of the Governor of South Australia, the newly appointed George Grey. The traditional lands of the Maraura people stretched deep into South Australian territory.Burke H., Roberts A., Morrison M., Sullivan V., The River Murray and Mallee Aboriginal Corporation (2016), \\"The space of conflict: Aboriginal/European interactions and frontier violence on the western Central Murray, South Australia, 1830‚Äì41\\", Aboriginal History, 40: 145-179. In 1848, at least nine people of the Wattatonga clan (of either the Bungandidj people or Tanganekald peopleAccording to the ethnologist and anthropologist Norman Tindale, Wattatonga was the name used by the neighbouring Bungandidj people to refer to the Tanganekald people.) were allegedly murdered by the station owner James Brown in the Avenue Range Station massacre (near Guichen Bay on the state's Limestone Coast). Brown was subsequently charged with the crime, but the case was dropped by the Crown for lack of (European) witnesses. Christina Smith's source from the Wattatonga tribe refers to 11 people killed in this incident by two white men.Christina Smith, pp62, The Booandik Tribe of South Australian Aborigines: A Sketch of Their Habits, Customs, Legends, and Language, Spiller, 1880 In 1849 at least ten Nauo people were killed in retribution for the killing of two settlers and the theft of food, in the Waterloo Bay massacre at Elliston on the west coast of Eyre Peninsula. Settlements As Europeans spread across South Australia, a number of Christian missionaries set up mission stations to reach out to Aboriginal people. Many of these became Aboriginal towns and settlements in later years. Ernabella was established as a Presbyterian mission station for Aboriginal people in 1937, driven by medical doctor and Aboriginal rights campaigner Charles Duguid (then president of the Aborigines Protection League), and supported by the South Australian government. Stolen generations In 1909, the Protector of Aborigines in South Australia, William Garnet South, reportedly \\"lobbied for the power to remove Aboriginal children without a court hearing because the courts sometimes refused to accept that the children were neglected or destitute\\". South argued that \\"all children of mixed descent should be treated as neglected\\". His lobbying reportedly played a part in the enactment of the Aborigines Act 1911. This designated his position as the legal guardian of every Aboriginal child in South Australia, not only the so- called \\"half-castes\\". Following the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families and the publication of the Bringing them Home report (1995‚Äì1997), the parliament of the Northern Territory and the state parliaments of Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales passed formal apologies to the people affected. On 26 May 1998, the first \\"National Sorry Day\\" was held; reconciliation events were held nationally, and attended by a total of more than one million people. Mounting public pressure eventually caused Prime Minister John Howard to draft a motion of regret, passed in federal parliament in August 1999, which said that the Stolen Generation represented \\"the most blemished chapter in the history of this country.\\" Native title Despite the inequalities that transpired during the early years of European settlement, some areas of the state are now subject to native title of varying kinds and degrees. This ranges from freehold ownership to the right to access Crown Land in their former range. The Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Land Rights Act 1981 grants rights over about 10% of South Australia in the northwest of the state, including a former Aboriginal reserve and three cattle stations. Prominent individuals David Unaipon - Unaipon is a Ngarrindjeri man who appears on $50 note for his inventions and contributions to society. * Sir Douglas Nicholls - South Australia is the only state of Australia to have appointed an Aboriginal Governor of South Australia, Nicholls, who was appointed in December 1977. Nicholls was from the Yorta Yorta people of what is now northern Victoria. Modern Aboriginal life 21st century Aboriginal people live in South Australia in a number of settings ranging from complete integration to English-speaking culture to near-traditional life in traditional homelands speaking predominantly the pre-European languages. Some live in or loosely associate with Aboriginal communities based on former mission stations such as Pukatja (formerly Ernabella). Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands are now freehold Aboriginal land in the northwest of the state, with limited access to tourists and visitors, created by Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Land Rights Act 1981. The Kaurna language of the Adelaide Plains had become virtually extinct, but is now being revived and taught to children in Kaurna Aboriginal schools.

It is a grey-coloured shrub with crowded, hairy leaves and lilac- coloured flowers which are white inside. Description Eremophila congesta is an upright, densely branched shrub growing to a height of , with its branches and leaves covered with fine grey hairs. The branches are also rough due to the raised leaf bases. The leaves are crowded and erect so that they obscure the branches. They are also thick, linear in shape, mostly long, wide and have thickened edges. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on very short stalks. There are 5 lance-shaped, very hairy, green to red sepals, mostly long. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is purple, lilac or mauve and white inside with a few purple spots. The tube is mostly glabrous on the outside and filled with woolly hairs inside. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs mostly from August to September. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The type specimen was collected in 1958 by the plant illustrator, Nathaniel Henry Speck, about north of Wiluna. The specific epithet (congesta) is a Latin word meaning \\"collected\\", \\"dense\\" or \\"thick\\", referring to the crowded leaves of this species. Distribution and habitat This eremophila occurs in the Wiluna area in the Murchison biogeographic region where it grows on lateritic slopes on low hills and slopes, sometimes in dense colonies. Conservation status Eremophila congesta is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk. Use in horticulture The crowded, silvery-grey foliage and pale to deep lilac-coloured flowers are features of this eremophila. It has been propagated by grafting on to Myoporum and grows best in well-drained soils in a sunny position. It is drought resistant but sensitive to frost.

Anderson was convicted and temporarily suspended from playing professional tennis due to being found guilty of match fixing his first round match at the 2016 Latrobe City Traralgon ATP Challenger. Anderson is best known for winning the 2016 Australian Open ‚Äì Boys' Singles title over Jurabek Karimov.  Tennis career  Anderson made his professional debut at the age of 14 in March 2013 when he received a wildcard entry into an Australian futures tournament in his home state of Queensland. He would lose in the first round of both the singles and doubles tournaments. Anderson secured his first ranking point in September 2013 when he defeated Jay Andrijic in the first round of an Australian futures tournament held in Cairns. He continued to improve his ranking through 2014 and 2015 with several wins spread across the challengers tour and the futures circuit. = 2016 = To begin 2016, Anderson received a qualifying wildcard into his hometown tournament ‚Äì the Brisbane International. He would record two upset victories from a set down over the eighth seed Dennis Novikov and the fourth seed Tim Smyczek to qualify for his first ever ATP main draw tournament at the age of 17. He faced Croatian Ivan Dodig in the first round, losing 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì2. Anderson was then given a wildcards into the 2016 Australian Open men's qualifying tournament and the junior boys' competition. He was lost in the second round of qualifying tournament but went on to win the junior singles title with a three set win over Uzbekistan's Jurabek Karimov in the final. This was Anderson's first junior grand slam title. Anderson didn't play again until May where he was eliminated in round one of qualifying for Busan and Seoul Challengers. Anderson had a further 4 months off for hip surgery returning to the ITF circuit in September. In October, Anderson was given a wildcard into the Traralgon Challenger, he lost in round 2 to John-Patrick Smith. Anderson ended the year with an ATP ranking of 736.  Match-fixing scandal  On 5 January 2017, Anderson was charged with match-fixing his first round match at the 2016 Latrobe City Traralgon ATP Challenger in October 2016. Anderson was approached to tank the first set of his first round match against Australian Harrison Lombe. He lost the first set 4‚Äì6, but won the next two 6‚Äì0, 6‚Äì2. In May 2017, Anderson pleaded guilty to the match-fixing charge and was fined $500 by Latrobe Valley Magistrates Court, Victoria. Anderson remains suspended (since February 2017) until the Tennis Integrity Unit investigations, and the independent Anti-Corruption Hearing process that will follow, have concluded. . In September 21 2018, Anderson was convicted of tennis match-fixing charges. The Independent Hearing Officer ruled that 19 months provisional suspension already served by the player was full and final sanction for breaches of the Tennis Anti-Corruption Program. The disciplinary case against Anderson was adjudicated by the independent Anti-Corruption Hearing Officer Prof Richard H. McLaren, following an investigation by the Tennis Integrity Unit. Having found the player guilty of two breaches of the TACP, Professor McLaren ruled that the 19 months suspension that he was serving since being provisionally suspended in February 2017, would be a full and final disciplinary sanction. No further period of exclusion or fine was imposed, meaning that Anderson would be eligible to return to playing professional tennis. However due to persistent injuries he had to retire and now works as a performance coach for the tennis organization, Lifetime tennis.

Grace Farms is owned and operated by Grace Farms Foundation, which supports initiatives in the areas of nature, arts, justice, community, and faith, and encourages participation locally and globally. To realize its vision, Grace Farms Foundation set out to create a building nestled into the existing habitat that would enable visitors to experience nature, encounter the arts, pursue justice, foster community, and explore faith. The River building, designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning, Japanese architecture firm SANAA, is a part of the landscape without drawing attention to itself. Under the continuous roof are five transparent glass-enclosed volumes that can host a variety of activities and events, while maintaining a constant sense of the surrounding environment. The areas of the River building are: the Sanctuary, a 700-seat amphitheater; the library, a staffed library with resources related Grace Farms Foundation's initiatives; the Commons, a community gathering space with 18-foot-long tables; the Pavilion; a welcome reception and conversation space with tea service; and the Court, a partially below-grade recreational and performance space. Approximately 77 of Grace Farms' 80 acres are being preserved in perpetuity as open meadows, woods, wetlands, and ponds. Grace Farms is a place for meaningful interaction and a platform for creative minds, leaders, and organizations to collaborate. The site is open to the public six days a week, allowing people to enjoy a diverse range of structured and unstructured programming, including: special performances; lectures; community dinners; year-round recreational activities; and walking trails. Permanent contemporary art installations by Thomas Demand, Olafur Eliasson, Teresita Fern√°ndez, Beatriz Milhazes, and Susan Philipsz are located around Grace Farms. Architecture Grace Farms, 700 seat amphitheater, viewed from the outside Chairs at Grace Farms, New Canaan, CT Opened in 2015, the River building was designed by the Japanese architectural firm SANAA, helmed by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa. The porous design of Grace Farms and the River building was meant to inspire and break down barriers between people. Natural light flows through more than 200 floor-to-ceiling glass panels in the River building, generating 360-degree views of the landscape in the changing seasons. The undulating pathways under a curvilinear roof follow the flow and elevation of the land. The River building has been honored nationally and internationally with numerous prestigious design awards. Grace Farms consists of the 48-acre former Windsome Farm, an equestrian facility, and an adjacent 27-acre parcel, which were bought between 2008 and 2009 by the Grace Farms Foundation. An additional five acres were later purchased. The property still features many of the equestrian farm's fences and buildings, including two long barns that have been turned into the welcome center and offices.

Grace Farms Foundation supports not-for-profits, government agencies, and quasi-governmental agencies on the front lines of service by offering access to space at Grace Farms. The River building and West Barn are available to grantees for professional programs, strategic meetings, trainings, capacity-building programs, and workshops. Grantees become partners in the Foundation's endeavor to collaborate in new and fruitful ways, including access to Foundation staff, networking events, and convenings. Dozens of organizations utilize space grants annually. For example, Grace Community Church occupies space at Grace Farms, and hosts a coffee and bagels gathering, followed by a service, on Sunday mornings. Arts for Healing, an organization dedicated to providing music and art therapy for individuals with emotional, physical, developmental, and social needs, also hosts workshops in the barn.

They were built from 1886 to 1963. It is also known as Mackay Court House and Mackay Police Station. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The site has been associated with the police and judiciary in Mackay since the 1860s. Although buildings were erected and removed during the 19th and 20th centuries as the site developed, the major buildings remain and include the police station, built as a court house in 1886, the current court house, built in 1938, and two brick police residences from 1936 to 1937. A 1960s watch house and keeper's residence are also on this site. The town of Mackay is named for John Mackay who entered the valley of the Pioneer River in 1860 and established a pastoral run there in the following year. In 1862 a settlement was begun on the south bank of the river and by 1863, the township had been surveyed and the first lots of land sold. It was gazetted as a port of entry and a customs house was opened. The town prospered as a port and as a commercial and administrative centre, drawing business from nearby pastoral holdings and the sugar cane plantations being developed along the river. There were 2 police constables in Mackay by late 1863. 1864 was the year in which a centralised police force under a Commissioner was inaugurated by Act of Parliament. It replaced a system of police districts where constables were under the direction of local magistrates and marked the beginning of a modern police force in Queensland. The government faced the problem of policing a huge area with a scattered population on a limited budget. Transport also posed problems, especially before the development of reliable roads and a railway network. The situation was addressed by instituting a system of regional courts served by visiting magistrates or judges and which had police offices, accommodation and lock-up facilities on the same site. The first report of the Commissioner of Police in 1865 recommended cutting costs and improving efficiency by combining police and judiciary functions in the same building. Because police travelled on horseback, the provision of stables and a paddock for police horses was necessary, so that police reserves for all these purposes were gazetted in major towns. Business district of Mackay, 1868 (the court house is the low timber building on the far left) A police watch house was built in Mackay in 1865 at the northern end of the current site and a Police Magistrate was appointed to serve the district. In 1872 a simple timber courthouse with a shingled roof was constructed. It was built near the Customs House rather than the police facilities and was inadequate from the beginning. A new courthouse was built in 1873 to the south of the lock-up and was soon extended, reflecting the speed with which the area was developing. A police station was constructed in 1878‚Äì1879 comprising cells and barracks. The 1880s saw an expansion in police numbers and in court cases as the Queensland economy enjoyed a boom and people poured into the colony. Police numbers were expanded and police and judiciary facilities constructed at such a pace that it became difficult to obtain suitably qualified contractors. The sugar industry was also booming and Mackay was amongst those regional centres where substantial new court houses were erected. In 1884 contracts for a new court house were prepared following the construction of new police stables and lock- up keeper's quarters. Court House (now Police Station), Mackay, c 1890 The new court house was designed by noted architect John James Clark, who was at the time Queensland Colonial Architect. Clark was born and trained in Liverpool, England. He arrived in Melbourne in 1853 and won a number of architectural competitions, his success in such competitions being a feature of his career. He designed some major public buildings in Melbourne, including the Treasury. He moved to Sydney in 1881 and in 1883 had become Queensland Colonial Architect. Although he left the position in 1885, he was responsible for some important public buildings including courthouses at Charters Towers, Rockhampton and Warwick. They and the Mackay court house were designed in the classical revival style thought appropriate for public buildings intended to convey a sense of stability and dignity, particularly a court house which represented the power of the law. The contractor for the work was Denis Kelleher and the cost on completion, including a strong room and furniture, was . The court house was a single storey building with rooms extended to each side of the front entrance containing barristers and witnesses' rooms and which were later extended by one room on each side. Behind the bench were rooms for the judge, police magistrates, Clerk of Petty Sessions and Jury. It was opened on 27 May 1886 and the first local sitting of the Supreme Court was held on 15 June 1886. A new gaol at North Mackay was completed in 1888 and facilities at the police complex and court complex improved with quarters for the police sergeant proposed in 1889 and police quarters in 1896. Although suffering a devastating cyclone in 1918, Mackay enjoyed a period of substantial growth through the 1920s and 1930s. It was the fastest growing town in Queensland, its population doubling between 1920 and 1940. This was largely because its connection to the railway system in 1924 improved access to markets and reduced transport costs, thus boosting not only the sugar industry but the developing dairy and tourist industries. The growth of the region was supported by local Member and Premier of Queensland William Forgan Smith and important improvements were made to the infrastructure of the town and harbour. Although Mackay enjoyed prosperity, the country as a whole endured widespread unemployment during the Depression years and extensive public works programs were put in place to alleviate this. New police residences were designed in 1935. The inspector's residence was built in 1936 and the watch house keeper's quarters in 1937, the difference in designation a subtle reflection of rank, although the buildings are very similar. They are unusual in that they are constructed of brick, although this may have been connected with the availability of good local bricks. They have the short passage and asymmetrical room plan typical of 1930s houses in the south, but which was modern for Mackay where many houses of a similar size were still built with central passage layouts. The residences are of a better quality than comparable police residences in other regional centres and represent a dramatic improvement from early police accommodation which was often cramped and inadequate. The size and quality of these ancillary buildings reflects not only the prestige accorded to these officers, but the prosperity of Mackay and the importance of its court and police station to the region. The next phase of the upgrading of the police and judicial complex was the construction of a large and handsome court house to replace the 19th-century court house which had long been inadequate. At the time Andrew Baxter Leven was Queensland Government Architect. Leven was trained in Scotland and arrived in Queensland in 1911, working in Queensland and in New South Wales until 1914 when he became a draughtsman in the Public Works Department. By 1923 he was Assistant Architect and Chief Architect between 1933 and 1951. For 22 years he was the government representative on the Board of Architects, being Chairman for the last ten years. His office was responsible for the design of a number of public buildings in the Georgian Revival style. The Mackay Court House is amongst the grandest of these buildings with handsome internal detailing including panelled offices. The Court was also designed to accommodate other important government functions such as the office of the Lands Commissioner. The foundation stone was laid on 31 March 1938 by Premier Forgan Smith. The new court house addressed Victoria Street where the first police lock-up had been and thus provided the main street with an imposing public building. The old court house became a police station after the court moved to its new premises effecting a reversal of zones of usage across the complex. It underwent additions and modifications for this purpose in 1940‚Äì1941, which extended the rear and created an upper level to part of the building to provide accommodation and a recreation room. Plans were drawn in 1961 for a new cell block and facilities by Architect in Association Colin Tesch and the new watch house was constructed in 1962‚Äì1963 at a cost of . It is designed in the International Modernist style developed in Europe about twenty years before, which makes this a late example, though perhaps not in the local context. It was built as part of a surge of post-war development in response to growth in the population and economy and following the lifting of restrictions imposed on building during and immediately after World War II. A new watch house keeper's residence, costing , was built adjoining the existing residence at the same time. In 1989 the demolition of the police station was proposed, but the people of Mackay strongly supported retention of the building, which underwent refurbishment in 1990‚Äì1991 as did the 1938 Court House. A large new police building on site includes a watch house, the old one being used now mainly for storage.  Description  The court house and police complex is situated in the central business district of Mackay on the corner of Victoria and Brisbane Streets. = Police station (former court house) = The Police Station (former Court House) is a classical revival building of rendered brick scribed to resemble stonework and is set well back from the street. The majority of the building rises to 2 storeys and the roof is clad with corrugated fibrous cement sheeting. The street entrance features an arcaded Tuscan order portico with 3 bays separated by square pilasters rising through 2 stories to the triangular pediment, which has a circular louvred vent in its centre. Three square windows are located in the spandrel over the arches, each with a moulded frame all around. This entrance is flanked by single storey wings which continue the arcaded effect with arched windows, now filled with glass louvres. The windows in the upper storey and the side windows and porches on the lower storeys are shaded by sun hoods on cast iron brackets. Windows were double hung and timber framed: some of these have been replaced. There is a tall brick chimney set back from each side of the entrance serving the corner fireplaces in the former female witnesses room and barristers room. A third chimney rises at the rear. Internally, the courtroom space is now occupied by offices although the ground floor plan is actually little changed. = Court house = The court house is a two-storey Georgian Revival building constructed of face brick with rendered detail. It has two hipped roof bays flanking a parapeted Tuscan giant order colonnade, with paired cement rendered concrete columns and a wrought iron balustrade. The rear elevation also has a two-storey verandah supported on Tuscan order columns with iron balustrading between. The high hipped main roof is clad in fibrous cement tiles and is topped by a fleche centred over an octagonal well in the first floor vestibule. The Brisbane Street elevation has a pedimented parapet with a circular louvred vent set in the gable. The building has multiple paned sash windows which are shaded by sun hoods on the lower floor. The interiors are well preserved and the entry and stair halls and the vestibule are panelled with polished silky oak, the floor being finished with coloured terrazzo. = Police residences = The police residences are a pair of brick bungalows prominently sited fronting Brisbane Street. They have hipped roofs; that of the Inspector's Residence being clad in corrugated iron and that of the keeper's residence in corrugated fibrous cement sheeting. Each has a projecting gabled room to the front with a bay window under a strongly defined gable end. Although such gables are a feature of this style, they visually echo the triangular pediment of the police station which they serve. The front entrance is from a small verandah with timber balustrading which is approached by low timber steps. The windows are paired casements. The houses are not identical although similar in form, and the floor plans differ, presumably to suit the use of the first tenants. The interiors still reflect the era in which they were built, although the inspector's house has been fitted out as an office. Both houses have hardwood floors, plastered walls and fibrous plaster ceilings with decorative mouldings. = Watch house = The watch house is 2 storey, rectangular in plan and is constructed of brick and patterned concrete blocks to an asymmetrical but balanced design. The main floor is elevated with undercroft car parking. Both levels are now used principally for storage. The northern wing is of face brick featuring boldly framed deep set square windows and houses a staircase, records and storage. It is linked to the main block by a lower, recessed section with a textured wall finish and slot glazing. The main block is screened by patterned Besser blocks. The interior is severely utilitarian in finish. The watch keeper's residence is an extension of the 1935 keeper's residence and is similar in style on the exterior although the interior is more typical of its era and has an open plan layout.  Heritage listing  Mackay Court House and Police Station was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The complex which contains the current and former court houses, police residences and other police buildings, illustrates several patterns important in understanding the development of Queensland. As the site of a court and police station which developed through the late 19th and 20th centuries in response to changes to legislation, population and the administration of justice, it illustrates the way in which the legal system was implemented and administered. This is individually and collectively reflected in the buildings on site. The quality of the buildings, in design and material, also illustrates the importance of Mackay as a regional centre, both in the 1880s when sugar was booming, and during the period between the World Wars when Mackay was the fastest growing town in Queensland. The 1930s buildings are major examples of buildings constructed as part of the public works program undertaken by the Labor government during the Depression to alleviate unemployment. As major public works, the court houses are important in the life and work of government architects JJ Clark and AB Leven, both architects of distinction, who made an important contribution to the development of architecture in Queensland. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The buildings on the site and the relationship between them, the fabric and design of the buildings and the extensive documentation connected with them are important because of their potential to provide information on both the city and the law which served it. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The two court houses in particular are fine examples of public buildings of their era and are excellent representatives of the high quality work produced by the office of the government architect. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. As substantial and prominently sited public buildings, of architectural merit, they make an important visual contribution to the character of Mackay. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The court house and police complex have had a long connection with the people of Mackay and the surrounding district as the focus for the administration of justice in the area.

It is classified in the oofamily Spheroolithidae, and was probably laid by an ornithopod dinosaur. Distribution Guegoolithus is known from the Early Cretaceous of Spain. It is common in the Maestrazgo Basin, dating to the lower Barremian. Fossils have been found in the Blesa, El Castellar, Camarillas, and Mirambel Formations. It has also been found at the slightly older El Hocajo, a part of the Cameros Basin which dates to the Valanginian or Hauterivian ages, up to 7 million years older than the Maestrazgo specimens. Description Guegoolithus is known from over 400 fossil eggshell fragments, but no complete eggs have been found. They are very thin for spheroolithids, ranging from 0.42 to 1.5 mm in thickness.Moreno-Azanza, M., J.I. Canudo, and J.M. Gasca. (2014) \\"Spheroolithid eggshells in the Lower Cretaceous of Europe. Implications for eggshell evolution in ornithischian dinosaurs.\\" Cretaceous Research 51: 75‚Äì87. The wide range of eggshell thickness is partially due to erosion on the inner and outer surfaces of the fragments.Amo Sanjuan, O., Canudo, J.I., Cuenca- Bescos, G. (2000) \\"First record of elongatoolithid eggshells from the Lower Barremian (Lower Cretaceous) of Europe (Cuesta Corrales 2, Galve Basin, Teruel, Spain).\\" In: Bravo, A.M., Reyes, T. (Eds.), First International symposium on Dinosaur eggs and babies. Extended abstracts. Isona i Conca Della, pp. 7‚Äì14. The size and shape of the complete egg is unknown. Like other types of dinosaur eggs, the shell of Guegoolithus is made up of tightly packed crystalline units. The shell is single-layered, but the shell units appear to be have two distinct layers because they exhibit a radiating acicular crystal structure near the base (the inner edge of the eggshell), but form a tabular ultrastructure on the upper third of the eggshell. The surface of the eggshell exhibits sagenotuberculate ornamentation (nodes and ridges forming a net-like pattern, with pits and grooves in betweenCarpenter, K. 1999. Eggs, Nests, and Baby Dinosaurs: A Look at Dinosaur Reproduction (Life of the Past). Indiana University Press, Bloomington, Indiana. ). It has a prolatocanaliculate pore system, similar to Spheroolithus, which means that the pores are irregularly shaped and vary in width along their length. Also like Spheroolithus, it has a prolatospherulitic morphotype, with eggshell units fused together and horizontal growth lines on the lower portion of the eggshell. Guegoolithus has much more prominent ornamentation that Spheroolithus, and a thinner eggshell than most Spheroolithus species. History Guegoolithus was first discovered in 2000 by Spanish paleontologists Olga Amo-Sanju√°n, Jos√© Ignacio Canudo, and Gloria Cuenca-Besc√≥s, though it was described as an oospecies of Macroolithus. In 2008, a paper suggested that \\"M.\\" turolensis be used as an index fossil for fossil sites in the Sistema Ib√©rico, because they are easily identifiable and always found in rocks of Hauterivian-Barremian age.M. Moreno-Azanza, J. M. Gasca, and J. I. Canudo. (2008) \\" Macroolithus turolensis como f√≥sil guia para el Hauteriviense superior-Barremiense basal de Teruel\\" In J I Ruiz-Ome√±aca, L Pi√±uela and J C Garc√≠a-Ramos (eds), XXIV Jornadas de la Sociedad Espa√±ola de Paleontolog√≠a, 15‚Äì18 October 2008, Museo del Jur√°sico de Asturias (MUJA), Colunga, Spain, Libro de Res√∫menes 43‚Äì44. An analysis in 2014 by Miguel Moreno-Azanza, Jos√© Ignacio Canudo, and Jos√© Manuel Gasca found that in fact, \\"M.\\" turolensis is not an elongatoolithid, but instead belongs in Spheroolithidae, and named a new oogenus for it: Guegoolithus. In 2016, Moreno-Azanza and several of his colleagues reported the discovery of a new fossil site in La Rioja, Spain, which included eggs assigned to Guegoolithus. Since this site is somewhat older than the Barremian age of the previously reported Guegoolithus fossils, Moreno et. al rejected the idea of using them as index fossils. Classification While it was previously considered an oospecies of Macroolithus in the oofamily Elongatoolithidae, Guegoolithus is now considered a spheroolithid because of the similarities of microstructure, ultrastructure, and ornamentation. It contains a single oospecies: G. turolensis. Unfortunately, relationships within Speroolithidae are not well known because of the unclear definitions of Spheroolithus and Speroolithidae. Paleobiology Life restoration of Gideonmantellia, a candidate for a parent of Guegoolithus. Guegoolithus is classified as a spheroolithid, which would indicate it was laid by an ornithopod dinosaur. It is very similar to the eggs of Maiasaura peeblesorum and other hadrosaurs, but these were not common in Europe during the Early Cretaceous. G. turolensis is most likely laid by a closely related ornithopods. Styracosterns (a clade of ornithopods that includes hadrosaurs and their close relatives) are, like G. turolensis, incredibly common in the lower Cretaceous of Spain. Given that fossils of Guegoolithus span a larger time period than is likely for a single species, the fossils probably represent many different styracostern species with structurally indistinguishable eggshells. Because Guegoolithus remained unchanged for upwards of 5 million years and it is very similar to the late Cretaceous spheroolithids, Moreno-Azanza et al. (2017) concluded that the nesting behavior of hadrosaurs and their close relatives remained unchanged for 80 million years. The eggshell structure is apparently designed to be easily broken from the inside, indicating that these dinosaurs were altricial. Its reclassification outside of Elongatoolithidae implies that no elongatoolithids are known from the early Cretaceous of Europe. However, elongatoolithids have been reported from the Late Cretaceous of France.

During the surgery, the neurosurgeon performs cortical mapping to identify vital areas, called the \\"eloquent brain\\", that should not be disturbed while removing the tumor.  Uses  A particular use for awake craniotomy is mapping the cortex to avoid causing language or movement deficits with the surgery. It is more effective than surgeries performed under general anesthesia in avoiding complications. Awake craniotomy can be used in a variety of brain tumors, including glioblastomas, gliomas, and brain metastases. It can also be used for epilepsy surgery to remove a larger amount of the section of tissue causing the seizures without damaging function, for deep brain stimulation placement, or for pallidotomy. Awake craniotomy has increased the scope of tumors that are considered resectable (treatable by surgery) and in general, reduces recovery time. Awake craniotomy is also associated with reduced iatrogenic brain damage after surgery.  Technique  Before an awake craniotomy begins for tumor or epilepsy surgery, the patient is given anxiolytic medications. The patient is then positioned in a neurosurgical head restraint that holds the head completely still and given general anesthesia. The anesthesiologist will then use local anesthetics like lidocaine or bupivacaine to numb the skin and bone of the head and neck. The craniotomy begins with a surgeon removing an area of the skull over the tumor and cutting into the meninges, the membranes that protect the brain. Before removing any brain tissue, the patient is awakened and the neurosurgeon creates a cortical map, using a small electrical stimulation device to observe the changes in the patient's condition when an area is stimulated. If an area is stimulated and the patient moves or loses some ability, like speech, the surgeon knows that the area is vital and cannot be removed or cut through to access a tumor. During the procedure, the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and other surgical personnel speak to the patient, and there is a technician constantly assessing the patient's ability to name objects, for example, or report any abnormal sensations. There are two variations on the technique: awake-asleep- awake (AAA), and monitored anesthetic care (MAC), also called conscious sedation. In an AAA surgery, the patient is only awake during the cortical mapping; whereas in an MAC surgery the patient is awake the entire time. The procedure for deep brain stimulation placement is similar, though instead of skull being removed, a burr hole is drilled for the electrodes instead and the MAC surgery is more common.  Complications  The complications of awake craniotomy are similar to complications from brain surgery done under general anesthesia ‚Äì seizures during the operation, nausea, vomiting, loss of motor or speech function, hemodynamic instability (hypertension, hypotension, or tachycardia), cerebral edema, hemorrhage, stroke or air embolism, and death. Seizures are the most common complication.  Contraindications  There are patients for whom an awake craniotomy is not appropriate. Those with anxiety disorders, claustrophobia, schizophrenia, or low pain tolerance are poor candidates for an awake surgery because any treatment of a psychological crisis would harm the procedure and could harm the patient.

Written by keyboardist Don Walker, it was released as a single in 1979, peaking at number 63 on the Australian charts. It appeared as a track on the album of the same name. Details \\"Sweethearts\\" was a caf√® in the middle of Kings Cross, Sydney in the 1970s and 1980s, \\"cramped between strip clubs and sex shops, patronised by the hookers, pimps and drug dealers and the lost and lonely debris of the night,\\" where author Don Walker would frequently eat. He said, \\"The original Sweethearts Cafe is where McDonald's is now. That got demolished and Sweethearts moved over the road to where Krave Espresso Bar is now. That lasted for quite a few years, until the late 1980s, early '90s.\\" Walker continued to live in Kings Cross for decades afterwards, and often wrote about the area. Author Louis Nowra said the song was, \\"the most immediately identifiable song about the Cross.\\" Elsewhere, Walker said the establishment was very small and run by a Yugoslavian family. \\"It had the reputation that when Nureyev was in Sydney, he would always have his coffee at Sweethearts and stuff like that. There was a beautiful middle-aged woman who used to serve coffee there and never said anything and she was reputed to be the girlfriend of quite a dangerous guy,\\" he claimed. The song first appeared in performances in 1978, after the chorus was written on an organ while recording demos for the album. The single was released a month after the album of the same title. Although it received some radio airplay, it was quickly dropped from playlists when it failed to reach the top 40. It would later appear on the band's greatest hits compilations.

It is an erect shrub with small, serrated leaves and mauve to blue flowers that extend well beyond the foliage. Description Eremophila conglomerata is an erect shrub which grows to a height of between and which has sticky, shiny branches due to the presence of resin. The leaves are clustered near the ends of the branches, obscuring them. They are also elliptic to egg-shaped, have serrated edges, a sharp tip, are shiny, very sticky and mostly long and wide. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a slightly flattened stalk long and extend beyond the smaller leaves. There are 5 sepals which are variable in size and shape but mostly long and green or yellowish-brown in colour. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is mauve to blue outside, reddish purple on the top and white with purple spots inside. The tube is mostly glabrous on the outside and densely woolly inside. The petal lobes are pointed and the lower lobe is raised so that it closes the opening of the petal tube. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed within the tube. Flowering occurs mostly from July to October and is followed by fruits which are dry, woody with a papery covering, oval-shaped and long. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The type specimen was collected by Chinnock south west of Sandstone. The specific epithet (conglomerata) is derived from the Latin word glomeratus meaning \\"form into a ball\\" or \\"gather into a rounded heap\\", referring to the small, clustered leaves of this species. Distribution and habitat Eremophila conglomerata occurs in the area between Sandstone and Cue in the Murchison biogeographic region where it grows in red sand and gravel. Conservation status Eremophila conglomerata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This eremophila is a suitable plant for growing in a container. It is difficult to propagate except by grafting onto Myoporum species and needs a well-drained soil but is drought resistant and tolerates frost, except when young.

In the 6th/7th centuries, it was replaced by the nearby city of Didymoteichon.

A solid gold bust of Emperor Septimius Severus found on the site of Plotinopolis in 1965 is now in the museum at Komotini. The city would later be one of the most important towns in Thrace, having its own assembly, part of the late Roman province of Haemimontus, and had an episcopal see (suffragan of the Metropolis of Adrianople). The first bishop of the city, Hierophilus, is mentioned in the 430s. In the 6th century, Emperor Justinian I improved the fortifications of Plotinopolis. It was probably at that time that the nearby rocky and more defensible hill was also fortified. It seems that already in the 7th century, the latter had become the core of the settlement, which was thereafter named Didymoteichon (\\"twin wall\\").

Kargman is founder and CEO of Kargo Global, Inc., a firm that manages mobile brand advertising for many media companies including CBS Interactive, Hearst, The Daily Mail, Meredith, Scripps, Target Corporation, T-Mobile, Vice, and Vox. Kargman holds numerous patents and is a member of Ad Council's Board of Directors.  Early life and career  Kargman grew up in the greater Boston area and graduated from the private all-boys school, Belmont Hill School, in 1992. In 1997, Kargman graduated with honors from Harvard University with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Government. He has two sisters, Bess, a filmmaker and director of 2011 film First Position, and Sophie Kargman, an actress. Before starting his own company, he worked at Intel and Intertainer, a broadband content provider.  Kargo  = Kargo Inc. = Kargman initially founded Kargo Inc. in 1999, hoping to build software that would serve as the mobile web's foundation. Mobile carriers, to whom he offered his services, insisted on many rounds of vetting and trial periods before they would purchase his software. At this stage, his company had much venture capital funding but little revenue and the company went through all of its money in 2001. That year, Kargo lost its office and staff dropped from 35 to just Kargman and two engineers. However, because the company was Tribeca- based and within the 9/11 impact zone, Kargo received approximately $70,000 from New York City's World Trade Center Business Recovery Grant Program, which kept it afloat. With this grant, Kargman aimed to rebuild the company - but this time without venture capital funds. = Kargo Global, Inc. = In 2003, Kargman created Kargo Inc.'s successor: Kargo Global, Inc., and he transferred Kargo Inc.'s trademark to it. While rebuilding Kargo, he pivoted the role of the company's relationship with mobile carriers. Instead of creating software for mobile carriers for single payments, he created sites where carriers could sell products - such as ringtones - and Kargo could share the revenue from every sale. As the Internet shifted, Kargo shifted again, now building websites for media companies rather than just their portals. However, Kargo found media companies to be reluctant because they were not sure they would be able to monetize the sites. So, after watching media companies be unable to sell mobile adds for several years, Kargman decided to move Kargo into the ad business. Kargo began contracting with networks such as AdMob and Millennial Media, placing ads on sites rather than merely relying on sites' publishers to do so. Kargo's annual revenue in 2015 was $100 million. Kargo has locations in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Detroit, Dallas, Sydney, and Auckland.  Kargo awards  Kargo has received several awards, including: * Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) Smarties Gold Medal, Cross-Mobile Integration, Lyft - 2018 * MMA Smarties Gold Medal, Social Impact, Lyft - 2018 * MMA Smarties Silver Medal, Mobile Video, Lyft - 2018 * Inc. 5000 - 2015-2018 * Crain's New York Business Fast 50 - 2015-2017 * Deloitte Technology Fast 500 - 2016, 2017 * Great Place to Work - 2017 * Business Insider's 37 Hottest Pre- IPO Ad Tech Startups - 2016 * OMMA Award for Best Rich Media Display: Single Execution, Unilever/Magnum - 2014 * OMMA Award for Best Online Advertising Creativity - 2014  Personal awards and honors  Kargman has been a guest on programs including CNBC, Fox News, Bloomberg, 20/20, NPR, and The Today Show and has been featured in publications including The New York Times, AdAge, Adweek, Business Insider, and The Wall Street Journal.

About Bravelets is a web-based retailer that sells pieces of jewelry, mainly bracelets, that are engraved with the words \\"be brave\\". The organization was founded and is headquartered in Austin, Texas, and according to Bravelets' blog, the products are manufactured in Guangzhou, China. A cause marketing-based business, the company donates 10% from each purchase to the charity of the purchaser's choice. It also provides people with the ability to create their own customized pages, through which they can sell Bravelets products to raise money for a non-profit organization or to offset a family member's medical expenses. The organization was founded by Stephanie Hansen in January 2012. Hansen came up with the idea the year before, while searching for jewelry for the family to wear together after Hansen's mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. Part of Hansen's motivation in creating her own cause marketing-based company was a frustration that other, existing options were unclear about how much of the proceeds of their sales went to the charitable organizations. When the website was originally launched, there was only one model of bracelet for sale, which was offered in ten colors, each tied to a different cause. They have since expanded to include several types of bracelets, as well as earrings and necklaces. As of January 2016, the company's website claims to have donated just over of 2 million to charitable causes.

Discovery and naming  restoration In 2007, the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum (FPDM) approached the Northeastern Research Institute of Petrified Woods and Mineral Resources, Nakhon Ratchasima Rajabhat University (NRRU) and associated Khorat Fossil Museum on the possibility of a collaboration. The motivation for such an effort was because of the similar age of rocks in Suranaree Subdistrict, Nakhon Ratchasima Province, Thailand and Katsuayama, Fukui Prefecture, Japan. Similar dinosaurs are known from the formations of both locales, and so the researchers wanted to collaborate in research to be able to more deeply compare the prehistory of both countries. The collaboration was approved as the Japan-Thailand Dinosaur Project (JTDP), and this contributed to the basis of the founding of the Asia Dinosaur Association in 2013, by which time over 30,000 fossils had been found by the joint effort. The fossils of Sirindhorna were collected as part of the JTDP, at the Ban Saphan Hin site of the Khok Kruat Formation; the dating of the formation is uncertain (as index fossils have proven rare), but it's thought to mostly likely date the Aptian stage of the late Early Cretaceous Period, between 125-112 million years ago. The formation does not usually crop out in the Nakhon Ratchasima province, where the geologic features are covered in a layer of thin red soil (local legend claims this colour is from the blood of dinosaurs); Early Cretaceous bedrock in Suranaree is generally found around a metre below ground level. The locality of the Sirindhorna bonebed is usually used for farming of corn and tapioca. Digging to make a reservoir, farmers happened upon dinosaur fossils. Researchers re-identified the bonebed's location and gathered information on taphonomy and other fossils found there, pertaining to various vertebrates but not any plants or invertebrates. Farming was not conducted while fossil excavation was conducted. Described in 2015 by Thai palaeontologists Masateru Shibata, Pratueng Jintasakul, Yoichi Azuma and Hai-Lu You, Sirindhorna was one of eighteen dinosaur taxa from the year to be described in an open access or free-to-read journal. It's the third species of iguanodont found in Thailand, following Siamodon and Ratchasimasaurus, both known from poorer material, and the first ornithopod from Southeast Asia to have a well-preserved skull. The type and only species of the genus is Sirindhorna khoratensis. The taxon is known from the holotype specimen NRRU3001-166, an articulated braincase, as well as a number of disarticulated referred specimens. The material known from these referred specimens consists of three more partial braincases, one with an articulated postorbital, one right premaxilla, a left and right maxilla, a right jugal, surangular, and quadrate, one predentary, a right and left dentary, and assorted teeth. The generic name is dedication to Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn for her contribution to the support and encouragement of palaeontology in Thailand. The specific name is derived from Khorat, the informal name of Nakhon Ratchasima Province.

He also has an interest in the history of science and has written on the history of black scientists. He is a fellow of the American Physical Society and served as the historian of the National Society of Black Physicists. He has made significant contributions to the theory of nonlinear oscillations and numerical analysis. Early life and education Ronald Elbert Mickens was born February 7, 1943 in Petersburg, Virginia, to Joseph P. Mickens, a general construction worker, and Daisy Brown Williamson Mickens who was a part-time domestic worker. The eldest of three children, Mickens was raised primarily by his maternal grandparents. It was through discussions with his grandfather, James Williamson, that Mickens was inspired to become a scientist at age six and has credited his grandfather with his early interest in science. Mickens attended Fisk University as an undergraduate and graduated in 1964 with degrees in mathematics and physics. He received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics in 1968 from Vanderbilt University and subsequently worked as a postdoctoral fellow at MIT. His studies at Vanderbilt were supported by fellowships from the Danforth Foundation and the Woodrow Wilson Foundation. Continuing his research efforts, he received a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship to investigate elementary particle physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Plot Doc Griffin (Donald Kirke) and his two henchmen rob a bank and quickly hide the loot before they are apprehended. The handsome owner of the horse ranch Nora Lane (Judith Barrie) loses all her money because of this. The police have Lane's employee Tom Marley (Tom Mix) infiltrate the prison with the robbers, hoping the thieves will tell Marley where the loot is hidden. When the trio manages to escape from prison, Marley has to hide his cover longer. His undercover action works too well, however, and both Lane and the police think he has actually joined the criminals. Marley then steals horses from Lane's ranch, and she is kidnapped by Griffin who takes her to the woods to find the loot. When he accidentally starts a forest fire, Griffin shoots his henchmen to keep the money for himself.

He also served the President of the Conference of Saint Vincent de Paul in its Pisan division. He was a noted figure in Pisa due to his charitable activities; he was close with important figures of that era in Pisa including Cardinal Pietro Maffi and Blessed Giuseppe Toniolo who both had an interest in education. His cause for beatification commenced in 1949 in a long and complex process that became blocked in 1966. It reopened several decades later and continued in Pisa after the resolution of the reasons for the initial blockage. The commencement of the cause saw him titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis titled him as Venerable on 7 November 2018 upon confirmation of his heroic virtue. Life Ludovico Coccapani was born in Pisa on 23 June 1849 to bourgeois parents Sigismondo Coccapani and Fortunata Guelfi; he was baptized on 24 June as \\"Ludovico Francesco Angiolo Cesare\\". His paternal side consisted of noted potters. This line of ceramists in 1739 took over the management of a ceramics workshop in Montecchio and later in 1746 arrived and settled in Calcinaia to continue their business. His parents died when he was in his childhood with one having died when he was eight in 1857; he therefore lived with his brother and sisters of which he was the lastborn. He received the sacrament of Confirmation on 23 June 1856 from Cardinal Cosimo Corsi. He did his studies in Pisa where he obtained a diploma in education around 1867. He taught first in Pisa for a brief period and then later in Fucecchio in Florence from 14 September 1867 but was forced to return home due to health reasons in 1869. In 1872 he taught at Pietrasanta and then in 1874 decided that he would dedicate himself to a range of charitable works for the betterment of others. He never married and lived in Pisa with his priest brother Lionello and his two sisters Teresina and Rosina. In 1874 he decided to devote his life to the poor and to that end soon discovered the life and charism of Saint Francis of Assisi. He felt that Francis' guidelines in his Rule were things that he could do in Pisa as his true calling and so decided to join the Secular Franciscan Order. He vested in their habit on 7 December 1907 and made his profession on 8 December 1908. He also began working for the Saint Vincent de Paul organization based in Pisa in 1894. He also served as a teacher and he educated children including those who had been abandoned and/or neglected. He also visited prisons and he frequented those places in order to reach out to the prisoners and to bring them a message of hope as well as to teach them of the messages contained in the Gospel while attempting to emulate the merciful love of Jesus Christ. Coccapani was devoted to the Eucharist and was an ardent devotee of the Blessed Mother. His confessor and close friend was the Cardinal Carlo Rossi (future Servant of God) and he had also met and worked with Blessed Giuseppe Toniolo. He was likewise close with Cardinal Pietro Maffi who invested Coccapani with the civil class honor of the Knight of the Pontifical Order of San Gregorio Magno. In 1914Other sources suggest he was president since 1907. he became the President of the Pisan detail of the Vicentian Conference and carried out the duties of the organization during World War I; it was during that conflict that he took care of war orphans. He died at his home in Pisa in the evening on 14 November 1931 due to pneumonia he had contracted earlier that week. He was granted a simple funeral and buried in a simple grave as per the instructions he laid out in his last will which also stipulated that his home was to become a kindergarten. His remains were exhumed in December 2015 and placed back into his grave after examination and canonical inspection was completed. =Legacies= His influence became widespread in Pisa and the surrounding areas to the point where he earned the moniker of the \\"Knight of God\\". In the parish of Saint Francis there was a soup kitchen that was named after him following his 1931 death. Beatification process The canonization process commenced in 1949 in Pisa - he therefore became titled as a Servant of God - and lasted until 1966 at which point the cause became blocked. It remained in that inactive state until 1989 when the Archbishop of Pisa Alessandro Plotti requested that it be reopened. The cause continued due to this new impetus and was closed on 15 November 1996. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints ‚Äì on 28 January 1997 ‚Äì granted their formal approval to the cause with the \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) declaration and around that time issued a decree validating the diocesan process. The next step in the cause was to compile the Positio dossier for the C.C.S. to evaluate whether Coccapani exercised a life of heroic virtue or not. Pope Francis confirmed he lived heroic virtue in a decree issued on 7 November 2018 and so titled him as Venerable. The first postulator assigned to cause was the Conventual Franciscan friar Antonio Ricciardi and the second was Ambrogio Sanna O.F.M. Conv. The third was Angelo Paleri O.F.M. Conv. The current one is the Conventual Franciscan Fra Damian- Gheorghe PƒÉtra≈ücu.

He was sent as ambassador to the Galatians to propitiate that people, when the inhabitants of Heraclea Pontica had offended them by assisting Mithridates II of Pontus, the son of Ariobarzanes of Pontus, with whom the Galatians were at war.Memnon, c. 24, ed.

Anise is the founder of the American Lawyers Public Image Association (ALPIA), an organization with a goal of promoting a positive image for lawyers. He serves as the organization's national director. Anise and the Association made news in 2001 after they publicly denounced NBC-TV's First Years, a television show that documented the life of first-year lawyers. The show was later cancelled after the first season. Anise founded I Love My Lawyer Day, a day of \\"no lawyer bashing\\" and lawyer appreciation that takes place on the 1st Friday of November each year. He established the day after hearing too many negative comments about lawyers. In addition to his marketing business, Anise is a former adjunct professor of both law and marketing, teaching at Nova Southeastern University's H. Wayne Huizenga School of Business and Entrepreneurship. He is also credited with coining the term lawyerpreneur.

Students attended the school from Great Barrington, the villages of Housatonic, Van Deusenville and other communities in the southern Berkshire region. Searles High School was founded in 1898 and closed in 1968, when its students transferred to a new regional high school. Early school history in Great Barrington The history of education in Great Barrington can be traced to a period before the American Revolutionary War in the mid-1700s. Colonial settlers, highly valuing literacy, often supported a local schoolmaster with private donations or church sponsorship. The town's first allocation of public funds to support education occurred in the year of its incorporation, 1761. While an early sign of its commitment to education, it would be a century before the rural pioneer community could support a public high school. Throughout the region one room school houses were opening, focused primarily on basic literacy skills. In the late 1700s and early 1800s more organized efforts emerged through private academies with more advanced teaching capacities. Most notable was a school established by the three Kellogg sisters. The contributions of the Kellogg, Sherwood and Hopkins families to local education are significant. It was the inherited fortune of Mary Sherwood Hopkins Searles, niece of the Kellogg sisters, that funded the widely admired new high school building constructed in 1898. High school history Great Barrington's first public high school was established in 1868, occupying a temporary site until a year later when a new building was completed. In 1898 an impressive new building was dedicated for the high school. This event proved so significant for the town that the school was named for its benefactor, and the date marks the founding of Searles High School. The school was named for Edward Francis Searles, whose deceased wife, Mary Frances Sherwood Hopkins Searles, was a Great Barrington native and had been the wife of Mark Hopkins, Jr., one of California's railroad barons.The Centennial Book of Searles High School Alumni, compiled and produce by the Searles High School Alumni Association, 1998, updated January 1, 2009 Early in its history Searles High School served students enrolled from throughout the southwestern corner of the state, as well as from three Connecticut towns and one town in New York. In 1923 there were seven women and four men on the high school faculty to teach 305 students. In June 1935 the high school had its largest graduating class to date of eighty-six students. The increasing enrollment first led to discussions of constructing a new building for the high school, and eventually led to the regionalization discussions beginning in the late 1940s.Great Barrington, Great Town, Great History, Bernard A. Drew, 1989 ‚ÄúThe Blotter‚Äù was the first school newspaper. In later years the newspaper became known as ‚ÄúThe Spectator‚Äù. The school's yearbook was ‚ÄúThe Climbing Ivy‚Äù. Through its seventy-year history, school records document 3,927 graduates. Student life The 1957 edition of The Climbing Ivy yearbook, gives an account of student life, as the school entered its last decade.The Climbing Ivy, Searles High School yearbook, 1957 edition =Academics= The academic curriculum included general, commercial and college preparatory courses. There were twenty-one faculty members, with the principal and vice-principal also serving as instructors. There were sixty- four seniors in 1957, including thirty-eight boys and twenty-six girls. English, history, civics, mathematics and science courses were either required or offered. Latin, French and Spanish were also offered. Additionally, art, mechanical drawing, home economics and physical education were included in the curriculum. =Extracurricular activities= Searles High School placed a strong emphasis on engaging students with an array of extracurricular activities. There was a student council, and each grade elected four class officers. Each spring several students were chosen to participate at the annual Boys and Girls State in Boston. Student publications included The Climbing Ivy yearbook and Spectator literary magazine, published three times a year. There was an Orchestra, Band, Majorettes and Dramatics Club. Other clubs included: * In School Glee Club * After School Glee Club * Airplane Club * First Aid Club * Camera Club * Radio Club * Morse Code Club * Cooking and Sewing Club * Izaak Walton Club * Stamp Club Complementing the academic curriculum, were Science, Scholastic, Current Events Clubs. In addition to the clubs there were Dance and Float Committees and aTraffic Squad. =Athletics= The school's small student body was able to support one sport each season for both boys and girls. In the fall, the boys played soccer and the girls played field hockey. Both the boys and girls played basketball in the winter. In the spring the boys fielded a baseball team, while the girls fielded a softball team. There was a cheerleading squad that supported the boys' varsity basketball team. Searles High School was a member of the Southern Berkshire League, but competed against teams throughout Berkshire County as well as against teams from nearby towns in New York state. In 1957 teams played against these schools: * Mt. Everett Regional High School, Sheffield, MA * Williams High School, Stockbridge, MA * Lee High School, Lee, MA * Lenox Memorial High School, Lenox, MA * Dalton High School, Dalton, MA * Pittsfield High School, Pittsfield, MA * Drury High School, North Adams, MA * Roeliff Jansen High School, Hillsdale, NY * Webutuck High School, Amenia, NY Regionalization Creating economies of scale was the rationale for the school regionalization efforts of the 1950s and 1960s. However, discussions around regionalization were complex and often contentious. Faced with increasing costs for maintaining adequate facilities, instructional personnel and curricular resources, some small rural districts felt pressured to explore consolidation with neighboring districts. For over a decade into the mid-1960s, Great Barrington explored consolidation with partners to the west and south, including Alford, Egremont, Mt. Washington, Sheffield and New Marlborough. Ultimately, those towns formed the Southern Berkshire Regional School District, the first of many regional districts in the state. Great Barrington chose not to regionalize with these partners.Great Barrington, Great Town, Great History, Bernard A. Drew, 1989 =Regionalization approved= Great Barrington began negotiating with new partners to the north. In June 1965 its voters joined those in Stockbridge and West Stockbridge in approving plans for a regional high school. The favorable vote tallies were: 922-554 in Great Barrington, 407-149 in Stockbridge and 178-55 in West Stockbridge. They created the Berkshire Hills Regional School District, and planning began for their primary and secondary schools to be located on adjoining campuses in Great Barrington. The district offices would be located in Stockbridge. The regionalization agreement united long-time sports rivals Searles High School and Williams High School into one student body. School closure The last class to graduate from Searles High School was in June 1967. The school did not actually close until April 1968, when the senior and junior classes moved to the newly completed Monument Mountain Regional High School in Great Barrington near the Stockbridge town line. Economies of scale for rural districts and increasing student populations led to the closure of its high school, an outcome Great Barrington had debated for over a decade. While the new regional high school was located within the town's city limits, it was several miles to the north of the 1898 building's central location in the heart of Great Barrington's small downtown.

The event was so significant, that this is the date the school marks as its founding, even though the town already had established a public high school. Designed by Boston Architect Henry Vaughan. Known as a church architect, Vaughan collaborated with Searles on a number of projects. The three story, Queen Anne design was considered to be grand in proportions, exceeding local expectations and receiving acclaim beyond the Berkshire region. The building still stands today and has been the object of various reuse proposals, including that of a boutique hotel to serve the area's significant tourist trade. The new school was built adjacent to ‚ÄúOlympian Field‚Äù, a venue for athletic events and an earlier gift to the community from Mr. Searles. Upon the opening of the new regional high school and the closing of Searles High School, the 1898 building began to serve as a middle school.The Centennial Book of Searles High School Alumni, compiled and produce by the Searles High School Alumni Association, 1998, updated January 2, 2009 =Remodeling controversy= The conversion of the historic 1898 Queen Anne school building into a boutique hotel provoked intense controversy in the town. In spite of the project's approval by the town's Historic Commission, strong community sentiment favors preservation of one of the town's landmark structures. The hotel proposal involves maintaining some internal structural elements, but models depict a fully transformed contemporary facade with no trace of the admired original Queen Anne design. A ‚ÄúSave the Searles School‚Äù effort has been undertaken to stop the project.

There is a zero point of reference called a total station. The instrument can be freely positioned so that all survey points are at a suitable sight from the instrument. Setting up the total station on a known point, often it is not possible to see all survey points. With the total station, bearings and distances are measured to at least two known points of a control network. This with a handheld computer recorded data is related to local polar coordinates, defined by the horizontal circle of the total station. By a geometric transformation, these polar coordinates are transformed to the coordinate system of the control network. Errors are distributed by least squares adjustment. The position and orientation of the total station in relation to where the control network is established. Comparison of methods Angular resection and triangulation: only bearings are measured to the known points. * Trilateration: only distances are measured to the known points. * Free stationing and triangulateration: both bearings and distances are measured to the known points. Naming Because bearings and distances in a resection (free stationing) are measured, the result may have a different mathematical solution. This method of a \\"total station set up\\" has different names in other languages, e.g. German: :de:Freie Standpunktwahl (free stationing). Naming is also regulated by the German Institute for Standardization DIN 18 709. Different mathematical solution The axes and circles of a theodolite Points in the polar coordinate system with pole O and polar axis L. In green, the point with radial coordinate 3 and angular coordinate 60 degrees or (3,60¬∞). In blue, the point (4,210¬∞). By measuring bearings and distances, local polar coordinates are recorded. The orientation of this local polar coordinate system is defined by the 0¬∞ horizontal circle of the total station (polar axis L). The pole of this local polar coordinate system is the vertical axis (pole O) of the total stations. The polar coordinates (r,f) with the pole are transformed with a surveying software in a data collector to the Cartesian coordinates (x,y) of the known points and the coordinates for the position of the total station are calculated. In a resection (triangulation) measuring bearings only, there can be a problem with an infinite number of solutions called: \\"danger circle\\" or \\"inscribed angle theorem\\". Back-sight points The back-sight points of the control network should cover and surround the stationing site. The position of the total station is not part of the area. This is the area where you want to measure with this station setup. Topographic points or stakeout points should not be measured outside this area. If measured outside this area, the errors in orientation will be extrapolated instead of being interpolated. While it is possible to use only two known control points in a resection (free stationing), it is recommended to use three control points. There is no redundancy for orientation, using two points only. Using five or more points of the control network, there is only a slight improvement in the accuracy. Advantages Choose the station point free for best visibility to all survey points * Where there is no obstruction * Where there is no traffic * Where there is the highest safety for the observer and the instrument Because of the range and accuracy of total stations, the method of a resection (free stationing) permits a great freedom of positioning the total station. For this reason, this method is one of the most used station set ups. Application Example of a site plan With the calculated coordinates and orientation of the total station, it can be used to set out points in construction surveying, machine guidance, site plan or other types of surveys.

The design is attributed to John Smith Murdoch and the builder was MS Caskie. It was completed in April 1902. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005.  History  The Mackay Customs House was completed in April 1902. The design of the building is attributed to John Smith Murdoch, District Architect with the Queensland Public Works Department, and it was constructed by MS Caskie for the tender price of . In search of new pastoral land, John Mackay and his party entered and named the valley of the Mackay River in 1860 (renamed Pioneer River in 1862), and the following year he returned to establish a cattle station. In 1862, the ketch \\"Presto\\" entered the Mackay River landing stores and building materials, then surveyed the river mouth, which consequently was gazetted as a Port of Entry. The first settlers arrived in October 1862, establishing the settlement of Port Mackay on the south bank of the river. In January 1863, John Tanner Baker was appointed Sub Collector of Customs for the new port (Baker also acted as Harbour Master and Magistrate). He arrived in February setting up in a tent, but soon established the Customs Office in a corner of the large store of Byrnes, Basset and Co. located on the riverbank. By the end of 1863, the name of the river had been changed to the Pioneer River, the first survey of the town of Mackay had been made, and the first land sale of town lots had been held. It was soon obvious better premises were needed for the Queensland Customs Service in Mackay, and in 1864, was allocated for a new building. By May 1865 the Queensland Colonial Architect reported that the new timber Mackay Customs House had been completed. It was located on the corner of a large \\"Reserve for Government Buildings\\", overlooking the river. The town of Mackay soon began to prosper through the growth of the port, the nearby pastoral holdings, and the plantations along the river which included the beginnings of the local sugar industry. River Street developed as a busy waterfront precinct with wharves (the Government wharf opened in 1868), warehouses, offices, ships' chandleries, boat builders, hotels and boarding houses, and the Customs complex which by 1870 included the Customs House, the bond store and the Sub Collectors residence. By 1895, agitation had begun for a new Customs House befitting Mackay's prosperity and importance. Lacking funds, the Government constructed a timber extension to the existing building. The community protested, pointing out that these extensions contravened legislation and should have been of non-combustible materials. The agitation for a new Customs House continued, and in 1900 drawings for a new brick building were prepared and tenders called. The design of the Mackay Customs House is attributed to JS Murdoch, District Architect Northern Division for the Queensland Works Department. At this time, Alfred Barton Brady was Queensland Government Architect and Acting Under Secretary of the Works Department (as shown on the tender notice), and Thomas Pye was District Architect Southern Division, and they both may have had input into the design. Under this team, the Government Architect's Office produced many of Queensland's finest public buildings, including a number for the new Commonwealth. JS Murdoch was also responsible for the Customs Houses of Maryborough, Bundaberg and Townsville, which exhibit some similarities in style to that of Mackay. He later joined the Commonwealth Government where he was involved in the planning of Canberra and the design of the provisional Parliament House and the Canberra Hotel, and rose to the positions of Chief Architect and Commonwealth Director-General of Works. Mackay Customs House, circa 1909 The Mackay Customs House was completed in April 1902. It was reported as featuring locally made bricks, cement and plaster finishing, rolled galvanised iron roof, wood and zinc ceilings, and joinery and fittings of cedar. The original timber Customs House was moved sideways to become the front portion of the adjacent Second Officer's Quarters. The original Reserve for Government Buildings was divided into the Customs House Reserve and the Post and Telegraph Reserve. In 1905, the Commonwealth subdivided the Customs Reserve further, returning the portion which included the Quarters to the State. Also in 1905, palm trees were planted to the north and the east of the Customs House. Mackay Customs House being used by the Commonwealth Bank (note the signage over the entrance) In 1921, the Commonwealth Bank leased the Customs House for 10 years, moving the Customs Service back into the adjacent timber building. The Customs House has since been altered several times for multiple occupancy, housing various other government departments. The brick Bond Store, on the south-east corner of the site addressing Sydney Street, was constructed about 1935. Following the devastating cyclone of 1918, Mackay enjoyed a period of substantial growth through the 1920s and 1930s. Local member and Premier of Queensland William Forgan Smith promoted Mackay's development, strongly supporting the Mackay Harbour Project and the Sydney Street bridge replacement. The first Sydney Street bridge, completed in 1887, was the second bridge across the river at Mackay, but for some time lead to nowhere. Located adjacent to the Customs House, it marked the \\"head of navigation\\" of the Pioneer River. The new bridge was completed in 1938, increasing traffic along Sydney Street to North Mackay. The inadequacy of the river port had been recognised by 1914. In 1939, the new Mackay Outer Harbour was opened, and the services of the river port gradually transferred to the new harbour. Apart from the Customs House and the Bond Store, only a few of the buildings of the former river port still survive. In 1969‚Äì70, extensions were made to the rear of the Customs House. In the late 1980s, conservation and restoration works were undertaken, reversing some of the alterations which had been made to the interior of the building. In 2004, the Customs House was sold to Alman Partners, a financial planning firm. In 2006, Alman Partners was awarded the Mackay City Council Heritage Award for their restoration of the building, which they continue to use as offices for their financial planning practice.  Description  The Mackay Customs House is a single storey brick building located at the corner of Sydney and River Streets, Mackay on the southern bank of the Pioneer River. It sits diagonally across the property, addressing the street corner and facing north-east towards the river mouth and the remaining buildings of the river port. Sydney Street continues north from this intersection as the Forgan Bridge across the river to North Mackay. At the centre of the symmetrical plan of this building is the Customs Office or Long Room. To the front is the semi-circular public area with encircling colonnade, and to each side are offices, separated from the Long Room by a corridor. At the rear is an enclosed verandah, from which open several utility rooms including toilets and the strong room. The elevations are also formal in composition, and predominantly symmetrical. The corrugated steel roof is highly modelled, with decorative timber gablets and rafter ends. The external walls are tuck-pointed red brick to the mid-height of the double-hung windows which have decorative metal security grills placed in place, with \\"roughcast\\" stucco panels with brick quoining above. Raised several steps above the ground, the curved entrance colonnade has columns of Doric order supporting a moulded entablature. At its centre is a raised parapet with the Royal coat of arms in relief at its centre. From this colonnade, there is access to the public area through two pairs of French doors with leadlight glass panels, and access to the staff areas through timber panelled doors. The owners have undertaken some minor works including the removal of metal grill gates at the top of the steps to the colonnade entrance, and replaced these with slate grey, steel framed doors with full glazing panels. Dividing the public area from the Long Room is a moulded archway and a panelled cedar counter. The Long Room is a double-height symmetrical space with semi-circular clerestory windows to each side, decorative pressed metal ceiling, and plaster mouldings to the opening surrounds. The interior of the building has plaster walls and varnished cedar joinery including doors, architraves and skirtings. Apart from the Long Room and the public area, the ceilings are tongue-and-groove timber boarding. To the south-east corner of the site is the former bond store. It is a rectangular single-storey building, which addresses Sydney Street with a gabled parapet and awning over the footpath. The external walls are rendered masonry, and feature stucco panels to the upper sections reflecting the detail of the Customs House. To the rear of the site is a garage building, with a central bay of brick and lean-to additions enclosed in steel mesh to either side. To both street frontages is a timber picket and rail fence with brick corner posts. The garden has palm trees, lawns and concrete paths, with a bitumen car parking area at the rear of the site  Heritage listing  Mackay Customs House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Completed in 1902, the Mackay Customs House is located on the site of Mackay's first Customs House constructed in 1865. Community agitation resulted in the earlier timber building being replaced by a new brick structure befitting Mackay's prosperity at that time. Originally part of a Government Reserve surveyed soon after the settlement of Mackay, the site has been associated with the Customs Service for over 130 years. Located on the southern bank of the Pioneer River, the Mackay Customs House faces north-east towards the river mouth, and the precinct of the former river port of which it is one of few surviving structures. The Customs House also addresses the approach to the Forgan Bridge, which marked the head of navigation of the river. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Customs House was constructed in the first years of the new Commonwealth for Commonwealth use. It uses the architectural language of a domestic style of the period, sometimes termed \\"Federation\\", which was part of a broader movement searching for a cultural identity for the new nation. As the office of the Australian Customs Service in Mackay for a century, it displays the coat of arms in relief on the front parapet, and its central and grandest space is the Long Room, which is a symbolic and traditional element of a Customs House. The Bond Store which is an important part of a functioning customs house remains on the site adjacent to the Customs House. The exterior and interior of the building are substantially as they were when constructed. Exterior features include the curved entrance colonnade, \\"roughcast\\" stucco panels, gable treatments and tuck pointed brickwork. The interior has decorative metal and boarded ceilings, moulded plaster wall decoration and panels, leadlight door panels, cedar joinery, and clerestory windows to the Long Room. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The design of the building is attributed to JS Murdoch, District Architect with the Queensland Works Department, during a period when many great public buildings in Queensland were designed by that office under AB Brady and Thomas Pye. It shows a high degree of technical competence, successfully combining picturesque qualities and domestic scale with the traditional formality of government buildings. Along with several contemporary Customs Houses, it is one of the few Queensland public buildings of that style. Murdoch later had a successful architectural career with the Commonwealth government, playing a substantial role in the development of early Canberra.

Marxist theory states that all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great and imperialist powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the free market and a class system.  Theory  The Marxist theory includes the belief that war will only disappear once a proletarian world revolution has occurred which overthrows free markets and class systems. = Rosa Luxemburg = Marxist philosopher Rosa Luxemburg theorized that imperialism was the result of capitalist countries needing new markets. Expansion of the means of production is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in consumer demand. Since the workers in a capitalist economy would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism. = Vladimir Lenin = Vladimir Lenin expanded upon Marx's ideas, providing an analysis of what Lenin described as monopoly capitalism. In his theory, Lenin suggested that as capitalism developed as a system, monopoly capitalism was the highest stage of its development. According to Lenin, \\"imperialism is capitalism\\" when \\"the formation of international capitalist monopolies will share the world among themselves and the territorial division of the whole world among the greatest capitalist powers is completed\\".Lenin, V.I. (1996) ‚ÄòImperialism: the Highest Stage of Capitalism‚Äô, London, Pluto Press. In this way, Lenin is suggesting that capitalist powers will cause wars with weaker nations to increase their holding of monopoly capital. As capitalism develops, its natural progression is for core capitalist nations to exploit those on the periphery through imperialist wars in search of new markets and resources. Lenin's theory provided the origins of the world-systems theory.Hobden, S. and Wyn Jones, R. (2008) ‚ÄòMarxist Theories of International Relations‚Äô, in Baylis, J., Smith, S., and Owens, P.

He is perhaps best known for participation in the Wounded Knee incident, for allegedly being the person behind the nebulous pseudonym involved with the murder of AIM activist Anna Mae Pictou-Aquash, Mr. X., and for bombing the Mount Rushmore Tourist Center as stated by Paul Demain. In actuality, Hill has never been charged for any of the above offenses. Early life David Harry Hill was born in 1941. =Personal life= Hill lived with one of the female activists, Thelma Rios, during his early days with the American Indian Movement during 1974‚Äì1975. He has been an advocate against alcohol and drug use, and has never been a user of either. Hill lives a healthy lifestyle and encourages youth and others to take care of their bodies. He continually says native people can only afford to fight with one another when they run out of oppressors. Hill is a Sun Dancer and has consistently encouraged the use of sweat lodges throughout Oklahoma since the 1970s. Career Although identified as a cop by ex-wife Thelma Rios, the claim (with respect to Hill being an officer of the law) is disputed. Hill actually worked as a union electrician, Director/Coordinator of Indian Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, Youth Alcohol and Drug Counselor in Oklahoma City Indian Center, Martial Arts Instructor at the Chickasaw Nation and at the Indian Center in Rapid City, SD, Seminole Nation, and as an Artist. Activism Hill has been an activist his whole life and with the American Indian Movement since 1972. He has served with the Leonard Peltier Defense Committee as Director three times and National Advisor to present, was at the Wounded Knee Standoff 1973, the Bureau of Indian Affairs Take Over 1972, Custer South Dakota Riot, Sioux Falls South Dakota Riot, Cass Lake Minnesota Standoff, Coordinator for First Longest Walk from Colorado to Marion Illinois, organized National Horse Rides for Freedom for Leonard Peltier, Jim Thorpe Run from OK to CA 1984, Various Demonstrations and Speaking Engagements against Grand Jury Abuse 1976, Demonstrations against KKK and Police Harassment/Police Brutality of Native People. He organized a demonstration against police brutality in Ponca City, Oklahoma resulting in a grievance committee formation to resolve such issues. Hill has had speaking engagements all over the United States, France, Canada, colleges, civic organizations, and Simon Schuster books paid him as a consultant and speaker on Native American life. He also organized and served as talk show host for two different radio stations in Salt Lake City, Utah, Seminole, Oklahoma and numerous programs on blogtalkradio. Hill also was instrumental in organizing a health outreach program for Native Americans in Salt Lake City, Utah. He also established a house for temporary shelter for indigent Native Americans in Salt Lake City, Utah. Hill organized various demonstrations in Utah in regard to the American Indian Religious Freedom Act and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' representation of Native Americans. Hill organized security during the Comanche tribal standoff in 1980 keeping Bureau of Indian Affairs (known by the acronym BIA) from interfering in Comanche tribal affairs. The standoff ended peacefully. He was hired by Seminole Nation as security consultant during their standoff with BIA officials which ended peacefully. Hill was identified by Rios-Conroy as having provoked the Custer Courthouse Incident riot that unfolded in 1973 following a one-day jail sentence of murderer Darld Schmitz, a White Air Force veteran in the murder of Wesley Bad Heart Bull. According to Rios-Conroy, \\"He started it all, Dave. He provoked the riot. He was right there. He told me so, proudly, several times. He instigated that courtroom riot too. I was there. I saw him start it, punching a cop. At the time everybody thought it was great. He was a warrior. He was a hero and everybody trusted him, including me.\\" She also later said she was misquoted about him being a cop, documented in the book \\"The Unquiet Grave\\" by Steven Hendricks. Rios-Conroy's account is corroborated by a separate account found in Peter Matthiessen's book, In the Spirit of Crazy Horse. Hill has allegedly never in any capacity worked as a cop or collaborated with law enforcement. He has actually filed a letter with his attorney, to the FBI that he would never talk to them ever in the '70s. Hill serves continues to serve as a fierce proponent of Leonard Peltier's innocence, issuing a declaration to the United Nations in 2010 to raise awareness and advocate for the release of the aforementioned individual from prison. He has organized national horse rides and demonstrations to bring awareness to the issue of unjust incarceration through violations of the Constitution against native people, such as what has occurred to Peltier. Hill has served as Director of the Leonard Peltier Defense Committee and Advisor on a number of occasions. Hill was also one of several Native American actors who walked off of the set of the critically panned Adam Sandler movie, The Ridiculous 6. Of the filming conditions, Hill stated that, \\"They were being disrespectful. They were bringing up those same old arguments that Dan Snyder uses in defending the Redskins. But let me tell you, our dignity is not for sale. It is a real shame because a lot of people probably stay because they need a job.\\" Terrorism Between 1975 October 10 and October 14, Harry David Hill, Annie Mae, Leonard Peltier, Darlene \\"Ka-Mook\\" Nichols and Dennis Banks are involved in several bombings in the Pine Ridge area. Hill allegedly harasses Annie Mae about being an informant, and forces her to make bombs so that her fingerprints would be on them, which according to legal theories proposed by AIM attorneys would implicate the government in any criminal planning conspiracy. When asked about these allegations Hill vehemently denies them all. =Mt. Rushmore= On 27 June 1975, Harry David Hill, along with Anthony \\"Tony\\" E. Ament (Thelma Rio's son-in-law), allegedly bombed the Mount Rushmore Tourist Center. On 7 July 1975, a search warrant was served on 1014 Milwaukee Street and several hundred pieces of evidence were seized in conjunction with RESMURS FBI agent shooting case and bombing of Mt. Rushmore. Hill was then charged with possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, unlawful possession of firearms and transportation of firearms. It was later determined the guns were not Hill's, the house was not Hill's and the other items listed as evidence were determined to be no more than an electrician's normal toolbox and work materials, which are not related to bombing. On 11 July 1975, United States Attorney Michael T. Milligan entered a motion to dismiss charges against Hill for charges filed July 7 on the \\"grounds and for the reason that the best interest of justice will be served.\\" Hill was not charged on either the federal or state level, the latter being owed to former South Dakota governor Bill Janklow. The federal charges were dropped for lack of sufficient evidence. The state misdemeanor charge of obliterating the serial number on a firearm was dropped in exchange for Hill pleading guilty to a misdemeanor assault of officers and all the guns were returned to Thelma Rios. =Pine Ridge= Between 1975 October 10 and October 14, Harry David Hill, Annie Mae, Leonard Peltier, Darlene \\"Ka-Mook\\" Nichols and Dennis Banks are involved in several bombings in the Pine Ridge area. Hill allegedly harasses Annie Mae about being an informant, and forces her to make bombs so that her fingerprints would be on them, which according to legal theories proposed by AIM attorneys would implicate the government in any criminal planning conspiracy. Wounded Knee On 26 June 1975, two FBI agents, Jack Kohler and Robert Williams, traveling in separate and unmarked vehicles, were following up on information that a wanted Oglala, Jimmy Eagle, was believed to have recently been at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in Oglala, South Dakota driving a red vehicle. The Agents believed that they had spotted Jimmy Eagle and followed him onto the Jumping Bull property. After agents entered the Jumping Bull compound to serve, on Jimmy Eagle, a warrant for robbery and alleged torture, a fierce shootout ensued with a group of American Indian activists. Several activists fled the scene. Agents Kohler and Williams, as well as Navajo Joe Killsright Stuntz, were killed in the ensuing shootout. The FBI compiled a list of suspects who the Bureau believed was responsible for the deaths of the Agents. Harry David (Mr. X) Hill was on the original list of subjects, but was later dropped from its lists along with a lot of others, because of investigation later showed they were not there at the Jumping Bull Ranch on the day in question. One source also identified Hill as the shooter of African-American activist Ray Robinson. =Mr. X= Mr. X is a pseudonym referring to the purported \\"true\\" murderer or murders of activist Anna Mae Aquash and two FBI agents. Mr. X is said to have been one of the triggermen who shot Annie Mae in the back of the head. Rios-Conroy claimed that Hill was Anna Mae's murderer, although she was arrested and pleaded guilty to being party to the murder. She also named attorney Bruce Ellison as being with her at that time. This name was first invoked by the defense of Leonard Peltier during his trial in 1977, where the defense alluded the murderer(s), Mr. X, escaped from the murder scene in a mysterious red pick-up truck, or been the name of a Native American killed earlier that day, Joseph Stuntz. AIM members Dino Butler, John Trudell and Vernon Bellecourt claim that Hill was the Mr. X behind the mask, saying he was responsible for shooting the agents (although this account is highly contested by other AIM members). John Trudell later met with federal authorities and subsequently testified against former AIM members, John Graham and Arlo Looking Cloud, resulting in their imprisonment. However, according to American Indian Movement, \\"Mr. X\\" was a hoax. Along with Robert Robideau, and Ward Churchill, Hill was also implicated in the creation of this alias. According to another AIM activist, Darelle \\"Dino\\" Butler, \\"There is no Mr. X. There was no white man coming to our camp that day bringing dynamite. Those are all lies created to keep Leonard in jail longer.\\" At a later date, Robert Robideau, who along with Dino Butler, were tried for the agents' death and were acquitted by reason of self-defense. Dino Butler in a taped statement said he did not go down to the agents' cars. On 12 June 2000, in an interview conducted from Leavenworth Prison, Peltier was asked about the nature of the true identity of Mr. X, Peltier replied, \\"Mr. X is, could be anybody. I mean there's no doubt that somebody killed these agents, but we don't know who he is.\\" See alsoAmerican Indian Movement *Wounded Knee incident *Wesley Bad Heart Bull *Ray Robinson *Anna Mae Pictou-Aquash References External links Category:20th-century Native Americans Category:Native American leaders Category:Native American activists Category:Members of the American Indian Movement Category:American civil rights activists Category:Terrorist incidents in North America in 1975 Category:Terrorism in the United States Category:Terrorist incidents in the United States in the 1970s Category:Choctaw people Category:1941 births Category:Living people ","title":"Harry Hill (activist)"},{"id":"48987384","text":"Sarisophora brachymita is a moth in the family Lecithoceridae.

In 1534 he obtained the rights of a south of the Straits of Magellan. He was appointed by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor as an adelantado of Terra Australis in 1539. S√°nchez de la Hoz, served as secretary to Pizarro in Peru during the conquest of Cuzco and wrote an account of the conquest of Peru. While the original manuscript was lost, the work was preserved in Italian translation and has subsequently been translated to other languages, serving as a valuable account of both the Spanish conquest and Incan ethnography. After some financial success, he returned to Spain and was granted leave by Emperor Charles V to return to the New World where he conflicted with rival conquistador Pedro de Valdivia over different grants to lands south of Peru. In 1547 Francisco de Villagra, one of Valdivia's men, had S√°nchez de la Hoz executed for leading a rebellion. According to Argentina and Chile the capitulaci√≥n granted to S√°nchez de la Hoz proves the Spanish Empire had claims and an animus occupandi on the lands that would later be called Antarctica. Given that Chile and Argentina have historically successfully established their border based on the uti possidetis iuris principle of international law the S√°nchez de la Hoz grant forms part of their arguments for territorial claims in Antarctica.

It was designed by Thomas Henry Fitzgerald and built in 1865 onwards. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 19 November 2010.  History  The Mackay General Cemetery was the Mackay region's principal cemetery and is one of the earliest regional cemeteries in Queensland. Its site was surveyed by licensed surveyor and Mackay identity Thomas Henry Fitzgerald (owner of the Alexandra sugar plantation) in late 1865. Closed to new burials in the 1990s, it is the burial place of about 15,500 people. The cemetery was surveyed soon after the township of Mackay was established on the banks of the Pioneer River. The first town allotments were sold in 1863 about two years after the Pioneer Valley began to be settled by pastoralists. Fitzgerald considered that the cemetery site was suitable because, as he stated, it was: > \\"nearly a mile from the town boundary. The greater portion of it is quite > dry and rich black soil in which it will be very easy to dig graves.\\" The earliest documented burial in the cemetery occurred in July 1866. The Mackay deaths register, in which that burial is recorded, notes two earlier burials (October 1864 and June 1865) there. It is possible that these occurred at the Mackay General Cemetery before it was officially surveyed; however, it is more likely that they took place at one of the cemeteries that ceased to be used after the General Cemetery was opened. Mackay General Cemetery is one of the earliest major cemeteries in the region, being contemporary to South Rockhampton Cemetery (1860) and West End Cemetery at Townsville (1865). From the 1870s, the cemetery was divided into sections according to religious denomination and included an \\"alien section\\" (for those with other beliefs). This typical feature of cemeteries established in late Victorian times was a vestige of the control formerly by the Church of England (now known as the Anglican Church) over burials which originally took place in churchyards. Initially in Australia, the Anglican Church had control of public cemeteries. This situation was disputed by other denominations and began to change from the 1820s with the establishment of denominational areas within cemeteries. Then, from the 1840s, culminating in the Queensland Cemeteries Act 1865, government legislated for the transfer of responsibility for administration of cemeteries from the church to an appointed board of trustees. Typically, cemeteries established from the late 20th century have not retained denominational divisions. The Mackay Cemetery Trust was appointed in 1870 and on 4 April 1873 the rules and regulations for the Mackay Cemetery were gazetted. The first trustees were local luminaries Thomas Henry Fitzgerald, John Spiller (Pioneer Plantation), David Hay Dalrymple (Mayor of Mackay), George Smith and William McBryde (Secretary). The cemetery continued to operate under a board of trustees until 1934 when legislation was introduced that handed the control of cemeteries to the local authorities. The general layout of the cemetery began to take shape from 1877 when tenders were called for cemetery roads; the present main road into the shelter shed dates to 1882. The Camphor Laurels (Cinnamomum camphora) that line the main central road date to 1899. Fences, lych-gate, mortuary chapel and iron gates were also erected in the late 19th century, but none of these are extant. Buildings in the cemetery including the tool shed and shelter shed date from the late 20th century. The layout of the Mackay General Cemetery is typical of that employed in late Victorian cemeteries both in Australia and Britain, which were strongly influenced by the principles of the cemetery design movement encapsulated in the book by horticultural journalist, author and landscape architect, John Claudius Loudon, On the laying out, planting and managing of cemeteries (1843). Above all Loudon recommended a practical approach to cemetery design that was responsive to the nature of the selected site; so on level sites formal layouts of orthogonal grave rows, walks and drives were employed, while on hilly sites broad sweeps were used to ease gradients. Other standard features included a central carriageway lined by evergreen trees, as were other paths in preference to groupings of trees, leading to a focal structure in the centre of the cemetery, use of plant species with some symbolism related to death or mourning, and a grid pattern of graves accessible by paths or roadways. The aesthetic qualities of these layouts represented a shift in the preferred balance of formal and informal elements within the cemetery landscape towards an increased degree of formality and often symmetry, which had a practical advantage in being easier and less expensive to lay out. The wide variety of elaborate monuments was also a feature of late Victorian cemeteries and reflected popular taste at the time. From the interwar period the trend was towards simpler more economical monuments and away from curbing and fenced plots. This trend culminated in the development of low maintenance lawn cemeteries after World War II with plaques set close to, or flush with the ground. An exception to this trend was the reappearance, towards the end of the 20th century, of more elaborate monuments associated with some ethnic populations. The variety of monuments and inscriptions reflects the changing demography of the Mackay region from its earliest days until the closure of the cemetery in the 1990s. A range of ethnic and cultural groups came to Mackay to work in the region's main industry: sugar cane growing and processing. Sugar cane was introduced to the Mackay area in 1863 and soon developed into a major industry. By 1872 Mackay mills produced 40 per cent of the total Queensland sugar production and 37 per cent of its rum. Heavy regulation of the sugar industry from 1915 ensured the prosperity of the region. It has become one of Queensland's main sugar cane growing areas and produces about a third of the sugar in Queensland. The state produces most of the nation's sugar. South Sea Islanders were the earliest and most numerous of the ethnic groups who came to the region to work in the sugar industry. First brought to the Mackay area to provide cheap manual labour in the 1860s, they remained a major presence until the trade in Islander labour ceased in 1904. Mackay hosted the largest population of South Sea Islanders in Australia. Other ethnic groups employed in the sugar industry included Javanese (from the 1880s), Singhalese (Sri Lankans) (from the 1880s), Japanese, and Southern Europeans, notably Maltese (from 1912) and Italians. Over 1000 Japanese migrated to Australia between 1888 and 1901 to work in the sugar cane industry; for a short time in the 1890s a Japanese consular official was established in Townsville. Chinese and Indians were also a presence, as in most other places in north Queensland. The cemetery contains South Sea Islander, Japanese, Javanese (Muslim) and Singhalese graves. The Japanese graves date to the early 20th century. South Sea Islander graves in the cemetery include that of Kwailiu Fatana'ona (John Fatnahoona), who was recruited from Malaita in the Solomon Islands to work in the cane fields of the Mackay district and was buried in 1904 aged 40 years. The Muslim graves include a slab design finished with decorative tiles in a manner that is typically Indonesian. There are also Italian and Maltese graves. For some of these ethnic groups, particularly the Japanese and Javanese, graves are the only extant physical evidence of their presence in the Mackay region between the late 19th and early 20th century. The cemetery also contains a number of graves of early identities in the region. The graves of people associated with the establishment of the sugar industry include plantation and mill owners, Gustav Muller of Hilldale, Charles Walker of the Dumbleton Plantation, Charles King of Meadowlands Plantation and Mill, William Williams of the Lorne Plantation, and James Carey of the Racecourse Mill. Other notable burials include monuments for: Andrew Diehm who accompanied the explorer William Landsborough on his explorations of the Burdekin and Bowen area; Houston Stewart Dalrymple Hay, the Harbour Master and Pilot for Mackay in the 1870s for whom Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point are named; and former mayors of Mackay including Henry Black (after whom Blacks Beach is named) who held the office three times. Many of the district's early clergy are buried in the cemetery including the Catholic priest, Father Pierre-Marie Bucas (after whom Bucasia was named). In the early 1950s the Pioneer Shire Council decided to close the Mackay General Cemetery and to open a new cemetery in Brickworks Court, Glenella, on the north side of the Pioneer River. The first burial at the new cemetery took place on 11 September 1951. Following subsequent burials it was discovered that the soil at the Glenella was not suitable for burials and the council decided to re-open the Mackay General Cemetery for a further two years. The last burial took place at Glenella on 17 June 1952. In 1953 the Council exhumed more than 60 bodies from it and re-interred them in the Mackay General Cemetery. In the 1990s it was decided that no further plots would be sold in the Mackay General Cemetery. Walkerston to the south-west of Mackay remains open for those who wish to bury their deceased loved ones and to erect burial vaults; otherwise the Mount Bassett Lawn Cemetery, opened in 1953, has replaced the Mackay General Cemetery.  Description  The Mackay General Cemetery is an reserve, located west of the inner city area of Mackay at the far western end of Shakespeare Street. It is bounded by Hume Street to the west, Cemetery Road to the south, Holland Street to the east, and to the north by cane fields that extend to the Pioneer River. The part of the reserve determined to be of cultural heritage significance is that used for burials, excluding the north-west corner where crops are being grown and there are no burials. The site is largely flat apart from a gully near the western end that contains a drain way. The main entrance is from Holland Street, at the intersection with Shakespeare Street. From here a curving central drive runs west through the centre of the cemetery, lined with trees on one side. The edges of the cemetery are unfenced; however rows of trees line the footpaths on the southern and eastern sides. The only buildings on the site are a shelter shed, located adjacent to the central drive in the centre of the cemetery, and some recent sheds. The cemetery is laid out in a grid and subdivided into denominational sections, with specific areas designated for Church of England/Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist, Lutheran and Catholic burials. A section for minority and ethnic based religions is located in the far western corner. Newer burial sections are located north of the central drive, while a series of grass roadways run north-south between the denominational sections, linking the central drive with Cemetery Road. A variety of monuments are found throughout the cemetery, including upright slabs, obelisks, crosses, angels, urns and bibles. They are constructed in a variety of styles and materials and feature a wide range of inscriptions in a number of languages. Headstones are made of marble, sandstone, iron, granite, and concrete. Grave surrounds include iron fencing or lacework but are predominantly concrete. Monuments and grave surrounds in the Protestant sections are generally painted white. An unusual locally made monument is a memorial to several members of the Cameron family. This elaborate cast iron, classical style aedicule is surmounted by a cross. Other monuments of note include several smaller cast-iron grave markers with iron lacework borders. These rectangular panels have inscriptions in relief, frequently laid out in wavy lines. More recent headstones and graves are less ornate, such as slab and desk variations. There are a number of Muslim graves in the cemetery. One of these consists of a raised slab clad with ornate ceramic tiles; it has a diamond shaped headstone. Two others each consist of a concrete slab with small, simple upright headstone at each end. The graveyard population comprises a wide variety of people including returned soldiers, Aboriginal people, South Sea Islanders, Japanese, Javanese, German, Maltese, Italian, French, English, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish immigrants. The work of a number of monumental masons is represented in the Mackay General Cemetery. The majority of mason-marked graves indicate that most people contracted the firm of Melrose and Fenwick. Other masons represented include J. Hanson of Sydney, J. Petrie & Son of Brisbane and of Townsville, A.L. Petrie of Toowong, F.M. Downes, Bowser Co Ltd., Brett & Nott, A.M. Rappell of Mackay, Jaceurs & Son of Royal Park Melbourne, B. & H. Jennings of Rockhampton, Lowther & Sons, W. Robertson & Co. of Mackay, J. Simmonds of Brisbane, C.M. & C. Mackay Iron Works and F.M. Allan of Rockhampton. A number of war graves plaques have been placed on the graves of Australian servicemen by the Australian War Graves Commission. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission record two servicemen of World War I and ten of World War II as being buried here. Plantings throughout the cemetery are largely confined to the perimeter and central drive. An avenue of mature Camphor Laurels (Cinnamomum camphora) lines the northern side of the central drive. A cluster of other mature trees are found along the Holland Street boundary, north of the main entrance. A few lone trees are also randomly located in some burial sections (such as Methodist section no.1). The shelter shed has a rectangular hipped roof, clad in corrugated iron and supported by square posts. Decorative arches span between the posts and a solid balustrade runs along the north and south edges with timber bench seating along the inner face. A wide, grassy gully, with concrete drain at the bottom, separates Methodist section No.3 and Catholic section No.2 near the western end of the cemetery. Views of farmland are obtained to the north, forming a picturesque backdrop to viewing the cemetery. Other picturesque effects are created by the curving central drive with its avenue of trees.  Heritage listing  Mackay General Cemetery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 19 November 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Mackay General Cemetery is one of the earliest cemeteries established in the Mackay Whitsunday region (1865), and having been in continuous use for more than 140 years until the 1990s when it closed, remains its largest. The cemetery therefore provides important evidence of the history and demography of this key sugar-producing region (one of Queensland's oldest and largest) in particular its cultural and ethnic diversity. The cemetery contains the graves of people from a range of the ethnic groups employed by the sugar industry through time, including South Sea Islanders, Javanese, Singhalese (Sri Lankans), Japanese, Maltese and Italians. For some of these groups, the graves in this cemetery are the only extant physical evidence of their presence in the Mackay region between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The cemetery is also important in demonstrating the evolution of burial practices over this period. The progressive layering, development and diversity of styles of memorialisation within the cemetery document changing attitudes to death and fashions in funerary ornamentation since the 1860s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The chief cemetery of Queensland's oldest and largest sugar-producing region, Mackay General Cemetery is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a late 19th century public cemetery in continuous use for more than 140 years. These comprise: its denominational divisions including an alien section intended for non-Christian burials, the layout of graves in a grid divided by paths and roadways, the central carriageway lined by evergreen trees, and the variety of monuments illustrating a range of religious and cultural preferences through time. These key characteristics combine to create an atmosphere of repose and reflection, a quality recognised as important to properly honouring and remembering the dead by many Queenslanders. The cemetery contains examples of a range of key monumental styles dating from the late 19th century until the 1990s. These include the ornate Cameron monument, made locally from cast iron, and the work of numerous monumental masons from throughout Queensland represented there.

This species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the 1767 12th edition of his Systema Naturae. Description As its name suggests, Coronula diadema resembles a crown in appearance, but as it grows it becomes more cylindrical; large specimens may be tall and in diameter. There are six broad wall plates surrounding a hexagonal orifice at the top, which is protected by a pair of opercular valves. The plates have fine longitudinal striations and the lower half often have irregular transverse striations. Distribution and habitat C. diadema is found on the external surface of whales. When discussing this species, the zoologist Charles Darwin (who devoted much of his career to barnacles) stated that he knew of the precise locations where four specimens were found, the arctic seas around Scandinavia, the east coast of North America, near the coast of the British Isles, and from the Gulf Stream. Another reported location was New Zealand, but Darwin suspected that this was an error, and might be Coronula reginae. The host whales are mostly baleen whales, particularly humpback whales (Megaptera novaengliae), with the barnacles attaching themselves to the head, the flukes, the flippers, various grooves and the genital slit. This barnacle has also been found on the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), the southern right whale (Eubalaena australis), the fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) and the northern bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon ampullatus). Life cycle Most barnacles are hermaphrodites and exhibit cross-fertilisation, so they need to be clustered closely together in order to be able to breed. An individual acting as a male extends his long penis to impregnate the mantle cavity of another individual in close proximity. Here internal fertilisation takes place and the embryos are brooded until the first moult. The free-swimming nauplius larvae form part of the plankton and pass through six moults before becoming non-feeding cyprid larvae. Laboratory experiments suggest that the cyprid larvae are induced to settle and undergo metamorphosis into juvenile barnacles in response to chemical cues from the skin of suitable host whales.

The purpose of Snare was to obtain laser emitter and other related data from special Soviet Tu-16 Badger, Tu-95 Bear, and M-4 Bison long range bombers flying observation missions of U.S. Navy carrier battle groups from Russian soil. Snare operations were conducted for a short period during RVAH-12's 1971-1972 Mediterranean deployment aboard . RVAH-12's Cold War / Vietnam-era deployments were as follows: *11 March 1966 - 26 October 1966, RVAH-12 was embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment.Grove, M. & Miller, J; Aerofax Minigraph 9, North American Rockwell A3J/A-5A Vigilante; Aerofax, Inc., Arlington, TX c1989, p15; *29 April - 4 December 1967, RVAH-12 was embarked aboard for a Western Pacific (WESTPAC) and Vietnam deployment. On 13 August 1967, an RVAH-12 RA-5C, BuNo 151634, was shot down over North Vietnam. Both crewmen LCDR Leo Hyatt and LTJG Wayne Goodermote ejected successfully, were captured by the North Vietnamese, and were repatriated to the United States on 14 March 1973. On 17 August 1967, an RVAH-12 RA-5C, BuNo 149302, was hit by antiaircraft fire over North Vietnam. The aircraft failed to return to the ship and the pilot, Commander Laurent Dion, and the reconnaissance attack navigator, Lieutenant (junior grade) Charles Hom, were listed with an initial finding of missing in action, followed later by a presumptive finding of killed in action. *Budgetary pressures of the Vietnam War force the Department of Defense to close several stateside air bases, to include Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida. Upon return from their 1967 deployment, RVAH-12 shifts home stations from NAS Sanford to the former Turner Air Force Base, renamed Naval Air Station Albany, Georgia, effective 1 May 1968. *22 July 1968 - 29 April 1969, RVAH-12 was embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. *10 April-21 December 1970, RVAH-12 was embarked aboard for a WESTPAC and Vietnam deployment. *16 September 1971 - 16 March 1972, RVAH-12 was embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. *5 January-11 October 1973, RVAH-12 was embarked on for a WESTPAC and Vietnam deployment. =RVAH-12 / Cold War (post-Vietnam)= With the end of the Vietnam War, RVAH-12 returned to stateside training and forward deployed Cold War presence operations aboard Fleet aircraft carriers. In addition, budgetary pressures and force reductions following the end of the Vietnam War force the Department of Defense to once again close several stateside air bases, to include Naval Air Station Albany, Georgia. In January 1974, RVAH-12 shifted home stations from NAS Albany to Naval Air Station Key West, Florida. RVAH-12's subsequent deployments were as follows: *17 September 1974 ‚Äì 20 May 1975, RVAH-12 was embarked on for a WESTPAC deployment. *30 March 1977 - 21 October 1977, RVAH-12 was embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. * 3 October 1978 - 7 February 1979, for a Mediterranean deployment and RVAH-12's final overseas deployment.  On 31 October 1978, an RVAH-12 RA-5C, BuNo 156610, experienced a landing mishap ashore at Naval Station Rota, Spain. The aircraft was damaged beyond economical repair and was stricken in place at NS Rota where it continued to be used as a crash and egress trainer for the station's crash, fire and rescue personnel. Attrition of airframes and the increasing maintenance and flight hour costs of the RA-5C in a constrained defense budget environment forced the Navy to incrementally retire the RA-5C and sunset the RVAH community beginning in mid-1974. Carrier-based reconnaissance was concurrently conducted by the active duty VFP community at Naval Air Station Miramar and the Naval Reserve VFP community at Andrews Air Force Base / NAF Washington with the RF-8G Crusader until 29 March 1987, when the last RF-8G was retired and the mission was fully transferred to the active duty and Naval Reserve VF community at NAS Miramar, Naval Air Station Oceana, Naval Air Station Dallas and NAS JRB Fort Worth as a secondary role with the F-14 Tomcat equipped with the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System. Following its return from its final Mediterranean deployment in 1979, RVAH-12 was disestablished at Naval Air Station Key West on 2 July 1979 following 14 years and 1 day of active naval service.

The first version is in two movements with a duration of about 11 minutes in performance; the second is variously described as being in one or in three (continuous) movements with a total duration of about seven minutes. The scores of both versions are dedicated to √Ångela Acevedo. History Esquinas was originally composed in 1931, in two movements and scored for chamber orchestra with a soprano voice in the first movement . According to one source, a version of Esquinas for orchestra alone was premiered on 20 November 1931 by the Orquesta Sinf√≥nica de M√©xico under the composer's baton . Two years later, in October 1933, Revueltas decided to make a new version of Esquinas. The second version is more compact, less repetitive, without abandoning the collage-form structure of short episodes. The two final movements are combined into one, and several orchestrational problems of the original version are corrected or improved (; ). This abbreviated version is regarded as either a single-movement composition , or as broken into three movements . The composer's note for Esquinas reads: Instrumentation The first version of Esquinas is unpublished and details of the scoring are unknown. The second version is scored for a chamber orchestra which, according to the manuscript of the score held by the Free Library of Philadelphia (Fleisher Collection), consists of piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, E clarinet, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (including xylophone), and strings. The publisher's (Peer International) website gives a slightly different instrumentation: 3 flutes (third doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, cor angalis, E clarinet, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 4 horns, D trumpet, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (2 Indian drums, xylophone, ch, bass drum, suspended cymbal, woodblock, tamtam, triangle, jingles, g√ºiro), harp, and strings. Analysis Street vendor The original version of Esquinas consists of three movements, the second and third of which are played without a break: #Lento sostenuto‚ÄîAllegro moderato ma agitato‚ÄîAndante‚ÄîVivo‚ÄîLento sostenuto #Allegretto #Allegro Esquinas offers an early example of Revueltas's Mexican popular-musical modernism, \\"whose themes are shattered at the moment of their birth, a struggle that does not permit its features to be heard emerging, decomposed, barely sketched and acclimated\\" . In the second version of the work, Revueltas discarded the vocal part in the first movement of the original. Although it is difficult to be certain about the composer's reasoning, it was most likely a purely practical consideration. There are several difficulties with the part. First, it comes to only 24 bars in all, consisting of four very short, widely separated outbursts. Second, the required registers exceed the normal range of a typical vocal tessitura, creating problematic technical difficulties. Third, the actual function of the singer is not clear: is she a soloist, or should she be regarded as a sort of \\"supplemental instrument\\" in the orchestra? In turn, where should the singer be placed on the stage, and how should the melodies be sung, since there are no words and the composer has provided no indication for vocalization ? It has been suggested that the soprano voice may represent the score's dedicatee, √Ångela Acevedo, with whom Revueltas had been living since 1930 and would marry in 1932, and to whom he also dedicated the scores of Ventanas, Pari√°n, and Caminos . The presence of a vocal part in the first version, however, suggests \\"In a direct and very natural way, the evocation of the sung street cry leads to the interpretation of two other cries of Esquinas, which call attention to themselves because, among other reasons, they are enunciated by a female voice. The unusual way of incorporating the voice (since she is neither a soloist, nor is part of the orchestra, and her participation is brief and sporadic) appears to be explained by its communicative function serving the composer to highlight or underline certain musical elements he considered significant\\" . It has been proposed that the musical construction of Esquinas is based on the cries of Mexican street vendors who once populated the urban landscape . Revueltas does not quote actual street cries, but rather imitates certain of their stereotypical aspects. The incorporation of these characteristic features merely suggests a semantic marking, enabling or enhancing their identification as a musical sign of cultural origin . Reception As an instance of Revueltas's harsher, more abstract, and modernist style, Esquinas was poorly received by audiences initially, in contrast to his more lyrical and tonal works, such as Colorines and Janitzio . Esquinas, in either of its two versions, has remained one of Revueltas's least-performed works, and the first recording was released only in 2004 Discography Silvestre Revueltas: Obra orquestal in√©dita/Unknown Orchestral Works.

The project was announced by the state government in May 2014, but was cancelled following a change of government at the March 2017 state election. The proposal included multiple stages: a extension of Roe Highway to Stock Road (Roe 8); a second stage linking Roe 8 to Stirling Highway, bypassing fourteen sets of traffic signals (Roe 9); and a final stage connecting into the Port of Fremantle. The plan included mandatory GPS tracking of all vehicles over an undisclosed size or weight with a charge per kilometre being applied for vehicles travelling along the route between Muchea and North Fremantle. The extension would have taken the highway from its current terminus at Kwinana Freeway approximately further west through the Beeliar Wetlands to Stock Road, near Forrest Road in Coolbellup. The proposed route was along or within the vicinity of an existing road reserve in the Perth Metropolitan Region Scheme. h The project's environmental assessment by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) along with the approval of the development by WA Government Minister Albert Jacob was ruled invalid by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court on 16 December 2015. On 30 March 2016 Greg McIntyre QC, acting for Corina Abraham, lodged writs in the Supreme Court of Western Australia, alleging that Minister of Aboriginal Affairs Peter Collier and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs cultural committee denied procedural fairness when it failed to consult her. On 24 August 2016 the Supreme Court dismissed Abraham's challenge. The Save Beeliar Wetlands group tried to challenge the highway in the High Court, but the court dismissed the challenge on 16 December 2016, saying there wasn't sufficient grounds for a challenge. Construction began in late 2016, following the signing of the contract to build Roe 8 by the Liberal state government. Opposition to the project continued, with protests and a second senate inquiry. The freight link was an election issue in the 2017 state election. The incoming McGowan Government states it intends to scrap the entire project.Labor vows to scrap Perth Freight-Link if it wins election The Guardian 4 January 2017WA Labor vows to axe Perth Freight Link The West Australian 4 January 2017 Route The Perth Freight Link was proposed to connect the terminus of Roe Highway (at the Kwinana Freeway) with the Port of Fremantle. In conjunction with existing highways and the Gateway WA and NorthLink WA projects, the Freight Link would have formed part of an free-flowing route between Muchea and the port. =Stage 1 (Roe 8)= Section 1, also known as Roe 8, was to be a extension to Roe Highway, from the Kwinana Freeway to Stock Road, cutting through a portion of the Beeliar Wetlands. =Stage 2 (Roe 9)= Stage 2 (Roe 9 ) would have linked the Roe 8 extension to East Fremantle. The original route considered was via Stock Road, Leach Highway, and High Street, upgraded with grade- separated interchanges, bypassing fourteen sets of traffic signals. Following community opposition to the plan, which would require residential properties to be compulsorily acquired and the demolition of homes, alternative routes were considered by the government. As of November 2015, the second stage had been postponed indefinitely, due to the intricacies and costs involved. In January 2017 Premier Colin Barnett announced a tunnel from Stock Road to High Street in East Fremantle 3 km short of the port, including crossing of the Swan River. The tunnel plan was revealed to cost at least $5.8b by documents that Main Roads had fought to prevent being released under a Freedom of Information request. An additional $2.7b would be needed to cross the Swan River. This option would impact the suburbs of Leighton and Mosman Park and see an increase in truck traffic to the north through Cottesloe. =Stage 3 (Roe 10)= A third stage would have seen the link cross the Swan River and connect into the port. There were no proposals made for the design, cost, or timing of this final section. =Roe Highway widening= Another section involved upgrading Roe Highway between Tonkin Highway and Orrong Road, adding a third lane in each direction and constructing a new bridge across the freight railway. History =Background= Roe Highway was first proposed in 1955 by Gordon Stephenson as part of what was to become the Metropolitan Region Planning Scheme. The highway was intended to form the southern and eastern sections of a ring route around the Perth metropolitan area.New Roe Highway link to open (April 1998). Western Roads: official journal of Main Roads Western Australia, 21(1), p.4. Perth: Main Roads Western Australia. In the 1950s, Stephenson planned for Roe Highway to continue westwards towards Fremantle, through South Fremantle along Marine Terrace and then north to connect with Stirling Highway and the Port of Fremantle. As part of the plan, in 1974 Stirling Highway was extended from its then terminus north of the Swan River southwards to Canning Highway. Over a period of approximately 20 years, Main Roads Western Australia procured land, and in 1985, Stirling Highway was extended southwards from Canning Highway to High Street (the western continuation of Leach Highway). The remaining 3 km strip of land south of High Street then became known as the Fremantle Eastern Bypass. At the southern end of the proposed Fremantle Eastern Bypass, an 8 km east-west road reservation was proclaimed, and became known as Roe Highway stage 8. With a change of state governments in 2001, the planned Fremantle Eastern Bypass / Roe Highway stage 8 was cancelled, with a commitment by the government to sell the land reserved for the Fremantle Eastern Bypass. As part of the funding arrangement for Roe Highway stages 6 and 7, the federal government stipulated that the Roe Highway stage 8 reservation was to be retained. Following a change in state governments in September 2008, planning work commenced on an extension of the Roe Highway from Kwinana Freeway to Stock Road.http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/BuildingRoads/Projects/UrbanProjects/Roe/Pages/roe.aspx Planning was also under way for an upgrade of High Street to dual carriageway between Stirling Highway and Carrington Street. =Project announced= Rethink the Link protest signs against the Perth Freight Link, 2015 The Perth Freight Link project was announced in May 2014, with joint funding between the state and federal governments. The announcement included plans for a toll on the route, which would only apply to trucks. In December 2014, the state government revealed that they planned to construct the Freight Link between early 2016 and 2019, and that the toll would apply on the truck route between Muchea (north of Perth) and Fremantle, once the link was completed. Uncertainty over the project's scope and time frame emerged in mid-2015. Following community opposition to the second stage, which would require residential properties to be compulsorily acquired and the demolition of homes, alternative routes were considered by the government. The uncertainty over stage 2 remained for over a year. In September 2016, there still was not a decision on the stage's timing, nor its route, but a tunnel was considered by Barnett as the most likely option. A tunnel under White Gum Valley, Beaconsfield and Hilton was committed to on 15 January 2017. =Controversies= The project is controversial, and has been the subject of concern and protest from multiple community groups on various issues. The main areas of contention relate to environmental issues, as well as the cost and justification for the project. The state government claims the project is needed to reduce congestion in Perth's south and enhance road safety, and would be required for any future port development in the vicinity. The necessity is disputed by opponents of the Freight Link, including the opposition Labor party and the Greens; McGowan has called it a \\"road to nowhere\\" and \\"waste of money\\". A 2015 report from Infrastructure Australia concluded that, while there would be economic benefit, the project was hurriedly prepared, and detailed assessments were not completed for alternatives. In 2016, a Senate inquiry unanimously denounced the Freight Link, and suggested the federal government redirect funding to a new outer harbour at Cockburn Sound proposed by the City of Kwinana. The route of the Roe 8 section takes it through the Beeliar Wetlands, a habitat for the endangered Carnaby's black cockatoo. The Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) approved the Roe Highway extension in 2013, following a review that included over 3,000 public submissions, and Environment Minister Albert Jacob confirmed his approval on 2 July 2015. Preliminary site works began on the project during November 2015, which drew protests with many people being given move-on orders preventing them from being in the area. As well as environmental issues with the extension of Roe Highway, Stephen Marley, president of the Livestock and Rural Transport Association of Western Australia, expressed concern in December 2014 that the cost of the truck toll will be passed on to farmers, and in May 2015, Palmyra residents protested the proposed compulsory acquisition and demolition of their homes to make way for Stage 2 of the link. Local people are opposed to the proposed route through the Bibra Lake area, including the local indigenous people, who described the area as a birthing place, the \\"King Edward Memorial Hospital for aboriginal people\\". The WA Road Transport Association has been critical of the November 2015 decision to postpone stage two of the project, as \\"Roe 8 alone delivers none of the productivity benefits promised by the full freight link to the port\\". They would not support a toll if implemented before the link to the port was completed. Such a toll was a prospect put forward by Barnett that month, though this was contradicted by Transport Minister Dean Nalder. =Legal challenges= In September 2015 the group Save the Beeliar Wetlands took legal action against the EPA, arguing that the authority did not follow its own policies. The project's environmental assessment by the EPA along with the approval of the development by WA Government Minister Albert Jacob was ruled invalid by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court on 16 December 2015. The state government appealed, and the ruling was unanimously overturned by the Court of Appeal on 15 July 2016, as the EPA's policies were \\"not mandatory considerations\\". The Save Beeliar Wetlands group tried to challenge the highway in the High Court, but the court dismissed the challenge on 16 December 2016, saying there were not sufficient grounds for a challenge. On 30 March 2016 Greg McIntyre QC, acting for Corina Abraham, lodged writs in the Supreme Court of Western Australia, alleging that Minister of Aboriginal Affairs Peter Collier and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs cultural committee denied procedural fairness when it failed to consult her. On 24 August 2016 the Supreme Court dismissed Abraham's challenge. =Commencement of construction works= The contract to build Roe 8 was approved and signed by state government in October 2016. There had been ongoing protests since construction activities commenced, including on 6 December 2016, the day after temporary fencing was erected. The 23 February 2017 public Senate Committee hearing A public Senate Committee hearing was held on 23 February 2017, regarding the Roe 8 project's alleged failure to adhere to Federal environmental conditions. State Environment Minister Albert Jacob denied the allegations. =State election and aftermath= During the 2017 state election, the incoming McGowan Government stated it intended to scrap the entire project. On 12 March, Main Roads and the contractors agreed to suspend work on the project.

It is a small grey shrub with purple to lilac-coloured flowers which have heart-shaped sepals at their base. Description Eremophila cordatisepala is a shrub which grows to a height of . Its leaves and branches are covered with a layer of greyish to yellowish branched hairs, but unlike others in the genus, lack resin glands and are not sticky or shiny. The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and are elliptic to lance-shaped, mostly long and wide and are often thickened or have their edges rolled under. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a slightly flattened stalk long which, like the leaves, is covered with a layer of branched hairs. There are 5 green to purple sepals which are hairy, lance- shaped to egg-shaped at first but enlarge as the flowers develop. After flowering, the sepal become heart-shaped and long. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is purple to lilac- coloured outside and white with purple spots inside. The outside of the tube and the petal lobes are almost glabrous but the inside of the tube is filled with woolly hairs. The petal lobes are rounded but have a small point in their centres. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed within the tube. The fruits are oval to cone-shaped, long and are woody with a papery covering. Taxonomy and naming Eremophila cordatisepala was first formally described by Lindsay Stuart Smith in 1956 and the description was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Queensland. The type specimen was collected by Stanley Thatcher Blake west of Windorah. The specific epithet is from the Latin cordati-, 'heart-shaped' and sepala, 'sepals'. Distribution and habitat This eremophila occurs in south-western Queensland and south-eastern Northern Territory where it usually grows on hillsides in red-brown clay soils. Conservation status Eremophila cordatisepala is classified as \\"near threatened\\" in the Northern Territory but as of \\"least concern\\" in Queensland. Use in horticulture A feature of this eremophila is its large sepals which, along with its silvery-grey leaves, help to make this small attractive shrub suitable as a container plant. It can be propagated from cuttings and grown in full sun or partial shrub in well-drained soil. It tolerates long dry spells but is damaged by severe frost.

Their leader was Ammon Bundy, who participated in the 2014 Bundy standoff at his father's Nevada ranch. Other members of the group were loosely affiliated with non-governmental militias and the sovereign citizen movement. The organizers were seeking an opportunity to advance their view that the federal government is constitutionally required to turn over most of the federal public land they manage to the individual states, in particular land managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), United States Forest Service (USFS), and other agencies. In 2015, the militants believed they could do this by protesting the treatment of two area ranchers convicted of federal land arson, who they believed were wrongly convicted. This is despite the fact that the men in question, father and son Dwight and Steven Dwight Hammond, did not want their help. The occupation began when Bundy led an armed party to the refuge headquarters following a peaceful public rally in the nearby city of Burns. By February 11, all of the militants had surrendered or withdrawn from the occupation, with several leaders having been arrested after leaving the site; one of them, Robert LaVoy Finicum, was shot and killed during an attempt to arrest him after he reached toward a handgun concealed in his pocketWhat LaVoy Finicum shooting investigation found.

Seven others, including Ammon and Ryan Bundy, were tried and acquitted of all federal charges. Five more had been found guilty and were sentenced months later. Seven of the militants saw prison time for their roles in the occupation. Jake Ryan and Duane Ehmer each received 366 days in prison, with Ryan additionally getting three years of supervised probation. Darryl Thorn received 18 months of prison time on November 21, 2017.

Ammon Bundy was also the leader of a group which he formed shortly before the occupation, which he later named the Citizens for Constitutional Freedom. Ammon's father, Cliven D. Bundy, had previously organized and led a somewhat similar incident roughly two years earlier in March 2014. Both Bundys are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and believed that their armed opposition to the federal government was ordained for them via divine messages ordering them to do so. Also in a leadership position amongst the militants was the group's occasional spokesman LaVoy Finicum, another Mormon, who owned a ranch at Cane Beds, in the Arizona Strip, near the community of Colorado City, Arizona. He had recently authored a self-published post-apocalyptic novel. Ammon's brother, Ryan Bundy, was also amongst the militants present, and was later arrested for his role in the occupation. On December 1, 2019, an investigation commissioned by the Washington House of Representatives reported Washington state legislator, white supremacist Matt Shea had planned and participated in domestic terrorism on at least three occasions.From Ruby Ridge to Matt Shea, eastern Washington struggles to shake far-right extremism, Los Angeles Times, December 20, 2019. Retrieved December 23, 2019. This included his participation, organizing, planning, and promotion of the 2014 Bundy standoff in Nevada, the 2015 armed conflict in Priest River, Idaho, and the 2016 armed seizure of the Malheur Refuge. Shea led a delegation of right-wing legislators from Oregon, Washington and Idaho that met with law enforcement on January 9, 2016, in Burns, Oregon where they were appraised of confidential intended law enforcement strategies for dealing with the refuge occupiers. The state House district's Republican Representative Cliff Bentz, attended the meeting, despite being warned by Harney County Judge Steven Grasty to decline the invitation. Bentz did, however, warn western Oregon state Representative Dallas Heard, from Roseburg, that it would be \\"inappropriate,\\" for Heard to attend, though Heard ignored the advice.Ore. state legislator meets with armed group at wildlife refuge, KGW, January 11, 2016.

Shea then disclosed those details to the Bundys, according to the report. =Hammond arson case= In 2012, Dwight Lincoln Hammond, Jr., 73, and Steven Dwight Hammond, 46, were both convicted of two counts of arson on federal land, in relation to two fires they set in 2001 and 2006. In a mid-trial settlement agreement, the Hammonds agreed not to appeal the arson convictions in order to have other charges dismissed by the government. The Hammonds were also told the prosecutor would seek the mandatory minimum sentence of five years. United States' Supplemental Sentencing Memorandum (filed September 21, 2015), United States v. Hammond, Case No. 6:10-cr-60066-AA (D. Ore.). Ultimately, Dwight Hammond was sentenced to three months' imprisonment and his son Steven was sentenced to a year and a day's imprisonment, which both men served. In 2015, the sentences were, however, vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which then remanded re-sentencing. Brief for the United States in Opposition, Hammond v.

In October 2015, a judge re-sentenced the Hammonds to five years in prison (with credit for time served), ordering that they return to prison on January 4, 2016. Stephen was scheduled to be released on June 29, 2019 and Dwight on February 13, 2020.Federal Inmate Locator, Federal Bureau of Prisons. Retrieved July 3, 2018. They were pardoned by President Trump on July 10, 2018. In late 2015, the Hammonds' case attracted the attention of Ammon Bundy and Ryan Payne. In November 2015, Bundy and his associates began publicizing the Hammonds' case via social media. On YouTube. Over the ensuing weeks, Bundy and Payne attempted to set up plans for what they described as a peaceful protest with Harney County Sheriff, David M. Ward, as well as request that the sheriff's office protect the Hammonds from being taken into custody by federal authorities. A sympathetic Ward declined Bundy and Payne's request. He later said that he began receiving death threats by email. Despite several early meetings with Bundy and Payne, the Hammonds eventually rejected their offers of assistance. =Prelude to the occupation= On November 5, 2015, Ammon Bundy called Harney County Sheriff David Ward and arranged a meeting later the same day. At the meeting, Ammon Bundy and Montana militiaman Ryan Payne insisted to Sheriff Ward that Ward must shield Dwight and Steven Hammond against re-imprisonment. Ward recalled that when he explained that he did not have authority to shield the Hammonds from a lawful sentence, Bundy's and Payne's demeanor became threatening. Payne told Ward that if he did not shield the Hammonds from imprisonment, \\"thousands\\" of armed militiamen would come to the county to \\"do Ward's job\\" for him‚Äîand Payne pointedly noted that he might not be able to control what else the militia might do.Walker, Peter. Sagebrush Collaboration: How Harney County Defeated the Takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Oregon State University Press 2018 By late fall, local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies noticed that members of anti-government militias had started to relocate to Harney County, and the USFWS began circulating a photograph of Ammon Bundy with instructions for staff to \\"be on the lookout.\\" By early December 2015, Bundy and Payne had moved to Burns. The same month, they organized a meeting at the Harney County Fairgrounds to rally support for their efforts. At the meeting, a \\"committee of safety\\" was organized by Bundy and Payne to orchestrate direct action against the Hammond sentences. According to that group's website, the Harney County Committee of Safety considers itself \\"a governmental body established by the people in the absence of the ability of the existing government to provide for the needs and protection of civilized society\\" (during the American Revolution, committees of safety were shadow governments organized to usurp authority from colonial administrators). From mid-November to late December 2015, local residents began to notice significant numbers of outsiders in the community, often dressed in military-style attire and openly carrying handguns and sometimes rifles. Some of these armed newcomers engaged in what local people considered threatening and harassing behavior, such as approaching shoppers in local stores and aggressively asking their opinions about the Hammond family. Many local people considered these actions to be deliberate intimidation, intended to sway the community into joining the outsider's unspecified plan to \\"protect\\" the Hammonds from re-arrest. Contrary to local custom, some residents began carrying guns in public locations. Many lived in fear that some kind of violent event was about to take place.Walker, Peter (2018). Sagebrush Collaboration: How Harney County Defeated the Takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Oregon State University Press. On December 30, 2015, USFWS staff members at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge were dismissed early from work. With tensions rising in nearby Burns, supervisors left staff with the final instruction not to return to the refuge unless explicitly instructed. Meanwhile, some Burns residents reported harassment and intimidation by militia members. According to the spouses and children of several federal employees and local police, they had been followed home or to school by vehicles with out-of-state license plates. On January 1, 2016, a forum held at the Harney County Fairgrounds was attended by about 60 local residents and members of militias. A Burns-area resident who organized the event described it as an opportunity to defuse tensions that had been simmering between locals and out-of-town militia in the preceding days. The event alternated between expressions of sympathy for the Hammonds and suggestions that a peaceful rally could be beneficial. On January 2, a rally of about 300 people gathered in a Safeway supermarket parking lot in Burns, organized by the Pacific Patriots Network (PPN), a militia umbrella organization that includes the 3 Percenters of Idaho. Members of the Pacific Patriots Network had been active in Harney County since November, drawn there by the Hammond arson case. Following speeches, the crowd marched to the home of Dwight and Steven Hammond, stopping briefly en route to protest outside the sheriff's office and the county courthouse. The crowd then returned to the Safeway parking lot and broke up. According to KOIN, the CBS-affiliated television station in Portland, Oregon, there was \\"no visible police presence at any point.\\" Armed occupation =First week= USGS satellite image of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters shows a fire lookout used as a watch tower (1), the main offices used as a headquarters (2), and buildings used as a canteen and barracks (3). Before the protest crowd broke up, Ammon Bundy announced to the crowd his plan to occupy the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, and he encouraged people to join him. His announcement surprised a PPN rally organizer, who later stated he felt betrayed. Ammon and Ryan Bundy‚Äîalong with armed associates‚Äîseparated from the crowd and proceeded to the refuge headquarters, located south of Burns. The militants settled into the refuge and set up defensive positions. Right before the occupation began, the militants notified the Harney County Sheriff's Office and also contacted a utility company with the intention of taking over the refuge's electric and other services, according to a motion to dismiss and memorandum filed by Ammon Bundy's lawyers on May 9. Law enforcement kept away from the refuge, but various security measures were taken in surrounding areas. By the evening of January 4, no overt police presence was visible in the area between the town and the refuge headquarters. Upon hearing of the occupation at the wildlife refuge, the two ranchers on whose behalf the militants were ostensibly acting disavowed the action. On January 2, the militia leaders claimed to have 150 armed members at the site, though one journalist reported that no more than a dozen armed militants were on the site, and another reported a claim that there were \\"between six and 12.\\" On January 3, The Oregonian said there were roughly 20 to 25 people present and that the militants had deployed into defensive positions. On January 3, Ammon Bundy claimed that they were being supplied by area residents. Other protest groups took varying positions. On January 2, the 3 Percenters of Idaho militia disclaimed involvement, calling the occupation a small splinter action. Ryan Bundy stated that the militant group wanted the Hammonds to be released and for the federal government to relinquish control of the Malheur National Forest. On January 3, Ammon Bundy said the ultimate goal of the militants was to \\"get the economics here in the county revived\\" for logging and outdoor recreation. On January 4, the militants announced a formal name for their group, Citizens for Constitutional Freedom. Notice posted on the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge's website stating its closure \\"until further notice\\" On January 4, Steven E. Grasty, the judge-executive of Harney County, emailed Ammon Bundy requesting that he leave the refuge. Harney County Sheriff David Ward then requested that the Bundys and others to leave. In response, Ryan Bundy said he wasn't convinced Ward spoke for all of the people in the county. Meanwhile, on January 4, Dwight and Steven Hammond voluntarily reported to begin serving the remainder of their respective prison sentences. In a public meeting held on January 6 at the Harney County Fairgrounds, nearly every attending person, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting, raised their hands when Ward asked who thought the militants should leave. Ward then offered to escort the militants to the county line if they would depart voluntarily. A fistfight erupted at the refuge on the evening of January 6 when three members of a group calling themselves Veterans on Patrol attempted to enter the headquarters and convince women, children and Ryan Payne to leave. Instead, they were repelled by militants, leaving one member of the Veterans on Patrol with a black eye. Family members of some of the militants were present at the refuge during the occupation, including a minor son of Ammon Bundy, as well as the children of some of the visitors sympathetic to the militia. \\"A version of this article appears in print on January 13, 2016, on page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Fervor at an Oregon Wildlife Refuge, Concern Just Outside It.\\" On January 7, Sheriff Ward and other local sheriffs met with Ammon Bundy and Ryan Payne from the site of the occupation. Sheriff Ward repeated his earlier offer to escort the militants out of the county. Bundy rejected the offer, saying the occupation would continue until management of federal land in the county had been turned over to local residents. =Second week= On January 8, members of other militias later met with the militants, asking them to establish a perimeter around the occupied area to avoid a \\"Waco-style situation.\\" A number of other militia and anti-government groups, some armed, arrived and were greeted with mixed reception. The 3 Percenters of Idaho announced it was sending some of its members to \\"secure a perimeter\\" around the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge compound and prevent a repeat of the Waco siege. Ammon Bundy initially welcomed the arrival of the additional militants, but hours after their arrival at the refuge on the morning of January 9, the convoy of new militants from the Pacific Patriots Network, led by Brandon Curtiss, president of the 3 Percenters of Idaho, were asked to leave by Utah attorney Todd MacFarlane, who acted as a mediator. The new militants left the refuge that afternoon. By January 10, an influx of armed groups and individuals was rotating through Burns, with some declaring they were there to support the occupation, others to try to convince the militants to quit, and still others with undefined purposes. Some militants, meanwhile, left the occupation completely. On January 11, the militants removed a stretch of fence between the refuge and an adjacent ranch, apparently to give the adjacent ranch access to land that had been blocked for years. \\"A version of this article appears in print on January 12, 2016, on page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Protesters Rip Out Fence at Refuge in Oregon,\\" but the ranch owners did not want the fence taken down and subsequently repaired it. The militants began searching through government documents stored for proof of government wrongdoing toward local ranchers. On January 12, the militants told KOIN reporter Chris Holmstrom that the refuge facilities were messy and unorganized when they arrived, and Jason Patrick asserted that they encountered rat feces deep. KOIN recorded some of their cleaning efforts in a garage. Bruce Doucette, the owner of a computer repair shop in Denver, Colorado, and a self-proclaimed judge, announced on January 12 that he would convene a \\"citizens grand jury\\" to charge government officials with various crimes. Doucette's claims to be a judge are consistent with legal frauds often practiced by the sovereign citizen movement and other anti-government movements. On January 14, Ammon Bundy announced that the militants planned a longer stay and were reaching out to nearby county sheriffs for support. Michael Ray Emry, speaking for Bruce Doucette, threaten to hold \\"a trial with the redress of grievance\\" against county and other government officials. Harney County Judge Steven Grasty, Sheriff Ward, and other county officials were served false legal documents by the militants. On January 15, the Oregon State Police arrested a militant at the Safeway in Burns who had been driving a government vehicle stolen from the refuge headquarters. Also on January 15, the Oath Keepers anti-government militia group warned of a prospective \\"conflagration so great, it cannot be stopped, leading to a bloody, brutal civil war\\" if the situation descended into violence. =Third and fourth weeks= FBI negotiator via speaker phone at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge on January 21 Militant numbers continued to grow to \\"several dozen\\" according to one report or about 40 in another. On January 16, LaVoy Finicum told The Washington Post that \\"[i]t needs to be very clear that these buildings will never, ever return to the federal government,\\" reiterating the group's demands for the federal government to cede ownership of the wildlife refuge. The militants began to vandalize the property, which local community leaders characterized as an attempt to provoke violent confrontation. A video released by the militants showed them inspecting a locked storage room for archaeological artifacts held in agreement with the Burns Paiute Tribe, an Indian nation in Harney County, leading the tribe to ask the federal authorities to block the passage of occupiers to the site. On January 19, Ammon Bundy and several other militant occupiers appeared unannounced at a community meeting in Burns without addressing the crowd. Residents urged an end to the occupation as did rallies held by opponents in Eugene and Portland, Oregon, and in Idaho. On January 21, Bundy met with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and discussed with them about relinquishing federal government control of the refuge as well as the releases of Dwight and Steven Hammond. He agreed to meet with the FBI again on the next day, but when the meeting occurred, Bundy left when the agent present declined to negotiate in front of the media. On January 23, the militants hosted a news conference at the refuge, promising news reporters that an Oregon cattle rancher and one from New Mexico would be present to sign papers renouncing their federal grazing permits. Only one rancher, Adrian C. Sewell of Grant County, New Mexico, a convicted felon, renounced his federal grazing permit at the conference. The Oregon rancher was absent.

Retrieved August 11, 2018. During the first weeks, law enforcement allowed the militants to come and go from the refuge at will. On January 26, the main leaders attempted to drive two vehicles to adjacent Grant County, Oregon, where Ryan Payne was invited by a Canyon City, Oregon, logger to speak at a public meeting at the John Day Senior Center in John Day, Oregon. It was the first time in which the main leaders were traveling together away from the refuge headquarters. State and federal authorities used the opportunity to intercept them with a traffic stop on a stretch of U.S. Route 395, situated away from populated areas. The militants' convoy consisted of a white 2015 Dodge Ram driven by LaVoy Finicum, followed by a dark-colored Jeep. Vehicles driven by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Oregon State Police pulled in behind the Jeep. The driver of the Jeep pulled over and he and his passengers, Ammon Bundy and Brian Cavalier, surrendered peacefully and were taken into custody. Finicum kept driving, followed by the authorities, but eventually stopped with police cars behind his truck. The police launched a round of foam-nosed pepper spray at the vehicle. Ryan Payne exited Finicum's truck and surrendered peacefully, also surrendering a handgun holstered on his right hip. Shawna Cox, a passenger in Finicum's truck, recorded cell phone video of Finicum shouting to police that he intended to ignore their orders and drive away. Other cell phone video footage shot by Ryan Bundy, another passenger, also showed Finicum taunting officers and daring them to shoot and kill him. About seven minutes after stopping his truck, Finicum resumed driving north at high speed. Cox, Ryan Bundy, and 18-year-old Victoria Sharp, were still in the rear seat of the truck at the time.‚ÄòPatriot Princess‚Äô Victoria Sharp still traumatized a year after Oregon standoff shooting, Kansas City Star, Rick Montgomery, January 26, 2017. Retrieved March 14, 2018. They were subsequently pursued by officers and eventually encountered a roadblock about later. An Oregon State Police SWAT member, identified in the trial of FBI agent Astarita as \\"Officer 1,\\" fired three shots with an AR-15, into Finicum's truck as it approached the roadblock. Finicum steered off the pavement to the left shoulder to evade the roadblock, embedding his truck in a roadside snowbank. Two OSP officers and four FBI agents were posted at the roadblock, with one of the FBI agents nearly being run over by Finicum's truck. Finicum soon exited and began walking away from his truck, briefly raising and lowering his hands above his head. While Finicum was leaving his truck, a FBI Hostage Rescue Team member allegedly fired two shots one of which entered the truck and ricocheted, inflicting the minor shrapnel wound on Ryan Bundy. OSP officers and FBI agents armed with rifles positioned themselves to his left, while an OSP officer equipped with a non-lethal Taser X2 walked downhill from an embankment toward him. As the officer with the Taser attempted to move within to make the most effective use of the Taser, Finicum turned his body to the left, holding his jacket with his left hand and reaching for a pocket with his right hand. He was then shot twice in the back by an OSP SWA member from the roadblock identified as \\"Officer 1,\\" and once by \\"Officer 2,\\" from the pursuit vehicle. =Immediate aftermath= LaVoy Finicum Immediately after the shooting and arrests, officials stated that Finicum was reaching for a handgun in his pocket when he was shot by a state trooper. The FBI found a loaded 9mm Ruger SR9, a gift from his stepson, in Finicum's left jacket pocket. Both of the Bundy brothers and three other militants were arrested. They faced \\"federal felony charges of conspiracy to impede federal officers from discharging their official duties through the use of force, intimidation or threats\\" (Title 18, United States Code, Section 372). The driver of the Jeep and Victoria Sharp, a passenger in Finicum's truck, were released without charges. Medical assistance was given to Finicum approximately 10 minutes after the shooting. Prior to the video of the action being released, some of the militants and supporters had claimed that Finicum was cooperating with the police when he was shot. This included a claim by Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore (who was not present at the arrest) that \\"he was just murdered with his hands up.\\" Cliven Bundy was quoted as saying that Finicum was \\"sacrificed for a good purpose.\\" At a news conference, officials had initially declined to comment on the Finicum shooting because the encounter was still under investigation, \\"A version of this article appears in print on January 28, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Jailed Oregon Protest Leader Urges Followers: 'Please Go Home'.\\" but they later released surveillance video of the incident, which officials said shows Finicum reaching for a handgun after feigning surrender, but Finicum's family continued to dispute the nature of the shooting, claiming that he was shot in the back while his hands were in the air, and denied the FBI's assertion that Finicum was armed at the time of his death. Finicum's public autopsy was performed on January 28, but officials withheld the autopsy report from the press until March 8. The Finicum family commissioned a private autopsy, but declined to make the results public. Three others were arrested in separate actions: Peter Santilli and Joseph O'Shaughnessy were arrested locally, while Jon Ritzheimer was placed under arrest by the FBI in Peoria, Arizona, after he had voluntarily surrendered. Fifth and sixth weeks Following the January 26 arrests, the occupation continued. In the early morning hours of January 27, militant Jason Patrick said that women and children had left the occupation, adding that five to six people met and then decided to continue the occupation. Many people reportedly left in a hurry. Hours later, federal and state police forces moved into the region, formed a perimeter around the refuge, and blocked access to it by setting up roadblocks. Only ranchers who owned land near the area were allowed to pass. The remaining members debated on what to do next, with some angry about the recent events. Through his lawyer, Michael Arnold of Eugene, Oregon, Ammon Bundy on January 27 urged those remaining at the refuge to stand down and go home, statements that were echoed by his wife. Later, several vehicles were seen leaving the refuge before the police perimeter had been set up. Later that day, eight people left the refuge and were met by the FBI and the Oregon State Police at the perimeter. Three militants, including Patrick, surrendered and were arrested, while five other people were allowed to leave the refuge by authorities without incident. By the morning of January 28, four militants remained: David Fry, 27, of Blanchester, Ohio; husband and wife Sean, 48, and Sandra Lynn Anderson, 47, both of Riggins, Idaho; and Jeff Banta, 46, of Yerington, Nevada. Fry reported that there was a warrant for the arrest of Sean Anderson; the Associated Press reported that Anderson was facing misdemeanor charges in Wisconsin for resisting arrest and drug possession. Fry also added that the others were free to go, but the four were reluctant to leave unless they were all allowed to go freely and Sean Anderson was not arrested. The FBI reportedly offered a deal where Sean Anderson would be arrested and the others would go free; this was acceptable to Fry and Banta, but not Sandra Anderson, at which point all four made a pact to remain together. By January 29, the four said they had ended negotiations with the FBI and were planning to remain at the refuge until their supplies ran out. On January 30, the FBI said negotiations were continuing. The militants also claimed that the FBI was shutting down their ability to communicate with the outside world, including locking down their ability to make or receive cell phone calls. The FBI later confirmed this action. The militants were able to maintain contact with Oregon Public Broadcasting from January 31 to February 3, at which point their line of communication was cut. About a week later, David Fry was able to reestablish online communications. On February 3, the remaining four militants, along with twelve of the arrested militants, were indicted for conspiracy to impede U.S. officers, though Kirkland and Stetson were not. Signs were added at some roadblocks stating that unauthorized protesters or visitors would be subject to arrest if they passed said blocks. =Surrender of the last four militants involved= At about 4:30 p.m. on February 10, David Fry rode past the police barricades using an all-terrain vehicle before returning to the refuge at high speed. Federal authorities claimed that caused them to begin to surround the refuge at around 5:45 p.m. Michael Arnold, Ammon Bundy's lawyer, learned of the escalation from a live feed where the remaining holdouts were talking of murder and asking to speak to Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore. Fiore was informed of the request as her flight touched down at the Portland International Airport in Portland, Oregon. Meanwhile, Arnold sent text messages to a FBI negotiator saying, \\"Fiore is landing now. Can you get her on the phone with the people at the refuge? ... We can slow this down by offering Michele Fiore to talk to them.\\" Fiore stated on a YouTube livestream with the militants that she would try to mediate the situation. While she talked to the four militants, Arnold worked on getting the FBI on the phone. At 7:38 p.m., a FBI agent told Arnold that Fiore was doing a good job and they should go to Burns. Later that night, it was reported that the remaining militants would be turning themselves in to the FBI at 8:00 a.m. on the following morning. On the morning of February 11, Fiore and Arnold arrived in Burns. Fiore met with Reverend Franklin Graham at the Burns Municipal Airport, who had flown in there on his private airplane, and both were driven to the refuge in a FBI armored truck, with Arnold in a vehicle behind them. Fiore and Graham took turns addressing the militants over a loudspeaker on the truck, and Arnold provided the FBI Ammon Bundy's recorded message for Fry. By 11:00 a.m., Sean and Sandra Anderson, Jeff Banta, and Fry surrendered to the FBI without incident. The previous night, Cliven Bundy had been arrested by the FBI after deplaning at the Portland International Airport on charges related to events that were alleged to have occurred during the 2014 Bundy standoff. He had flown to Portland to support Fry, Banta, and the Andersons. In February 2016, the elder Bundy was transported back from Portland, Oregon, to Las Vegas, Nevada, to be tried in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada on charges related to the standoff at his Nevada ranch. In the first trial there, two defendants who were not charged in Oregon were convicted of some counts, with the jury deadlocked on other charges against them and four others. The two who received guilty verdicts were sentenced on July 26 and 27.Partial verdict reached in Bundy ranch standoff trial in Nevada, Oregon Live (AP), April 24, 2017. Retrieved May 28, 2017.

Retrieved May 28, 2017. Aftermath =Further arrests= The final arrest of the 26 militants indicted for felony conspiracy was of Travis Cox, and took place on April 12 in Cedar City, Utah. At sentencing, on August 7, 2017, the 20-year-old Cox, the youngest of all those indicted, described his own behavior as \\"arrogant\\" and \\"ignorant.\\" He had served 51 days in pre-trial custody before making bail. U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown said about him, \\"I think it's important to note, if my memory is correct, you're the first person who's acknowledged this was a mistake.\\" She sentenced him to two months of house arrest.

Retrieved August 11, 2017. In the months preceding the sentencing of Cox, Sean, Sandra and Dylan Anderson each received sentences of a year of probation for trespassing. A 27th militant, Scott Alan Willingham, was arrested on March 16. Willingham pleaded guilty to one count of theft of government property on May 12. Michael Ray Emry, who had described himself as being an \\"embedded reporter\\" for the 3 Percenters of Idaho, was arrested by the FBI on May 6 in John Day, Oregon, on federal weapons charges relating to his possession of a stolen fully automatic .50-caliber M2 Browning heavy machine gun. Willingham told The Oregonian that Emry spent time at the refuge for media purposes and to share his expertise with weapons, and supplied another militant at the refuge with a semi- automatic AK-47 rifle. =Trials= A total of 27 people involved in the occupation were charged under federal law; of those, 26 have been indicted for a single federal felony count of conspiracy to impede officers of the U.S. from discharging their official duties through the use of force, intimidation, or threats. A number of those under indictment on the conspiracy charge are also charged with a variety of other counts, some of which incur sentences up to life imprisonment, including possession of firearms and dangerous weapons in federal facilities, use and carry of firearms in relation to a crime of violence, depredation of government property (relating to damaging the site \\"by means of excavation and the use of heavy equipment\\"), and theft of government property. In addition, several of those under indictment in Oregon have also been indicted separately for their roles in the 2014 Bundy standoff in Nevada. In January 2016, a court denied bail to Ammon and Ryan Bundy saying that they were \\"a flight risk and a danger to the community.\\" The court also denied bail to Ryan Payne, Dylan Anderson, and Jason Patrick. In 2017, prosecutors said they would be asking for a 41-month prison sentence for Payne. By August 2016, twelve militants pleaded guilty to charges against them, including four of nine militants who were part of Bundy's \\"inner circle\\". Of those four, two were reported to be negotiating a resolution to a federal indictment in regards to the Bundy standoff in Nevada. The trials for seven militants, including Ammon Bundy, were scheduled to start on September 7, 2016; while a further seven militants were set for trial beginning February 14, 2017. Charges against the remaining indicted militant, Peter Santilli, were dropped (but he still faces charges in Nevada related to the 2014 Bundy standoff). On August 3, 2016, about 1,500 potential jurors were summoned and asked to complete questionnaires that would be reviewed by the attorneys and parties involved in the September 7, 2016, trials. Judge Anna Brown previously said the case would require an unusually large jury pool. The defense would focus on the argument that the federal government doesn't actually have jurisdiction of federal land, as they lost the right to own the land inside of Oregon once it became a state. On October 27, 2016, Ammon Bundy and six other defendants were found not guilty of conspiracy to impede federal officers and possession of firearms in a federal facility by a jury. One defendant was found not guilty of theft of a government-owned truck, and the jury was hung on charges of theft of surveillance cameras by another defendant. The judge released five of the defendants, but returned Ammon and Ryan Bundy to federal custody because they also face trial related to the 2014 Bundy standoff in Nevada. At the end of the trial, Marcus Mumford, Ammon Bundy's lawyer, argued with the judge that Bundy should be released immediately on the grounds that the court did not have a detainer, and the United States Marshals Service had no document authorizing Bundy's detention. Both of the Bundy brothers had been ordered to be held without bail in January when they were charged. After the judge admonished him for yelling at the bench, six U.S. Marshals surrounded the defense table and then tackled Mumford and tased him when he resisted. A spokesman for the Marshals Service said Mumford was arrested because he \\"was resisting and preventing Marshals from taking Ammon Bundy out of the courtroom and back into custody.\\" Other lawyers described the Marshals' actions as a sharp break from customary courtroom decorum. On March 13, 2017, federal prosecutors dropped the unusual charges brought against Mumford for his outburst at his client's verdict.Federal Prosecutors Move To Drop Charges Against Tased Attorney For Bundy,Oregon Public Broadcasting, Conrad Wilson, March 13, 2017.

In the trial of the second group of defendants held in February 2017, four remaining defendants were being prosecuted for conspiring to impede federal employees from working at the refuge through intimidation, threats, or fear. Greg Bretzing, the recently retired FBI special agent in charge testified that several agency informants had been sent into the refuge occupation to assess the situation. One, Mark McConnell, was Ammon Bundy's driver in the convoy to the city of John Day. Drones, fixed cameras, and aerial reconnaissance were used in the surveillance. Bretzing said no military had been involved. He said his top three goals were a peaceable end to the takeover, a return of the refuge to USFWS control, and holding accountable the occupiers who were involved.Oregon's retired top FBI agent testified why he didn't send agents to 'assault the refuge', The Oregonian, Maxine Bernstein, February 22, 2017.

Prosecutors indicated that nine informants had been engaged at the refuge occupation, for periods of two hours to 23 days, and that none were involved at the initial occupation. Some had carried weapons. A California blogger, Gary Hunt, said he received a thumb drive and documents that contained the names of the nine informants who had been at the Refuge, and six others in the case who had not been there, and he subsequently posted them online to aid the defense.

A collection of firearms and explosives were found inside the refuge. Safes were found to have been broken into, with money, cameras, and computers stolen by the militants. They were also found to have badly damaged tribal artifacts. The FBI's Art Crime Team conducted an archaeological field assessment to determine if the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act or the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 were violated; additional charges may result if so. During the occupation, the militants illegally dug a new road using a government-owned excavator, expanded a parking lot, dug trenches, destroyed part of a USFWS-owned fence, and removed security cameras. Some of the refuge's pipes broke, after which the militants, officials said, defecated \\"everywhere.\\" Investigators found \\"significant amounts of human feces\\" at \\"two large trenches and an improvised road on or adjacent to grounds containing sensitive artifacts\\" of the Burns Paiute Tribe. A USFWS spokesperson said that the damage risked \\"the destruction and desecration of culturally significant Native American sites\\" and called it \\"disgusting, ghoulish behavior.\\" The Burns Paiute Tribe condemned the damage; tribal council member Jarvis Kennedy described it as if \\"someone went to Arlington National Cemetery and went to the bathroom on the graves and rode a bulldozer over them.\\" Two of the militants, Sean Larry Anderson and Jake Edward Ryan, were subsequently indicted for \\"depredation of government property,\\" an offense that carries a potential ten-year jail sentence. A group of 600 volunteers signed up to restore the refuge, after the Oregon Natural Desert Association sought assistance. The FBI also found evidence that the militants used a boat launch area, about northeast of the refuge, for firearms training. At the boat launch area, investigators recovered about 1,685 spent shell casings. The refuge remained closed after the FBI left the site in late February, with the entrance road blocked off from public access by armed officers from the USFWS. The refuge's manager described it as \\"one big mess\\" at the end of February. Although he and fifteen other employees at the refuge were able to return to their jobs at the end of February, they found that while there had not been much structural damage to the buildings, there had been a great deal of disruption to files, heavy equipment, and fittings, in addition to the problems caused by a lengthy break in the maintenance of the refuge's infrastructure. Efforts to reduce the population of invasive carp in Malheur Lake are thought to have been set back by three years. While the buildings remain closed for repairs, which are expected to take until the summer, the refuge's lands were reopened to the public in mid-March. \\"A version of this article appears in print on March 27, 2016, on page TR11 of the New York edition with the headline: After a 41-Day Standoff, Birding Is Back.\\" =Prosecution of FBI agent= An FBI agent, W.

Those latter shots were discharged as LaVoy was reaching inside his jacket shouting, \\"Shoot me, shoot me.\\" Detectives said they found Finicum's loaded automatic pistol with a round chambered, in his jacket. A total of six bullets had been fired by two Oregon State Police (OSP) SWAT officers, the first three at the oncoming vehicle. According to investigators, the fatal volley included one round that hit Finicum's back which was fired by \\"Officer 2,\\" who had arrived in the chase vehicle. Non-lethal rounds had also been fired at the vehicle, and Ryan Payne was hit in the hand by a rubber bullet. The investigators and prosecutors believed someone else fired two additional shots. One of those two bullets hit the roof of Finicum's truck as he was exiting his vehicle with both hands raised, after he had swerved his truck into a deep snowbank alongside the southbound edge of the roadblock. A second shot missed. Both those interim shots, taken before the fatal volley, were attributed by prosecutors to Astarita, but he had denied firing at all.12 takeaways from Week 2 of FBI agent's trial in LaVoy Finicum shooting, The Oregonian, Maxine Bernstein, August 5, 2018.

The municipalities of Burns and Hines, Oregon, along with Harney County, its schools, spent . The million figure also includes wages paid to employees who could not work because of the occupation, such as for about 120 BLM employees whose offices were closed. The figure of the costs does not include additional costs, such as lost time in the field, delayed or canceled BLM projects, or added demand for food and services at local nonprofits, such as the Harney County Senior Center. A subsequent estimate stated the cost as at least million, including million spent relocating employees who had been threatened by the militants, million on federal law enforcement, million to replace damaged or stolen property and over million spent by Oregon government agencies. =Reopening of refuge headquarters= In September 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said the headquarters area would remain closed while they installed security upgrades, which they anticipated could take until spring 2017. Roads and wetlands remained open to the public for birding. By May 8, 2017, the entire Visitor Center, including Center Patrol Road, had been reopened to visitors. =Reactions= Throughout the occupation, statements were issued by anti- government activists and sympathetic residents, who criticized the militants' tactics. \\"A version of this article appears in print on January 4, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Armed Protesters Vow to Stay on Oregon Refuge Indefinitely.\\" Other statements of condemnation were issued by legal scholars; and federal, state, local, and tribal governments. In the first days, the takeover sparked a debate in the United States on the meaning of the word \\"terrorist\\" and on how the news media and law enforcement treat situations involving people of different ethnicities or religions. Oregon government officeholders, such as Governor Kate Brown and Congressmen Peter DeFazio, Earl Blumenauer, and other top officials in Oregon who had hoped for a more rapid and rigorous federal response, urged criminal proceedings for the militants and expressed praise that the occupation ended without further bloodshed. Congressman Greg Walden, whose district office is in Bend and incorporates the refuge, said, \\"We can all be grateful that today has ended peacefully, and that this situation is finally over. Now, life in Harney County can begin to return to normal and the community can begin the long process of healing.\\" Walden complained about allegedly poor federal forest and land management policies during the occupation, and said he would like to see changes to those policies: \\"We need to foster a more cooperative spirit between the federal agencies and the people who call areas like Harney County home.\\" On June 27, 2018, Walden pleaded for a pardon for the Hammonds on the floor of the House of Representatives, and in a statement issued July 1, Walden quoted Judge Michael Robert Hogan's opinion that sentencing the Hammonds even to the minimum mandatory sentence would \\"shock the conscious\\" and revealed that President Donald Trump was considering a pardon for the arsonists. Harney County held a primary election in May 2016 at which voters turned out in large numbers.

Life Anderson was born in Angus, the son of an agricultural labourer, grew up in St Vigeans and attended Arbroath Education Institution. He taught at the English School in Constantinople from 1856-59. In 1860, after moving back to Scotland, he became editor of the John O'Groat journal. At this time he started to excavate in Caithness, in partnership with Robert Shearer. From 1869 to 1913, 44 years, he was the keeper of the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland. He was also editor of the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland from 1869 to his death in 1916. V.

As keeper of the National Museum, he oversaw an \\"enormous growth in the Museum‚Äôs collections\\", and emphasised the importance of record- keeping. DV Clarke states that: \\"Anderson‚Äôs scholarship was, at its best, challenging and provocative, rivalling that of the finest European scholars of his day\\", but that \\"for many years a vibrant and influential figure in Scottish archaeology, in the end he became a poor reflection of once- innovative attitudes\\".

The wall of kindness ( dƒ´vƒÅr-e mehrabƒÅnƒ´; Dewar e meherbani) is a charity work phenomenon and a kind of welfare, usually done by attaching cloth hangers from outside of houses; those encourage people to donate miscellaneous useful things such as winter clothing. It was introduced by an anonymous Iranian, and the practice quickly spread throughout the country. The motto of the movement are two sentences which appear on the walls: \\"Leave what you don't need\\" () and \\"Take what you do\\" (). Description Initially started for the homeless people of the Mashhad, Iran, the act serves a purpose to support the people in need. In response to social media, large numbers of people are taking part as a campaign and it has helped many homeless or otherwise destitute people during the cold winter weather. A similar initiative, but with open fridges, spread from Tehran to other cities. Bookshelves are also being added to the Walls of Kindness in order to donate books specially for poor children A wall of kindness was seen in Pakistan's Karachi on 15 January 2016 and another one in China's Liuzhou, located in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on 29 January 2016. Also students of Marymount International School of Rome, in April 2016, have reproduced the idea by designating a wall with similar function and name. A wall of kindness was set up in Peshawar by Serve Mankind & Wadaan and afterwards it started Spreading all over Pakistan such as, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Sialkot, Quetta, Khuzdar and Karachi have witnessed similar walls where people are leaving clothes and other essential items for the poor. A new Wall of Kindness was recently witnessed in Amman/Jordan at the Landmark Amman Hotel on 21 November 2017, which marked the first day of rain, inviting generous souls including children to donate clothes anonymously for the most in need ahead of the winter season. After donations are received, the laundry team at the hotel picks up the clothes, cleans them, irons them, wraps them up and hangs them back so they are available for the recipients, just like brand new items. Similar walls known as \\"Neki ki Deewar\\" have sprung up in multiple cities across India such as Allahabad, Bhilwara, Jhalawar, Mysore, Chandigrah, Bhopal, Dehradun, Korba and Kolkata sometimes even having more supply than demand of clothes. The walls are also serving unexpected purpose of keeping walls clean and free from spitting. Background The economy of Iran was hit when sanctions were imposed by the Western World. As the situation became worse, with an increasing number of unemployed, many could not afford clothes. Inflation caused particular difficulties for those in need. In the winter of 2015, young Iranians in Wahid came up with the idea. The main theme was to meet the demand for resources from charities. For the first time, a wall symbolizes unity rather than separation and the community has been asked to donate voluntarily. As soon as the attempt came to the attention of various social and mass media platforms, it was supported and praised by citizens as well as netizens. Young Iranians took the chance to strengthen the bonds of community. The campaign went smoothly despite the risk of misuse and loss of resources. People were responsive and well aware of the fact that most vulnerable should get priority. Winter clothing disbursed among mass number of people as a welfare had been seen before, but still, the idea was innovative and showed much intelligence. Impact  The sharing works of charity had a great impacts of religious point of view regarding Islamic country like Iran. Like in other religions, charitable work is considered a virtue in Islam, which has driven people to do more for humanity. Like in Iran, people in Pakistan are showing their humanity via this initiative.

During the 1960s, Powell was managing director of two London publishing houses, Mayflower Books and then the New English Library, and achieved a measure of notoriety for publishing Fanny Hill for the former and The Carpetbaggers for the latter. In 1967 he and his family emigrated to Australia. There he published magazines (including men's magazine Chance International and women's magazine POL) and books (including bestseller Now You'll Think I'm Awful), introducing new standards of production quality to the Australian market. After problems with the importation of Chance ‚Äî an issue was barred by Australian Customs on the grounds of obscenity and upheld by court order ‚Äî Powell moved his business to Hong Kong where his magazines were printed. He continued, however, to write and publish books, copy, and magazines for Australian and international personal computing and travel markets. During the 1980s and 1990s he also wrote columns for the Sydney Morning Herald, becoming their computer/technology editor and later travel editor and supplements editor. He left the Herald after a September 1994 Media Watch episode identified allegedly plagiarised material under his byline, insertions which, according to Powell, had been made by a junior colleague while he was on leave. After leaving the Herald, he continued to write books on personal computing, motoring and travel, as well as columns for a range of old and new media. Biography =Early life and career= Gareth Powell was born in Caerwys, North Wales on 26 May 1934. He was the seventh child of Calvinist Methodists Thomas Norman Powell, an Inspector of Schools, and his wife Blodwyn (n√©e Hughes). When Powell was two, his family moved to Pontypridd, and then when nine to Wallasey. He was expelled from school at the age of 15. On turning 17, he joined the British Army as a regular soldier, where he served in the field security stream of the Intelligence Corps for two years and a half years, including in Malaya, and attaining the rank of sergeant. After discharge, he worked in various jobs including as a truck driver and circus hand, before joining local paper Wallasey and Wirral Chronicle in 1955. =London publishing= Powell moved to London, where he worked for two years on a weekly trade magazine. By 1960 he had worked as an editor for Four Square Books. He subsequently worked for paperback publisher Panther Books, before becoming a founding member of Mayflower Books. Mayflower Books Mayflower Books launched in 1961 under American publishers Feffer and Simons, with Powell as managing director. It published a mix of original and reprinted works, with its opening slate being William Saroyan's Rock Wagram, Richard Gehman's Sinatra and His Rat Pack, a Dixon of Dock Green novel, and Something Fresh by Wodehouse. Mayflower also published paperback editions of science fiction works, starting with Player Piano by Kurt Vonnegut, as well as approximately two film tie-ins each month. During the production of the fourth issue of satirical magazine Private Eye from late 1961 to early 1962, Powell provided the creative team with a free room in Mayflower's Covent Garden warehouse (later the site of The Roxy nightclub). According to Powell, he was gifted a 5% share of the magazine in recompense, but sold it shortly afterward to Peter Cook, who took over the magazine in June 1962. By late 1962, Mayflower's biggest success was the UK paperback edition of Richard Gehman's Sinatra and His Rat Pack, with 300,000 copies sold. Even so, the firm did not have the resources to buy the rights to any major title, in particular the UK rights for The Carpetbaggers, by Harold Robbins. Mayflower was sold to Dell Publishing in 1963, with Powell and Lionel V. Fennelly becoming joint managing directors. Powell handled editorial and promotional responsibilities, and Fennelly handled administrative, commercial and sales responsibilities. =Fanny Hill= In November 1963, Mayflower published an unexpurgated paperback edition of the original 1748-49 version of John Cleland's erotic novel Fanny Hill. Police raided G. Gold & Son's Magic Shop in London, seized 171 copies, and charged the retailers under Section 3 of the Obscene Publications Act of 1959, which allowed for trial without jury. Mayflower decided to cover Gold's legal costs, and asked that as publisher of the work they be charged under Section 2 of the Act, which as in the case of the 1960 trial for Lady Chatterley's Lover, would have required a jury trial. This request was denied on the grounds that \\"it would be less oppressive to the publishers\\" (although Powell states that he was also briefly arrested). Despite supportive testimony of many expert witnesses, the recency of the Profumo affair, Gold's association with the \\"Soho smut market\\", and the book's low 3s 6d cover price all contributed to a guilty verdict after two minutes' consideration by magistrate Sir Robert Blundell. After liberals, the media, and the literary world protested, and an all-party motion in Parliament condemned the verdict, the Obscene Publications Act was altered to give publishers the right for a trial by jury. Mayflower issued a bowdlerized edition of the novel, as did other publishers. Although Mayflower offered to accept returns, only 250 of their 82,000 copy run were so returned. New English Library At the start of 1964, Powell moved from Mayflower to become managing director of the New English Library (NEL). =The Carpetbaggers= Powell soon scored a coup in securing the British paperback rights for bestselling novel The Carpetbaggers. He did this partly by offering author Harold Robbins, whose previous UK paperbacks had been published by Corgi, the massive advance of when the standard payment of the time was approximately . The rights were acquired by NEL's Four Square imprint (which NEL had purchased during Powell's time at Mayflower). Most rivals thought that Powell and Four Square had erred. Four Square published its British paperback edition of The Carpetbaggers in early 1964. Unlike the expurgated hardcover \\"Commonwealth Edition\\" published in London by Anthony Blond the previous year, NEL's version was unexpurgated; this was banned in South Africa in 1965, and threatened with being banned or restricted in New Zealand, the unexpurgated work having already been banned in Australia since 1961. Paradoxically, those bans had the effect of raising public awareness of the book and ultimately contributed to increased sales when the bans were ended. Powell had a taste for flamboyant promotion of the books he published. As part of his publicity campaign, he brought Robbins to London in early February 1964. The author, too, believed in the role of promotion in making a book a bestseller. Peter Haining, then an editorial director at NEL, recalled that Robbins \\"pressed the flesh, and he was very good at it... He realized that publicity was the thing, and he worked hard to create an impression\\". The novel was promoted as a fictionalised version of the life of eccentric entrepreneur Howard Hughes. The book's bright red covers were decorated with sexy illustrations on both front and back, a banner on the front proclaiming \\"Over 5,000,000 copies sold\\", and the back cover trumpeting \\"THE CARPETBAGGERS is the bestseller all America is reading and talking about\\". By March 1965 The Carpetbaggers was at number three on the British best-seller list. =Departure from NEL= The New English Library's only profitable year was 1964, when The Carpetbaggers was published. Victor Weybright, co-founder of the parent New American Library (NAL), became critical of Powell, whom Weybright states had assured him \\"that he knew nothing of arithmetic\\", and who \\"talked more about his Rolls Royce than about the business\\". Weybright continues that, on the night of the 1966 UK General Election, Powell: > ...parked his Rolls Royce conspicuously in front of Annabel's, the > nightclub, which occurred to him as a splendid way to celebrate a socialist > victory... ‚Äî a young man in a Liberty-print shirt, with a Rolls Royce, who > had openly described himself as a lout, but with no company bank account > except for deposits from New York and California to cover deficits and keep > the enterprise alive. His notion of progress was to publish more and more > Playboy trivia and Girodias pornography ‚Äî with a bit of warmed up egghead > stuff from NAL in the U.S.A. Powell did not renew his contract in early 1967, and was succeeded as managing director by editorial director Christopher Shaw. NEL tried to \\"shake off the Powell image\\". It announced that it would cut output from around 50 titles a month to 36, and would further reduce that to 18 by early 1968.Eric Clark, \\"The Paperback Tigers Retreat\\", The Observer, 27 August 1967, p. 8. Retrieved via ProQuest on 15 October 2016. Irving Wardle, the English writer and theatre critic, noted in the New York Times Book Review: > If the [British publishing] boom is ending, one can date it to the departure > for Australia this year of Gareth Powell. He paid huge advances on the > assumption that it only needed spectacular salesmanship to achieve an even > vaster readership. He largely supplied the salesmanship himself with the aid > of a Rolls-Royce and a helicopter. And he stood for no nonsense about > literature: Marketing books was no different from marketing a can of beans. > Told by his American employer, \\"You're not in show business, Gareth,\\" he > replied. \\"Well, we bloody well ought to be.\\" Powell was not a popular figure > among the old-style bookmen, and terms ranging from \\"whizz-kid\\" to \\"lout\\" > were freely bandied about in print (He was a working-class boy, which made > it worse). The Powell of this period provided partial inspiration along with John Lennon and John Bloom for the titular character in Hunter Davies's 1970 novel The Rise and Fall of Jake Sullivan, with all three having achieved \\"enormous success\\" from humble beginnings. =Early Australian-based publishing= Emigration Powell had mentioned during a November 1966 visit to Australia that he was considering settling there because he liked \\"the idea of Australia's classless society\\", and elsewhere that he would leave the UK for either America or Australia because he \\"didn't like the atmosphere\\". In 1967, he emigrated to Australia with his wife, their children, the Rolls Royce and ‚Äî not having been cleared by Britain to export more ‚Äî only in capital ($ in ). He had applied for assisted passage ‚Äî \\"If I can get [it]... I'd be silly not to, wouldn't I?\\" ‚Äî but this application was refused after direct intervention by Immigration Minister Billy Sneddon, who stated \\"People of affluence are not entitled to an assisted passage\\". By the following year, Powell was driving a Holden. Chance International and other girlie magazines Powell's first Australian venture was Chance International, a girlie magazine which launched in 1967 with Jack de Lissa (who had founded earlier magazine Squire). A Sun- Herald reviewer found Chance a \\"glossy product... certainly full of meat, and on beautiful paper. A good book, for reading in the bath\\". Additionally, the magazine was noted as publishing \\"good, exciting new fiction\\", which \\"didn't have that orientation to particular traditions of the short story that the literary magazines seemed stuck to\\".Michael Wilding, \\"Tabloid Story\\" in: Bruce Bennett, ed., Cross Currents: Magazines and Newspapers in Australian Literature, Melbourne: Longman Cheshire, 1981, p. 228. Chance also published the work of some of Australia's best young photographers of the late 1960s and early 1970s, including Rennie Ellis, and was somewhat of a breakthrough in its high standards of printing quality, photography and design. In a widely derided 1968 NSW Equity Court ruling in Chance International Pty. Ltd. v. Forbes, Justice Helsham, who was unsure what 8-page comic strip Barbarella was about but suspected lesbianism, decreed that the November 1968 issue of Chance was obscene and should be destroyed. Australian Censorship: The XYZ of Love noted that the judge \\"overlooked the fact that a few doors away from his court, a cinema was showing Barbarella which included some lines of dialogue he found particularly offensive in the strip\\". At that time, Powell was publishing two other girlie magazines, Squire and Talent. Talent, which Powell described as \\"a colourful Man Junior\\", was printed in Milan and had been selling 42,000 copies throughout Europe. However Squire, co-published with Jack de Lissa, had also been having difficulties with Australian censorship boards. Powell stated that the Equity Court decision was causing him to have \\"second thoughts about the whole future of girlie magazines in Australia\\", and was considering whether he should either stop publishing Chance, or move its headquarters overseas. POL magazine In 1968, Powell launched women's magazine POL under editor Richard Walsh,Richard Walsh, \\"Case Study: The New A&R;\\", in: Craig Munro and Robyn Sheahan-Bright, eds., Paper Empires: A History of the Book in Australia, 1946-2005. University of Queensland Press, 2006, pages 93-94. a founding co-editor of underground magazine Oz. POL was both the first major Australian women's magazine to use colour offset printing, and the first to have its issues printed overseas; this was done by the Hong Kong branch of Dai Nippon Printing before issues were air-freighted to Australia. With POL, Powell became the first client of John Singleton's Public Relations firm SPASM. Other magazines At the end of 1967, Powell launched Surf International as an upmarket competitor to Surfing World. It was edited by John Witzig,\\"Surf back in time to Lennox: FROM THE COLLECTION\\", Daily Examiner, Grafton, N.S.W, 8 Oct 2014, p. 26. Retrieved via ProQuest on 15 October 2016 and contained articles from Midget Farrelly, Bob McTavish, and Nat Young. Powell reported: \\"I tried to buy Surfing World but they asked too high a price for it, so I said I'll start my own\\". By September 1968 Surf International was said to be \\"selling 40,000 copies a month in Australia, Hawaii, the U.S., U.K., South Africa and Tahiti\\". The magazine ceased in 1969, however, with Witzig going on to co-found Tracks the following year. In 1970 Powell launched Fathom, a diving magazine, which ran for 10 issues and closed in 1974. Book publishing In addition to magazines, Powell published books including Now You'll Think I'm Awful by Sue Rhodes (\\"a Helen Gurley Brown-ish tilt at Australian sex habits\\", which sold over copies), investigative journalist Bob Bottom's first book Behind the Barrier (an \\"indictment\\" of Broken Hills Barrier Industrial Council), and Frank Moorhouse's first book, the 1969 Futility and Other Animals, which Moorhouse reports as never being distributed due to Gareth Powell Associates running into financial difficulties.Frank Moorhouse, \\"Working lunch lasts a lifetime\\", The Australian, 5 December 2007, p. 21. =1980s to 1990s= Computer magazines In the 1980s Powell began publishing computer magazines, including Australian Apple Review (which launched in 1983 with Graeme Philipson as its first editor) and The Australian Commodore Review (which launched in 1984). Broadsheet columnist In the 1980s, Powell became a columnist for the Sydney Morning Herald. He worked as that newspaper's Computer Editor from January 1987, and also became its Travel Editor, and Supplements Editor. In September 1994, the ABC's Media Watch television programme, under host Stuart Littlemore, aired an accusation that copy appearing under Powell's byline had been plagiarised. Powell maintained that this had been the result of actions performed by a junior colleague without his knowledge while he was overseas, however separated from the Herald.John Logothetis, \\"Gareth Powell\\", FidoNet Echomail Archive, 15 15 September 1994.

Name The name Suha krajina (literally, 'dry march') refers to dryness of the region.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC. There is a general lack of surface water in the area, which lies on permeable karstified limestone and dolomite, through which most precipitation disappears into the ground and makes its way to the Krka River. The German designation D√ºrrenkrain (and in turn the English name Dry Carniola) is the result of a hypercorrection based on the adjective ending -krajnski (understood as a dialect metathesis of *-kranjski), as happened for White Carniola.Ko≈°ti√°l, Ivan. 1930. \\"Jezikovne drobtine.\\" Ljubljanski zvon 50(3): 179‚Äì180, p. 180. History The region is one of the least developed in Slovenia, and its population is sparse and decreasing. Its weak economic position is a result of its unfavorable natural conditions combined with historical circumstances. Mining and foundry work were important in the area until the 19th century, but died out around 1900 due to the area's poor transport accessibility. The construction of the Lower Carniola Railroad along the Temenica River to the east left the Krka Valley economically isolated. During the Second World War, Dry Carniola was part of the territory annexed by Italy. Much of the population in the area rejected the communist-led Liberation Front movement due to Partisan murders of civilians and the efforts of local priests. In March 1944, German aircraft bombed the villages of Ambrus and Zagradec, and in April the Partisans murdered Franc Kern, the curate in Hinje, and evicted 30 families. In 1945, Partisan forces burned the villages of Hinje and ≈Ωvirƒçe. Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2.

Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p. 204. Today, Dry Carniola is primarily an agricultural area, with most of the population engaged in farming. Nonetheless, only about 15% of the farms are full-time farms, and the majority of other farmers have additional sources of income from non-agricultural activities. Because there are few non- farming jobs in the area, much of the population commutes to larger industrial centers outside the area. The connection to these was facilitated in recent years by the freeway connection between Ljubljana and Novo Mesto.

It takes place over three weeks each spring, since 2012, in multiple sites throughout Cairo‚Äôs city center capitalizing on its unique architectural and social heritage. Established one year after the 25th of January 2011 revolution D-CAF is an independent initiative of a group of independent organizations that seeks to reinvent the public space of downtown Cairo around a new vision where contemporary Art is an integral part of the socio-economic and political fabric of the Egyptian society. D-CAF is now in the planning phase of its fifth edition to present cutting edge local, regional and international alternative theater and dance performances, music concerts, visual arts shows, film screenings, art lectures and workshops, by emerging and avant-garde artists from around the world. Along with providing a dense high-quality program of artistic events to a diverse public, D-CAF is concerned with introducing curatorial expertise in the disciplines it presents, as well as forging new collaborations between artists and spaces, and producing new work. Each edition, D-CAF collaborates with curators to develop the different elements of the festival thereby expanding its network and knowledge. Over the past four editions, D-CAF has brought together hundreds of artists from all over the world in spite of a difficult and unstable political and cultural environment. The festival‚Äôs curators and staff continuously invest time and resources into forging new artistic collaborations, uncovering and utilizing new venues, producing new challenging work by both local and international artists, and providing audiences with diverse experiences and opportunities to access contemporary art. The festival aims to present intellectually and economically accessible cutting edge contemporary art works in order to reach the wider possible audience and to familiarize them with contemporary arts without diminishing the value of works presented. It is constantly reinventing public and private spaces in downtown to host performances and events, thus always surprising the audiences and the city. The festival aims to embrace modernity and to build on the desire of many in Egyptian society to explore different identities and to challenge traditional roles, demand basic social and political rights and guarantee freedom of expression. The festival sees itself as a space where important themes can be explored. A major objective is thus to present audiences with new creative visions for the future. Given this sensitive political and social environment, D-CAF fights to bring back culture and art at the center of the public space as a new way to express ideas and multiply exchanges between the artists and the audience and among the audiences themselves. Downtown Cairo One of the main aims of D-CAF is the revival and reclamation of Downtown Cairo as a vibrant cultural center, capitalizing on its unique architectural and social heritage. The festival also benefits from the fact that many of Cairo‚Äôs major independent cultural institutions are based in Downtown. D-CAF uses this to build on the existing cultural communities that these institutions have been creating over the last decade. The festival takes place outside of traditional state venues both as a means of maintaining its artistic independence but also to generate a new conversation between audiences, artists and the city by using non-conventional sites such as historical buildings, storefronts, alleyways, and rooftops for performances, events, and arts exhibitions. By choosing non-traditional venues for arts exhibitions and performances, D-CAF intends to attract bystanders and art lovers to re-discover the heart of Downtown Cairo and attend arts events presented in an original way, out of galleries and institutions. Mission To produce a high-quality international contemporary arts festival in Downtown Cairo, showcasing local, regional and international artists and attracting diverse audiences from Egypt and abroad. Vision A well-planned, well- produced and well-publicised event that will be a rolemodel, not only for the arts, but also for other organisations, especially NGOs, across Egypt, and will help to contribute to a blooming local and regional contemporary arts scene. Future Plans D-CAF 2016- Fifth Edition In 2016, D-CAF will seek again to present to the Egyptian audience, to the local artistic scene and to the international programmers who come to the festival, the latest trends in contemporary arts with both established and upcoming artists from various parts of the Arab world and in the different sections of the Festival‚Äôs programming. The festival thus aims to maintain a balanced programme of Arab and Western art and thus showcase trends not only in Europe and America, but also across the region in which the festival is based and that the festival hopes to most influence. The festival will seek to ensure that the selection of Arab artists at D-CAF 2016 provides something quite different, representing a variety of countries across the region and from countries that have not been represented in previous editions. Arab Arts Focus- Second edition In 2016, the Arab Arts Focus will widen its scope, including an even stronger programme of local and regional artworks by established and emerging Arab artists across disciplines, and inviting an even wider range of programmers from the five continents. The overall objective of the focus is to support the development of a sustainable professional contemporary arts sector in Egypt and the Arab world, one that will allow artists and arts professionals working in contemporary cultural production to contribute to a flourishing regional arts scene, and to show their creative work beyond regional borders.

The group advocates gun ownership rights and resistance to the U.S. federal government's involvement in local affairs. The group's name derives from the disputed claim that only three percent of American colonists took up arms against the Kingdom of Great Britain during the American Revolution. The Southern Poverty Law Center categorizes the Three Percenters as an \\"anti- government\\" group. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) characterizes the Three Percenters as \\"anti-government extremists who are part of the militia movement.\\" The group is American-based but has a presence in Canada as well. Some Canadian experts consider the group the \\"most dangerous extremist group\\" in Canada. Foundation and membership The movement has been characterized as part of the broader patriot movement. Founded in 2008, it was given impetus by the election of Barack Obama as president of the United States. Members believed that Obama's presidency would lead to increased government interference in the lives of individuals, and particularly stricter gun- control laws. Many members are former and current members of the military, police and other law-enforcement agencies, as well as anti-government groups such as the Oath Keepers.The movement was co-founded by Michael \\"Mike\\" Brian Vanderboegh from Alabama, a member of the Oath Keepers, a group with whom the Three Percenters remain loosely allied and are often compared. Vanderboegh claims to have formerly been a member of Students for a Democratic Society and the Socialist Workers Party, but abandoned left-wing politics and politics in general in 1977 after being introduced to libertarianism. The group's website states that it does not discriminate against anyone; however, in response to Black Lives Matter protests following the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the Three Percenters' Facebook page featured numerous racist comments made by its supporters. Ideology The group's website states it is \\"not a militia\\" and \\"not anti-government\\". Three Percenters believe that ordinary citizens must take a stand against perceived abuses by the U.S. federal government, which they characterize as overstepping its Constitutional limits. Its stated goals include protecting the right to keep and bear arms, and to \\"push back against tyranny\\". The group opposes federal involvement in what they consider local affairs, and states in its bylaws that county sheriffs are \\"the supreme law of the land\\". Like other American militia movements, Three Percenters believe in the ability of citizen volunteers with ordinary weapons to successfully resist the United States military. They support this belief by claiming that only around 3% of American colonists fought the British during the American Revolution, a claim which underestimates the number of people who resisted British rule, and which does not take into account the concentration of British forces in coastal cities, the similarity of weapons used by American and British forces, and French support for the colonists. Organization and activities The group's local chapters are structured hierarchically according to its National Bylaws. As well as political activism, chapters also engage in paramilitary activities such as marksmanship training. Membership requires voting and opposing laws the group sees as unconstitutional. Members take an oath similar to that of the U.S. armed forces. Three Percenters who are also active military members are asked to swear an additional oath promising to disobey certain official orders, such as orders to disarm U.S. citizens. The group's Facebook page mostly features posts supporting gun rights. Vanderboegh self-published a serial novel online, Absolved, in 2008, which he called \\"a cautionary tale for the out-of-control gun cops of the ATF\\". On its website, the movement claims that it is not a militia group, but rather a \\"national organization made up of patriotic citizens who love their country, their freedoms, and their liberty.\\" Vanderboegh and his novel Absolved first received wider media attention in 2011, when four suspected militia members in Georgia were arrested for a plan for a biological attack that had supposedly been inspired by the novel. Vanderboegh distanced himself from the alleged plot. In 2013, Christian Allen Kerodin and associates were working on construction of a walled compound in Benewah County, Idaho, \\"for Three Percenters\\", designed to house 7,000 people following a major disaster, an initiative which local law enforcement has described as a \\"scam\\". In April 2013, a group of Jersey City, New Jersey, police officers were disciplined for wearing patches reading \\"One of the 3%\\". Following the 2015 Chattanooga shootings at a strip mall, a military recruitment center and a United States Navy Operational Support Center in Tennessee, Three Percenters, Oath Keepers, and other militia groups began organizing armed gatherings outside of recruiting centers in several states, with the stated objective of providing protection to service members, who were barred from carrying weapons while on duty in civilian recruitment centers. In response, the Army Command Operations Center Security Division issued a letter ordering soldiers not to interact with or acknowledge armed civilians outside of recruitment centers, and that \\"If questioned by these alleged concerned citizens, be polite, professional and terminate the conversation immediately and report the incident to local law enforcement\\", noting that the issuing officer is \\"sure the citizens mean well, but we cannot assume this in every case and we do not want to advocate this behavior\\". An Idaho Three Percenter group protested refugee resettlement in that state in 2015. In 2016, the \\"3 Percenters of Idaho\\" group announced it was sending some of its members in support of the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, allegedly in order to \\"secure the perimeter\\" and to prevent a \\"Waco-style situation\\". They left several hours later after being told their assistance was not needed. Two days previously, Vanderboegh had described the occupiers as \\"a collection of fruits and nuts\\". \\"What Bundy and this collection of fruits and nuts has done is give the feds the perfect opportunity to advance their agenda to discredit us\\", he said. The group provided security for a 2017 event held by Patriot Prayer called \\"Rally for Trump and Freedom\\". Several Three Percenters were also present and providing security for the Unite the Right rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. After the events at Charlottesville, the group's \\"National Council\\" issued a \\"stand down order\\", stating, \\"we will not align ourselves with any type of racist group\\". In 2017, a 23-year-old Oklahoma man, Jerry Drake Varnell, was arrested on federal charges of plotting a vehicle bomb attack on a bank in downtown Oklahoma City, modeled after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. During a meeting in 2017 with undercover FBI agents, Varnell identified with the Three Percenters movement, saying that he subscribed to \\"III% ideology\\" and intended \\"to start the next revolution.\\" In March 2020, Varnell was sentenced to 25 years in prison, for the crimes of conspiracy to use an explosive device to damage a building used in interstate commerce, and to plan to use a weapon of mass destruction against property used in interstate commerce. In 2018, three men were arrested in connection with the bombing of the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, Minnesota. The bombing was non-lethal. One of men involved, former sheriff's deputy Michael B. Hari, had connections to the group. In June 2019, Oregon Governor Kate Brown sent the Oregon State Police to bring 11 absent Republican state senators back to the Oregon State Capitol. The Republican state senators had gone into hiding to prevent a vote on a cap- and-trade proposal with a goal of lowering greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in order to combat climate change. The Three Percenters offered support for the Republican senators, declaring they would be \\"doing whatever it takes to keep these senators safe\\". On June 22, 2019, a session of the Oregon Senate was cancelled when the Oregon State Capitol was closed due to a warning from the state police of a \\"possible militia threat\\". In May 2020, during a Second Amendment rally on Memorial Day weekend in Frankfort, Kentucky, Three Percenters and other protesters breached several off-limit barriers to access the front porch of the Governor's Mansion, Governor Andy Beshear's primary residence, and began heckling the Mansion's occupants in response to the Governor's restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Soon afterward, members of the group moved several hundred yards away and raised an effigy bearing the Governor's face and a sign reading sic semper tyrannis (\\"thus always to tyrants\\") from a tree. The event drew condemnation from Beshear and from across the political spectrum. Some state officials had joined the Three Percenters at earlier events, including Kentucky State Representatives Savannah Maddox and Stan Lee, and Kentucky State Senator John Schickel. Beshear labeled the group as \\"radical\\", that their actions were \\"aimed at creating fear and terror\\", and declared that officials who appeared at previous Three Percenter events \\"cannot fan the flames and then condemn the fire.\\" During the investigation of Gretchen Whitmer kidnapping plot, one of the arrested is identified as the second in command of the Wisconsin branch of the Three Percenters, so far without the group having confirmed or denied it.

SimplePlanes followed the release of SimplePhysics and SimpleRockets and before SimpleRockets 2. The game was first released on Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows and was ported to iOS and Android later. It was released onto Steam on the 17th of December 2015 after going through the Steam Greenlight process. The game received mixed reviews from critics, with the main downfalls mentioned the most being the ‚Äúslippery controls‚Äù and the graphical design. Gameplay In SimplePlanes the player is given the freedom of building anything they want to create using the materials and objects provided, and players can additionally use XML modifications on their creation. Planes (or other creations) created by the community can also be downloaded from the SimplePlanes.com website. When the creation or build is finished, the player can fly/drive/sail it around the map which contains 5 different islands with unique features, (4 on IOS or Android) and/or upload it to the SimplePlanes website. The five islands each provide a different experience to the player, with interactive targets. Each island has a unique name, such as Maywar, Krakabola, Snowstone or Wright. The game also gives players the ability to build cars, boats, trains and mechanical objects. SimplePlanes contains challenges which the player can do. The challenges involve short tutorial-type activities (such as the \\"take-off tutorial\\" and the \\"landing tutorial\\") but can get more advanced with missions (such as \\"SAM Evasion\\" (a 4 stage level which gets increasingly difficult) and \\"Trench Run\\" (a race through a canyon-like area on the game map)> There are also weapons (bombs, wing guns and miniguns, missiles, rockets and torpedoes) in the game for the player to use on their creations. Features The game includes a builder with various parts, engines and mechanical gizmos. On the website, there are shared builds and mods created by the community surrounding SimplePlanes. There are also forums, where community members can communicate with others, as well as help one another. Development Following the release of popular games SimpleRockets and SimplePhysics, Jundroo LLC released SimplePlanes on Windows and Mac OSX. Soon after it was ported to iOS and Android. The Windows and OSX versions were first sold on Gumroad but when SimplePlanes was released onto Valve's Steam on 17 December 2015 after going through the Steam Greenlight process, all sales were moved there. All purchasers from Gumroad received a free Steam key. Mac copies were also sold via the Mac App Store. The people who purchased the game through this method had to email the receipt to get the Steam key. Reception SimplePlanes received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to Metacritic, where it garnered a score of 67/100. The biggest issue critics had was the process of building. Nadia Oxford, a writer for Gamezebo gave SimplePlanes a 4/5 for its realistic flight challenges, sandbox mode and the amount of building options. The review was weighed down by the lack of tutorials and how \\"getting pieces to fit together doesn't always go as planned\\". Jordan Minor from 148Apps criticised the game for its \\"slippery controls\\" and he noted the environment was \\"ugly, muddy and blocky\\". He compared the graphics to \\"a poor man's Wii Sports resort\\" and said the planes looked like small wooden toys with the best compliment he could give the game being \\"who knows if the aerodynamic knowledge players learn from SimplePlanes can actually transfer over into the real world? But, gameplay and visual gripes aside, the fact that it at least feels like it can is probably the best compliment this game can get\\". Ben Schwan, a writer for the German website Heise Online also criticised the building mechanics. Mark Steighner, a writer for Hardcore Gamer did not criticise the controls but instead commented on the lack of charisma that games like Kerbal Space Program have. He also addressed the novelty issue and how after a while the game can get boring.

He was the cofounder of the newspaper Lotta Comunista with Lorenzo Parodi.  Biography  Arrigo Cervetto was born in Buenos Aires to Amedeo Cervetto and Bernardina Pasquino, immigrants from Liguria. Upon reaching adulthood, he returned to his hometown in Liguria, and became an apprentice steelworker in the \\"ILVA\\" complex, located in Savona. During his work, Arrigo Cervetto developed a conscious for the disparity between social classes. On 25 July 1943, he took part in the first demonstrations after the fall of Mussolini. On September 8 he fought as an anti-fascist partisan in Piedmont during the Italian Liberation War. Arrigo Cervetto, along with Piero Parisotto and Antonio Bogliani, left the Italian Communist Party (PCI) after a year of service, he rejected the policies of Palmiro Togliatti. Togliatti wanted to break the tradition and accept alliances with international bourgeois forces. as a result, Arrigo declared himself an anarchist. As an anarchist, Cervetto began to study Libertarian Communism, following the development of a libertarian ideology, along with figures like Umberto Marzocchi. In 1948, Arrigo Cervetto met Pier Carlo Masini and Lorenzo Parodi, who would become his political ally through his career. In March 1950, he took part in a conference organized by the Ligurian Anarchist Federation in Genoa-Pontedecimo, with the aim to concretely define the political struggle of the Italian Anarchist Federation. He collaborated with the milanese newspaper The Libertarian (Italian: Il Libertario) from May 1950 to May 1951. He also worked on the Anarchist Groups of Proletarian Action's (GAAP) newspaper The Pulse (Italian: l'Impulso) from 1950 to 1957. During his time writing for The Pulse, he wrote many articles on the Cold War and Decolonization, though he also explored the capitalistic nature of the Soviet Union, arguing the theory of State Capitalism. Cervetto Arrigo theorized \\"Unitary Imperialism,\\" starting with the\\"Imperialism\\" of Lenin, as opposed to the common vision of a bipolar world divided into two camps, Soviet socialism and the American Capitalism. Cervetto states that both powers were imperialists and capitalists, and that the unequal economic development compelled them to a continuous struggle for the hoarding of new markets, stating that the two superpowers were not so different in nature. Also in Genoa-Pontedecimo, from the 24‚Äì25 February 1951, he helped found the \\"Anarchist Groups of Proletarian Action\\" (GAAP). There, he presented the thesis of \\"Liquidation of the state as an apparatus of class.\\" In his thesis he argues that, \\"the social revolution, that installs a classless society, is accomplished with the simultaneous liquidation of the bourgeoisie as a class and the liquidation of the state as an apparatus of class,\\" and that, \\"it's the task of the proletarian mass organizations (factory councils, agricultural community, people's committees) expropriate the capitalist system of its facilities and to take on the direct and collective management.\\" Cervetto was fired by ILVA of Savona in December 1950 during restructuring, and in May 1951 he would return to Argentina where he would stay for a year, until May 1952. The return to Savona would soon see him engaged in the political-theoretical struggle, as he attempts to organize a revolutionary party, though without a job he no longer receives a regular salary. As such, he accepts to work for Feltrinelli, writing a biography of the \\"Worker's Movement of Savona.\\" In those years he deepened his historical research on the origins of class consciousness in the proletariat. Later, to survive, he accepted a job as a representative of the publisher Giulio Einaudi Editore.  Collaboration with Azione Comunista After the death of Stalin in 1953, and with cold war beginning to thaw, Giulio Seniga, former assistant of Secchia, founded in the movement of \\"Azione Comunista\\" in 1954, a for dissent within the Italian Communist Party. In December 1954, the Azione Comunista, the historical anti- Stalinist currents, the Anarchist Groups of Proletarian Action, the PC Internationalist of Onorato Damen, and the Trotskyists of the Revolutionary Communist Groups of Livio Maitan, made up the \\"Movement of the Communist Left,\\" holding a demonstration at Cinema Dante in Milan. Cervetto, contrary to the decision of the National Committee, was sent to Milan to work at the paper. He worked at the paper until August 1956, striving to counteract the maximalism and extremism, but with a primary goal of analyzing and defining the USSR's economic system as \\"state capitalism.\\" Among the promoters of the Communist Action, there was Seniga; a group of other ex-PCI who still supported Stalinist communism, such as Raimondi and Vinazza; Pier Carlo Masini, who increasingly focused on the Italian Socialist Party ; and one of the founders of the PCI, Bruno Fortichiari. In 1957, the GAAP opened the First National Conference of the Movement of the Communist Left in Livorno, from the 3‚Äì4 November 1957. Cervetto and Parodi, now holding clearly Leninist positions, present the \\"Thesis of 1957.\\" In the thesis, they analyze the global cycle of capitalism, and explicitly exclude the possibility of a global crisis in the short term. They also indicate the need for the formation of a class party from \\"a deep and passionate theoretical work.\\" However, differences of opinions caused the expulsion of Masini and Seniga, who then joined the PSI. With the failure of the PSI limiting the possibility of making active changes to policy, Cervetto and Parodi spent much of 1960‚Äì61 analyzing the economic system of China. The pair then defined China's economic policy as \\"nascent state capitalism.\\" In 1963, differences of opinions caused a break with Raimondi and other ex-PCI sympathizers and Azione Comunista on China and the Maoist movement, who disagreed on Cervetto's thesis about maoist China, who saw China's Economic policy as the result of a democratic-revolution by the bourgeois, and as state capitalism. In 1963, Cervetto and Fortichiari decided to transfer the preparation and printing of Azione Comunista to Genoa. From April 1964 they published a series of Cervetto's Articles, which aimed to \\"make clear the basic lines of the Leninist conception of the party.\\" It is a study (which would be collected two years later in a volume titled \\"Class struggle and the revolutionary party\\") of the Leninist concept of political action as the basis Scientific solution \\"To the problems left unsolved by the inclination of Amadeo Bordiga objectivist and subjectivist from that of Leon Trotsky.\\" Cervetto's research this solution found an organic link between Capital by Karl Marx, and the \\"What is to be done?\\" by Lenin; starting from here, he addresses the issue of workers' coalition. The last chapter focuses on the role of the revolutionary party on the definition of the strategy, such as \\"result of a scientific analysis of a given stage of the class struggle.\\"  Foundation of \\"Lotta comunista\\"  After his break with Azione Comunista, Cervetto formed a new organization. In December 1965 he founded the Lotta Comunista party, and started a vast work settlement organization. The consolidation and development of the party allowed Cervetto to start a long career of political-economic analysis.

It is located in south Saqqara and was built right next to the Pyramid of the 6th Dynasty Pharaoh Pepi I. Reherishefnakht's pyramid however was probably built at the end of the 11th Dynasty or the beginning of the 12th Dynasty. It is the oldest Egyptian pyramid built for a person who was not a member of the royal family. The pyramid was discovered a few years before it was first excavated by Audran Labrousse and the Mission Arch√©ologique Fran√ßaise de Saqq√¢ra in 2005.  Pyramid  The base of the pyramid measures only 13.1 m x 13.1 m and is thus clearly smaller than the surrounding royal pyramids. The building material was mainly limestone rubble, which had originally been used in other nearby buildings and was recycled for this pyramid. Among this material some older offering tables, stele, chapel doorposts and lintels were found. Several of the blocks are inscribed and contain the names and titles of hitherto unknown individuals from the late Old Kingdom. For example, a broken lintel was found which had belonged to the tomb of a previously unknown wife of Pepi I named Sebutet. Further fragments were discovered which belonged to the burial chamber of a woman named Behenu.  Substructure  From the north, a shaft led down to the burial chamber. This was located underground and was a small room. Its ceiling consisted of plates, located at the same height as the base of the pyramid. The furthest forward of them had the name of the tomb's owner written on them in red paint. The decoration of the burial chamber is a synthesis of motifs from the 6th dynasty and the 11/12th dynasties. For example, a band of hieroglyphs intended for the exterior of a sarcophagus were combined with 6th dynasty motifs used for decorating the interior of sarcophagi. The upper parts of the west and south walls is decorated with a frieze which depicts the burial of Reherishefnakht. The lower parts of the same walls and the whole of the east wall are inscribed with hieroglyphs. The western portion of the inscription consists of spells 214‚Äì217 of the Pyramid Texts, while the eastern part contains spell 335 of the Coffin Texts.

It is the most commonly used emergency contraceptive in China. The drug is marketed in a combination formulation with mifepristone under the brand name Zi Yun. Anordrin has not been studied for use or marketed outside of China. It has been used in China since the 1970s. Anordrin has both weak estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity. It binds to the estrogen receptor but does not bind to the androgen receptor or the progesterone receptor. In animals, anordrin has antigonadotropic effects, and in male animals, inhibits spermatogenesis and causes atrophy of the epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicles. It produces a dihydroxylated active metabolite, anordiol, with similar but more potent estrogenic activity.

The Wigtown Martyrs or Solway Martyrs, Margaret Lachlan and Margaret Wilson were Scottish Covenanters who were executed by Scottish Episcopalians in 1685 in Wigtown, Scotland, by tying them to stakes on the town's mudflats and allowing them to drown with the rising tide. Monuments to the 'Wigtown Martyrs' exist in Wigtown. During \\"The Killing Times\\" of the Covenanters in the 17th century, Margaret McLachlan, an elderly woman of around 63, and Margaret Wilson, around 18 years of age, were sentenced to be tied to stakes in the tidal channel of the River Bladnoch near its entrance to Wigtown Bay to be drowned by the incoming tide. The ploy was that the younger woman might be persuaded to change her mind after watching the older woman drown. The strategy failed and both died. This execution was carried out by dragoons under the command of Major Windram in the presence of Sir Robert Grierson of Lag who held the King's Commission to suppress the rebels in the South West. Their story, as told in various sources, tells how the women were betrayed by an informer. After about a month in prison they were tried as rebels and sentenced to death by drowning. The story of the Wigtown Martyrs was among those collected by Robert Wodrow and published in his History of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland from the Restoration to the Revolution. The Church of Scotland synod had decided in 1708 to collect accounts of persecution under the Stuart monarchs, and persuaded Wodrow to take on the research.

It lies about 8 km to the east of the village of Bunessan, beyond Loch Assapol and Scoor House. It was awarded the status of Scheduled monument in 1993 due to its significance as a source of information about 18th and 19th century rural life in Scotland.  Etymology  The name Shiaba is derived from the Gaelic Sia Ba meaning \\"six cows\\", a reflection of the area's relative fertility in comparison to other parts of the Ross of Mull. This reputation appears to have been backed up by the findings of the Napier Commission of 1883.Ross of Mull Historical Centre (2004) Discover The Ross..., p. 52. Bunessan, Ross of Mull Historical Centre  History  Mull as shown in Bleau's Atlas of Scotland, 1654. Shiaba (as 'Shaback') can be found towards the bottom left on the Ross of Mull (Ros-y) The township first appears by the name Shiaba in written records in 1779, though it is thought likely that its existence predates this. A possible earlier reference can be found in Bleau's Atlas of Scotland, 1654, which depicts the settlement of 'Shaback' in the approximate location of Shiaba. While the community initially operated using the runrig agricultural system, around 1804 it had changed into a crofting community with fixed areas of land attached to each croft. It is likely that this change was at least partially driven by a policy of 'Modernisation' carried out by the landowner the Duke of Argyll, as it was believed this system would generate greater incomes for the inhabitants allowing for greater rents to be charged. At its height the settlement included a School, two corn- drying kilns, one if not two horizontal watermills, around 12 dwellings built in the typical local-fashion with rounded-corners, as well as other agricultural structures including byres, peat-drying stacks, and possibly a small chapel. The remains of most of these buildings are still clearly visible. The population in the mid-1800s was around 130. The clearance of the settlement began in 1845 when the Duke of Argyll issued the residents with an eviction notice. The literate and articulate response of those inhabitants who wished to remain is well-documented.Ross of Mull Historical Centre (2004) Discover The Ross..., p. 52. Bunessan, Ross of Mull Historical Centre However, in 1847 almost all the inhabitants were removed, with some relocating to other areas of the Ross of Mull while others were encouraged to go overseas. A contributing factor to the clearance of the village was the hardship experienced by the people of Shiaba following the failure of the potato crop in 1846 which gave support to the landlord's arguments that removal was in their best interests.Ross of Mull Historical Centre (2004) Discover The Ross..., p. 52. Bunessan, Ross of Mull Historical Centre According to the 1871 census only a single shepherd and his family remained, tending a flock and managing 92 hectares of land. This dwelling too was vacated in 1937 following severe storm damage and the township was finally abandoned entirely. A notable resident of Shiba was the Gaelic poet Mary MacLucas, author of the Gaelic hymn Leanabh an √†igh (Child in a Manger). The tune of this piece later became famous as the melody to the more widely known hymn Morning Has Broken.  Designation as a Scheduled Monument  The remains of the settlement were given Scheduled Monument designation by Historic Scotland on 5 March 1993. The decision was made on the grounds that it was of national importance as a well- preserved and documented settlement showing the evolution from a pre-crofting to a crofting economy, and which therefore has the potential to provide information about the Scottish rural economy and society in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

He showed good form on the flat before emerging as an outstanding performer in hurdle races. In his first two seasons of competition he raced on the flat and won three of his ten races including the Noel Murless Stakes and the Prix Denisy as well as finishing second in the St Simon Stakes. When transferred to Ireland to compete under National Hunt rules he made an immediate impact, winning five races in his novice season including four Grade 1 victories in the Royal Bond Novice Hurdle, Deloitte Novice Hurdle, Mersey Novices' Hurdle and Champion Novice Hurdle. In the following season he won the Morgiana Hurdle, becoming the first horse to defeat Faugheen and then recorded his sixth Grade I success in the December Festival Hurdle. In the following season he won a second Morgiana Hurdle and was then stepped up in distance to win the Stayers' Hurdle. On 28 December 2017 Nichols Canyon was fatally injured in a fall at Leopardstown. Background Nichols Canyon was a small bay gelding with no white markings bred in the United Kingdom by Rabbah Bloodstock Limited. He was from the second crop of foals sired by Authorized who won The Derby and the International Stakes in 2007. His other offspring have included Seal of Approval (British Champions Fillies' and Mares' Stakes), Complacent (Spring Champion Stakes), Hartnell (Tancred Stakes) and Ambivalent (Pretty Polly Stakes). Nichols Canyon's dam Zam Zoom was an unraced mare bred by Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud, and was a granddaughter of Lucayan Princess, the dam of the multiple Group One winner Luso. In October 2011, the yearling colt was offered for sale at Tattersalls and was bought for 48,000 Guinea by Blandford Bloodstock. The colt entered the ownership of Rachel Hood & Elaine Lawlor and was sent into training with Hood's husband John Gosden. He was named after Nichols Canyon, Los Angeles. Racing career =2012 & 2013: Flat racing= Nichols Canyon began his racing career by finishing second in a maiden race over one mile at Sandown Park Racecourse on 9 August 2012 and then came third in a similar event over the same course and distance in September. He recorded his first success in October when he was ridden by William Buick to a two length victory in a nine furlong maiden race at Goodwood Racecourse on 14 October. He began his second season by finishing third in a handicap race at Sandown in April and then finished second in a similar event over eleven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in May. Nichols Canyon was then moved up in class and finished unplaced in both the Queen's Vase at Royal Ascot in June at the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York in August. On 4 October he started at odds of 5/1 in the Listed Noel Murless Stakes over one and three quarter miles at Ascot and recorded his first important success as he won by two lengths from the Luca Cumani-trained Greatwood. Nichols Canyon started favourite for the Group Three St Simon Stakes at Newbury later that month, but after taking the lead in the straight he was overtaken and beaten by the four-year-old Cubanita. The subsequent Dubai World Cup winner Prince Bishop finished tailed- off in last place. The horse ended his season with a trip to France for the Listed Prix Denisy over 3100 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 14 November. Ridden by Olivier Peslier he took the lead 200 metres from the finish and drew away to win by four lengths from the six-year-old gelding Inis Meain. =2014/2015 National Hunt season: Novice hurdles= At the end of his flat racing career Nichols Canyon was sold to Andrea & Graham Wylie. He was gelded and transferred to the stable of Willie Mullins. Nichols Canyon made his debut under National Hunt rules in a Novice hurdle race at Cork Racecourse on 2 November 2014 in which he was ridden for the first time by Ruby Walsh. Starting at odds of 1/4 he took the lead approaching the final flight to win by a length from Baily Cloud with a gap of seventeen lengths to the rest of the eleven runners. Twenty-six days later the gelding was stepped up to Grade I level for the Royal Bond Hurdle at Fairyhouse and started 7/2 second favourite in a field of seven runners. With Walsh riding the Mullins trained favourite Allez Colombieres, Nichols Canyon was partnered by Paul Townend. Nichols Canyon took the lead at the second last hurdle and recovered from a mistake at the last to win by five lengths from All Hell Let Loose. The victory was marred for the Mullins team by the fatal injury sustained by Allez Colombieres. At Leopardstown Racecourse in December the gelding started odds- on favourite for the Grade I Future Champions Novice Hurdle but unseated Ruby Walsh at the third hurdle in a race won by Sizing John. On 8 February, Nichols Canyon reappeared in the Deloitte Novice Hurdle over two and a quarter miles at Leopardstown and started second favourite behind his stable companion Alvisio Ville. Walsh sent the gelding to the front from the start and after being briefly headed by the favourite he regained the lead approaching the second last hurdle and drew away to win by three and a half lengths from Windsor Park with a gap of eight and a half lengths back to Alvisio Ville in third place. Mullins offered high praise after this performance \\"To put in a performance like that, against all those good horses in Leopardstown, that could be a Champion Hurdle performance. To me, did he look a little bit like Hurricane Fly? He‚Äôs the same type as a build of horse and has the same aggressiveness as him. He could be that horse\\". On 11 March Nichols Canyon made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival and started the 7/2 favourite for the Grade I Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle over two-mile and five furlongs contest. Despite horse racing analysts viewing the raise in distance a negative for Nichols Canyon chances on Cheltenham's stiff finish with the Supreme Novices' Hurdle offering a suitable alternative over two- mile, Mullins chose the extended trip as he already had the favourite for the shorter race with Ruby Walsh also in the saddle. Therefore, Walsh openly expressed the change of tactics in order to tackle the extra distance: \\"I wouldn‚Äôt want to make the running on him\\" which he applied during the race, restraining Nichols Canyon in the early stages and only beginning to make headway 3 furlongs from home, but after a mistake at the second last hurdle he was unable to make any further progress on the leaders and stayed on for third behind Windsor Park and the Challow Novices' Hurdle winner Parlour Games. A month later, Nichols Canyon returned to England for the Grade I Mersey Novices' Hurdle over two and a half miles at Aintree Racecourse. He started the 3/1 favourite ahead of Parlour Games whilst the other ten runners included Three Musketeers (Leamington Novices' Hurdle), Days of Heaven (Dovecote Novices' Hurdle), As de Mee (EBF Novices' Handicap Hurdle), Sub Lieutenant (Michael Purcell Memorial Novice Hurdle), Ballybolley (Champion Standard Open NH Flat Race) and McKinley (Slaney Novice Hurdle). Nichols Canyon tracked the leader Ballybolley before moving up to take the lead just after the second last hurdle. He drew away on the run-in and won by four and a half lengths from Parlour Games with seven and a half lengths back to Three Musketeers in third place. Mullins admitted to being surprised by the performance saying \\"I didn't expect him to do that. I thought his coat had gone a bit and I said to Ruby he could run flat today... We came here on a wing and a prayer\\". On his final appearance of the season, Nichols Canyon was made the 4/5 favourite for the Grade 1 Tattersalls Ireland Champion Novice Hurdle over two and a half miles at Punchestown on 1 May. Mckinley was again in opposition whilst the other four runners were Alpha des Obeaux, Sempre Medici (Dunboyne Castle Novice Hurdle), Outlander (Golden Cygnet Novice Hurdle) and Phil's Magic. Walsh sent the gelding in front from the start and Nichols Canyon maintained his advantage throughout, extending his lead approaching the last hurdle and winning in impressive style by seven lengths from Alpha des Obeaux, Racing Post describing him as \\"a proper Champion Hurdle horse in the making - he is a stayer with speed who relishes his racing\\". Walsh described the winner as \\"an iron little horse... he gallops and jumps and he's got some constitution\\". =2015/2016 National Hunt season: Hurdles= On his first appearance of the 2015/2016 National Hunt season Nichols Canyon was one of five horses to contest the Grade I Morgiana Hurdle over two miles at Punchestown on 15 November. The 1/6 favourite was the undefeated Champion Hurdler Faugheen, who, as the Mullins' stable's star hurdler was ridden by Ruby Walsh. Nichols Canyon, the 7/1 second choice in the betting, was ridden by the trainer's nephew David Mullins and faced another three rivals with Wicklow Brave (County Hurdle)‚Äî also trained by Mullins, Plinth (Istabraq Hurdle) and Thomas Edison (Galway Hurdle). Nichols Canyon was left to set the pace upfront and with a round of jumping described as \\"brilliant\\" by Racing Post he managed to maintain the lead for the rest of the race. He only looked to be headed for a brief moment on the turn for home but he found plenty and again increased the lead before the last hurdle, managing to hold off the late charges on the run- in of his stablemate and short odds-on favourite Faugheen by half a length at the finish line, with Wicklow Brave a length and a quarter back in third. Immediately after the race Mullins was puzzled by the result declaring: \\"That worked out completely different from the way they worked on Tuesday. Faugheen left Nichols for dead... They went a good gallop and Nichols did it the hard way out in front, he jumped fantastic. Maybe he has improved more... He looks a Champion Hurdle horse now... I'm not making any excuses for Faugheen\\". On 29 December Nichols Canyon started odds on favourite for the December Festival Hurdle over two miles on heavy ground at Leopardstown with only three opponents in Windsor Park, Plinth and the Fighting Fifth Hurdle winner Identity Thief. Nichols Canyon and Identity Thief disputed the lead multiple times during the race, initially with Ruby Walsh not pleased with the pace set by his rival and later on lost the advantage to Identity Thief after a mistake at the second last hurdle. However, Ruby Walsh regained his inside position near the rail and again went in front and from there on the lead was constantly disputed with both jockeys going all out, until the hundred yard marker from the finish at which Walsh mount battled hard and asserted to win by two lengths at the line, \\"making it one of the most enthralling races of the four-day festival\\" Commenting on the gelding's success Mullins compared him to Hurricane Fly saying \\"To look at, he‚Äôd remind you of him, and there‚Äôs the sheer toughness of him. He wouldn‚Äôt have the same speed as Hurricane Fly, but certainly he‚Äôs getting into that realm of ability. I thought that was him finished [at the second-last] but Ruby maintained his position on the inside, which meant he got a little breather coming around the last bend. But he‚Äôs tough, rock solid. He‚Äôs not the biggest horse but just hugely aggressive. When other horses might have backed off, he put down his head\\". The rematch with Faugheen came twenty-six days later in the Irish Champion Hurdle over the same course and distance in which he finished a distant third behind his stablemate. At the 2016 Cheltenham Festival Nichols Canyon started the 15/2 third choice in the betting for the Champion Hurdle. He raced prominently throughout the race but made a bad mistake at the final obstacle and finished third behind Annie Power and My Tent Or Yours. In April he faced Annie Power again and finished third behind the mare in the Aintree Hurdle. In the following month he was sent to the United States and moved up in distance for the Iroquois Steeplechase over three miles at Percy Warner Park in Nashville. He disputed the lead for most of the way before finishing third behind Rawnaq and Shaneshill. =2016/2017 National Hunt season: Hurdles= Nichols Canyon began the 2016/2017 season by attempting to repeat his success in the Morgiana Hurdle and started odds-on favourite ahead of Jer's Girl (Mares Novice Hurdle Championship Final), Sempre Medici (Red Mills Trial Hurdle) and Ivanovich Gorbatov (Triumph Hurdle). The race had not been his target, but he was drafted in when both Faugheen and Annie Power were injured. In a race run in thick fog Nichols Canyon emerged from the gloom to win by twelve lengths from Jer's Girl. Mullins commented \\"He‚Äôs just got lots of stamina and once it became a test of stamina the conditions suited him more than any other horse in the race. He jumps fantastically and he goes a very, very good gallop over two miles, so he‚Äôs competitive at it. I‚Äôd imagine we will be stepping up [in distance].\\" In December he started odds on favourite to win a second Ryanair Hurdle but was beaten seven lengths into second place by Petit Mouchoir. In the Irish Champion Hurdle in January he started second favourite behind Petit Mouchoir in a four-runner field which also included Ivanovich Gorbatov and the French import Footpad. He tracked the favourite from the start but looked well beaten when he fell at the last. On 16 March Nichols Canyon was stepped up in distance to contest the Stayers' Hurdle over three miles at the Cheltenham Festival in which he was partnered by Walsh and started at odds of 10/1 in a twelve-runner field. Unowhatimeanharry started odd-on favourite after winning eight consecutive races including the Spa Novices' Hurdle and the Long Walk Hurdle. The other runners included Cole Harden. Jezki, Zarkandar and Shaneshill. Nichols Canyon was held up by Walsh as Cole Harden set a strong pace before giving way to the outsider Lil Rockerfeller on the final turn. Nichols Canyon moved into contention approaching the final flight, produced a strong late run on the rail, took the lead in the final strides and won by three quarters of a length from Lil Rockerfeller with Unowhatimeanharry three and a half lengths away in third. After the race Graham Wylie said \\"When I told Willie to buy a horse for me, he rang me up and said 'I think I've found you the next Inglis Drever'. He looks like Inglis Drever as he's only a pony, but he flew up the hill. Ruby told me he'd ride him like that to make sure he got the trip. It wasn't until approaching the last I thought he might get placed, never mind win... we thought he'd be a Champion Hurdle horse, but it hasn't gone right... but this is great. Willie is a genius\\". Walsh commented \\"He's a little warrior. He switched off, he jumped and we just crept away. Lil Rockerfeller was battling back at me but he kept going all the way to the line\\". On his final start of the season Nichols Canyon started 7/4 favourite for the Champion Stayers Hurdle at Punchestown on 27 April. The race developed into a sustained struggle between Nichols Canyon and Unowhatimeanharry with the British-trained gelding prevailing by a head. =2017/2018 National Hunt season: Hurdles= On his first appearance of the 2017/2018 National Hunt season Nichols Canyon contested the Hatton's Grace Hurdle at Fairyhouse on 3 December and finished second to the five-year-old mare Apple's Jade. On 28 December Nichols Canyon faced Apple's Jade again in the Christmas Hurdle over three miles at Leopardstown. He was racing in third place when he fell heavily at the fifth flight, sustaining serious injuries. Although he was immediately attended by veterinary staff he could not be saved and was euthanised on the track. Ruby Walsh commented \\"He is a big loss... He was as tough as nails\\", while Patrick Mulling said \\"He was a small horse with a big heart and would run through a brick wall for you. He was a character as well, he was always a very happy horse.\\" PedigreeNichols Canyon was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Sadler's Wells, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

A highway link from Roe Highway to Fremantle Port was proposed in the Metropolitan Region Scheme since the 1950s. A reservation for the bypass was included in the scheme in 1973. It was deleted at the request of the state government's Minister for Planning in 1992, reinstated in 1994 following a change of government, and once more deleted in 2004 after another change of government in 2001. History In the 1950s, the Metropolitan Region Scheme planned for Roe Highway to continue westwards from its present terminus at Kwinana Freeway towards Fremantle, through South Fremantle along Marine Terrace and then north to connect with Stirling Highway and the Port of Fremantle. As part of the plan, in 1974 Stirling Highway was extended from its then terminus north of the Swan River southwards to Canning Highway. A narrow 4 km strip of land immediately south of this intersection was proclaimed for further road construction, but as it was not part of Gordon Stephenson's original plan it was occupied by housing built before the time of Stephenson. Over a period of approximately 20 years, Main Roads Western Australia procured most of the land in question for the future road. In 1985, the first kilometre of this road was constructed, which extended Stirling Highway southwards from Canning Highway to Leach Highway (known as High Street west of Carrington Street). The remaining 3 km strip of land south of High Street then became known as the Fremantle Eastern Bypass. At the southern end of the proposed Fremantle Eastern Bypass, an 8 km east-west road reservation was proclaimed. This became known as Roe Highway stage 8. This land however was lightly built up and much of it remained as urban bushland throughout the late 20th century. The Roe Highway stage 8 reservation was intended to be the final link of a major urban ring-road, as originally envisioned by Stephenson. However, there were problems with the proposed link, a product of the changes made by governments since Stephenson's original plan. This included the deletion of the original inner Fremantle section and the proclaiming of the Fremantle Eastern Bypass. Some residents of Fremantle strongly objected to the proposed 4-lane dual carriageway Fremantle Eastern Bypass, claiming it would divide the area, damage urban woodland and impact on 3 nearby schools. Also, the proposed Roe Highway stage 8 would cut between North Lake and Bibra Lake, a location considered of high environmental value as a wetlands. The Environmental Protection Authority in its report on the proposed Roe Highway Stage 8 confirmed the high conservation status of the Beeliar Wetlands and the negative impacts a highway would have on the wetlands. With a change of state governments in 2001, the planned Fremantle Eastern Bypass / Roe Highway stage 8 was cancelled, with a commitment by the government to sell the land reserved for the Fremantle Eastern Bypass. In doing this, the government put forward a \\"6-point plan\\" to cope with the anticipated growth of heavy vehicle traffic in and out of the Port of Fremantle, which included plans for better usage of rail, more efficient usage of trucks and a new deepwater container port near Rockingham. As promised, the Fremantle Eastern Bypass land was sold for a total of $17 million. These funds were then spent on a new grade separated interchange at the intersection of Leach Highway and Orrong Road in Welshpool. During the period for public submissions on the planned cancellation and sell- off, City of Melville residents opposed the plan as the proposed Fremantle Eastern Bypass / Roe Highway stage 8 would have removed most trucks from Leach Highway, which, although classified as a state highway, travels through a number of residential suburbs. On the other hand the move was generally supported by Fremantle residents including the local MP, and also those concerned by the potential negative impact the proposed road would have on Bibra Lake wetlands.

Their head coach was Roy Williams. No team captains were selected for this season, the first, and so far, only time this has happened in program history. The team played its home games in the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Roster Wes Miller was not eligible to play this season because he transferred from James Madison. After playing as a walk-on in the previous season, David Noel received a basketball scholarship to play beginning with this season. Schedule and results After Matt Doherty resigned from the men's basketball coaching position at the end of the previous season, Dean Smith once again persuaded Roy Williams to once again take the vacant position. This time Williams accepted, becoming the head coach of the Tar Heels on April 14, 2003. After the annual Blue-White Scrimmage and two exhibition games against North Carolina Central (then playing in NCAA Division II conference CIAA) and Team Nike, Williams' first game with the Tar Heels was against Old Dominion on November 22, 2003. Williams received a standing ovation as he stepped onto the court of the sold out Smith Center. With Smith and Bill Guthridge in attendance, the Tar Heels beat Old Dominion 90-64. The win was Williams' 419th career win. The 115 points scored against George Mason were the most points Tar Heel team had scored against an opponent since 1994. The triple-overtime loss to Wake Forest at home set several program records. The 114 points scored in this game are the most points scored in a Tar Heel loss. The Wake Forest loss was only the fifth time a game went into triple overtime in program history. The last time a game went into triple overtime prior to this season was in the 1982-83 season against Tulane (also the team, albeit in 1976, that the Tar Heels played against to set the program and ACC record of four overtimes). The 119 points that Wake Forest scored are the most points an opponent has scored over the Tar Heels, breaking the 112 points Maryland scored at Cole Field House in the previous season. Those points are also the most an opponent has scored against the Tar Heels in the Smith Center. Both teams scored 16 points in the first overtime. The Tar Heels' 16 points are the Tar Heels' third most points in an overtime period, and Wake Forest's 16 points are the second most points a Tar Heel opponent has scored in halftime. In the second overtime, both teams only scored two points, respectfully the fewest points the Tar Heels and one of their opponents have scored in a halftime. The 13 points Wake Forest scored in the third overtime are the third most points a Tar Heel opponent has scored in an overtime. The win against Miami was the 200th win in the Smith Center. The Tar Heels beat Connecticut for the second consecutive year. The win was also the Tar Heels' tenth win over a number one ranked team (according to the AP Poll). At the time, the Tar Heels tied UCLA for most wins over a number one ranked team. (The Tar Heels now own this record outright, with 13 wins over number one ranked teams to UCLA's 12.) The Tar Heels finished with their first winning record in two seasons, 17-10, but only finished fifth in ACC play with a conference record of 8-8. They were eliminated in the quarterfinals of the 2004 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament by Georgia Tech. However, their overall record by the time of their loss in the ACC Tournament allowed them to play in the 2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The Tar Heels' NCAA tournament run ended with a defeat against Texas in the tournament's Second Round. - !colspan=9 style=\\"background:#56A0D3; color:#FFFFFF;\\" Exhibition - !colspan=9 style=\\"background:#56A0D3; color:#FFFFFF;\\" Regular Season - !colspan=12 style=\\"background:#56A0D3; color:#FFFFFF;\\" ACC Tournament - !colspan=12 style=\\"background:#56A0D3; color:#FFFFFF;\\" NCAA Tournament http://www.goheels.com/SportSelect.dbml?SPSID=668157&SPID;=12965&SITE;=UNC&DB;_OEM_ID=3350&Q;_SEASON=2003 Notes References Category:North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball seasons North Carolina Category:2003 in sports in North Carolina Category:2004 in sports in North Carolina North Carolina ","title":"2003‚Äì04 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team"},{"id":"48989277","text":"E. Santos, 1972 Emilio Santos Corchero, born 7 October 1935 (San Vicente de Alcantara, Extremadura, Spain), is a theoretical physicist, professor at the Universities of Costa Rica (1964‚Äì68), Valladolid (1968-76) and Cantabria (Spain) (1976-). In the year 1998 he received the Medal of the Spanish Society of Physics. His scientific work (about 100 articles in scientific journals) has been mainly devoted to develop a stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics that maintains strict causality (i. e. supporting Albert Einstein‚Äôs opinion that \\"God does not play dice\\"). In that interpretation the dispersion of results in the measurements is due to lack of control of all relevant factors rather than to a lack of causality (as many quantum physicists believe). For a summary see Foundations of Science, 20, 357-386 (2015). An application has been the study of \\"parametric down conversion\\" experiments using the Wigner representation of quantum optics; see European Physical Journal D 13, 109-119 (2001) (in collaboration with A. Casado, T. W. Marshall and R. Risco-Delgado) and references therein. A related subject of interest has been the meaning of the Bell inequalities and the requirements for their empirical tests to be reliable. See Physics Letters 98A, 5-9 (1983) (in collaboration with F. Selleri and T. W. Marshall), Physics Letters 115A, 363-365 (1986), Physical Review A 46, 3646-3656 (1992), International Journal of Theoretical Physics 42, 2545-2555 (2003). The stochastic interpretation rests upon the assumption that the quantum vacuum consists of real fields. Their fluctuations might explain the \\"dark energy\\" recently discovered in cosmology; see Astrophysics and Space Science, 332, 423-435 (2011). Another subject of interest has been the study of relativistic stars in order to see whether some modifications of general relativity (possibly of quantum origin) might prevent the collapse to singularities (\\"black holes\\"); see Astrophysics and Space Science 341, 411-416 (2012).

Main characters  = Brakebills students = Quentin Makepeace Coldwater is the protagonist of the trilogy. At the start, he is 17, obsessed with a series of children's books called \\"Fillory and Further\\", and depressed. After a successful interview, he moves to Brakebills to study magic. After his graduation from Brakebills, Penny brings him evidence of travel between worlds and he travels to Fillory. Following a confrontation with the Beast in which he is seriously injured, he spends 6 months unconscious being healed by centaurs. He returns to Earth, taking a non-magical job before Eliot, Janet, and Julia arrive and he goes with them to rule Fillory. As a King of Fillory, he travels to the outer islands to collect unpaid taxes and is accidentally returned to Earth. After returning to Fillory and helping Eliot finish a quest to return magic to Fillory, he is again ejected from Fillory. Back on Earth, he returns to Brakebills, is assigned the Discipline of Minor Mendings, and becomes a professor until, after a prank by Plum, a Brakebills student, goes wrong, he is fired. He accepts a job attempting to steal a suitcase from a pair of magicians, and begins working with Plum. In the aftermath of the heist, he moves to New York with Plum, and they try to use the contents of the briefcase to create a magical land. Missing a key ingredient, they fail. Following Eliot to Fillory, which is now almost dead, he sacrifices Ember and Umber, gains their power, and repairs the land. He returns to New York, and is then successful in creating a magical land, which he begins to explore. In an interview, Grossman describes Quentin at the start of the trilogy as being a lot like he was as a teenager and \\"at the very end of the books gets to somewhere around where I'm trying to be\\". Quentin is at least somewhat bisexual, as though he prefers women, he was open to sleeping with Eliot. * Julia Wicker is a childhood friend of Quentin's. Following an unsuccessful interview for Brakebills on the same day as Quentin, she works to learn magic from other sources. Eventually, she finds Free Trader Beowulf, a group of hedge witches like herself, and she moves to Murs in France to study with them. Following an accidental summoning of Reynard, the trickster god, in which she is raped and has her humanity taken, she finds Eliot and Janet and travels with them and Quentin to become a Queen of Fillory. During a quest to restore magic to Fillory, the goddess she had intended to summon makes her a dryad, and she becomes a demigod, after which she goes to look after the other side of Fillory. Grossman has stated that she is very like what he was like in his twenties, when he \\"really got lost in the way that she does\\", and in writings about his own struggles with depression has used similar phrasing to the way he describes her. * Alice Quinn is a friend and lover of Quentin's and an extremely talented magician. She is in Quentin's class at Brakebills, moves up a year with him, and is sorted into the Physical magic group by her Discipline, which is Phosphoromancy. She comes from a family of magicians; her older brother was at Brakebills 8 years before her, and died when he was transformed into a niffin, a spirit of pure magic, by a spell that got out of control. At first, she is painfully shy, and is \\"deep in a trance of unworthiness\\", but she is able to pull herself out of it. After Brakebills, she and Quentin fall into a hedonistic lifestyle until they travel to Fillory. She transforms herself into a niffin to be able to defeat the Beast, saving her friends and Ember in the process. As a niffin, she explores Fillory, travelling in time back to its beginning, before making her way back to Earth and to Brakebills. There, seeing Plum and Quentin, she follows them until Quentin traps her in a failed attempt at making a magical land, and is able to transform her back into a human. She travels to Fillory with him as the land is dying, and assists him in the process of repairing it, before returning to New York. There, she and Quentin succeed in making a magical land and set out to explore it. * Eliot Waugh is a friend of Quentin's who becomes the High King of Fillory. He comes from Oregon, where he was bullied for his sexuality. Two years older than Quentin, Eliot welcomes him when he takes his entrance exam. Eliot is described by Quentin as \\"conspicuously brilliant\\" despite never seeming to study. He takes great care in his appearance, is a heavy drinker with an appreciation for fine wines, and smokes. He travels to Fillory with Quentin, and then becomes its High King, where he is able to develop into a mature and caring individual. In an interview, Grossman stated that Eliot was based on several people, including a college roommate that he looked up to. * Janet is a peer of Eliot and Josh, was in the Physical magic group, and becomes High Queen of Fillory. She is called \\"Janet Way\\" by another student in the first book, but \\"Janet Pluchinsky\\" by Dean Fogg in the second. She is outspoken and sometimes unkind, but fiercely loyal. She travels with the others to Fillory, where she becomes High Queen. During Eliot's absence, she tours the lands and writes a constitution. Her discipline involves cold magic, and in the third book she has a pair of ice axes she calls her \\"Sorrows.\\" In an interview, Grossman describes her as being free with her anger in a way he wishes he could be and notes that she says the sorts of things he would want to. Grossman has also noted that the discrepancy in her names is due to \\"operator error\\", in that he had forgotten that he'd revealed her last name and inadvertently renamed her. * Josh Hoberman is a peer of Eliot and Janet and later King of Fillory. He is the overweight comic relief of the Physical Magic group; an incredibly strong but inconsistent magician, he barely graduates from Brakebills. After travelling to Fillory with the others, he uses one of the buttons that allows users to travel between worlds to explore the multiverse, before he sells the button to the dragon in the Grand Canal and uses the money to buy himself a mansion and set himself up as an intermediary between self-trained \\"hedge witches\\" and classically trained magicians. He accidentally returns to Fillory with Quentin and Julia, and ends up becoming King of Fillory and marrying Poppy, with whom he has a child. * Penny is a peer of Quentin's and later the Librarian of the Neitherlands, the city between worlds. It is revealed that his first name is William and his middle name is Schroeder, but no last name is given. He is examined for Brakebills on the same day as Quentin, and his Discipline involves travel between worlds. After leading the others to Fillory and a fight with the Beast, in which his hands are bitten off, he chooses to stay in the Neitherlands. During the fight with the Old Gods, he proves himself capable, and losses in personnel mean that he is promoted to be Librarian of the order that runs the Neitherlands. He has spectral prostheses for his hands, which have a number of extra capabilities. In an interview, Grossman described him as a \\"suburban ... punk wannabe\\" who grew up in an upper-middle class home; he has a sheltered life in a Southern California Gated community and \\"tries to cobble together a personality by pretending he doesn't\\". Grossman describes him as very close in personality to Quentin, \\"just not in the ways that would make them like each other\\". = The Chatwins = The Chatwins are a family of five siblings who travel to Fillory while being sent away to the country; their descriptions of these travels to Christopher Plover form the basis of the \\"Fillory and Further\\" novels. They are listed in order of age. * Martin Chatwin, also known as the Beast, is the eldest sibling and first to travel to Fillory. He features in \\"The World in the Walls\\" and appears at the end of \\"The Flying Forest\\". Christopher Plover sexually abuses him, and he becomes disillusioned with the real world. He is able to sneak back in to Fillory through a route intended for Rupert, and he gives his humanity to Umber to be able to remain in Fillory forever. He becomes the Beast, rules Fillory as a tyrant, and is killed by Alice. * Fiona Chatwin features in \\"The World in the Walls\\" and \\"The Flying Forest\\", and later has children who inherit the house in Cornwall. In her later life, she would pretend she'd never heard of Fillory. * Rupert Chatwin is the author of \\"The Door in the Page\\" and the great-grandfather of Plum Purchas. He features in \\"The Girl Who Told Time\\", \\"The Flying Forest\\", and \\"The Secret Sea\\". He witnessed Martin giving his humanity to Umber in Castle Blackspire, after which he stole a spell and a knife capable of killing gods. He left the spell, the knife, and a memoir called \\"The Door in the Page\\" in a briefcase that could only be opened by one of his descendants before he was killed in Africa in World War II; this memoir is included in The Magician's Land. * Helen Chatwin features in \\"The Girl Who Told Time\\" and \\"The Wandering Dune\\". She is described as pious, worshipping Ember and Umber and deferring to Their judgement. After she and Jane receive magic buttons that would allow them to travel to Fillory at will, she hides them in a well. Later, she changes her name, becomes an Evangelical Christian, and moves to Texas. * Jane Chatwin, also known as the Watcherwoman, is the author of \\"The Magicians,\\" intended to be the sixth \\"Fillory and Further\\" book. She features in \\"The Wandering Dune\\" and \\"The Secret Sea\\". After she finds the magic buttons again at around age 13, she returns to Fillory to be told Martin has become the Beast and that Umber has been killed. She holds a war council with Ember. The dwarves give her a watch that allows her to travel in time, and she attempts many different scenarios until Quentin and his friends are finally able to kill the Beast, after which she destroys the watch. Following this, she ages rapidly. Posing as a paramedic, she is responsible for giving Quentin the note that leads him to his Brakebills entrance exam. = Ember and Umber = Ember and Umber, also known as the Great Rams, are the dual ram gods of Fillory, somewhat analogous to Aslan in their role. Each is significantly larger than a normal ram, with large, curled horns. Ember is golden, and has a resonant baritone voice, whereas Umber is dark grey, also known as the Shadow Ram, and has a higher, tenor voice. In the \\"Fillory and Further\\" books, they generally gave the Chatwin children a quest at the beginning, and then returned at the end to send them home again. In The Magicians, Ember has been trapped by the Beast, and Umber is presumed dead. It later emerges that the Beast was created when Martin Chatwin gave his humanity to Umber, who wanted to be a King as well as a god.  Characters introduced in The Magicians  = Brakebills =  Students  Amanda Orloff - student at Brakebills and peer of Quentin after he moves up a year. She is described as \\"devastatingly competent\\" and is the daughter of a Five-star general. She is killed when she tries to fight against the Beast after he breaks into Brakebills. * Gretchen - student at Brakebills a year older than Quentin who walks with a limp. * Surendra - student at Brakebills the same age as Quentin.

In Quentin's first year at Brakebills, she is 25, and he has a crush on her. * Mayakovsky - Professor Mayakovsky runs Brakebills South, in Antarctica. Despite being married, he had an affair with Emily Greenstreet, after which he was sent to Brakebills South, where he is held by an Incorporate Bond. He is an excellent magician, and has, in his spare time, constructed many magical wonders, any of which might have been a magnum opus. His father was brought in from Siberia to be a professor at Brakebills. His power-storing coins are used by Quentin to restore Alice, among other tasks. * March - Professor of Practical Applications. After Quentin distracts him in class, he misspeaks, allowing the Beast to enter; after these events, he retires. * Chambers - the Butler of Brakebills. After Eliot catches him taking wine from the Dean's cellar, he buys cigarettes for Eliot. He also provides the Physical Kids with alcohol. * Bigby - the mentor of the Physical Kids and a Pixie. * Brzezinski - a potions expert. * Foxtree - a tall, Native American professor who officiates a game of welters. = Fillorians = Humbledrum - bear. * Farvel - birch tree. * Dint - guide to the group who betrays them to the Beast. * Fen - guide to the group who is killed in Ember's Tomb. * The Questing Beast - one of the 12 unique beasts of Fillory.

He goes to University, becomes a hedge fund manager, lives in Hoboken, and Julia foresees that he will die in a skiing accident at age 77. * Richard - physical magician a year above Eliot, Janet, and Josh at Brakebills. He travels with the group to Fillory. * Ana√Øs - magician from Luxembourg who travels to Fillory with Quentin and his friends. * Emily Greenstreet - was a student at Brakebills in the same year as Charlie, Alice's older brother, 8 years before Quentin. She had an affair with Professor Mayakovsky, leading to his exile to Brakebills South, and was somewhat responsible for Charlie's death. She accepts a high paying job in New York essentially doing nothing, and meets Quentin after he returns from Fillory. * Lovelady - a travelling purveyor of questionably magical items who occasionally visits Brakebills. He sells a magical button to Penny allowing travel between worlds.  Characters introduced in The Magician King  = Fillorians = Abigail the Sloth - representative of the talking animals, sent aboard the Muntjac. She also acts as a psychopomp who provides the method by which Quentin and Julia reach the Underworld. * Aral - second place finisher in the Fillory-wide swordsman competition. * Admiral Lacker - Admiral of the Fillory Navy and Captain of the Muntjac. * Benedict Fenwick - apprentice in the map room in Castle Whitespire. Quentin convinces him to come aboard the Muntjac to help with maps and make new ones on their voyage. He is killed as he is leaving the Muntjac during a battle. * Bingle - winner of the Fillory-wide swordsman competition and personal bodyguard to Quentin and Julia. * Elaine - customs agent of Fillory, she tends to the borders. She is the daughter of the man who collected the keys, and Eleanor is her daughter. Quentin first meets her on Outer Island, and then at the End of the World. * Eleanor - daughter of Elaine. She makes Quentin a passport on Outer Island. * Jollyby - master of the hunt at Castle Whitespire. * unnamed collector of keys - father of Elaine = Julia's acquaintances = Julia's family consists of two parents and a sister four years younger than her.  The safe houses  Jared - leader of the first safe house Julia finds. He travels with her when she explores other safe houses, looking for information. * Warren - leader of a safe house in Richmond, Virginia, and a wood spirit of some kind. When he gets upset, he loses control of his human disguise and begins to sprout branches.  Free Trader Beowulf  Free Trader Beowulf is an online support group for people with serious clinical depression. Julia joins them after passing a series of hidden tests and decoding messages found online. There are 14 members; she is the 15th. Later, when she learns magic, she joins some of them in Murs, in a house owned by Pouncy, where they are attempting to gain more magical strength by summoning a god. The name \\"Free Trader Beowulf\\" is a reference to the early role-playing game Traveller. * Asmodeus - approximately 17, with a mysterious past and a brilliant mind for theoretical physics.

She eventually kills Reynard. * Failstaff - member of the Murs magicians. About 30, he is 6'5\\" and \\"built like a butte\\". He is in love with Asmodeus * Pouncy Silverkitten - owner of the house in Murs. He made a fortune trading stocks, and holds the Free Trader Beowulf record for highest level of prescriptions. He is described as looking like an Abercrombie model. * Gummidgy - member of the Murs magicians who acts as high priestess during the attempted summoning of Our Lady Underground and who is a psychic. * Fiberpunk - member of the Murs magicians who specialises in metamagic, magic that acts on other magic. He is described as a \\"short, thickset specimen almost as wide as he was tall.\\" * Iris - member of the Murs magicians who finds Julia in a safe house and tests her. Once Julia moves to Murs, Iris teaches her the rest of the basics so that Julia can participate in the rest of their research. = Others = Reynard the Fox - trickster god that the Murs magicians accidentally summon instead of Our Lady Underground. He kills everybody except for Julia and Asmodeus. After Julia sacrifices her shade to him, he rapes her, giving her semi-divine power. * Our Lady Underground - old fertility goddess from Provence. She carries a staff in one hand and in the other a nest with three eggs, and half her face is always in shade to signify the half the year she spends in the underworld. She is old enough that her name has been lost, so the Murs magicians name her after a statue, Notre Dame Sous Terre, which is one of the Black Madonnas that bear her influence. * Poppy - Australian magician and friend of Josh's who studies dragons. After being accidentally drawn into Fillory, she chooses to remain as a Queen, and eventually she and Josh are married.

He is a member of the editorial board of the journal Progress in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.. He is the chair of the editorial board of the journal Magnetic Resonance.  Education He received a Diploma in chemistry from ETH Zurich in 1974, and a D.Phil. from Oxford University in 1977, supervised by Ray Freeman.  Career  Bodenhausen began his post-doctoral research under the supervision of Robert and Regitze Vold at the University of California in San Diego. He subsequently worked with Leo Neuringer and Robert G. Griffin at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then in 1980 he moved to the ETH in Zurich, where he joined the group of Richard R. Ernst. In 1985 he was appointed to a professorship at the University of Lausanne. In 1994 he became a professor at the Florida State University in Tallahassee filling the position of Director of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Magnetic Resonance. In 1996 he was elected fellow of the American Physical Society \\"for his numerous contributions toward making magnetic resonance one of the most sophisticated and versatile methods available for gaining insight into structure and dynamics of molecules in condensed and gas phase.\\" In 1996 he was awarded a professorship at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris. He also held a part-time position at the √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne. From 2005 to 2011 he chaired the Board of Trustees of EUROMAR.  Research  Bodenhausen was one of the pioneers in the field of two-dimensional Fourier transform NMR spectroscopy. In the group of Ray Freeman he contributed to some of the first heteronuclear experiments. In 1976 he proposed a scheme to induce selective excitation of small portions of multiline spectra, later named DANTE by Morris and Freeman.E. Fukushima, S:B:W: Roeder, Experimental Pulse NMR, II.D.2. Selective excitations, pag. 114-115 In 1977 Bodenhausen and Freeman showed how it was possible by observing spectrum of a heteronucleus (an atomic nucleus other than a proton) to achieve indirect detection of the proton resonance frequencies, and the correlations of chemical shifts between protons and heteronuclei.G. Bodenhausen, R. Freeman: J. Magn. Reson. 28, 463 (1977)Slichter, Principles of Magnetic Resonance, p. 140 In 1980 Bodenhausen and D. J. Ruben introduced the HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) experiment, which produces two-dimensional (2D) spectra with one axis for protons (1H) and the other for a heteronucleus, usually 13C or 15N. This double INEPT has been the base for many subsequent heteronuclear single quantum experiments published in the literature and it has proven pivotal in the spectroscopy organic chemistry and in the field of protein NMR. One of the first steps in increasing the information content of NMR spectra was the introduction of a relayed homonuclear coherence transfer by Geoffrey Bodenhausen together with Gerhard Eich. In 1984 he published with Herbert Kogler and Richard R. Ernst a pivotal article in Journal of Magnetic Resonance where they described how to design phase cycles allowing the selection of specific coherence-transfer pathways in NMR pulse experiment. In 1987 he published with Richard R. Ernst and Alexander Wokaun Principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance in One and Two Dimensions, considered a classical monograph on the topic of multidimensional NMR.Oleg N.

At Princeton, he brought innovative and modern design to the conservative academic audience of university books and transformed the university into a center for innovative design. Conkwright‚Äôs design philosophy was that the book‚Äôs design should be user-friendly for the reader: lie flat when opened; wide margins to allow for holding; stamped spine; and clear, readable type. He also chose carefully the materials to be the best possible and within budget. Many of the designers he hired also received recognition, including: Helen van Zandt, Jan Lilly, and Frank Manhood.

Career  = NCIX and Linus Tech Tips = Sebastian was working as a manager for the now defunct Canadian online computer store NCIX. He was asked by the company to be the host for its technology channel, which was created to help demonstrate products. Sebastian was assisted by an unidentified cameraman and editor, and worked with limited resources, shooting videos with a camera borrowed from the son of the company's president. His first video was a demonstration for a Sunbeam processor heatsink. Due to high costs and low viewership during the early days of the channel, Sebastian was instructed to create the Linus Tech Tips channel as a cheaper offshoot of the NCIX channel, to allow for lower production values without impacting the NCIX brand. He described TigerDirect and Newegg as competitors. Linus Tech Tips was created on November 24, 2008. Sebastian did not develop videos full-time at NCIX. During his time at the company, he worked as full-time sales representative, a high-end systems designer, a product manager, and a category manager. = Linus Media Group = The Linus Tech Tips logo as of 2018. Sebastian founded Linus Media Group in January 2013 out of a garage, with Luke Lafreniere, Edzel Yago, and Brandon Lee. The group developed the Linus Tech Tips channel as an independent venture. = Notable projects =  \\"7 Gamers 1 CPU\\" (early 2016 ‚Äì late 2016)  On January 2, 2016, Linus Tech Tips released a video demonstrating a computer capable of supporting seven individual users at once, with an estimated total cost of $30,000. The video made technology news on a number of websites, and gained over one million views on the day it was uploaded. Two more videos of the machine, including benchmarking and overclocking results, were released before the machine was disassembled during a livestream the following month. The computer had eight modules of 32 GB ECC DDR4 RAM, eight 1 TB Kingston SSDs, two Intel Xeon 14-core E5 2697 v3 processors, seven AMD R9 Nano GPUs, an EVGA T2 1600W PSU, and was housed in a Caselabs Mercury S8 with an Asus Z10PE-D8 WS motherboard. The project was sponsored by Kingston Technology. On May 22, 2016, Linus Tech Tips released a sequel project, which was a system that allowed for eight users to play games simultaneously, among other improvements.  iMac Pro incident (2018)  In April 2018, the Linus Tech Tips channel uploaded a video claiming that Apple refused to repair his iMac Pro (paid, non-warranty repairs) after they damaged it in a product teardown, an act (refusal to repair) that has been speculated by VentureBeat to be illegal.  Gaming PC Secret Shopper (2018)  In December 2018, Linus Tech Tips released a four- part series detailing their experience buying a gaming PC from 6 System Integrators (SI) representing 3 different market tiers: two major manufacturers (HP and Alienware), two high-volume SI (iBuyPower and CyberPowerPC), two upscale boutique SI (Origin PC and Maingear) to see what they would offer to an average customer.
