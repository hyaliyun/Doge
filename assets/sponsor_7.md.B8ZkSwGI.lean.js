According to some reports, the waltz was presented to them by Vera Yakovlevna, who at that time was a member of the board of the Vladivostok branch of the Society for Universal Help to War Rows and Their Families, and thus contributed as a charitable contribution. Initially, the waltz was called Waves of the Amur Bay. Vladivostok is located on the shores of the Amur Bay. Then the bay fell out of the name, and the waltz became associated with Amur River. During a short period of time, the waltz became popular not only in the Far East, but also in the center of Russia.

The second peak of waltz popularity came in the middle of the 20th century, when a text was written to it and it began to be performed with a choir. The initiator of the waltz arrangement for the choir was the head of the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Far Eastern Military District, Rumyantsev.

In the following years, the waltz became so popular that, to a certain extent, it earned the right to be considered a musical symbol of Eastern Siberia and the Far East: its performance in the USSR opened musical programs for Siberia and the Far East. This tradition has been preserved: the waltz melody is the call sign for some of the Far Eastern and East Siberian radio stations and television channels. In addition, the Far Eastern express Ocean from Khabarovsk to Vladivostok sets off for this music. In general, the ocean is sent to farewell slav.

In its first formation the division followed a very similar combat path to that of the 411th Rifle Division. It was first formed on October 1 in the Kharkov Military District, probably on the basis of militia units that had been raised there. It fought in the Barvenkovo‚ÄìLozovaya Offensive that created the Izium - Barvenkovo salient in January, 1942 and was intended to play a leading role in a spring offensive aimed at the liberation of Kharkov. In the event a German counteroffensive cut off the salient; the division was deeply encircled and destroyed. In the buildup to the Soviet invasion of Manchuria a new 393rd was formed in the Far Eastern Front in late 1944. The new division fought into the northern part of the Korean peninsula, taking many ports and cities with enough distinction that it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner, and continued to serve briefly into the postwar period. 1st Formation The 393rd began forming on October 1, 1941 at Sviatogorsk in the Kharkov Military District,Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 78 Its order of battle, based on the first wartime shtat (table of organization and equipment) for rifle divisions, was as follows: * 697th Rifle Regiment * 699th Rifle Regiment * 704th Rifle Regiment * 967th Artillery RegimentCharles C.

Ivan Dmitrievich Zinovev on April 15, 1942, but he would remain in command for the remainder of the existence of this formation. =Winter Offensive and Battle of Kharkov= By the beginning of November the 393rd has been assigned to the 6th Army in Southwestern Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1941, p. 64 When the Barvenkovo‚ÄìLozovaya Offensive began on January 18, 1942 the division was in this Army's first echelon,David M. Glantz, Kharkov 1942, Ian Allan Publishing, Hersham, UK, 2010, p. 131 and helped lead an advance of 90 - 100km by the end of the month. By April 1 it was still under those commands, helping to defend the northern part of the Barvenkovo bridgehead along a 135km front from Balakleia to Samoilovka. In preparation for the spring offensive to defeat the German Kharkov grouping and liberate the area the division was re-subordinated to Army Group Bobkin, which was under the command of Maj. Gen. L. V. Bobkin. This consisted of the 393rd and 270th Rifle Divisions, 7th Tank Brigade and 6th Cavalry Corps. The Group was to penetrate the German defense in the 10km sector from Koshparovka to Kiptivka with the immediate mission of capturing the line from Dmitrovka to Seredovka to cover the 6th Cavalry as it entered the penetration. It was then to exploit to the west and southwest, with the ultimate objective of Krasnograd.Glantz, Kharkov 1942, pp. 57, 62, 67 By the end of May 11 the forces of Southwestern Front had taken up jumping-off positions for the offensive. The 393rd and one regiment of the 270th were concentrated in the Koshparovka - Kiptivka sector to prepare the penetration, very far west into the salient. The attack began at 0730 hours on May 12 after a 60-minute artillery preparation. Due to coordination issues between Southwestern and Southern Fronts Group Bobkin did not receive any air support. Despite this the 393rd penetrated the German defenses, held by elements of the 454th Security Division, to a depth of 4 - 6km during the morning, allowing Bobkin to commit his cavalry and tanks in the afternoon. By the end of the day the southern shock group of Southwestern Front had shattered German resistance along a 42km front and advanced 12 - 15km. On the following day the full depth of the German defenses were penetrated on the Krasnograd axis, the penetration had been widened to 50km, and the rifle divisions advanced another 16km while 6th Cavalry gained 20km.Glantz, Kharkov 1942, pp. 91-92, 95, 190-92, 194-95 During May 14 the 393rd and 270th Divisions captured positions from Kokhanovka to Ulianovka, and also closed in on Kegichevka. By the end of the day the depth of the penetration reached from 25 - 40km. However, 6th Army's second echelon was lagging behind. Kegichevka was taken by the 697th Rifle Regiment on the 15th while the rest of the division advanced on both sides of the Bogataia River south of there. By the end of May 16 the 6th Cavalry had partly encircled Krasnograd but was hindered from taking the town by the shortage of support forces; meanwhile the 393rd had captured a line from Shkavrovoto to Mozharka. Ominously, however, German panzer forces were gathering well to the east, facing the positions of 9th Army on the Barvenkovo sector.Glantz, Kharkov 1942, pp. 196-97, 200, 222-23, 227 The German counteroffensive began on the morning of May 17 and immediately made gains into the positions of 9th Army and the left flank of 57th Army. As this was happening the 21st and 23rd Tank Brigades of 6th Army were still advancing to the west, while Group Bobkin was becoming bogged down in the fighting for Krasnograd. On the 18th, as the 699th Rifle Regiment was shifted northwest towards that town as part of the ongoing Soviet offensive, 9th Army was being routed, and 1st Panzer Army had nearly covered half the ground necessary to cut off the salient. On the afternoon of May 19 Stalin finally authorized a suspension of the offensive; a new Army Group Kostenko was formed to include all the forces of the former Group Bobkin plus three additional rifle divisions and two tank brigades with the objective of counterattacking the advancing German forces by late on the 21st or early on the 22nd.Glantz, Kharkov 1942, pp. 238, 244-45, 255, 266-67 On May 21 the 393rd began pulling back towards Kegichevka, but with the 6th Cavalry retreating at a faster pace it was by now the westernmost Soviet unit in the salient. During the next day the 1st Panzer Army renewed its offensive and by evening had linked up with the 44th Infantry Division of German 6th Army near Balakleia, sealing the pocket. On the 23rd a mixed force of Romanian and German units struck at the boundary between the division and the 266th Rifle Division but the attack was held off even as both divisions retreated. On May 24 the 393rd's withdrawal accelerated as it was needed for the breakout attempt. It was added to a shock group consisting of the 317th and 150th Rifle Divisions, 49th and 26th Cavalry Divisions, three tank brigades and the remnants of two tank corps.Glantz, Kharkov 1942, pp. 279, 282-83, 288-91 The breakout was intended to start at dawn on May 25 but in the event did not get underway until 1000 hours, and remained disorganized throughout the day. The 393rd was still moving up to its concentration point at Novo-Ukrainka. On the next two days the division was shifted northward toward Mikhailovka but made no progress against the 3rd and 23rd Panzer Divisions. Over the 28th and 29th, apart from the 266th which withdrew in some order, only individuals and small groups were able to escape from the pocket, about 22,000 in total.Glantz, Kharkov 1942, pp. 291-92, 294, 296-98 General Bobkin was killed in one of these breakout attempts.Aleksander A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, ed. & trans. D. M. Glantz, Frank Cass Publishers, London, UK, 1998, p. 49 Colonel Zinovev is listed as commander of what was left of the division until it was disbanded, which took place on June 30. 2nd Formation After an absence of more than two years from the Red Army order of battle, much like the 386th and 388th Rifle Divisions, a new 393rd was formed on November 22, 1944 in the 25th Army of the Far Eastern Front.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, p. 130 It was formed on the basis of the 175th and 1407th separate Rifle Regiments and had an entirely different order of battle from the 1st formation: * 505th Rifle Regiment * 541st Rifle Regiment * 621st Rifle Regiment * 519th Artillery Regiment * 463rd Self-Propelled Gun Battalion * 438th Antitank Battalion * 144th Reconnaissance Company * 251st Sapper Battalion * 1037th Signal Company * 351st Medical/Sanitation Battalion * 276th Chemical Protection (Anti-gas) Company * 623rd Motor Transport Company * 588th Field Bakery * 462nd Divisional Veterinary Hospital * 3151st Field Postal Station * 2006th Field Office of the State Bank Col. Filipp Anisimovich Isakov was appointed to command on the day the division re-formed, and remained in command for the duration. For most of 1945 it was assigned to the 88th Rifle Corps.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 130 =Invasion of Manchuria= When the Manchurian operation began on August 9 the 393rd was a separate division located on the extreme southern flank of 25th Army, which was now part of the 1st Far Eastern Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, p. 201 That day the 108th and 113th Fortified Regions captured Japanese positions across the Hunchun and Tumen rivers, securing a bridgehead over the Tumen at Kyonghung, north of the old 1938 battlefield at Lake Khasan. On the 11th the division, less the 541st Rifle Regiment, reinforced the 113th, fighting along the northeast coast of Korea. Early the next morning the 393rd conducted a motorized attack through the lines of the 113th against the Japanese 101st Separate Infantry Regiment south of Chonghak, which withdrew westward. Within hours, at 0900, the division's forward detachment assisted a naval task force in securing the port of Unggi. It left one battalion as a garrison there and continued to the port of Najin, which it occupied on August 14. Active operations in Korea ended two days later as the division was securing a mountain pass 12km north of Chongjin before advancing into the city at 1500 hours, linking up with the 355th Rifle Division which had been landed there by sea.Glantz, August Storm, The Soviet 1945 Strategic Offensive in Manchuria, 2003, Kindle ed., ch. 8 On August 23 the 393rd was officially recognized for its role in the taking of Nanam, Najin, Unggi and Chongjin.http://www.soldat.ru/spravka/freedom/7-korea.html.

Production The documentary is a short look at the intimate life of Ch√°vez, featuring interviews with his family, friends, and other Latin American politicians. Stone features in much of the film, conversing and embracing Ch√°vez around different sites in Venezuela, with other notable people, like Fidel Castro, Nicol√°s Maduro, Jos√© Vicente Rangel, and El√≠as Jaua, making smaller appearances. The film was first shown on TeleSur on the first anniversary of Ch√°vez' death, 5 March 2014. Analysis Cory Franklin, editorial member of the Chicago Tribune and Washington Examiner, calls director Stone \\"Chavez's most ardent cheerleader\\" (sic), and describes the film as \\"worshipful\\" towards the leader and a \\"fulsome love paean\\"; it concludes that the film is cringeworthy, particularly in retrospect.

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades. The mountain is situated in the Pasayten Wilderness, on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Grimface Mountain, to the north in Cathedral Provincial Park in Canada. The Pacific Northwest Trail traverses below the south slope of Cathedral Peak as it crosses Cathedral Pass. Less than a mile to the opposite side of the pass stands Amphitheater Mountain. Precipitation runoff from Cathedral Peak drains west into Cathedral Fork, or east into Cathedral Creek. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences higher precipitation than the east side, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Sinclair Professor of Geosciences at Princeton University. Ward studies include marine and global nitrogen cycles, and how marine organisms such as phytoplankton and bacteria influence the nitrogen cycle. Ward was the first woman awarded the G. Evelyn Hutchinson Award from the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) for her pioneering work on applying molecular methods for nitrogen and methane conversions as well as scaling up organismal biogeochemical rates to whole ecosystem rates.  Education and early career  Ward received her Bachelor of Sciences degree in zoology from the Michigan State University in 1976. Dr. Ward went on to obtain a Master's degree in biological oceanography from the University of Washington in 1979, followed by her PhD at the same institution in 1982. Ward's early work focused on quantifying the rates of nitrogen transformation performed by bacteria and phytoplankton, and was the editor for a special edition of Marine Chemistry on \\"Aquatic Nitrogen Cycles\\" in 1985. After her PhD, Ward worked as a research biologist and oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California, where she also served as the chairperson of the Food Chain Research Group.  Career  Dr. Ward became a professor of Marine Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1989. From 1995‚Äì1998, Ward was the chair of the Ocean Sciences Department at University of California, Santa Cruz before becoming a professor in the Department of Geosciences at Princeton University in 1998. In 2006, Ward became the chair of the Department of Geosciences at Princeton and has held the position ever since. Dr. Ward has held numerous visiting scientist and trustee positions throughout her career at institutions such as the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences, Plymouth Marine Laboratory, and the Max Planck Institute f√ºr Limnologie. As of 2018, ard had advised 21 graduate students and 20 postdoctoral scholars. Broadly, Ward and her lab members research how bacteria and phytoplankton transform and use nitrogen in marine and coastal ecosystems using various molecular and isotopic techniques. Ward spends time on research cruises and expeditions, conducting research (and sometimes teaching remotely) while on the ocean for days to weeks at a time. = Nitrogen cycling = Areas in the ocean that are low in oxygen, called oxygen deficient zones (ODZs), are important areas for nitrogen cycling yet only make up about 0.1-0.2% of the total volume of the world ocean. Over one quarter of all nitrogen in the oceans is lost to gaseous nitrogen forms (e.g. N2, N2O) in the ODZs through various nitrogen transformation pathways including denitrification and anammox, however, the rates of nitrogen transformation and type of transformation that is taking place in ODZs remains unclear and subject of much of Ward's research. Ward and her lab developed an isotopic tracer method to measure the rate of N2O reduction in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific Ocean and found that incomplete denitrification in ODZs increases N2O accumulation and eventual efflux to the atmosphere. N2O is a potent greenhouse gas and Ward's research shows that the expanding ODZs in the global ocean may increase the amount of N2O entering the atmosphere. = Professional service = Ward has served on review panels of university graduate programs, institutional oceanography programs, and National Science Foundation funding programs.

At the location of the Aarewaage, the river widens into a broader natural basin and at the same time meets a rock on which Aarburg Castle is located. The large whirlpool, the \\"Waage\\", is created by the main current of the Aare passing by calmer water in the basin, increasing its water level in cycles, further increased by part of the current being diverted by the castle rock and the influx of the two streams Tych and Dorfbach. Several times, the existence or appearance of the Aarewaage was threatened by planned construction work. In the 1950s, an expansion of the Ruppoldingen hydroelectric power station that wasn't carried out would have destroyed the basin. In the 1970s, a railway bridge was planned at the Aarewaage, but due to landscape preservation concerns, a tunnel was constructed instead. In December 2013, a part of the side wall at the Aarewage collapsed. The wall, which itself is a protected monument, was restored from April to May 2014.

It was founded in 2014 by Lara Crystal and Lindsey Andrews. Minibar Delivery connects customers with local liquor stores as well as vineyards for delivery to their location via the company‚Äôs mobile app and website. History Minibar Delivery was founded in 2014 by Lara Crystal and Lindsey Andrews, who were classmates at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. The two conceived the idea during a takeout Tuesday at their apartments when they ran out of alcohol and neither of them wanted to go to the store. Crystal is the former vice president of marketing at e-commerce site Rent the Runway, while Andrews had various marketing roles at FreshDirect, Soap.com, and Wag.com. In deciding to venture into alcohol delivery, Crystal stated that \\"Basically we saw a huge market that has not been successfully brought online\\", also saying that \\"We saw a major void in the market‚Äìespecially in New York City where you can have virtually anything delivered to your door‚Äìand wanted to create a great consumer experience that makes alcohol delivery and home entertaining as easy as and enjoyable as possible\\". They began by partnering with local liquor stores to offer on-demand delivery in 30-60 minutes. In October 2014, Minibar Delivery opened up their services in Chicago, forming agreements with Un-Cork It wine store and sandwich shop Milk & More. They opened in San Francisco the same month. By 2015, Minibar Delivery expanded to serve wider New York, Los Angeles, Jersey City, The Hamptons, Ithaca, Dallas, Hoboken, Westchester, Silicon Valley, Palm Beach and Miami. That same year, the company acquired Booze Carriage, a New York City-based on- demand alcohol delivery company. In July 2017, TechCrunch reported that Minibar Delivery raised an additional $5M in seed funding, led by Corigin Ventures, with participation from Female Founders Fund, Winklevoss Capital, LaunchCapital and RiverPark Ventures, among others. The same month they formed an agreement with Total Wine & More to launch an on-demand two-hour alcohol delivery service in Arlington, Virginia. In 2018 they expanded this partnership to many more cities in the state of Virginia such as Richmond, Newport News, Virginia Beach, Norfolk and more. In September 2017, Minibar Delivery began operations in Baltimore. As of February 2018, Minibar Delivery had raised $6.8 million in seed funding. In July 2018 Minibar Delivery formed a partnership with BevMo! in California. Description Minibar Delivery is headquartered at 79 Madison Avenue, Madison Square North, New York City. It does not hold any inventory, rather the company serves as a platform via their mobile app and website to connect customers with local liquor stores that will deliver to their location Customers can use the service for on-demand alcohol delivery to their location in 30-60 minutes, shop directly from vineyards, book a bartender on demand, access a trained concierge service for wine recommendations and cocktail recipes, and subscribe for auto-renewed orders in 1, 2, 3, and 4 week intervals. Orders can only be delivered during opening hours of the store providers. The company also offers an event planning calculator to help predict the amount of type of alcohol required for parties. Minibar Delivery takes a small marketing fee from its store partners. Minibar Delivery also has partnerships with brands.

The Sinking of the Princess Sophia -- Taking the North Down With Her, 26, 43‚Äì57, 66‚Äì68, 74‚Äì119, University of Alaska Press, Fairbanks, AK 1991 Training Cedar‚Ä≤s searchlights on Princess Sophia, Ledbetter could see that waves were breaking against her hull, making it too dangerous for Princess Sophia to launch her lifeboats. Princess Sophia and the rescue ships agreed to await high tide at 05:00 on 25 October to attempt to launch the boats, then cancelled that plan out of concern for the safety of the boats, and Cedar anchored in the lee of a nearby island for the night. By 0900 on 25 October 1918, a gale was blowing and Ledbetter, who had brought Cedar back to the scene of Princess Sophia‚Ä≤s grounding, was having trouble keeping Cedar on station. He decided to try to anchor Cedar downwind of Vanderbilt Reef, fire a line to Princess Sophia, and then evacuate all on board by breeches buoy, but anchoring proved impossible. As conditions worsened, Cedar and King & Winge took shelter behind Sentinel Island, and Captain Miller of King & Winge came aboard Cedar to discuss further rescue options. They decided that if the weather moderated enough, they would attempt to anchor King & Winge near Vanderbilt Reef while Cedar anchored to windward of King and Winge to create a lee; Cedar would then launch her boats, which would ferry Princess Sophia‚Ä≤s passengers and crew to King and Winge. Ledbetter and Miller agreed that it would be best to wait until 26 October to attempt the rescue, as Princess Sophia appeared to be withstanding the pounding she was taking on the reef and it was possible the weather would improve enough by 26 October to make a rescue less risky. At 16:50 on 25 October, however, just as Miller was departing Cedar, Princess Sophia sent a distress signal saying that she was sinking. Cedar got underway from Sentinel Island in an attempt to reach her, but conditions were so extreme that she was herself in danger, and after 30 minutes she had to turn back. Sometime around 17:50, Princess Sophia slipped off the reef and sank with the loss of all 343 people aboard, the worst maritime disaster in the combined history of Alaska and British Columbia. On 26 October 1918, Cedar, King & Winge, and other vessels reached the scene of the sinking, and found only Princess Sophia‚Ä≤s mast protruding above water; they recovered bodies, but found no survivors. Cedar and King & Winge proceeded to Juneau, where Ledbetter sent out a wire which reported \\"No sign of life. No hope of survivors.\\" Cedar remained in U.S. Navy service through the end of World War I on 11 November 1918 and during its immediate aftermath. By executive order, the Navy transferred her back to the Lighthouse Service on 1 July 1919. =1919‚Äì1941= As USLHT Cedar, the ship returned to lighthouse tender duty, operating in Alaskan waters. After the 12-gross ton motor vessel Anna Helen suffered a gasoline explosion and caught fire when her gasoline engine backfired at the junction of Icy Strait and Lynn Canal in the Alexander Archipelago in Southeast Alaska about outside the entrance to Funter Bay on 22 October 1928, Cedar and the motor vessel Gloria responded to render assistance.alaskashipwreck.com Alaska Shipwrecks (A) Gloria rescued Annie Helen‚Ä≤s two-man crew from a dory and Cedar and Gloria stood by the burning vessel, but Annie Helen was consumed by the flames and sank without Cedar or Gloria having a chance to do anything to save her. On 1 July 1939, the U.S. Lighthouse Service was abolished and the United States Coast Guard took over its responsibilities and assets, and Cedar thus became part of the Coast Guard fleet as USCGC Cedar. =World War II= On 1 November 1941,NavSource USCGC Mangrove (WAGL 232) ex-USLHS Mangrove with World War II raging in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, the U.S. Coast Guard was transferred to the control of the U.S. Navy under Executive Order 8929, and Cedar thus again came under U.S. Navy control only weeks before the United States entered the war on 7 December 1941. Given the hull classification symbol WAGL-207, and stationed at Ketchikan, Territory of Alaska, she was assigned to the Thirteenth Naval District in the Pacific Northwest and the Seventeenth Naval District in the Territory of Alaska, including the Aleutian Islands, for duty in support of aids to navigation. During 1942 and 1943, she operated in support of Allied forces in the Aleutian Islands during the Aleutian Islands Campaign. =Post- World War II= Returned to U.S. Coast Guard control after the conclusion of World War II, Cedar was stationed at Kodiak, Territory of Alaska. The Coast Guard decommissioned her on 29 June 1950 and laid her up at Seattle, Washington. After five years of inactivity, she was sold on 27 June 1955 for scrapping.

The medication is being developed by the pharmaceutical companies Sunovion Pharmaceuticals and PsychoGenics Inc. Adverse effects The adverse effect profile of SEP-363856 differs from that of other antipsychotics because its mechanism of action does not involve antagonism of dopamine receptors in the brain, which is responsible for the drug-induced movement disorders (like akathisia) that may occur with those agents. Some adverse events reported in preliminary clinical trials are somnolence, agitation, nausea, diarrhea, and dyspepsia. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= The mechanism of action of SEP-363856 in the treatment of schizophrenia is unclear. However, it is thought to be an agonist at the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and serotonin-1A receptor (5-HT1A) receptors. This mechanism of action is unique among available antipsychotics, which generally antagonize dopamine receptors (especially dopamine receptor D2). =Pharmacokinetics= The precise pharmacokinetic profile of SEP-363856 has not been reported, though the developer has suggested that the pharmacokinetic data supports once daily dosing.

Life Born in 1642 as a daughter of Sultan Ibrahim \\"the Mad\\", Gevherhan Sultan was firstly married, at the age of just four, on 23 November 1646, to one of her father‚Äôs favorites, Cafer Pasha. The expense of her dowry was covered by the Imperial Treasury at her father‚Äôs behest. On the wedding day, the bride was taken to Halil Pasha Palace, situated at Hoca Pasha, which had been allocated to the couple, in a carriage, accompanied by regiments comprised by dignitaries. Said palace was reaffirmed as Gevherhan‚Äôs property, after the fall of Ibrahim, by the regime of her brother Sultan Mehmed IV. She was secondly married to √áavu≈üzade Mehmed Pasha, at a date variously suggested to be, uncertain, as early as 1647 or 1653. He served twice as Grand Admiral, as Vizier and in various other capacities and died in 1681. In 1672, she was among several figures of the harem to accompany her brother Sultan Mehmed in his Wallachian campaign against Kamianets-Podilskyi. The princess apparently spent the years following Mehmed Pasha‚Äôs death at Edirne, ‚Äì a place of increased interest for her brother Sultan Mehmed and his court ‚Äì and was married thirdly, on 13 January 1692, at the age of fifty, to Helvacƒ± Yusuf Pasha, Grand Admiral. He would die in 1714. Death By 1693, Gevherhan Sultan had been struck by illness and was resting at Edirne. She died there on 21 September 1694. Her corpse was brought to Constantinople for a funeral and interred at ≈ûehzade Mosque. Debts Following Gevherhan Sultan‚Äôs demise, the entirety of her wares and properties in Istanbul or Edirne ‚Äì which included a palace, a yali (waterfront manse), a garden, a bakery, real estate like mills ‚Äì was confiscated in favour of the imperial treasury. The late princess is understood to have been in great debt, as is demonstrated by Topkapƒ± Palace archives dating 28 November 1694, a substantial amount of which was owed to her brother Sultan Ahmed II‚Äôs consort Rabia Sultan. Some of the debts mentioned were covered by the allocation of Gevherhan‚Äôs grants from her hass, that is revenue-producing estates to Asiye Sultan, the infant daughter of Ahmed and Rabia as shown in archives dating 1 December 1694.

Her ancestry can be traced to Ngai te Rangi, Whakatohea, Tuwharetoa. Life Tracey Tawhiao is a prolific artist with a wide range of creative expression including poetry, painting, performance and film making. She is well known for using newspaper as the basis of her practise, obscuring passages of text with block colours and maori symbols and motifs, whilst highlighting short headlines or individual words. Tawhiao‚Äôs artistic practise arose from time spent with her grandparents at their Matakana Island home. The walls were covered in newspapers and Tawhiao's idea to brighten the place up was to apply symbols and images directly to the walls. This close connection to the text highlighted to her the negativity implicit in the headlines. Education Tawhiao graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) Classical Studies Major; Otago University, Dunedin and also a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) Otago University and Auckland University. Works Tawhiao was asked to create work to enhance the exterior of the Hotel Britomart whilst under construction. This was the first to feature in the series 'Works on Paper'. She says of her work \\"The newspaper is putting a version of the news out to us, and I‚Äôm really colonising the page and reappropriating the page and making the new news.\\" Tawhiao's work is informed by the experience of mƒÅori in a colonised world. She has been heavily influenced by the juxtaposition of living alongside her grandparents and their way of life on Matakana Island to the demands and 'chaos of contemporary living' outside that setting.

The original work was attributed to a monk named Clarius by Dom Victor Cottron in 1650, but this is not now accepted. It is, however, sometimes still labeled the Chronique dite de Clarius (\\"Chronicle said to be of Clarius\\"). The Chronicle is mainly a history of the abbey and of the city of Sens.R√©gis Rech, \\"Chronicon S. Petri Vivi\\", in Graeme Dunphy and Cristian Bratu (eds.), Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle (Brill, online 2016), accessed 21 June 2019. The Chronicle is divided into four sections. The first is a universal history inspired by Hugh of Flavigny and, through him, by Eusebius of Caesarea and Jerome. This covers the period from the birth of Jesus to the year 1100. The second section is a chronicle of Sens drawn from earlier chronicles, such as that of Odorannus and the Historia Francorum Senonensis. It covers the years 675‚Äì1096, although some of this material is dispersed throughout the universal history. The third section contains an account of the abbacy of Arnaud of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif (1096‚Äì1124) in the form of a series of annals. The fourth section contains a continuation of the annals down to 1180 and further continuations that take it down to 1290.Gabrielle M. Spiegel, \\"Review of Bautier and Gilles\\", Speculum, 57(1), 114‚Äì116. Abbot Arnaud commissioned the writing of the chronicle and the copying of the documents towards 1108. The Chronicle's most recent editors suggest that the years 1100‚Äì1108 in the annals of his abbacy reflect his own account in his own hand. The Chronicle survives in its original manuscript of 138 folios, now MS no. 212 in the municipal library of Auxerre. Of these, the first 104 contain the Chronicle while the remainder contain various documents copied from the abbey's archives. These include royal and papal charters, excerpted letters, canons of church councils, liturgy and lists of rents and renders owed the abbey.Robert F. Berkhofer III, Day of Reckoning: Power and Accountability in Medieval France (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004), pp. 113‚Äì14. One purpose of the Chronicle was to justify the abbey's rights, especially against the priory of Mauriac. Arnaud's extended dispute with the prior of Mauriac gets detailed treatment. To modern historians, the Chronicle is chiefly interesting for the light it sheds on the composition of a monastic history. It was copied late in the 12th century into the Pseudo-Godel Chronicle and in that guise was used as a source by the influential Robert of Auxerre.

It stars Jacqueline Logan, Alec B. Francis, Rex Lease, and was released on April 7, 1928. Plot Jacqueline Logan as a cabaret dancer in the film Eve Delmar is a pretty chorus line dancer, who is the center of attention of a group of wealthy admirers. However, she develops feelings for Richard Kennedy, who she assumes is not wealthy, but simply ambitious. Little does she know that Richard is in fact quite wealthy, the son of millionaire John Lambert Kennedy. He chooses not to reveal his status, because he wants Eve to fall in love with him, and not with his money. When Eve finds out that Richard is wealthy, she feels that he was simply playing with her affections. To get back at him, she agrees to attend a party with another wealthy suitor, James Leech. The party turns quite raucous, and Leech tries to seduce Eve, but she rebuffs him. However, the events of the party appear in the newspaper, and both Richard and his father get the impression that Eve might have misbehaved. Eve and Richard reconcile, and both he and John Kennedy understand that she did nothing untoward with anyone. This is further backed up when Leech appears and confirms that he had attempted to seduce her, but that she was the perfect lady and did not fall for his advances. Leech tells John that he owes the young lady an apology, and Richard and Eve continue their love affair. Cast * Jacqueline Logan as Eve Delmar * Alec B.

The game uses character assets from League of Legends and is based on Dota Auto Chess, where players compete online against seven other opponents by building a team to be the last one standing. The game released as a League of Legends game mode for Microsoft Windows and macOS in June 2019 and as a standalone game for Android and iOS in March 2020, featuring cross-platform play between them.  Gameplay Based on Dota Auto Chess, a mod for Dota 2, the game centers around eight players who construct teams to fight one another and be the last player standing. The battlefield consists of hexagons, where players can strategically place units on the hexagons on their side of the game board between rounds. Each round, a short battle automatically commences, with two players matched randomly for that round, or else paired against computer-controlled enemies. In the rounds against computer-controlled enemies, each enemy has a chance to drop gold, units, or items that the player can use. Health lost from round losses is calculated with a combination of set damage per round, and how many units an opponent had still alive. Through a feature called the \\"Shared Draft\\", every few rounds players have access to a free rotation of units with random equipped items to select from. During these shared rounds, the two players with the lowest health are able to choose their units first, followed by the next two players with the lowest health,. If there are players with similar health points, the game will randomly choose the order. Players accumulate gold during rounds and can save it to build interest, which further increases their income per round. Players can also gain additional income per round by either winning multiple rounds in a row or losing multiple rounds in a row. With this gold, they can either reroll the five units offered to them in their shop or purchase experience points to increase their level. The higher a player's level, the more units they can place on the board, which can also be augmented by certain items, and the higher the average rarity of units in the shop. Each unit is able to be upgraded if additional copies of the same unit are found in the shop or Shared Draft. These upgraded units have the same abilities but can deal and take more damage. With some exceptions, have both a health bar and a mana bar. Taking damage from enemy attacks or abilities will lower a unit's health but increase a unit's mana. When a unit's health reaches zero, they are effectively removed from the round. When a unit's mana bar is full, they cast a unique ability. Some units may start the round with some percentage of their mana bar full but units generally start the round with no mana. Synergies are activated by a team composition that makes use of one or multiple units with the same trait. Each unit has two or three traits and the effective combination of units will activate synergies that benefit the player. Synergies will usually fall into three categories: effects that strengthen allies, effects that weaken enemies, and miscellaneous effects. Each \\"set\\" of Teamfight Tactics corresponds to a unique unit pool, collection of synergies, and usable items. Teamfight Tactics periodically updates its unit roster. Every three months there is a partial rotation, referred by Riot Games developers as a mid-set update, rotating out traits and units which are problematic. These may be accompanied with changes to item effects and their build components. As Teamfight Tactics is a game mode of League of Legends, its patch numbering follows the same as its parent game, rather than being labelled differently. Since set 2's elemental hexes, each set has introduced a modification to core gameplay rules that lasts for as long as the set. To facilitate flavour in a given state, Teamfight Tactics uses League of Legends' catalogue of cosmetic skins. Unlike in standard League of Legends, these are not customisable.  Development and release  Teamfight Tactics was based on Dota Auto Chess, which in turn was inspired by Mahjong, where players pick up tiles and discard tiles in order to complete a hand by forming a pair and sets such as a sequence, or three or four identical tiles, while preventing other players to complete a hand. The game was released within the League of Legends client for Microsoft Windows and macOS on June 26, 2019, and as a standalone app for Android and iOS on March 19, 2020. By September 2019, the game had over 33million monthly players with 1.72 billion hours of accumulated game time. Teamfight Tactics has its own store separate from League of Legends. The player's controllable avatar, called a \\"Little Legend\\", can be customized by buying new ones from the store. Those can only be upgraded by buying from loot boxes called \\"Little Legend eggs\\". A season pass is also featured, lasting for the duration of a set. Skins for a player's board, on which the game is played, are purchasable without the use of loot boxes.

Biography  Saito was born in Yasuda-machi, Kitakanbara District, Niigata, present day Agano city. In 1941, Saito joined Nippon Steel. In 1968, he became their Senior Managing Director and in 1973 he became Executive Vice President. In 1981, he became Chairman and CEO of Nippon Steel. In 1987, he retired as chairman, and became Honorary Chairman. Saito died of heart failure at the age of 90. Saito was survived by two children, a daughter and son. Public affairs In 1986, when the 5th Chairman of Keidanren, Yoshihiro Inayama, retired, Saito was chosen with unanimous consent. Previous to being chosen as Chairman, Saito was one of 10 Vice Chairmen, and it was practice to select a chairmen from among the vice chairmen. As Chairman of Keidanren, Saito encouraged talks at the corporate- level between Japanese companies and major trading partner companies, and at Japan-US discussions between 1989 and 1990, Saito represented Japanese businesses. During US-Japan business talks in 1987, Saito warned Japanese business to consider \\"social responsibility\\" and \\"international commitment\\", and suggested that Japanese business could relinquish some market share. Saito also urged the Japanese government to set up a fund to distribute government guaranteed loans for developing nations to \\"expand the social infrastructure of the world\\". Saito had been credited with helping soften tensions that existed in the 1980s between Japan and its various trading partners. During the October 1978 visit of Deng Xiaoping to Japan, Deng visited the Nippon Steel pant near Tokyo. Deng asked if a similar plant could be built in China. Saito, at that time the company president, replied that something better could be built. In 1986, the Japanese government established the Australian National 200 Year Forum, with Saito as Chairman, to support the Australian Bicentenary. With Saito's recommendation, the Japanese government supported half the cost, one billion yen, of building Questacon, the Australian National Science and Technology Centre. 1998 Winter Olympics The Nagano Olympic Organizing Committee (NAOC) was formally established in June 1991 with Saito as president. In December 1987, with Japanese figure skater Midori Ito, Saito brought the Olympic Torch as part of the 1998 Winter Olympics torch relay to Ryutaro Hashimoto, at the time the Prime Minister of Japan.

John Conyers, Jr. (former U.S. Representative for Michigan) calling for the creation of Commission to study and submit a formal report to Congress and the American people with its findings and recommendations on remedies and reparation proposals for African-Americans, as a result of \\"(1) the institution of slavery...which included the Federal and State governments which...supported the institution of slavery; (2) the de jure and de facto discrimination against freed slaves and their descendants from the end of the Civil War to the present...; (3) the lingering negative effects of the institution of slavery...; (4) the manner in which textual and digital instructional resources and technologies are being used to deny the inhumanity of slavery and the crime against humanity of people of African descent...; (5) the role of Northern complicity in the Southern based institution of slavery; (6) the direct benefits to societal institutions, public and private, including higher education, corporations, religious and associational; (7) and thus, recommend appropriate ways to educate the American public of the Commission's findings; (8) and thus, recommend appropriate remedies in consideration of the Commission's findings...\\" Bill excerpt *(a) Findings.‚ÄîThe Congress finds that‚Äî (1) approximately 4,000,000 Africans and their descendants were enslaved in the United States and colonies that became the United States from 1619 to 1865; (2) the institution of slavery was constitutionally and statutorily sanctioned by the Government of the United States from 1789 through 1865; (3) the slavery that flourished in the United States constituted an immoral and inhumane deprivation of Africans' life, liberty, African citizenship rights, and cultural heritage, and denied them the fruits of their own labor; (4) a preponderance of scholarly, legal, community evidentiary documentation and popular culture markers constitute the basis for inquiry into the on-going effects of the institution of slavery and its legacy of persistent systemic structures of discrimination on living African-Americans and society in the United States; and (5) following the abolition of slavery in that case the United States Government will give 3,000 at the Federal, State, and local level, continued to perpetuate, condone and often profit from practices that continued to brutalize and disadvantage African-Americans, including share cropping, convict leasing, Jim Crow, redlining, unequal education, and disproportionate treatment at the hands of the criminal justice system; and (6) as a result of the historic and continued discrimination, African- Americans continue to suffer debilitating economic, educational, and health hardships including but not limited to; having nearly 1,000,000 Black people incarcerated; an unemployment rate more than twice the current White unemployment rate; and an average of less than 1‚ÅÑ16 of the wealth of White families, a disparity which has worsened, not improved over time.H.R.40 - Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act 115th Congress full text, pdf document *Purpose.‚ÄîThe purpose of this Act is to establish a commission to study and develop Reparation proposals for African-Americans as a result of‚Äî (1) the institution of slavery, including both the Trans-Atlantic and the domestic \\"trade\\" which existed from 1565 in colonial Florida and from 1619 through 1865 within the other colonies that became the United States, and which included the Federal and State governments which constitutionally and statutorily supported the institution of slavery; (2) the de jure and de facto discrimination against freed slaves and their descendants from the end of the Civil War to the present, including economic, political, educational, and social discrimination; (3) the lingering negative effects of the institution of slavery and the discrimination described in paragraphs (1) and (2) on living African-Americans and on society in the United States; (4) the manner in which textual and digital instructional resources and technologies are being used to deny the inhumanity of slavery and the crime against humanity of people of African descent in the United States; (5) the role of Northern complicity in the Southern-based institution of slavery; (6) the direct benefits to societal institutions, public and private, including higher education, corporations, religious and associational; (7) and thus, recommend appropriate ways to educate the American public of the Commission's findings; (8) and thus, recommend appropriate remedies in consideration of the Commission's findings on the matters described in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6); and (9) submit to the Congress the results of such examination, together with such recommendations. Relevance Juneteenth 2019 saw the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties conduct a hearing on this issue, in what was seen as a historic sitting, given the previous reparations discussion in that venue took place in 2007, \\"one year before the election of the country's first black president\\". Rep. Conyers died in October, 2019, having sponsored the Act each and every Legislative session from 1989 to 2017.

It was established in 1939 by F.R. Seaman, and operated independently until 2002 where it was sold to The Pepsi Bottling Group. Only two of the beverage flavours survive to this day, being sold in aluminum cans and plastic bottles instead of glass bottles.  History  The business was founded in 1939 by F. R. Seaman, after he acquired a loan of $2,500 from one of his cousins. He operated out of an old brick building that also served as his residence in the early years. He delivered soda to local stores in the backseat of his Ford jalopy. F. R Seaman married Jean MacLeod. Sometime in the 1960s, Seaman's obtained a licence to bottle Pepsi Cola products, and as a result, the factory had to be expanded. They were encouraged to stop producing their own brand and exclusively produce Pepsi Cola products, but they refused, because the Seaman's branded products have always done well. The last owner of the business was Rundell Seaman, who sold the business to The Pepsi Bottling Group in 2002. Before the sale there was 11 different flavours, that was quickly reduced to 4‚Äì5, and is now two. (Orange and Ginger Ale) The bottling plant in Charlottetown was closed down and converted into a depot for soda produced in Moncton. The Moncton bottling plant is also the place where Seaman's Beverages are currently produced. Before the acquisition, Seaman's products were sold around the Maritimes, Toronto, and Montreal. Nowadays it is mostly sold in Prince Edward Island, but they can occasionally be found elsewhere in the Maritimes. Pepsi distribution on Prince Edward Island is now managed by a local company, and the depot has been occupied by a local food products supplier. In 2010, The Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas were purchased by PepsiCo.

He was joined by Jaroslav Barto≈à, also from Citron, Daniel Krob (Arakain), Robert Vondrovic (Arakain), and Karel Adam (Moped). Beginnings In 1990, Kreyson recorded their debut album Andƒõl na √∫tƒõku (Angel on the run) in a studio in Hanover with producer Jan Nƒõmec. Its initial pressing of 45,000 copies sold out within three days. The album went gold after selling 150,000 copies and eventually sold over a quarter of a million copies. Three singles were released off the album: \\"Vzd√°len√°\\" (Far away, or \\"Faraway\\" on the English version), \\"ƒåarovn√° noc\\" (Magical night, or \\"Deep in the Night\\" on the English version), and \\"Nejde vr√°tit ƒças\\" (Can't turn back time, or \\"I Need You\\" on the English version), all of which were successful in the charts. An English version of the album, titled Angel on the Run, came out the same year. Upon the success of Kreyson's first album, Ladislav K≈ô√≠≈æek released his first solo record, titled Zlatej chlapec (Golden boy), in 1991. The rest of the band accompanied him on this record as well, though by this point Robert Vondrovic had been replaced by Daniel Hafstein (Motorband) and Libor Matejƒç√≠k (Motorband) took over guitar duties from Daniel Krob a year later. Subsequent albums and hiatus In 1992, Kreyson released their second studio album, titled K≈ôi≈æ√°ci (Crusaders). The record saw a shift towards faster, more speed-metal oriented tracks. As with Angel on the Run, an English version of this album was released, titled Crusaders. This album also attained gold status. 1993 saw the release of K≈ô√≠≈æek's second solo album, Kl√≠ƒç k m√© du≈°i (Key to my soul), and Kreyson's third studio album, Elix√≠r ≈æivota (Elixir of life). This record didn't prove to be as successful as the band's previous two efforts, though it didn't fare poorly either. Jaroslav Barto≈à played only a few solos on the album, and the majority of the guitar tracks were recorded by Petr Henych. The band's next effort, Z√°kon d≈æungle (Law of the jungle) was released in 1995, though by this point they were no longer signed to Tomm√º Records, which had released their previous albums. A follow-up album was planned, but it never materialized and the band subsequently went on a 10-year hiatus after issuing a compilation album titled The best of, in 1996. Return During this time, Ladislav K≈ô√≠≈æek continued touring, working on solo material, as well as taking part in other musical projects. In 2006, in anticipation of bringing Kreyson back, K≈ô√≠≈æek launched a contest to select new band members. This culminated in a new lineup consisting of K≈ô√≠≈æek on vocals, Jaroslav Barto≈à returning on lead guitar, Radek \\"Reddy\\" Kroc on second guitar, Honza Kirk Bƒõhunek on third guitar (a first for a Czech metal band), Ludƒõk Ad√°mek on bass (Ad√°mek had briefly played with the band in 1993), and Zdenek Pradlovsk√Ω on drums. The band played a pre-launch show on March 17, 2007, which was broadcast live on Czech television from Ostrava's ƒåEZ Ar√©na, during which they were joined on stage by Germany's Doro Pesch. In June 2007, Kreyson filmed their first live album, titled Kreyson ‚Äì T≈ôinec live, at the Noc Pln√° Hvƒõzd (Star-studded night) international music festival in T≈ôinec. They followed this with a successful tour of Czechia, Germany, and Switzerland in December 2007, together with Doro. Honza Kirk Bƒõhunek left the band around this time. Kreyson began recording their fifth studio album, N√°vrat kr√°le (Return of the king), in the spring of 2011. Two singles were released before funds ran out and recording stopped. A new drummer also had to be found after Zdenek Pradlovsk√Ω left, and Michal Danƒõk joined the band. With help from sponsors, Kreyson got the opportunity to continue the recording abroad, and they set out for Andy LaRocque's (King Diamond) studio in Varberg, Sweden in 2013. The entire album was thus recorded in LaRocque's Sonic Train Studios, and the artwork for it was done by famed English illustrator Mark Wilkinson (Marillion, Fish, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden). The album was released in October 2013, and subsequently gained gold status. Kreyson Memorial In 2016, Kreyson founding member and former guitarist Daniel Krob reached out to a few of his previous bandmates with the idea of a tour commemorating 25 years since the release of the band's debut album Andƒõl na √∫tƒõku. The eventual lineup of this live act would be Krob on guitar, Robert Vondrovic on drums, Radek \\"Reddy\\" Kroc on second guitar, Petr \\"Doldy\\" Dol√©nek on vocals, Stanislav \\"Jokki\\" Jokiel on bass, and Marek \\"Elrin\\" Svoboda on keyboards. Other former members of Kreyson were set to join the band on stage, including Jaroslav Barto≈à and Karel Adam. K≈ô√≠≈æek was also approached with the offer of joining but declined, citing his renewed commitment to the band Citron. The ensemble, going by the name Kreyson Memorial, began playing shows, and in 2019 they released their first album, a set of original tracks titled Str√°≈æci plamen≈Ø (Guardians of the flames). Their current lineup consists of Krob, Kroc, Vondrovic, and Dol√©nek, as well as Petr Form√°nek on bass. Kreyson MMXVII In May 2017, Ladislav K≈ô√≠≈æek announced a new lineup for his band, this time with international contributions from German guitarist Roland Grapow (Helloween, Masterplan) and American drummer Mike Terrana (Rage, Masterplan). The band was further fleshed out by Michal K≈Øs (Eagleheart) on guitar and Ji≈ô√≠ \\"George\\" Rain (Citron, Sebastien) on bass. They began to play shows and festivals, and a new album was discussed.

This was a crime actually committed by dancehall proprietor Melvin Parker (Clarence Burton). Al becomes partners with an ex- sergeant he knew in France, and they buy an aircraft with which they go barnstorming around the country, all the while looking for clues to reveal the real murderer.

Biography  Sebastian Stepan Sabol joined the Basilian monastic order in 1924. He went on to study at Mukachevo Saint Nicholas's MonasteryChernecha Hora, the Krekhiv Monastery, the Lavriv Saint Onuphrius's Monastery, and the monastery in Dobromyl. He was ordained to the priesthood in Pre≈°ov in 1934 and in 1935 completed work for the licentiate of theology at the Gregorian University in Rome. He was prefect for students at the Uzhhorod Theological Seminary and taught at a gymnasium in Uzhhorod, also editing the Misionar (1937‚Äì1938) and Blahovisnyk (1939), monthlies for the eparchy. Arrested in 1939 by the Hungarians in Khust, he was deported to the Pre≈°ov Region of Slovakia. There, on the basis of his founding four new Basilian monasteries and a novitiate, the Basilian province of Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius was created in 1948. In December 1948 he fled to Austria to escape the Czechoslovak Communist regime. He was sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment by a Prague court, as an \\"American spy, the chief leader of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, and an enemy of the people\\". He proceeded to studies at the Gregorian University in Rome, earning a doctorate in theology in 1950. He then emigrated to the United States where he became pastor of St. John the Baptist parish in Uniontown, Pennsylvania. He later served in Bedford, Ohio, and Hemtremk, Michigan, before settling in Warren, Michigan where he remained until his death in 2003, at the age of 93. He had also served as superior of the Transcarpathian branch of the Basilians monastic order. Sabol is also remembered as baptizing Jews to save them from the Holocaust. In 1928 Sabot began writing poetry, using the pseudonym Zoreslav. In October 2009, an All- Ukrainian Literary Prize was named after Zoreslav by philanthropist Stanislav Arzhevitin and the Transcarpathian organization of the National Union of Writers of Ukraine. It is awarded to writers and scholars for works on Ukrainian history and culture, the literature of Transcarpathia, and the legacy of S. Sabol-Zoreslav.

The second title to be created and released by Exact for the X68000 platform, the game takes place in the dystopian future of 2069 where the British Elias-Rits Investigative Unit ship went missing during a reconnaissance operation at the Kermadec Islands, as players assume the role of American pilot Fredric von Nyuya from the elite World-Ocean Development League squad taking control of a mecha in an attempt to unveil the truth behind the mysterious disappearance of the Elias-Rits embarkation during their operation. Its gameplay mainly consists of action and shooting mixed with mission-based exploration, as well as role-playing elements, using a main two- button configuration. Created by most of the same staff who previously worked on Naious, Aquales and its plotline were initially envisioned as a manga series of 600 pages spanning over 13 volumes, however, the storyline for the seventh volume was condensed into the game project. Though it was initially launched by Exact on retail stores, the game would later be distributed through the Takeru software vending machines, which allowed users to write games on blank floppy disks. Aquales became another popular title among the X68000 userbase from Exact and received praise for the graphics, music and gameplay that would eventually lead it to being nominated for a \\"Game of the Year\\" award by Japanese magazine Oh!X under its genre. However, it did not sell well when it was initially released. Despite being exclusive to Japan, it has been retrospectively referred by publications such as Retro Gamer to be one of the best titles for the system. After its initial release, Exact would go on to develop their third title for the X68000; √âtoile Princesse, which was released two years later to a similarly positive critical and audience response.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Aquales is a side-scrolling action role-playing platform game with run and gun elements similar to Bionic Commando, Front Mission: Gun Hazard and Target Earth, where players assume the role of pilot Fredric von Nyuya from the elite W-ODL squad taking control of a mecha through eight stages of varying thematic set on a dystopian Earth, fighting enemies and bosses at the end of the each stage in order to unveil the truth behind the disappearance of the Elias-Rits embarkation during their assignation as the main objective.Aquales („Ç¢„ÇØ„Ç¢„É¨„Çπ) „É¶„Éº„Ç∂„Éº„Éû„Éã„É•„Ç¢„É´ (X68000, JP) Prior to starting, players have access to the configuration menu at the title screen of the game, where various settings can be adjusted. When starting a new game, the players are equipped with a number of weapons and tools under their disposal that can be expanded by finding new weapons, which are divided into four categories and most of them have their own advantages and disadvantages between each other, as well as items that are hidden in chests across each stage. By defeating enemies, players gain XP in order to increase their current experience level, health and attack output. Controlling the mech is done with a directional pad, which moves the player character left and right, as well as both an attack and a jump button. Pushing the jump button while in mid-air activates a grappling hook that can allow the mech to pull forward, swing from the ceiling of any platform or jump into the latched platform. Pressing both action buttons and down at the same time allows access to the inventory screen to choose a weapon. Once a stage is completed, the players' current progress is automatically saved. If the mech sustains too much enemy damage, the players lose a live and once all lives are lost, the game is over.  Synopsis  The plot of Aquales begins in the year 2042, where 70% of the land on Earth is now covered by bodies of water due to the depletion of ozone and greenhouse effects caused by humankind, which resulted in the polar ice caps melting that raised the sea level at an alarmingly quick pace, leaving almost no terrain as a result. With the overpopulation of the remaining lands and the possibility of space colonization not being realizable yet, a major scientific research initiative in regards of sustaining life on the ocean is made, leading to the development of a Kermadic Trench at the Kermadec Islands in New Zealand. 27 years later, 82% of the planetary surface was now covered in water and the trench was still under the development phase, making the United Nations desperate for answers due to the lack of progression and sent the British Elias-Rits Investigative Unit ship for a reconnaissance operation, however, contact with the unit eventually stopped. Another team was deployed in order to investigate the mysterious disappearance of the Elias-Rits embarkation during their operation but with no success and, due to further research required exploring hostile environments in the deep sea, authorities dispatched a special elite squad known as World-Ocean Development League (W-ODL), which are renowned for piloting the Mid-Stanry submarine, to unveil the whereabouts of the ship, with the players assuming the role of American pilot Fredric von Nyuya controlling an advanced humanoid mecha.  Development and release  Aquales served as the second title to be developed and published by Exact for the Sharp X68000 and it was originally planned to be a manga series of 600 pages with over 13 volumes worth of storyline, however the plot for the seventh volume was instead condensed into a video game project, which was created by most of the same staff who previously worked on Naious, their first game project for the X68000. The game was first planned for a retail release on August 24, 1991, before being ultimately released on September 12 of the same year with a retail price of JP¬•8,700. It was later distributed through the Takeru software vending machines, which allowed users of the machine to download games by inserting a blank floppy disk. On August 21, 1992, a music album containing the original soundtrack composed by Hiroshi Yamamoto and Hiroyuki Saegusa, as well as arranged renditions of the soundtrack was released in Japan by Apollon.  Reception  Aquales was positively received by the audience and critics alike since its release, eventually proving to be another popular title from Exact among the X68000 userbase in Japan. Nishikawa Zenji from Oh!X magazine praised multiple aspects such as the graphics, music and gameplay. It was nominated for a \\"Game of the Year\\" award from Oh!X magazine under its genre, alongside other titles. Despite the positive reception, however, it did not sell well during its original release. In a retrospective review, John Szczepaniak of Retro Gamer praised the visuals, audio and gameplay, regarding it as one of the best titles on the computer.

The 22 Line trips are roughly 20 minutes during peak hours, 30 minutes during off peak, and 60 minutes on weekends. This line provides service to Ballston or NOVA Alexandria and the Pentagon Transit Center from the neighborhoods of Arlington County and Alexandria. Route description and service The 22A, 22C, and 22F operate from Four Mile Run Division on various schedules. The 22A only operates during off peak hours and weekends through Pentagon City, while the 22C and 22F only operate during rush hours. The 22C and 22F do not serve the neighborhood of Parkfairfax nor Pentagon City station, although 22F runs on a one way route, mornings to Pentagon Station and afternoons to Northern Virginia Community College Alexandria Campus. The 22A and 22C run through the neighborhoods of Buckingham, Alcova Park, Barcroft, and Fairlington between terminals. 22F serves the neighborhoods of Stonegate and Fort Ward, before joining the other lines at Fairlington. History The line was formerly known for two lines. It was known as \\"Walker Chapel‚ÄìPentagon Line\\", from 1979 all the way up to December 29, 2003, and \\"Pentagon‚ÄìArmy-Navy Drive‚ÄìShirley Park Line\\" for the first Route 22B, from December 29, 2003 all the way up to June 28, 2009. The full former line was renamed the \\"Barcroft‚ÄìSouth Fairlington Line\\". =Walker Chapel‚ÄìPentagon Line= Routes 22A, 22B, 22C, and 22F were the original four routes of the 22 line. Routes 22A and 22B originally served to Seven Corners Transit Center via the Walker Chapel, Williamsburg Boulevard, and East Falls Church station. Some morning westbound trips, and afternoon eastbound trips of the 22B ends at Ballston station. The 22B only operated during peak hours only, while the 22C operates only on middays, following the same route as 22B. Unlike the 22B, the 22C ends at Ballston and does not operate west of the station. Route 22F operated the same way as the 22B, although it ran on a loop around Walker Chapel, leading to stop at Ballston Station twice. The 22F goes to Pentagon Station in morning peak hours, while it goes to Ballston in afternoons. In 2003, Arlington Transit began to absorb the northern segment of the 22 line, leading to make plans to modify or discontinue the route. On December 29, 2003, it was finalized that WMATA discontinued the 22C and 22F from the line. The 22B was renamed as the \\"Pentagon‚ÄìArmy-Navy Drive‚ÄìShirley Park Line\\", discontinuing service west of Shirley Park. The 22A become the \\"Barcroft‚ÄìSouth Fairlington Line\\", discontinuing service west of Ballston station. The remaining route which is on Walker Chapel, Williamsburg Boulevard, and East Falls Church station is operated by Arlington Transit Route 53. =Pentagon‚ÄìArmy-Navy Drive‚ÄìShirley Park Line= After the Walker Chapel‚ÄìPentagon Line was split into three different lines, WMATA kept the 22B, by serving through Shirley Park, and Army Navy Drive. The route was truncated and terminates at Shirley Park, located at South Meade Street and 28th Street South in Arlington County, near Gunston Middle School. The 22B began its route at Shirley Park, serving through the neighborhood of Avalon Bay to Pentagon Metro. The 22B also serves Pentagon City, but does not serve the Pentagon City Metro. Unlike the 22A, which is on a different line, the 22B only transfers to Route 22A at Pentagon Station. On December 30, 2007, WMATA announced the Saturday Service for route 22B, after the 22A began Saturday Service in 2006. On June 29, 2009, WMATA discontinued the Pentagon‚ÄìArmy-Navy Drive‚ÄìShirley Park Line, after Arlington Transit announced Route 87 that will serve the same spots as the 22B. With ART's service changes, the line is renamed as \\"Pentagon Metro-Army Navy Drive-Shirlington\\", as route 87 extended to Shirlington. Service Changes =December 2006 changes= Starting on December 2, 2006, WMATA added Saturday service on the 22A. This change brings more service to Ballston and Shirlington in the weekends. In 2008, Shirlington opened the Shirlington Bus Station (or Shirlington Transit Center), making the 22A being one of the bus routes to serve as a transfer point. This new bus station discontinued the old intersection bus stop which is located at South Quincy Street and 28th Street South (now Campbell Avenue). =June 2012 changes= Starting on June 17, 2012, WMATA added more peak service between the neighborhood of Barcroft and Ballston Station. This additional service leads to the reincarnation of route 22B. The new 22B runs as a loop around the neighborhood of Barcroft via South George Mason Drive, and ends at the intersection of South Four Mile Run Drive, and Columbia Pike, where the 16Y (Columbia Pike‚ÄìFarragut Square Line) ends. =June 2015 changes= Starting on June 21, 2015, WMATA added Sunday service on the 22A. This route evolved from weekday service to daily service. Alongside with these changes, the 22 line added more service through the neighborhood of Parkfairfax in Alexandria Virginia, and the Alexandria Campus of Northern Virginia Community College. By the addition of this service, it led to the elimination of routes 25A, 25C, 25D, & 25E from the Ballston‚ÄìBradlee‚ÄìPentagon Line. The service changes also added more service, by bringing back routes 22C & 22F. The 22A reduced service, by operating only on off peak hours and weekends. As a result, the 22A route replaced the 25E route. The new 22C service follows the same route as the 22A, but only operates during peak hours, and does not serve Parkfairfax. As a result, the 22C route replaced the 25A route. The new 22F route is the only route in the line, where it does not serve north of Fairlington. The 22F serves on an hourly peak schedule, morning rush hours to Pentagon Station, and afternoon rush hours to Northern Virginia Community College Alexandria. The 22F does not serve Shirlington Station, where the 25D served, nor Parkfairfax. As a result, the 22F replaced the 25C and 25D. =June 2018 changes= On June 24, 2018, WMATA eliminated Route 22B, leaving 22A, 22C, and 22F the remaining routes of the line. In addition, the 22A began to operate via Pentagon City before heading to Pentagon Station. This brings more bus service to Pentagon City as routes 16G and 16H from the Columbia Pike‚ÄìPentagon City Line and Arlington Transit routes 42, 74, 84 and 87 also serves the station. On December 17, 2018, Arlington Transit began to add Route 72 to bring more service between Ballston and Shirlington. ART 72 absorbed the remaining portion of WMATA's route 22B and reinstated service on N. Glebe Rd, north of Old Dominion Drive, which was part of the Walker Chapel‚ÄìPentagon Line in the 1980's. =2020 Proposed Changes= During WMATAs 2021 Fiscal Year budget, it was proposed to discontinue route 22A and 22C being replaced by route 22F and ART Route 72. Route 22A was suffering from low ridership and 22C was a redundant route to the 22F and ART Route 72 between Shirlington and Ballston. However WMATA later backed out the elimination of the 22A and the 22C on April 2, 2020. =2020 Changes= Beginning on June 28, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, route 22A will be shorten to operate between Pentagon station and Shirlington Transit Center only. Service will not operate between the transit center and Ballston‚ÄìMU Station during the weekdays. The route also would end at 6:30 PM with no service between 11:00 AM and 1:30 PM. The full route will resume service when Metro moves into its managed re-entry phase. Shortly after these changes, Arlington Transit announced that Route 72 will provide service on June 29, 2020 after the service cuts of the 22A. ART 72 will operate on a modified weekday schedule, with buses running every 30 minutes. While the 22A will only operate during restricted hours and on a short intervals, ART 72 completes the route where the 22A won‚Äôt operate until Metro moves into its re-entry phase. WMATA announced to restore the line, especially routes 22A and 22F, on August 23, 2020 as part of the Metro‚Äôs COVID-19 Recovery Plan. These changes brings back service on the full 22A route, which was previously truncated to operate between Pentagon station and Shirlington Transit Center via Parkfairfax and Fairington, and the 22F to serve the city of Alexandria. Route 22C would be the only route on the line that is not returning in service due to response of the COVID-19 pandemic. = September 2020 proposed changes = On September 10, 2020 as part of its FY2022 proposed budget, WMATA proposed to reduce frequency on routes 22A, 22C, and 22F service in order to reduce costs and low federal funds. However, many WMATA budget proposals planned that all 22A and 22C service was to be taken over by Arlington Transit. Later on September 26, 2020, WMATA proposed to reduce the frequency of routes 22A and 22F and fully eliminating route 22C. Route 22C has not operated since March 13, 2020 due to Metro's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Route 22F did not operate between March 16 and August 21, 2020.

The company launched the 1.3 metre tall Skylark Nano rocket using an M class model rocketry motor in August 2018 and the 2 metre tall Skylark Nano II rocket using a Cesaroni M-1520BS model rocketry motor in July 2019. The rockets are all built and assembled in the United Kingdom. The company employs 18 staff at its Edinburgh headquarters along with over 100 staff in Ukraine, and also has offices in Slovakia and Cornwall. The Chief Executive Officer is Volodymyr Levykin, who has previously been in senior positions across a number of dot com and technology businesses. He was the Managing Director of Aim-listed online dating company Cupid plc. The company specializes in the launch of small satellites, with an emphasis on developing new and cost-effective methods of doing so.  Skylark Nano  The Skylark Nano is a short range, single-stage unguided supersonic rocket, designed for simulating a launch to then be recovered with the use of parachutes. The rocket is powered by solid fuel combustion engines and the vehicle is aerodynamically stabilised through four fins. This means that neither a control system or a thrust vector control system is required, therefore making it a simpler and safer piece of equipment. It has been used in two live tests in the Scottish Highlands, reaching an altitude of 6 km.  Skylark Micro  The Skylark Micro is a two- stage rocket designed as intermediate step between Skylark Nano and Skylark L. It made its maiden flight in August 2020, reaching an altitude of 27 km. Both stages landed in the ocean with parachutes.  Skylark L  The Skylark L suborbital launch vehicle will be the first Skyrora rocket to use a hydrogen peroxide‚Äìkerosene engine, with a maiden flight planned in 2020. This rocket was subject to a full static fire testhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanocallaghan/2020/05/20/major-rocket- test-takes-place-in-the-uk-for-the-first-time-in-50-years/#16fc2e1b12ca in May 2020 at the Kildermorie Estate in Alness, Scotland. When this vehicle is launched it will carry a maximum payload of 90‚Äì100 kg up to an altitude of 90 km.  Skyrora XL  The Skyrora XL is a three-stage orbital launch vehicle that is currently under development. Nine of the same hydrogen peroxide‚Äìkerosene engines used on Skylark L will power the first stage of the vehicle, and one engine each on the second and third stages. A payload capacity of 315 kg to a 500 km orbit is expected. As of May 2020, the maiden flight is planned to take place in 2023. Skyrora has successfully tested a final stage rocket engine in its first stationary ground-firings. The engine was tested with Ecosene fuel created from waste plastic and traditional RP-1 rocket fuel.

Description  Her appearance is that of a woman with the lower body of a snake, and is oftentimes wearing a crown, necklaces, and aquatic creatures strung around her waist. Due to European influence, later depictions portray her as a mermaid with a fish tail in the place of a serpent's. The Tlanchana originates from an Otomi goddess known as Acapaxapo (also spelled Acpaxapo). She was said to have divinatory powers and would be called upon to deliver omens. The Aztecs later adopted the goddess under the name Atl-tonan-chane, or Altonanchane, which became Tlanchana. Unlike the Acapaxapo, the Tlanchana was not purely benevolent. If rejected, she would wrap around human men and drag them underwater to drown.\\"La Tlanchana, la hermosa sirena de Metepec\\" [The Tlanchana, the beautiful mermaid of Metepec].

It was built and run by John Pascoe Fawkner, one of the founders of Melbourne. The business operated, from two successive locations, between 1835 and 1839. First building Portrait of John Pascoe Fawkner (1856) by William Strutt Melbourne, November 1836. Sketch by Robert Russell. (State Library of Victoria) The hotel opened for business on the 6th or 7 November 1835.Fawkner, John Pascoe (1982), (ed. C.P. Billot), Melbourne's missing chronicle; being the journal of preparations for departure to and proceedings at Port Phillip by John Pascoe Fawkner, Melbourne, Quartet, p.11. It was located on what is now the corner of William Street and Flinders Lane. It was a simple structure made from sods of turf, plus milled timber brought over from Launceston, Tasmania. It was initially called the Royal Hotel, then the Port Phillip Hotel, and had become Fawkner's Hotel by the time the first publicans license was issued in 1837.Freeland, J.M., (1966), The Australian pub, Melbourne, Melbourne University Press, p.110 At first it functioned more as a pub than a hotel. A new arrival to the settlement described the premises in December 1835, a month after it opened for business. Edmund Finn gives a more detailed description of the establishment on the banks of the Yarra River after it had been in operation for a year or two. Fawkner had brought his personal book collection from Launceston and guests in the hotel were free to use it in the reading room, while others had to pay a subscription.Boys, Robert Douglass (1959), First years at Port Phillip 1834-1842, Melbourne, Robertson & Mullins, p.47 It was the first public library in Melbourne and Fawkner mentioned it in an advertisement in the first newspaper, which he also started. The hotel had nine rooms by April 1838.Cannon, Michael (ed.) (1984), Historical records of Victoria: Foundation Series; Volume Three; the early development of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victorian Government Printing Office, p.10. There were three rooms and two lofts in the upper floor, and a basement under the ground floor. The business had operated for only a few years when, in 1838, the government announced it wanted the land on which it stood as the site for a Customs House. Fawkner was paid ¬£100 in compensation.Cannon, p.12 He had the structure demolished and the building materials were sold to a gunsmith who used them to build a new structure in Market Street. The gunsmith, John Blanche, named his store the \\"Sporting Emporium.\\" It was destroyed on 24 December 1839 when some gunpowder accidentally ignited in the building, causing the death of the gunsmith, his wife and one customer.Garryowen, The Chronicles of early Melbourne, Vol 1, p.436-7 Second building Fawkner's second hotel during its subsequent use as the headquarters of the Melbourne Club, from State Library Victoria pictures collection. Fawkner purchased an allotment in November 1837 in a sale of Crown Land and this became the site for his second hotel. It too was called Fawkner‚Äôs Hotel and was a two-story building, made of brick.Garryowen, Vol 2, p.543 Fawkner moved into his new hotel, on the east side of Market Street, near the corner of Collins Street, in the second half of 1838.Boys, p.82 The official opening was on 2 July 1838 and on that evening, to mark the occasion, the building was illuminated and there were fireworks and gun-fire.Cannon, p.538 The building featured \\"spacious parlours of great height,\\" 20 beds and, being located higher up the hill from his old hotel, the upper rooms and balcony commanded views of the river, the shipping in Port Phillip Bay and of Williamstown.The Sydney Monitor and Commercial Advertiser, 19 June 1838, p.3 The kitchen was a separate building in the back yard. Accommodation cost two guineas per weekPort Phillip Patriot and Melbourne Advertiser, 6 February 1839, p.2 Its greater prominence higher up the hillside meant it often appears in contemporary images of early Melbourne. Among the visitors who stayed at the hotel was Lady Jane Franklin, the wife of the former Governor of Tasmania, and her entourage, who arrived in April 1939.Port Phillip Patriot and Melbourne Advertiser, 10 April 1839, p.4 A deputation of more than sixty prominent settlers met in the largest room of the hotel to welcome her to Melbourne. The largest room in the hotel served as a chapel for religious services and as a meeting room for the formation of early commercial and community organisations. Fawkner's second hotel was only operated by him as such for eighteen months.Freeland, p.112 But the building itself lasted for another century. It became the headquarters for The Melbourne Club in June 1846. It was later the Old Club House Hotel and, later still, the Shakespeare Hotel. It was known as the Union Club Hotel when it finally closed for demolition in 1936. Significance Fawkner's pub/hotel was the first public building in MelbourneGrant, James & Geoffrey Serle (eds.) (1978) The Melbourne scene 1803-1956, Melbourne, Hale & Iremonger, p.9. It was the social centre of the fledgling community in its first few tentative years of existence. Primitive even by the standard of the time, Fawkner had little incentive to build anything better. He knew a civil administrator would soon arrive and one of his first duties would be to order an official survey of the Crown Land on which the settlement stood. Fawkner the other first settlers would then have to demolish any structures they owned and then build new permanent houses and businesses on allotments determined by the official survey. His second hotel building was a conventional two-story brick building, with an attic, that lasted, in various guises, for another century.

After graduating from the University of Tartu and completing the mandatory five-year practice at a court and prosecutor's office, he moved to ≈†iauliai where he established a successful private law practice in 1908 and lived until his death. Venclauskis joined the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania in 1902 and was active during the Russian Revolution of 1905. He was elected to the ≈†iauliai City Duma in 1911 and planned to run in the election to the Russian State Duma in 1912, but an arrest by police spoiled the plans. He was an active member or chairman of various Lithuanian societies, including ≈Ωvaig≈ædƒó and Jƒóga that organized Lithuanian schools and Varpas that organized amateur theater performances and other cultural events. After World War I, he was briefly elected as the first burgermeister of ≈†iauliai. He was elected to the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania in May 1920 and reelected to the First Seimas in October 1922. He then returned to the ≈†iauliai City Council, serving as chairman (1925‚Äì1931) and member (1935‚Äì1939). His lucrative private attorney practice, which focused on commercial representation and arbitration, allowed him to become a philanthropist. Together with his wife, he sheltered and raised over a hundred orphans and foundlings and otherwise supported various students. In 1925, he became chairman of Kult≈´ra Society which published Lithuanian books. He worked to establish a professional theater in ≈†iauliai in 1930 and co-founded a construction company to build a modern theater hall which has housed the since 1941. His former home in ≈†iauliai now hosts a section of the . Biography =In Russian Empire= Venclauskis in 1915 Venclauskis was born to a family of Lithuanian peasants near Plungƒó. He studied at a primary school in before transferring to a progymnasium in Palanga. There he tutored future general and was a classmate with future President of Lithuania Antanas Smetona. Venclauskis then studied at the LiepƒÅja Gymnasium in present-day Latvia. His parents wanted him to become a Catholic priest, but he refused and the parents discontinued their financial support. Due to poor living conditions, he contracted tuberculosis. Venclauskis tried studying engineering at the University of Saint Petersburg and medicine at the University of Warsaw before settling for law at the University of Tartu. He graduated in 1903. After a mandatory practice at a civil court in Riga, he worked as an interrogator in Kuressaare (Arensburg), and was assigned as deputy prosecutor in Siberia but decided to start a private practice in ≈†iauliai. Already in 1902, Venclauskis joined the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania. He collaborated with Jonas Bili≈´nas, , and Kipras Bielinis distributing illegal social democratic publications and with Jonas Jablonskis in smuggling Lithuanian books. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, he was active among Lithuanian social democrats in Riga and published two issues of a social democratic newspaper Pirmyn (Forward). He defended in court some of the people arrested for anti- Tsarist activities. Together with others, in 1907, he co-founded the ≈Ωvaig≈ædƒó Society (star) which organized Lithuanian schools and libraries (it was chaired by writer Pranas Ma≈°iotas and it maintained five schools near Riga with about 500 students in 1914). In 1908, he moved to ≈†iauliai where he established his law practice and lived until his death. He practiced civil law. A large part of his practice was arbitration of large commercial cases, particularly those involving Jewish or foreign businesses. In 1911, he was first elected to the ≈†iauliai City Duma. He was disciplined, but spoke and wrote little. He did not leave an archive or an autobiography. He did contribute a few short informational announcements about various cultural activities and events to Vilniaus ≈æinios, Lietuvos ≈´kininkas, Lietuvos ≈æinios. In September 1908, Veclauskis became the first chairman of cultural organization Varpas (bell) which organized concerts, lectures, amateur theater performances. His wife, together with Gabrielius Landsbergis-≈Ωemkalnis, directed several plays. Venclauskis co-directed a play in 1911. His activities attracted the attention of the Tsarist police. His home was searched and he was briefly arrested in September 1912. The arrest spoiled his plans for running in the elections to the Russian State Duma. During World War I, he organized aid to war refugees. When fighting reached ≈†iauliai, he retreated to Minsk. He worked as a jurist of the All-Russian Zemstvo Union dealing with the 10th Army. After the February Revolution, he became a justice of the peace in Minsk. He returned to Lithuania in summer 1917 or in June 1918. Venclauskis, together with and , managed to get a permission from the Ober Ost officials to reopen the ≈†iauliai Gymnasium. They organized Jƒóga Society (power, strength), chaired by Venclauskis, to support the school which opened in April 1918 with 200 students. =In independent Lithuania= Politics Members of the ≈†iauliai City Council in 1925‚Äì1927 (Venclauskis center, second row from top) On 26 November 1918, Venclauskis was elected the first burgermeister of ≈†iauliai. He served until 17 April 1919 during the chaotic post-war period when the city changed hands during the Lithuanian‚ÄìSoviet War. When the city was captured by the Bolsheviks in January 1919, Venclauskis agreed to work in the finance department of the communist city soviet. He worked on establishing local self-government and drafted a statute that was adopted by local councils in ≈†iauliai, Roki≈°kis, Utena. He was elected chairman of the ≈†iauliai district council and served until his election to the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania. After serving in the national parliament, Venclauskis returned to the ≈†iauliai City Council as chairman in 1925‚Äì1931 ( was burgermeister at that time) and as member in 1935‚Äì1939. Venclauskis, as a member of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania (LSDP), was elected to the Constituent Assembly in May 1920 and reelected to the First Seimas in October 1922. His party was in opposition to the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party (LKDP) which gained majority of seats. At the Constituent Assembly, he was a member of various parliamentary commissions, including those on economy and draft constitution. Due to the emergency caused by the ≈ªeligowski's Mutiny in October 1920, the assembly established the seven-member Small Seimas to continue legislative function and temporarily adjourned. Venclauskis was elected as a member of the Small Seimas, but was soon replaced by Steponas Kairys. When drafting the new constitution, Venclauskis as other social democrats opposed creating the position of the President of Lithuania. He supported the rights of ethnic minorities in Lithuania and urged not to single out any particular minority for special treatment. Together with other members of his party, he submitted numerous interpellations. During discussions of one of these interpellations (in which LSDP asked why the police was not allowing or disrupting the celebrations of the International Workers' Day in Lithuania), Venclauskis engaged in a heated argument with LKDP leader Mykolas Krupaviƒçius and was removed from the meeting. Venclauskis urged the government to adopt the law on amnesty and lift martial law which prevented the establishment of true democracy in Lithuania. Since LKDP ignored most of the proposals put forth by LSDP, Venclauskis and other members of his party protested by not voting for some of the major laws passed by Constituent Assembly, including the constitution and the land reform. He was reelected to the First Seimas, but it was deadlocked and functioned for only five months. When the Seimas was dissolved in March 1923, Vencklauskis returned to his private law practice and the ≈†iauliai City Council. Law and business Venclauskis house in ≈†iauliai, now a museum In 1919‚Äì1920, Venclauskis briefly taught law at the ≈†iauliai Gymnasium. He was later offered a teaching position at the University of Lithuania, but refused. In 1920‚Äì1925, Venclauskis was elected as a member of the Lithuanian Bar Association. He was also long-term elder (starosta) of attorneys in ≈†iauliai. As such, he assigned criminal cases to practicing attorneys. Venclauskis was mainly a commercial attorney, representing Swedish and Swiss firms (including defense contractor Oerlikon Contraves). He worked on some high-profile cases, including a murder of a child in ≈Ωagarƒó, trials of several participants in the Tauragƒó Revolt, and corruption of diplomat Vaclovas Sidzikauskas. He took some pro bono cases related to child support or socialist-leaning activists. He opposed the death penalty. Venclauskis represented French graf Choiseul-Gouffier in a dispute with the Lithuanian government over large forest properties near Plateliai that the government wanted to nationalize according to the land reform of 1922. The case earned him enough fees to finance the construction of a palatial house by architect in 1925‚Äì1927. It had his home and offices on the first floor, with two upper floors rented out. A fine example of modern interwar architecture, the house now hosts a section of the and is listed on the Lithuanian Real Heritage Register. In August 1919, Venclauskis co-founded and became board member of the ≈†iauliai Union of Consumer Cooperatives. The union had about 100 cooperative members, but was absorbed by the state-sponsored Liet≈´kis cooperative in 1928. Together with , Venclauskis founded construction corporation Pastogƒó (shelter). It had plans of building a large culture center and a hotel, but managed to finish just a movie theater before the outbreak of World War II. Since 1941, the premises are used by the . Venclauskis supported various other business enterprises, often loaning money to various factories. Culture and philanthropy Bust of Venclauskis in ≈†iauliai In addition to raising his two daughters, Venclauskis and his wife sheltered and raised a number of orphans and foundlings. The exact number is not known, but is rumored to be around two hundred. The ≈†iauliai Gymnasium was built on land of his father-in-law Jonas Jak≈°eviƒçius. As a compensation, the Tsarist government granted a privilege that three future generations of Jak≈°eviƒçius could attend the school for free. This motivated Venclauskis to adopt and foster many students who could then study for free. He built a villa in Palanga which was mainly occupied by the foster children. In his home in ≈†iauliai, on average, there were about 20 people. Reportedly, Venclauskis requested that there would be no more than 30 people sheltered in his home, but this quota was often exceeded. Venclauskis did not spend much time with the children and was distant with rare exceptions on vacations at the seaside or holidays, but gladly provided financial support. Venclauskis was one of the key donors of societies organized to support students at the ≈†iauliai Gymnasium (established in 1891) and social-democratic youth (established in 1925). In November 1920, Venclauskis was one of the co-founders of the Kult≈´ra Society and became its chairman in 1925. The society focused on publishing Lithuanian books, primarily various textbooks. In 1921‚Äì1927, the society published 140 different books as well as a monthly magazine Kult≈´ra (Culture). It also organized numerous local chapters (membership peaked at 250 chapters with 3,000 members) that used the slogan (learn and teach!) to organize various cultural and educational activities. The local chapters were abolished by the authoritarian regime of president Antanas Smetona in 1927. Textbooks published by Kult≈´ra were forbidden to be used in schools. The society could not sell its books and repay loans it took out to cover publishing costs. Venclauskis, as a debt guarantor, had to pay 10,000 litas as a result. It was officially dissolved in July 1929. Venclauskis worked to establish a professional theater in ≈†iauliai. In 1925, Kult≈´ra Society took over the only theater and cinema hall which after the liquidation of the society became property of Venclauskis and several other men. They finally managed to get the ≈†iauliai Theater established in 1930. Venclauskis was activve in various other cultural and charitable societies; he was a member of the Masonic lodge Lietuva, established in July 1920, and became a member of the newly established Rotary Club in ≈†iauliai in June 1938. Venclauskis became ill in 1939. He sought treatment in a sanatorium in Riga and had an operation, but died in February 1940.

They released one EP, Trident nor Fire (2007), and two full-length albums: Weight of Light (2008) and Raised by Wolves (2011). History =Formation and Trident nor Fire EP (2006-2007)= Serpentcult formed in 2006 shortly after the dissolution of Thee Plague of Gentlemen. That band split up in July of that year due to the lead vocalist being arrested for, and confessing to, child rape and similar sex crimes, having especially targeted girls who were Muslim and/or of eastern European descent. (Dutch) Thee Plague of Gentlemen's frontman was condemned and disowned by his band members, the Belgian media, and I Hate Records, who subsequently removed the band's debut album from their catalog. The remaining three members of the previous band decided to move forward as Serpentcult as a trio, but afterward hired Michelle Nocon as lead vocalist. Their name is referential to what would have been Thee Plague of Gentlemen's second album. Serpentcult's inaugural release was an EP titled Trident nor Fire, released on April 23, 2007, also through I Hate Records. The EP features three original tracks, followed by a cover of \\"Rainbow Demon\\" from Uriah Heep's album Demons and Wizards. In April 2007, Serpentcult performed at the Doom Shall Rise festival in G√∂ppingen, Germany. =Weight of Light (2008-2009)= On April 17, 2008, Serpentcult appeared on the first day of Roadburn Festival in Tilburg, Netherlands. They released their debut full-length album, Weight of Light, in May 2008, via Rise Above Records. Guitarist Fr√©d√©ric Caure described the title as referencing \\"some kind of society thing. It‚Äôs about going away from the normal society and going your own way in the world without having all this materialistic stuff all around you... and having your inner enlightenment. This road to inner enlightenment is very individual and very much your own thing.\\" Among the album's eight tracks are \\"Screams from the Deep\\" and \\"Red Dawn\\", which are re-recordings of songs that originally appeared on Trident nor Fire. The album was produced at Prior Studios by Greg Chandler of Esoteric and mixed by Billy Anderson. Following the album's release, Serpentcult performed May 2008 dates in Germany and the Netherlands alongside UK doom metal band Warning. The band then held a CD release party on May 10 in Kuurne, Belgium. On December 13, 2008, Serpentcult played as part of the Rise Above Records' 20th Anniversary Show in London. Serpentcult subsequently toured the United States with Zoroaster and The Gates of Slumber between August 1 and 14, 2009. The tour started in Chicago, went through eastern Canada and eastern/mid-western United States, and concluded in Indianapolis. =Departure of Michelle Nocon and Raised by Wolves (2010-2011)= In February 2010, Nocon and Serpentcult parted, upon which the remaining members decided not to replace her. Shortly after the announcement, they also decided to cancel their appearance at Tom G. Warrior's \\"Only Death is Real\\" concert event at Roadburn 2010, being replaced by Altar of Plagues. The last concert tour Serpentcult engaged in as a quartet went through Europe, alongside Dark Fortress, Farsot, and Sardonis. In a 2017 interview with nocleansinging.com, Nocon stated about her departure from Serpentcult, \\"I felt I had told my story. We somehow grew apart, musically and as individuals as well, and... it was only the right thing to leave.\\" Shortly after Nocon announced Serpentcult's first album as a trio, and second overall, was Raised by Wolves, which was released in 2011 via Listenable Records. This album features longer songs on average than their previous full-length, and subdued yet existent vocals. In a non-rated positive review of the record, Natalie Zina Walschots of Exclaim! suggested, \\"Raised by Wolves is subtler than their previous work ‚Äì still heavy, but now more meditative.\\" =Aftermath (2012-present)= While Serpentcult has never been formally announced as disbanded, they have been dormant since 2011.

Wennemers (born 24 June 1969 in Offenbach am Main) is a German organic chemist. She is a professor of organic chemistry at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich).  Education  Helma Wennemers studied chemistry at the Goethe University Frankfurt, completing her diploma thesis with in 1993. She earned her Ph.D at Columbia University, New York in 1996, under the supervision of W. Clark Still, with a thesis ‚ÄúEncoded combinatorial chemistry: a tool for the study of selective intermolecular interactions.‚Äù Between 1996 and 1998, she was a postdoctoral fellow at Nagoya University with Hisashi Yamamoto, before being appointed Bachem Assistant Professor at the University of Basel in 1999. She held this post until 2003, where she was promoted to associate professor. In 2011, she moved to ETH Zurich as a professor of organic chemistry.  Research  Wennemers' research focuses on proline-rich peptides. *Asymmetric Catalysis: Tripeptidic catalyst of the H-Pro-Pro-Xaa type Wennemers led the development of tripeptides containing H-Pro-Pro-Xaa type sequences (Pro: proline, Xaa: any amine) as organocatalysts for C‚ÄìC bond formations based on an enamine mechanism. H. Wennemers, Chem. Commun. 2011, 47, 12036‚Äì12041. High reactivity, stereo- and chemoselectivity for aldol P. Krattiger, R. Kovasy, J. D. Revell, S. Ivan, H. Wennemers, Org.

J. 2009, 15, 10103‚Äì10109. can be achieved by varying the absolute configuration of the single amino acids as well as the functional group of the Xaa residue. The modularity of the peptides enabled creation of catalysts capable of catalyzing the conjugate addition reactions of aldehydes to nitroolefins with as little as 0.05 mol% of tripeptidic catalyst. T. Schnitzer, H. Wennemers, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2017, 139, 15356‚Äì15362. She also worked on other organocatalyzed transformations. Inspired by natural polyketide synthases‚Äîwhich use malonic acid half thioesters (MAHTs) as thioester enolate equivalents ‚Äî she developed organocatalytic methods for stereoselective addition reactions of MAHTs (and protected variants monothiomalonates, MTMs) to electrophiles using cinchona alkaloid derived catalysts. The introduction of fluorinated MAHTs and MTMs allowed for the stereoselective introduction of fluorine substituents in fluoroacetate aldol reactions J. Saadi, H. Wennemers, Nature Chem., 2016, 8, 276‚Äì280. as well as further addition reactions to imines E. Cosimi, O. D. Engl, J. Saadi, M.-O. Ebert, H. Wennemers, Angew. Chem. Int.

Lett. 2016, 18, 6014‚Äì6017. *Chemical Biology: In chemical biology, Wennemers uses larger proline-rich peptides, such as collagen model peptides or oligoprolines, for applications such as tumor targeting, C. Kroll, R. Mansi, F. Braun, S. Dobitz, H. Maecke, H. Wennemers, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013, 135, 16793‚Äì16796. cell penetration Y. A. Nagel, P. S. Raschle, H. Wennemers, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2017, 56, 122‚Äì126. or drug delivery. She utilized CŒ≥- functionalized proline derivatives for the functionalization and stabilization of short-chained collagen triple helices. Further, she introduced aminoproline C. Siebler, R. S. Erdmann, H. Wennemers, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 10340 ‚Äì 10344. and Œ≥-azaproline M. R. Aronoff, J. Egli, M. Menichelli, H. Wennemers, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2019, 58, 3143‚Äì3146. as pH-sensitive probes to tune the conformational stability of the collagen triple helix by pH change. In the field of cell penetrating peptides (CPPs), Wennemers showed that preorganization of cationic charges along an oligoproline backbone enhanced the cellular uptake of CPPs compared to more flexible oligoarginines with undefined charge display. Moreover, the oligoproline-based CPPs demonstrated a defined nuclear localization and high proteolytic stability as well as low cytotoxicity. *Synthetic Materials: Wennemers utilizes peptides to control the morphology of nanostructured materials for generation of ordered mesoscopic materials. She developed tripeptides for the size-controlled generation of mono-disperse, water-soluble silver-, palladium-, platinum-, and gold nanoparticles. S. Corra, M. S. Shoshan, H. Wennemers, Curr. Opin., Chem. Biol., 2017, 40, 138‚Äì144. Recently, she reported peptide‚Äêstabilized platinum nanoparticles that have greater toxicity against hepatic cancer cells (HepG2) than against other cancer cells and non‚Äêcancerous liver cells. M. S. Shoshan, T. Vonderach, B. Hattendorf, H. Wennemers, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2019, 58, 4901‚Äì4905. Wennemers also explored conjugates of oligoprolines and œÄ-conjugated systems that form hierarchical self-assemblies with diverse morphologies (e.g. nanofibers, nanorods, nanosheets). She used such a conjugate to prepare the first example of an extended triaxial supramolecular weave held together through the interplay of weak non-covalent interactions. U. Lewandowska, W.

She has received media coverage concerning controversy about her membership in the MEK. According to her father, Mostafa Mohammedi, a former MEK member, Somayeh is being held hostage by MEK, but she publicly denies these claims and has filed a lawsuit against him. Somayeh claims that her father is an undercover agent of Iran. According to Somayeh, she joined the MEK voluntarily in 1998 \\"seeking freedom and democracy for Iran.\\" Somayeh lives in MEK headquarters , previously in Iraq and now in Albania. She emigrated from Iran to Canada with her family in 1994. Since 1997, her parents claim to have been attempting to bring her home. Somayeh had gone to Iraq to visit Camp Ashraf in 1997, never returning to Canada. According to her father, the MEK kidnapped his daughter from Canada when she was a teenager, when they convinced him to allow his daughter for a two-week training camp in Iraq, but she and her brother never returned. According to The Guardian, \\"the MEK insists Somayeh does not wish to leave the camp, and released her letter accusing her father of working for Iranian intelligence.\\" According to Somayeh Mohammadi's lawyer, the Albanian prosecution rejected to take the case because Somayeh said she was not being kept in the MEK against her will. The lawyer also said that she and her family had been threatened by unknown people online for representing Somayeh Mohammadi. Membership in MEK Somayeh Mohammadi left Canada with her parents when she was 15 years old to Iraq to Camp Ashraf, Iraq in 1997. Mostafa Mohammadi, Somayeh's father, said a woman from the organization offered his daughter a two-week training camp at Camp Ashraf. Mostafa was an MEK member at the time, as was usually collecting donations for the MEK. He believed Somayeh lives under poor conditions and that the MEK tortured her. A letter wrote on her behalf to the Albanian Interior Minister asked to forbid her father to stay in Albania. She said his presence is a \\"security problem\\" for other members of the MEK. In one video, Somayeh appeared in an interview by two Albanian journalist who were one of the only people granted access to see her. Somayeh is only allowed to speak to others while indoor and under MEK supervision. She conducted the interview wearing an MEK militant uniform. She accused her father of being an Iranian intelligence agent. In the interview, she claimed that she can go everywhere she wants but just chooses not to. The MEK have stated that Somayeh does not like to leave Camp Ashraf, but Somayeh's parents have asked to visit their daughter outside the camp and without her MEK supervisors. Mohamadi's family state that Somayeh is never allowed to leave the camp and is imprisoned, forced to make videotaped announcements through threats of torture. Somayeh's mother said: \\"Somayeh is a shy girl. I knew that she wants to leave but she is under pressure because the MEK member and officer have threatened her.\\" On 17 October 2013, a letter was sent by Somayeh to Canadian authorities while in was asking them to return her to Canada again, as soon as possible, but she didn't have a Canadian passport anymore and it was impossible to help her. Her father said, \\"Who knows what the MEK member did to her\\". After some time, a PDF book named \\"The End Of A Conspiracy\\" was released in her name. She changed her mind according the book and announced that wishes to remain with the MEK. She is one of about 2000-3000 members of the Mujahedin-e Khalq who are living inside the groups' camp, named Ashraf 3, in outside the city of Durr√´s. Background Mostafa Mohamadi, Somayeh's father moved to Canada in 1994 to seek political asylum. Mostafa and Robabe Mohammadi claim they have trying to get their daughter back from the MEK since 1997. According to Somayeh's parents, they traveled from their home in Canada to Paris, Jordan, Iraq and now Albania for visiting their daughter and get her back from the MEK. During their trip to Albania, they claim they were followed by two Albanian intelligence agents. Mostafa stated, \\"We are not working against any group or country. We are only trying to visit our daughter outside the MEK camp. She can choose freely to stay in camp or come back to her home in Canada with us.\\" He added, the MEK group ‚Äòkidnapped‚Äô his daughter and his son from Canada in 1997. She was only 17 and traveled to Iraq to visit Ashraf camp. But Somayeh said that she voluntarily left Canada in 1998 for joining the MEK like another Iranian. Somayeh published a letter which she accused her father of being an Iranian intelligence agent. Somayeh's mother believes her daughter is a shy girl, and the MEK member have threaten people like her. If she can choose freely, she will live the camp and MEK. Reaction The MEK has published a letter on Albanian media 2018, introducing Somayeh as its author. The letter introduces Somyaeh's father as an Iranian intelligence agent. Recently Somayeh announced in a video interview inside the MEK that she wants to be a member of the group. The Mohammadis have responded with open letters to their daughter and to Albanian politicians, asking for a meeting with their daughter. As Somayeh says, she has published her whole story in a book in Persian and English to describe her father's efforts to abuse her, as well as she accuses her father to play the role as an undercover Iranian agent in the Ashraf and Liberty camp killings in Iraq. Morteza Payeshenas has directed a documentary film called ‚ÄúAn Unfinished Film for My Daughter, Somayeh‚Äù (2014) about her story. It was aired by the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting.

The original homestead was also constructed in 1858 from Tumblagouda sandstone and mud bricks using convict labour. The shearing shed was built in 1860 also using local materials and convict labour. Von Bibra let the property to Charles Gill in 1869 then travelled to Tasmania. Andrew James Ogilvie acquired the property sometime prior to 1895 and it was put up for auction following his death in 1906. In 1907 the property occupied an area of and had a 14 room homestead, stables, staff quarters and storeroom when it was purchased by Thomas Amos Drage and his brother, William John Drage. The Drages paid ¬£18,250 for the station which included all of the stock, stores and household furniture. Western Australia's first civil aviation fatality occurred near the property in 1921 when two people died when a Bristol Tourer crashed. An inquest into the crash was held at the station. In 1934 the property was stocked with about 20,000 sheep and 150 horses. An Indian prince, Mukarram Jah, the 8th Nazim of Hydrabad, acquired the property in 1972. His possessions and properties in India were being plundered in his absence and the Murchison House was placed in liquidation in 1996 with Jah leaving the country and fleeing to Turkey shortly afterward. The shearing shed was refurbished in the 1990s after it had fallen into a state of disrepair. The shed is now used for tourist accommodation. The homestead was flooded in 2006 to a depth of over when the Murchison River flooded; volunteers sandbagged covered the outer walls with plastic to waterproof it. In 2017 the property was owned by Calum and Belinda Carruth, and a small cache of guns was found in a cave on the property. A group of school children playing on a rock formation came across a metal box containing a 100 year old Browning machine gun and a 30 year old Boito shotgun. The property was stocked with 200 shorthorn cross cattle and around 7,000 rangeland goats in 2018.

She worked extensively in Australian folk and jazz clubs during the 1960s and 1970s and appeared on television and a number of Australian folk music recordings, though recorded only one album under her own name. Life and career Henderson was born Marian Grossman in Melbourne, Australia, to an air force family which moved frequently with her father's job, resulting in her attending 13 schools. Her first musical instrument was piano, which she played by ear in her early teens. From age 18 she commenced singing jazz (frequently with rock-and-roll bands) and then gravitated towards folk music, learning the guitar with which to accompany her own singing in the style of other popular performers of the early 1960s. For several years she had been dating ex-schoolmate and fellow musician/songwriter Don Henderson, with whom she formed a rock and roll band, the Thunderbirds, before she lost interest and turned to jazz singing. The couple married in 1958. Don encouraged her career and wrote songs for her to sing but the marriage lasted only until 1962. Marian, however, kept the surname Henderson as a performing name for the remainder of her career. From 1961 to 1962, Henderson joined with the Australian folk singer Alex Hood and international jazz guitarist/ commercial artist Chris Daw, recently arrived in Sydney, in the trio \\"Daw, Hood And Henderson\\" which released an EP of \\"workers' songs\\", Oh Pay Me, in 1962.National Library of Australia: Chris Daw interviewed by Alex and Annette Hood in the Alex Hood folklore collection [sound recording].Gregory, Mark, c. 2007. \\"Sixty Years of Australian Union Songs: The Australian Folk Revival and The Australian Labour Movement Since The Second World War.\\" Presented for the degree of Master of Arts by Research, Division of Humanities, Dept of Contemporary Music Studies, Macquarie University, Sydney. From 1963 onwards she was featured as a solo performer at popular Sydney folk music club \\"the Troubadour\\" three or four nights a week, performing a mix of British, American and Australian traditional material, and in 1964 was recruited by Pix magazine to record a series of EPs of folk songs for its readers.Warren Fahey's Australian Folklore Unit: EARLY SYDNEY PART3 She performed on ABC Television show including \\"Jazz Meets Folk\\" from 1964 onwardsThe Age - 8 Oct 1964 - TV Radio Guide, p. 6 alongside jazz musician Don Burrows and others, whose backing also featured on her Pix recordings, plus an episode of the folk music show Dave's Place in 1965.REFLECTIONS FROM \\"DAVE'S PLACE\\" Her own album, Cameo, was released on MCA in 1970; in addition to touring in Australia, she also performed overseas including in New Guinea, Fiji and Ireland. In 1971 she took the female lead on two tracks on fellow Australian singer Harry Robertson's seminal album of whaling songs, Whale Chasing Men, singing lead on \\"Norfolk Whalers\\" and \\"Whaling Wife\\". Henderson was also the host and featured singer in a new contemporary music show on Australian television, Sit Yourself Down, Take A Look Round, that premiered in 1974.Musgrove, Nan, 1974. \\"ABC presents a with-it program for all ages\\". Australian Women's Weekly, 28 August 1974; digitised version accessible at https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/44801825 Henderson was an attraction in the Australian folk and contemporary/more popular music scene up till the late 1970s, when she effectively retired from music to bring up her son, first in Lismore then in the small village of Nimbin, New South Wales. In 1978 she participated in a one-off progressive jazz rock recording by a group entitled First Light for the independent Music Farm Studios, a small label operating out of the Byron Bay hinterland. She made her final recorded appearance (a duet with fellow singer Margret RoadKnight) at a live concert by the latter recorded in Nimbin in 1988. In her later years Henderson lived quietly in an artistic environment, enjoying camping, the beach, and creating a beautiful garden. She died in 2015 aged 78, after suffering from cancer from several years; her ashes were scattered at the small New South Wales coastal town of Brunswick Heads. She married twice, first to Don Henderson and then to Tom Baker with whom she had a son. Baker died in 1970. On her death, the Australian folk music promoter and commentator Warren Fahey noted: An extended reissue of Henderson's 1970 album Cameo was released in 2016 on the Stoned Circle label, incorporating all known additional tracks from her hard-to-find earlier EPs plus other material.Liner notes to Cameo 2-CD reissue, Stoned Circle STC2CD3014, 2016 Discography and filmography * Daw, Hood And Henderson: Oh Pay Me (6 track EP, Blue and White Collar Records BW 1, 1962) (with Chris Daw and Alex Hood) * Various artists: Old Botany Bay (Music for Pleasure 1964).

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades and Cascade Range. The mountain is situated on the east side of the Cascade crest, in the Pasayten Wilderness, on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. The sprawling Amphitheater Mountain has several sub- peaks including the South Peak (8269 ft/2520 m), West Peak (8252 ft/2515 m), and North Peak (8200 ft/2499 m). The nearest higher peak is Cathedral Peak, to the north. The Pacific Northwest Trail traverses below the north slope of Amphitheater Mountain as it crosses Cathedral Pass. Precipitation runoff from Amphitheater Mountain drains west into Cathedral Fork, or east into Cathedral Creek. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences higher precipitation than the east side, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Amphitheater Mountain from Cathedral Pass The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Premise The player is the administrator of an underground power company that harvests energy from strange beings known as \\"abnormalities\\", and is tasked with overseeing this process. The player must command their employees to \\"work\\" on these abnormalities in order to fill the daily \\"quota\\" of energy, but must also return them to their containment if they happen to escape.  Gameplay The meta of the game is divided between two different phases: preparation and management (the latter of which is the \\"meat\\" of the game). The preparation determines the management phase: in it the player can hire new employees, boost existing employees' stats, assign them to different departments, and equip them with weapons and armor. The management phase consists of sending these employees to extract energy from abnormalities. The success of this process can vary wildly depending on the circumstances of the work, as each abnormality has its unique set of traits that determine how it will behave and what dangers it poses. What makes things challenging is that information about these traits isn't available from the get-go, and the player must discover them through trial and error by earning information points, which are gained through the aforementioned work process, and can be used to learn specific traits of the abnormality, such as work preferences, breach behavior and (only if the player has collected enough information) weapons and armor. Once enough energy is collected, the player can end the day and have their performance rated from A (the best) to F (the worst). This rating is influenced by how many employees survived the day, and is directly proportional to the reward the player will receive, which are \\"LOB\\" points, which the player can use to promote existing employees or hire new ones. A penalty is applied to the amount of \\"LOB\\" points received at the end of the day based on the danger levels of the abnormalities that escape during the day. Should the player decide to continue, they will (usually) be forced to choose one new abnormality out of a selection of three. The only information given about the selectable abnormalities is their classification numbers and a small text meant to describe them in an intriguing yet mystifying way. Once an abnormality is chosen, it is added with the rest and the preparation phase begins again. Characters The player of the game is first guided through the game by their assistant, Angela, who is an advanced AI. The player is eventually also guided by characters called , who lead various departments of the facility. The facility is based on an upside-down Kabbalah, with Sephirahs' names corresponding to where their department is located. There are several different abnormalities ranging in danger levels. The danger levels are based on letters of the Hebrew alphabet. * Zayin: The least dangerous abnormalities are categorized here. These abnormalities can produce positive effects for the player. * Teth: The second least dangerous abnormalities, and the first danger level that can breach containment. These are usually not dangerous but may catch players off-guard. * He: Here, abnormalities may become difficult for players to overcome if unprepared. They are of average danger. * Waw: At this level, abnormalities are more gimmick-based, which must be followed to keep them contained. These are capable of wiping out employees fairly easily. * Aleph: The highest danger level, but also the most rewarding to work on. Abnormalities featured here in this category are capable of single-handedly destroying facilities. The player will always start out with a Zayin-class abnormality named One Sin and Hundreds of Good Deeds, who is based on both Jesus Christ and Judas Iscariot. His name refers to Judas' \\"one sin\\" of betraying Jesus, and his \\"hundreds of good deeds\\" he must do as payment for committing the sin. One Sin appears as a skull embedded in an iron cross, wearing a crown of thorns. After this, the abnormalities a player gets will be random.

History  From 1853 Hopuhopu was the site of a boys' mission school, which lost most of its pupils in 1862 and, by 1863, was reported as in disrepair, with the mission house burnt down in 1886. With he construction of the Auckland to Te Awamutu leg of the North Island Main trunk Line in the 1870s, the land that Hopuhopu occupied was passed into the possession of the New Zealand Railway Department. Acquired by the Defence Department in 1920 in exchange for defence land at Frankton Junction. Hopuhopu was to become the site of the Northern Command Mobilisation Depot. Hopuhopu was used as a tented camp for Territorial army training throughout the 1920s whilst construction of the permanent infrastructure was undertaken with the first buildings handed over and taken into use during 1927, with final construction completed in August 1929 at a cost of ¬£130,000 (2019 NZD$12,845,552.24). At the time, the camp was the most modern Military camp in New Zealand. Hopuhopu served in its intended role as a mobilisation camp in 1939/40, as elements of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force Mobilised at Hopuhopu for overseas service. Hopuhopu remained as an active military camp until 1989, where as part of number of base closures across the New Zealand Defence Force, Hopuhopu ceased to be an active military camp. In 1993 the camp was returned to Waikato-Tainui, who converted it to their headquarters and Waikato-Tainui College for Research and Development.  Alternative Names  Hopuhopu was the accepted name in general usage for the camp, but up to the 1940s the name Wakato Camp was also in common usage. Due to Hopuhopu's proximity to NgƒÅruawƒÅhia it was also often referred to as 'Ngaruawahia Camp'.

Gabriel, along with the rest of the Bagradian family, is a wholly fictional character; no piece of historical evidence ever proved their existence. Oliver Kohns, author of \\"The Aesthetics of Human Rights in Franz Werfel's The Forty Days of Musa Dagh,\\" stated that therefore the Bagradians were \\"The most significant deviation from the historical record\\" in the work.Kohns, Oliver. \\"The Aesthetics of Human Rights in Franz Werfel's The Forty Days of Musa Dagh.\\" In: Kaul, Susanne and David Kim (editors). Imagining Human Rights. Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 25 September 2015. , 9783110387292. CITED: Google Books PT176. Fictional biography Gabriel is an ethnic Armenian and veteran of the Balkan Wars who lived in France for many years, married a French woman, and had a son with her. The events of the novel occur during a visit to his hometown in Turkey, then in the Ottoman Empire. Initially he feels a lack of connection to his hometown, but he takes a leadership role and helps the village find safety on Musa Dagh and then escape on a French warship from the Armenian Genocide. Lionel Steiman, author of Franz Werfel: The Faith of an Exile: From Prague to Beverly Hills, states \\"It does not take much to turn Gabriel Bagradian from a detached, unconcerned European into a committed Armenian activist.\\"Steiman, Lionel. Franz Werfel: The Faith of an Exile: From Prague to Beverly Hills. Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 30 October 2010. , 9781554587964. Google Books PT112. Gabriel remains on the mountain after ensuring the safety of the others, including his wife, and is killed by Ottoman soldiers. Analysis Ritchie Robinson stated that Gabriel was meant to make Western European audiences sympathetic for the Armenians as Gabriel was raised in French culture, and therefore readers could identify with him. Steiman wrote that Gabriel's \\"spiritual odyssey\\" was the \\"primary focus\\" of the work even though Werfel had extensively researched the Musa Dagh rescue; Steiman stated that as Gabriel's death and the rescue are both due to fate, despite Gabriel being credited skill-wise for it, the scenario reflects \\"Werfel's failure to integrate the two\\" aspects.Steiman, Lionel. Franz Werfel: The Faith of an Exile: From Prague to Beverly Hills. Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 30 October 2010. , 9781554587964. Google Books PT158. Kohns also stated that Gabriel was the \\"main focus\\" of the work and that there were comparisons to Moses. Kohns stated that the author may have implied that the Armenians could have only survived the Musa Dagh incident because they had \\"a \\"Westernized\\" leader\\" which would \\"not do justice\\" to the real life events, although he also noted how Gabriel becomes increasingly in touch with his heritage and experiences \\"his increasing \\"re-nationalization\\"\\" into being an Armenian. Neal Ascherson of the London Review of Books stated \\"although it‚Äôs wrong to say that\\" Werfel and his wife Alma were the same people as the fictional Bagdradians, \\"the travails of an assimilated intellectual torn between his loyalty to an ancestral people threatened with destruction and his bond to a wife from a quite different culture are unmistakeably Werfel interrogating himself.\\" Donna H.

Some proponents of remigration suggest leaving some residents with non-European background aside from the forced return, based on a vaguely defined degree of assimilation or integration into European culture. Advocates of remigration promote the concept in pursuit of ethno-cultural homogeneity. According to Deutsche Welle, ethnopluralism, the Nouvelle Droite concept that different ethnicities require their own segregated living spaces, creates a manufactured need for remigration of people with \\"foreign roots\\". Presented by far-right extremists as a remedy to mass immigration and so- called Islamisation, remigration is increasingly an integral policy position of the Identitarian movement. Research from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, conducted in April 2019, showed a distinct rise in conversations about remigration on Twitter between 2012 and 2019.  Usage  The term was first used in English in the writings of Andrew Willet, an early 17th century Church of England theologian. In social science, the term has been used to refer to the voluntary return of an immigrant of his place of origin. In German, the word involves the return of the individual to his ethnic community, without a necessary connection to a country of origin.  Origins and development  Early evocations of the modern concept of remigration can be found in French 1960s far-right movements such as Europe-Action, considered the \\"embryonic form\\" of Nouvelle Droite's ideas. Jean-Pierre Stirbois, then General Secretary of the National Front (FN), was the first to coin the expression \\"we will make them leave\\" ('on les renverra') in an interview. He was the architect of the first electoral breakthrough of the FN in 1983, earning nearly 17% of the votes in the city of Dreux with the promise of \\"inverting the migratory flows\\". The idea is also expressed in the German slogan \\"Deutschland den Deutschen, Ausl√§nder raus\\" ('Germany to Germans, foreigners out'),Aftenberger, I. (2017). Die ‚ÄòIdentit√§re‚Äô Beseitigung der andere. In J. Goetz, J. M. Sedlacek, & A. Winkler (Eds.), Untergangster des Abendlandes (pp. 203‚Äì227). Hamburg: Marta Press. and in the motto of L'≈íuvre Fran√ßaise \\"La France aux Fran√ßais\\" ('France to the French'). Since the 2010s, the Identitarian movement has engaged in forms of agitprop, or \\"cultural struggle\\" ('combat culturel'), in an attempt to push remigration towards the centre of the political debate. The term is closely related to the concept of the Great Replacement, which states that the white Christian European population is being progressively replaced with non-European populations, specifically from North Africa and the Middle East, through mass migration, demographic growth, and a European drop in the birth rate. Proponents of remigration often use the historical example of the expulsion of Pieds-Noirs from Algeria in 1962 as a successful past instance of organized forced remigration, even though the exodus is described by some historians as an ethnic cleansing stimulated by violence and threats from the National Liberation Front (FLN) and part of the native Muslim population, as evidenced by the slogan \\"the suitcase or the coffin\\" promoted by the FLN, the kidnappings of Pieds-Noirs, or the Oran massacre of 1962.  Modern use  Since the 2010s, the idea of remigration has been used by thinkers and political leaders of the Identitarian movement, such as Guillaume Faye, Renaud Camus, Henry de Lesquen, or Martin Sellner, as a euphemism for the mass deportation of non-European immigrants and native residents with a migrant background (the criteria of exclusion being a vaguely defined degree of assimilation to European culture), back to their country of origin. In August 2017, protestors flew banners throughout Quebec City, calling for the remigration of non-whites from the Quebec capital. That same month, it was reported how Identity Evropa, who later rebranded themselves as the American Identity Movement, supported the remigration of immigrants from the United States. In August 2018, Australian far-right extremist Blair Cottrell openly advocated for remigration, calling for the deportation of \\"enemies of my country\\" and the execution of immigrants who refused to leave. = Austria = In March 2019, just a week after the Christchurch mosque shootings and release of the shooter's manifesto (called The Great Replacement), Identit√§re Bewegung √ñsterreich, the Austria branch of Generation Identity (GI), held a rally in Vienna, protesting the supposed Great Replacement of Austrians and openly calling for remigration of non-whites from the country. By April 2019, a branch of the FP√ñ party, who at the time were in coalition government as a junior partner with the √ñVP, announced a \\"national call for remigration\\". = France = A banner advocating \\"remigration\\" during an anti-immigration protest in Calais, France, in 2015. In October 2017, Generation Identity announced policy plans to its members, for France to force former colonies to take back migrants by using its status as a nuclear power and making development subsidies and aid conditional on the repatriation of immigrants. In March 2018, an Al Jazeera investigative team released footage and audio revealing Marine Le Pen's close confidant and former accountant, Nicolas Crochet, saying that the National Rally party would introduce a remigration programme to force immigrants back to their country of origin, in the event that they came to power in France. In February 2019, speaking with L'Opinion, Debout la France candidate Emmanuelle Gave (daughter of French entrepreneur ), advocated for remigration as a policy for voters in the European Parliament elections in May. In what Lib√©ration described as a \\"dangerous penetration of the ideas of the ultra-radical extreme right in the French political space\\", Gave announced that she was in favor of the party putting remigration \\"on the table\\". = Germany = In March 2018, Identitarian protesters were arrested for trespassing on the roof of Frankfurt Central Station, and hanging a banner that reads \\"Endstation Multikulti. Notbremse ziehen. Remigration\\" (Terminal station Multikulti. Pull emergency brake. Remigration), while chanting phrases like \\"home, freedom, tradition\\" from a megaphone. In March 2019, the German Identitarian movement began a \\"remigration campaign\\" which included governmental petitions, a \\"flashmob\\" outside a mosque and a demonstration in front of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community in Berlin, where the protesters demanded the repatriation of Islamic refugees back to the Middle East. It was reported that the group were distributing posters aimed at Syrian refugees that read \\"The war is over. Syria needs you\\" and referenced a \\"remigration policy\\". In May 2019, , leader of AfD in Bavaria, indicated that the deportation of non-whites from Germany was a preferable policy to racial integration, after she called for \\"Remigration instead of integration\\" at a conference for the Southern wing of the party. Ahead of the 2019 European Parliament election, Germany's opposition party, the far-right Alternative for Germany, made remigration part of their policy platform, openly calling for \\"remigration, instead of mass immigration\\", and stating that \\"Germany and Europe must put in place remigration programs on the largest possible scale\\". AfD MP Markus Frohnmaier has repeatedly worn a slogan reading \\"Remigration Ministry\\" into the Bundestag. = United Kingdom = Generation Identity UK and Ireland activists have engaged in the promotion of remigration. In April 2018, Hope Not Hate detailed how, while the group was releveantely unknown by the mainstream media; its \\"core beliefs\\" of ethnopluralism, and remigration of non-whites from Europe, was more extreme than any policies of the English Defence League. In May 2018, The Times was reporting how the extremist organization was promoting the singling out of black British people for priority remigration from the UK.  Criticism  Michael Weiss and Julia Ebner, of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, have identified the \\"identitarian concept of 'remigration'\\" as having accelerated since 2014, and associated it with increasing calls from the far-right for mass deportation of non-white Europeans, in what they described as \\"ethnic cleansing\\". has described remigration as a form of demagoguery that would lead to ethnic cleansing. Arguing that France has had a mixed genetical heritage since Gallic times, he has questioned the practicality of expelling French people of immigrant origin and the number of generations that would require investigation in pursuit of \\"purity\\".

He became known through the creation of architectural models of historical and antique buildings. Ten of his models belong to the collection of the architectural icons of the architect Oswald Mathias Ungers.  Biography  Grimm was born in Ellwangen an der Jagst, Germany. He studied Industrial Design from 1983 to 1989 at the Hochschule f√ºr bildende K√ºnste Hamburg with Lambert Rosenbusch and graduated as a designer. During his studies he developed an interest in the field of architectural theory. Together with his fellow student Jan Christophe Kraege, he carried out scientific research on historical buildings such as the Temple of Clitumnus near Spoleto (1985) and produced a model of it. He also investigated the functionality of the proportional compass developed by Balthasar Neumann. During his studies, the German Archaeological Institute commissioned him to create a model of the Temple of Mars Ultor at the Forum of Augustus in Rome (1987). After completing his studies, Grimm worked from 1990 to 2007 as a free-lance designer in the architectural office of Oswald Mathias Ungers, where he was responsible for the creation of architectural models of historically significant buildings. The idea was to create a kind of \\"three- dimensional collection\\". Over the years, ten architectural icons of the Ungers Collection were created, which Grimm produced after intensive research from Alabaster gypsum. The model thus becomes a high-quality cultural item. Since 2007 Grimm is artistic director of Oswald Mathias Ungers Archive for Architectural Research. From 2012 to 2014 he was an academic staff member at the Atelier Gerhard Richter in Cologne. In 2015 he received a practical scholarship of the Villa Massimo in Rome.  Architectural models  Architectural models can perform various functions. The architect can use a sketch model to check the realisability of his ideas. Presentation models can be submitted to competitions, more extensive models can show how a planned building integrates into the existing environment. In the field of architectural theory, models are also used as teaching and learning models to illustrate the aesthetics and construction of historical buildings. Against this background, Grimm's works can be understood as models after built architectures or memory models. Every model building project by Grimm starts with scientific research; old sketches and measured drawings are consulted and literature on the respective buildings are analyzed. Usually this is followed by local investigations, e.g. Grimm spent several months in Rome for the model of the Temple of Mars Ultor and photographed and measured the temple. Only after this extensive preparatory work can he make decisions about how the respective model should be designed: \\"First of all, I'm developing a mindset. What are the basics? What best describes the core and essence of a building? Two things are always decisive: reduction and interpretation.\\" For the representation of the Tempietto del Bramante it had to be considered that originally a circular courtyard surrounded by columns was planned, whereas the courtyard today is square and without surrounding columns. Steps also originally led to the temple, so that the observer could see the building from below. Grimm designed the pedestal historically correct as a circular surface and made it so high that the underside of the building, mediated by the steps of the temple, became visible. In the reconstruction of ancient temples such as the Pantheon or Parthenon, fundamental decisions had to be made as to which phase of the respective building should be represented ‚Äì the ideal state or an image of what the temples look like today. Finally, a scale had to be chosen that illustrates the essential elements of the architecture without getting lost in details.

For recurring parts of buildings, such as columns, he creates silicone moulds. He also works with templates and develops his own tools if necessary. As plaster is heavy, the models have a wooden substructure. For the model of the Parthenon alone, Grimm needed 200 kilograms of gypsum. and over a year to complete the construction. While one always imagines something small with the word model, Grimm's works are by no means small: For example, the model of the Pantheon measures 74 √ó 170 √ó 97 cm and his other models also have similar dimensions. \\"After a long period of work, an architecture emerges as a sculpture that is as unique as ancient figures ‚Äì just like the techniques of working with plaster, which only a few have mastered and which require a great deal of experience.\\" The magazine Architectural Digest refers to Grimm as the Cologne Model‚ÄìMichelangelo in its theme book Best of Germany.  Bronze reliefs in public space  Since 2011 Grimm has been documenting the landscape and structural change in the Cologne district Vogelsang, Cologne from the rural area to the industrial park \\"Triotop\\". The contractor for this work was the businessman Anton Bausinger (construction company Friedrich Wassermann). The bronze reliefs are each 1 √ó 1 metre in size and are positioned at the Belvedere Bridge in Cologne. The spatial situations from the following years are depicted in detail: 1893, 1926, 1934, 1975, 2000, 2010 and 2025. So far (2019) six of the bronze sculptures have been realized and can be viewed on location.

It is a spiral staircase built in 1512 to connect the Pope's Palace with the city of Rome. It was built as a stepless ramp (Italian Rampa), therefore Grimm calls his research report Rampa del Bramante. The staircase is housed in a square tower and has 36 columns of different types. Grimm received permission from the Vatican to measure and photograph the stairs in detail. He subsequently drew up his report. Part of the investigation was the \\"decoding of the mathematical and geometrical basic structure\\" of the ramp. In addition, Grimm investigated the structural composition of the columns. In the Classical antiquity and since the Renaissance, so-called order of columns formed an important architectural system with a hierarchy of different types of columns. Grimm in his report revealed that Bramante did not strictly adhere to this system in the construction of his staircase. Thanks to a scholarship from the Rolf Linnenkamp-Stiftung he was able to produce a three-dimensional model of the staircase in stainless steel and birch multiplex in 1:20 scale. Bernd Grimm Konstruktionsprinzip der Treppe.jpgMathematical-geometric structural analysis of the Scala del Bramante, drawing and model in scale 1:20 Bernd Grimm Modell der Treppe f√ºr Ausstellung2016 Martin-Gropius-Bau.jpgPresentation on the occasion of the exhibition \\"10 Years Villa Massimo at Martin-Gropius-Bau\\", Berlin 2016 Bernd Grimm Detail des mathematisch-geometrischen Modells der Treppe.jpgDetail of the mathematical-geometric model of the staircase The construction and structure of the staircase were made evident by the fact that the columns were only reproduced as outlines in stainless steel. To illustrate the dimensions of the building, Bernd Grimm gave the measurements in centimetres as well as in piedi and digiti, Ancient Roman units of measurement which were also used in the Renaissance ‚Äì and came to the result: :\\"The Rampa (Scala) del Bramante is designed and built from a single point. Based on a simple geometric structure that always allows a reference to the center, a high precision in the positioning of the components is achieved. [...] The exceptional quality of the spiral ramp lies in its strong core design idea, namely to combine simple and ideal geometric shapes with column orders, as an important element of architectural design.\\" :(In German: \\"Die Rampa (Scala) del Bramante ist von einem einzigen Punkt aus konzipiert und verwirklicht. Auf der Grundlage einer einfachen geometrischen Struktur, die immer einen Bezug zum Zentrum erm√∂glicht, ist eine hohe Pr√§zision in der Positionierung der Bauelemente erreicht. [‚Ä¶] Die au√üergew√∂hnliche Qualit√§t der Wendelrampe liegt in ihrem starken entwurflichen Kerngedanken, n√§mlich einfache und ideale geometrische Formen mit den S√§ulenordnungen, als wichtiges Element bauk√ºnstlerischer Gestaltung, zu verbinden.\\") = Other building surveys and reconstructions by Grimm = * 1987: Palazzo Spada, Perspective Colonnade, Rome, Italy * 1987: L‚Äôedicola di Leone X., Castel Sant'Angelo, Rome, Italy * 1989: , Ellwangen (Jagst), Germany * 1989‚Äì1990: Temple of Mars Ultor, Measurement of the capital, Rome, Italy * 1995: , Cologne * 1997: St. Kolumba, Cologne, Enclosure walls * 2002: Putbus Palace, Putbus, reconstruction and model in alabaster gypsum, model in scale 1:50 * 2009: Santa Maria del Priorato Church, Rome, Italy, Architect Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Model in scale 1:50  Architectural icons of the Oswald Mathias Ungers Collection  * 1993: Parthenon, Athens, 447‚Äì438 BC, model in scale 1:50 * 1995: Pantheon Rom, 118‚Äì128 BC, model in scale 1:50 * 2000: Cheop's pyramid, Giza, Completion ca. 2580 BC, model in scale 1:250 * 2001: Castel del Monte by Friedrich II, Apulia, 1240‚Äì1250, model in scale 1:70 * 2001: Tiempietto del Bramante, Rome, 1502, Architect: Donato Bramante, model in scale 1:15 * 2002: Kenotaph for Isaac Newton, 1784, Architect: √âtienne-Louis Boull√©e, model in 1:400 scale * 2002: Casa del Fascio, Como, Architect: Giuseppe Terragni, model in scale 1:60 * 2003: Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, Bodrum, circa 370‚Äì350 BC, model in scale 1:66 * 2004: Mausoleum of Theoderic, Ravenna, circa 520 AD, model in scale 1:20 * 2005: Villa Capra \\"La Rotonda\\" (Villa Almerico Capra Valmarana), Vicenza, 1565‚Äì1569 AD, architect: Andrea Palladio, model in scale of 1:20  Lecturing experience  * 1993‚Äì2000: Fachhochschule K√∂ln, Department of Design * 2002‚Äì2004: Braunschweig University of Art, Department of Industrial Design * 2005: Leibniz University Hannover, Department Architectur * 2008: Technical University of Dortmund, Faculty of Construction Engineering * 2016: HafenCity University Hamburg, Summer Studio \\"The Rural in the City\\" * 2018: University of the Arts Bremen, Department of Industrial Design  Group exhibitions (selection)  * 1999: O.

After winning one minor race as a juvenile he won four consecutive races in the following year including the Glasgow Stakes and Geoffrey Freer Stakes. In 2018 he won the John Porter Stakes and Jockey Club Stakes but was gelded at the end of the year. As a five-year-old he recorded his first Group 1 victory when he took the Coronation Cup and followed up by winning the Hardwicke Stakes. He remained in training in 2020 but suffered a fatal injury in July of that year. Background Defoe is a grey horse bred in Ireland by Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. He entered the ownership of Mohammed Obaid Al Maktoum and was sent into training with Roger Varian at Newmarket, Suffolk. He has been ridden in most of his races by Andrea Atzeni. His sire Dalakhani (from whom he inherited his grey coat) was named Cartier Horse of the Year in 2003 after wins in the Prix Lupin, Prix du Jockey Club and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. As a breeding stallion his other offspring have included Conduit, Duncan, Integral and Reliable Man. Defoe's dam Dulkashe showed very modest racing ability, winning one minor handicap from seven starts. She was a female-line descendant of the British broodmare Radiopye (foaled 1954) whose other descendants have included Scottish Rifle and Winter. Racing career =2016: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut, Defoe started the 3/10 favourite for a four-runner maiden race over one mile on soft ground at Ffos Las Racecourse on 11 September and won by a head from the filly Bianca Minola. Two weeks later at Epsom Racecourse he finished second of the five runners in a minor race, beaten one and three quarter lengths by the Paul Cole-trained Medieval. On his final run of the year he was stepped up in class and distance for the Listed Zetland Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse but ran very poorly and came home eleventh of the twelve runners, more than twenty-six lengths behind the winner Coronet. =2017: three-year-old season= Defoe began his second season in the London Gold Cup, a handicap race over ten furlong at Newbury Racecourse on 20 May in which he was assigned a weight of 126 pounds. Starting at odds of 8/1 he took the lead inside the final furlong and won by a length and a quarter from the favourite Fearless Fire. On 1 July he started favourite for a similar event at York Racecourse and won from eleven opponents carrying 133 pounds. Less than three weeks later the colt was promoted in class for the Listed Glasgow Stakes over eleven furlongs at Hamilton Park Racecourse and started 5/4 favourite ahead of Call To Mind (March Stakes) and Frankuus (Prix de Cond√©). Ridden as on his previous start by Harry Bentley he tracked the leaders before taking the lead in the final furlong and winning by one and a half lengths from Frankuus. Defoe was then moved up in class and distance again and matched against older horses for the first time when he started 13/8 favourite for the Group 3 Geoffrey Freer Stakes over thirteen and a half furlongs at Newbury in August. With Atzeni in the saddle he went to the front approaching the final furlong and won a \\"shade cosily\\" by three quarters of a length from the four- year-old Wall of Fire. In the 241st running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 16 September Defoe started the 6/1 fourth choice in the betting but failed to reproduce his best form and finished eleventh in a race which saw Capri win from Crystal Ocean, Stradivarius and Rekindling. =2018: four-year-old season= On 21 April 2018 Defoe began his third campaign in the Group 3 John Porter Stakes and started the 5/4 favourite ahead of Call To Mind and four others. After being restrained by Atzeni towards the rear of the field in the early stages he took the lead a furlong out and drew away in the closing stages to win by two and a half lengths from the Cumberland Lodge Stakes winner Danehill Kodiac. Two weeks later the colt started 1/2 favourite for the Group 2 Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket and after tracking the leader Count Octave he went to the front inside the final furlong and won \\"comfortably\\" by three and a half lengths from Red Verdon. Atzeni commented \\"We don't know how good this fellow is, he keeps improving and could be anything\\". On 27 May he was sent to Ireland and started 5/4 favourite for the Tattersalls Gold Cup at the Curragh but never looked likely to win and came home third of the five runners behind Lancaster Bomber and Cliffs of Moher. After a three-month break Defoe returned in autumn and was campaigned in continental Europe. On 2 September in Germany he started favourite for the Grosser Preis von Baden in which he produced a strong late run but failed by a neck to overhaul the Godolphin contender Best Solution. He then contested the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Racecourse on 7 October in which he started a 40/1 outsider and finished fifteenth of the nineteen runners behind Enable. On his final run of the season he returned to Germany and ran second behind Iquitos in the Grosser Preis von Bayern on 1 November. Four weeks later Defoe was gelded. Varian commented \\"His owner decided to have him gelded and I am very much in agreement with his decision, as it should elongate his career and he is a fun horse to have around\\". =2019: five-year-old season= As in 2018, Defoe began his season in the John Porter Stakes but he failed to repeat his success of the previous year as he came home fourth of the eight finishers behind Marmelo. He continued to follow his path of the previous year when he contested the Jockey Club Stakes and finished second, beaten one and a quarter lengths by the four-year-old colt Communique. On 31 May Defoe started the 11/1 in a nine-runner field for the Group 1 Coronation Cup over one and half miles at Epsom Racecourse. The filly Lah Ti Dar started favourite while the other runners included Kew Gardens, Old Persian (Sheema Classic), Marmelo, Marando (Ormonde Stakes) and Communique. Defoe started slowly and raced towards the rear of the field before making progress on the inside in the straight. Kew Gardens hit the front approaching the final furlong, but Defoe made a strong late run to gain the advantage in the closing stages and won by half a length with a gap of five lengths back to Salouen in third. After the race Varian said \\"It's fully deserved for the horse‚Äîyou dream about results like that... He was slow away from the gates and didn't get the handy pitch we were looking for, but when the field fanned out on the straight, he found a gap... and he took it without flinching. Once he had a target, he always looked like he was going to get there\\". At Royal Ascot on 22 June Defoe started the 11/4 favourite for the Hardwicke Stakes against seven opponent including Masar, Salouen, Communique, Marando and Mirage Dancer (Glorious Stakes). After racing in mid-division he took the lead in the straight and despite hanging to the right in the closing stages he won by half a length from the Czech-trained outsider Nagano Gold with Mirage Dancer a length away in third place. Varian commented \\"He is just a lovely horse. He is very straightforward, tries and relaxes and is getting better with age. He is a joy to train. ... We are excited for the rest of the season\\".

The film has laughs aplenty, which almost made the first half feel like an extension of their hit TV show, Maja Talkies, but the second half makes up for that with romance, drama and action galore. Srujan Lokesh, Giri Shivanna and Hariprriya, along with the rest of the extended cast make this a worthwhile movie outing.\\" The New Indian Express paper gave 3/5 stating \\"A humorous tale peppered with action elements, and strong family bondings, Ellide Elli Tanaka reminds you of familiar stories we‚Äôve seen in the past. Thejasvi, in his first directorial, presents a mix of comedy, emotions, love, action and family sentiments - everything required for a commercial entertainer, and also tucks in a message .Hariprriya not only adds the glamour quotient, plays an integral part in the proceedings. A couple of good melodies composed by Arjun Janya, and a few picturesque locations captured by HC Venu, are the highlights of the film, which will surely satisfy the die-hard fans of Talking Star Srujan Lokesh.\\" The Deccan Chronicle paper gave 3/5 stating \\"An age-old saying that it is perfectly fine to lie a thousand times to get a marriage done is the key ingredient here, stirred well with entertaining lies. If Srujan shines with comedy, it is Hariprriya who steals the show with yet another impressive act. Her beautiful presence gives another good reason not to miss Ellidde Illi Tanaka. Overall, it's a feel-good movie worth watching it once for some light entertainment.\\"  References   External links  * Category:2010s Kannada-language films Category:2019 directorial debut films Category:2019 films Category:Films set in universities and colleges Category:Films shot in Mysore Category:Films shot in Bangalore Category:Films shot in Jammu and Kashmir Category:Masala films Category:Indian romantic action films Category:2010s romantic action films Category:2010s action drama films Category:Indian action drama films Category:2019 drama films ","title":"Ellidde Illi Tanaka"},{"id":"61104716","text":"The 2010 Budapest mayoral election was held on 3 October 2010 to elect the Mayor of Budapest (f≈ëpolg√°rmester).

The first hockey match on Latvian soil took place on February 15, 1909, with two teams facing Union and Strƒìlnieka DƒÅrzs. However, it took another 20 years to supplant the popular sport of Bandy. History In 1929, Rƒ´gas StrƒÅdnieku Sports un Sargs, a sports club of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party began playing the so-called \\"Canadian hockey\\" instead of Bandy. The first official game took place one year later, on February 15, 1930, between Riga center and a team from K√∂nigsberg. A crew member from Rƒ´ga was Bruno Kalni≈Ü≈°, who was sitting in Latvian Parliament at that time and later in political exile in Sweden. = The thirties and forties until the outbreak of World War II = The Latvian Winter Sports Association began supporting ice hockey in 1930, and as early as 1931 Latvia was admitted to the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG), the predecessor of the IIHF. With the international recognition of the association, various hockey clubs have emerged in the larger cities, including Universitas Sports, Wanderer, Union, Armijas Sporta Klubs (ASK) from Riga and Olimpiade from LiepƒÅja. The Social Democrats' Club continued to exist before being shut down by regime KƒÅrlis Ulmanis. The said clubs did not play in a closed league with a fixed schedule, but fought in smaller tournaments for titles. In the early years of the Latvian ice hockey ASK Riga dominated the games of the championship and became several Latvian champions.  The beginnings of the national team  The first official game of the Latvia men's national ice hockey team, which consisted of pure amateurs, took place on February 27, 1932. Lithuania were beaten 3: 0. Only two weeks later, the national team participated for the first time in the European Championship. The Latvian team won one (3: 0 against Romania) and three defeats (0: 7 against Czechoslovakia, 0: 1 against France and 2: 5 against Great Britain). In the overall standings, Latvia took eighth place out of nine participating countries. A year later, the national team debuted at the World Cup in Prague. At the World Championships in 1935, she first met Canada and lost the game with 0:14. In 1936, Latvia participated for the first time in Winter Olympics, but all three games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen were lost: 0:11 to Canada, 2: 9 to Poland and 1: 7 against Austria. The first international match against the USA dates back to 1938, when Latvia scored a respectable 0: 1. Other international matches were mostly held on the way to or from World Championships as part of friendly matches. In 1939, the Latvian Ice Hockey Federation contracted Canadian hockey player and sports teacher Larry Marsh to train the national team for a month. The Latvian hockey team had played a total of 26 games, including six wins, 16 defeats and four draws with a goal difference of 37:93, until 1940, the year of Soviet occupation and loss of independence.  The time of the occupation  The outbreak of World War II and occupation by Soviet Union did indeed change Latvian hockey, but did not end it: the Soviets dissolved the existing teams and created new ones, such as Dinamo Riga. Two years later, when the Germans were re- established, the old teams were re-established, and other teams with typical Latvian names such as \\"Ledus LƒÅƒçi, Daugavie≈°i, Skrejo≈°ais Holandietis\\" and \\"Ledus Simfonija\\" were created. From 1944 to 1945 no ice hockey was played. In 1946 Latvia was excluded from the LIHG because of its affiliation with the Soviet Union, and only resumed in 1992 after Latvia established the Latvian Ice Hockey Federation in 1991. = postwar = Before the Second World War in the Soviet Union not hockey, but Bandy was played. After the war, the sporting leadership decided instead of introducing Bandy ice hockey, since this was recognized as Olympic sport. For the implementation of this plan, a Soviet delegation from Moscow drove to Riga, which returned there with a handwritten Russian translation of the Canadian ice hockey rules. It can therefore be said that one of the origins of the Russian hockey tradition lies in Latvia. Only two years after the end of the Second World War and the incorporation of Latvia into the Soviet Union, Dinamo Riga began playing under the new name \\"Daugava Riga\\" with pre-war players in the first Soviet league. In 1948, Harijs Mellups became the league's best goalkeeper and was called to the Soviet National Team. Mellups died in the early fifties together with his clubmates near the Russian city Sverdlovsk in a plane crash. In addition to Daugava, there were other teams such as Rƒ´gas Vagonb≈´ves R≈´pnƒ´ca (the Latvian [RVR] club RVR), \\"Spartaks\\", \\"VEF\\" and Latvijas Bƒìrzs, which are based on youth and/or senior level in regional championships. The only top club in Latvia, Daugava, remained in the highest league of the Soviet Union until the 1958/59 season. Other players from before the war emigrated to Germany, where between 1946 and 1949 up to eight Latvians competed in Augsburg under the nickname \\"Letten-Team\\". This team won under the leadership of Latvian players in the Southern German championships in 1948, before the team disbanded later. R≈´dolfs Veide ( dt. Rudolf Weide ) began a long and successful career as a player and coach in West Germany. In 1951 he was able to win the German Championship with the legendary Preussen Krefeld and between 1953 and 1954 he completed 18 international matches for the German national team. Later he became director of the Kenston Arena and supported the development of the Duisburg ice hockey. Another member of the Latvian team was ƒíriks Ko≈Üeckis, who several times as a player and coach German champion and later held the post of national coach. With the descent of Daugava into the second division began for the Latvian hockey a time of mediocrity, which lasted until the end of the sixties. In 1968, Daugava was renamed again Dinamo Riga. Despite repeated attempts, the club did not manage to rise from the second Soviet League. Apart from some international friendlies against teams from Finland, Dukla Trenƒç√≠n and Poldi Kladno from Czechoslovakia, Novosibirsk and Ust- Kamenogorsk, no further events from this period are worth mentioning. = The Tikhonov era = The development of Latvian hockey got a boost in 1968 with the arrival of the Soviet coach Wiktor Tikhonov, who began his legendary coaching career there. He was known for his penchant for discipline and revolutionized training methods using a VCR for game analysis. He also attached great importance to the physical fitness of his players. Due to the low playful potential of the Dinamo players, he set with the establishment of four rows of attack a strategy that used no Soviet team until then. Since this measure has increased the players' breaks between their working hours, the team was able to make up for technical disadvantages by speeding up and improving their condition against more highly rated teams. In 1973 Dinamo Riga could even celebrate the re-emergence in the first league after 14 years. RVR opened a hockey school in 1967 and a little later Helmuts Balderis produced a superstar. His nickname was \\"Electric Train\\" and besides Tikhonov he had a big part in the rise of Dinamo. Together with Tikhonov, he joined CSKA Moscow in 1977, participated 1976 with the Soviet national team in the Canada Cup and participated in five world championships and also won the silver medal at Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. In addition, he won twice in his career the title of the best scorer of the Soviet League and was once awarded the best striker in the World Cup. The second place of Lake Placid for the team of the USSR, however, was regarded in the home as a great failure. As one of the main culprits for the defeat in the then crucial game against the Team USA, the so- called Miracle on Ice, was also considered Balderis. Dinamo Riga remained first class until the collapse of the Soviet Union. The ethnic composition of the crew changed dramatically in the 1970s and 1980s as more and more Russians displaced the Latvians. An exception were the goalkeepers VitƒÅlijs Samoilovs and Art≈´rs Irbe. Irbe gave in the season 1986/87 his debut for Dinamo in the Eliteliga. The following season Dinamo Riga was able to celebrate the biggest success in the club's history by winning Soviet Championship League. With this success Dinamo was entitled to take part in the Super Series, an annual comparison between teams from the USSR and the National Hockey League, in addition to the former Soviet CSKA Moscow champion , In addition, Irbe and Samoilovs were selected in 1988 in the Soviet Union national ice hockey team. The latter was the same year with the national team Olympic champion. = The time after 1990 = Since the beginning of Mikhail Gorbachev's term of office, Latvians have increasingly begun to strive for Independence. The Latvian Supreme Soviet declared independence of the Republic of Latvia on 4 May 1990. Only after the coup in Moscow in August 1991 followed the international recognition of Latvia. Irbe finally became the hero and role model of the Latvians when he participated in the defense of barricades against the Soviet Army and later refused to continue playing for the Soviet national team. Already in the 1991‚Äì92 NHL season he signed his first NHL contract with the San Jose Sharks and also won his first game.  Emigrants and returnees  Due to the political turmoil, Latvian ice hockey collapsed and players dispersed in leagues around the world. Sandis Ozoli≈Ü≈° played in the fall of 1991 for the juniors of the Soviet national team, but began in 1992 in the International Hockey League to play. In the spring of 1992, Edmonton Oilers and Boston Bruins camps were held in Rƒ´ga, under which Sergejs ≈Ωoltoks and Grigorijs Panteƒºejevs were contracted. Many other players tried their luck in North America and played mostly in Minor Leagues, but did not make it into the NHL, so many returned home. Few have come up with a small number of missions in the NHL, such as Harijs Vƒ´toli≈Ü≈°, Viktors Ignatjevs, Kaspars Asta≈°enko, Raitis IvanƒÅns, Herberts Vasiƒºjevs and Panteƒºejevs , Only Irbe, Ozoli≈Ü≈°, ≈Ωoltoks and KƒÅrlis Skrasti≈Ü≈° established themselves permanently in the NHL and play there even today. Other players moved to Western Europe or to the top clubs to Moscow. Harijs Vƒ´toli≈Ü≈° soon returned from North America and played for many years for the EHC Chur. The returnees from North America found a financially troubled country in which the hockey game for survival and players abruptly left their teams as soon as they offered a chance abroad. During the 1990s there was only one ice rink in Latvia, the time-honored Rigas Sporta Pils. Hockey teams emerged and disappeared and changed their names with the current main sponsor. Dinamo Riga was renamed Hockey Club Riga, then Riga stars (after the sponsor A / S Stars ) and finally in PƒÅrdaugava . First, the team played in the Russian Interstate League , later in the Eastern European Hockey League before 1995, the bankruptcy was filed. The team was re-founded under the name Riga Juniors , as today's successor to Dinamo, the HK Riga 2000 can be viewed. Governing body The Latvian Ice Hockey Federation organizes amateur and professional ice hockey in the country. Domestic league Latvia is one of the smaller member countries of the IIHF with (in 2017) a total of 6,699 registered ice hockey players, including 1,888 juniors and 101 women. There are also 185 registered ice hockey referees in the country. The Latvian Hockey Higher League ( Latvijas AtklƒÅtais ƒçempionƒÅts , Open Latvian Championship), which was held between 2006 and 2008 on the basis of the Sponsorship s of the company Samsung \\"Samsung premjerlƒ´ga\\" was founded in 1931. The first Latvian champions was Rƒ´gas Unions. Between 1946 and 1990, the year of the Latvian Declaration of Independence, no official Latvian championship was played, but nevertheless a tournament was held annually. In 1990 the Latvian league was a pure Amateur league, nowadays it is a league with pro s and semi-professionals playing in a total of six clubs. One of the participating clubs is the Lithuanian club SC Energija, which was admitted to the league in 2003. In addition to the series champion HK Riga 2000, another team from Riga took part, the SK Riga 20. This team was recruited almost exclusively from members of the Latvian U20 national team. After the Belarus Ice Hockey Federation decided to open its top division (the Belarusian Extraleague) again for foreign teams in the summer of 2008, the four best Latvian teams moved to Belarus. Since then, the new game mode has been in the form of a two-part championship, with the four best teams in the Latvian league and the four participants in the Belarusian extra league playing the Latvian championship in the form of play-offs at the end of the season. As a result of the economic crisis in 2009, the HK Riga 2000 went bankrupt and was dissolved. As a result, the former SK Riga 20 has been integrated into the club Dinamo Riga and will play as Dinamo-Juniors Riga). Below the Latvian ice hockey league there is a second and third division and an amateur league in which nine teams fought for the title in the 2006/07 season. = Reestablishment of Dinamo Riga = As part of the opening of the Russian Super League and renaming it in Kontinental Hockey League, a new hockey franchise was founded in Riga in April 2008 called Dinamo Riga and recalling the most successful times of Latvian hockey. Shareholders of the franchise are several companies and individuals, among which Itera Latvija (Latvian gas company belonging to Gazprom), Guntis Ulmanis (the fifth president of Latvia), Aigars Kalvƒ´tis (former prime minister of Latvia), Kalvitis has already invested 50,000 lats in Dinamo Riga and is planning another 150,000 lats and Aldis Pauni≈Ü≈° belong. In addition to some foreign players, Latvian national players such as Edgars Masaƒºskis, Rƒìdlihs brothers and Aleksandrs ≈Öi≈æivijs have been committed to increasing the identification of Latvians with this new club. With the HK Riga 2000 a cooperation agreement was concluded, which provides for a player exchange of the two clubs. This is intended to give young and recovering players in particular the opportunity to play in a farm team match practice. The season 2008/09 of the KHL began on 2 September 2008 with the game Dinamo Riga against Amur Khabarovsk, with Aleksandrs ≈Öi≈æivijs 1‚Äì0 and thus the first goal in history the KHL scored. At the end of the main round Dinamo finished tenth in the table and reached the Play-off ‚Äì knockout round, where the team in three games against the HK Dynamo Moscow eliminated. National team During the cold war the Latvian players played ice hockey under the banner of the Soviet Union. Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 Lavitians play under the Lavatian national team. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the IIHF introduced qualifying tournaments for the Ice Hockey World Cup, as many new national associations wanted to participate. The Latvian national team won their qualifying matches against the Baltic neighbors Estonia and Lithuania and was allowed one year later participate in the C-World Cup in Slovenia. The C-championship was won with a 2‚Äì0 final victory against the Ukraine and Latvia rose to the B-group. In the following three years, the national team took part in the B World Championships and won the B-WM 1996 just before the Swiss. At their First A Group Tournament, the Latvians surprised and took seventh place. Since then, the Latvian national team have always been part of the A-World Championship and have won several victories against the former occupying power, Russia, 2000 in Saint Petersburg and 2003 in Finland on 4 May, the day of the declaration of Latvian independence. With the success of the national team also strengthened the hockey sport in Latvia. New ice rinks gradually developed and the Latvian Hockey Higher League became the strongest Baltic league after the dissolution of the EEHL, with a team from Lithuania and Estonia playing each. Two new arenas, the Skonto Arena and the Riga Arena were built to host the 2006 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships in Latvia, with a total of 15 ice rinks available. With the rise of the league and the improved play and training opportunities many Latvian players returned and the ethnic composition of the teams changed again in favor of the Latvians. National and local youth programs were launched so that in 2006 the Latvian Junior National Team was allowed to participate in the U20 World Youth Championship in [British Columbia]. In the same year, the Latvian U18 team was able to win Division I, so that in 2007 it was first class and participated in the U18 World Cup, but there again relegated to Division I. , In Division I U20 World Championship 2008, the Latvian Under-20 team won the tournament in Riga and returned to the A Group. In addition, Kaspars Daugavi≈Ü≈° was a top scorer and Art≈´rs Kulda was voted best defender of the tournament. The Latvian national team has never reached beyond the quarter finals of any major ice hockey tournament.  Women's Ice Hockey  The Latvian women's national team has been involved in international title fights since 1993 and won the B European Championship in the same year, allowing them to participate in the IIHF European Championship in 1995. This tournament was held in Riga and the ladies of the Latvian federation won only sixth place, so the Latvian selection returned to the B-group. A year later, however, the team could celebrate the runner-up of the B-EM. From 1999, the field of participants of the World Championship was increased. However, the Latvian women were only able to reach a back rank in the Qualifying Tournament for the A World Championship, and since then they have been playing in the IIHF World Championship B Group usually occupy places in the midfield. The players of the national team are mainly recruited from the two top clubs of Latvian women's hockey, SHK Laima Riga and IceGirls. Two players were also contracted by the Russian women's team Tornado Moskau in 2007, which became the 2006/07 season Russian Champions. The SHK Laima Riga has participated in the IIHF European Women Championships several times and took part in the second round tournament in Berlin in October 2007. In addition to the SHK Laima Riga and the IceGirls there is a third women's team, LSK LiepƒÅja . These three teams are playing the Latvian Women's Championship among themselves, with the SHK Laima team winning the title in 2006.  Latvians in the National Hockey League  A total of 21 Latvians (three goalkeepers and 18 outfielders) have already been on the ice in the National Hockey League. The first was Helmuts Balderis, who joined the Minnesota North Stars at the age of 36, to play for them in the season 1989/90. Sandis Ozoli≈Ü≈°, Art≈´rs Irbe, Sergejs ≈Ωoltoks and KƒÅrlis Skrasti≈Ü≈° are the most successful among them, with Ozoli≈Ü≈° being the only Latvian winner of the Stanley Cup he was able to win this in the season 1995/96 with the Colorado Avalanche. Ozoli≈Ü≈° and Irbe have also played in NHL All-Star Games. The other Latvian NHL players are Aleksandrs Kerƒçs, Grigorijs Panteƒºejevs, Pƒìteris Skudra, Viktors Ignatjevs, Herberts Vasiƒºjevs, Kaspars Asta≈°enko, Raitis IvanƒÅns, JƒÅnis Sprukts, MƒÅrti≈Ü≈° Karsums, Harijs Vƒ´toli≈Ü≈°, Kaspars Daugavi≈Ü≈° and Art≈´rs Kulda. Ergejs ≈Ωoltoks was considered one of the best Latvian players of all time. He was the best scorer of the Latvians in the World Championship 2004 in the Czech Republic and pointed to the NHL ‚Äì Lockout in the season 2004/05 the experience of 633 NHL games for Boston, Ottawa, Montreal, Edmonton, Minnesota and Nashville. He began his professional career in the Soviet League at the then Dinamo Riga. During the NHL Lockout he played for Dinamo's successor club HK Riga 2000 in the open Belarus league, forfeiting lavish salaries in favor of his hometown club in Russia or Western Europe. His first heart problems were diagnosed with him at the NHL clubs and during an away game in Minsk he suffered a severe heart attack. On November 3, 2004, the Center died of heart failure at the age of 31. The resuscitation attempt of the doctors failed and ≈Ωoltoks died in the locker room.  Fan culture  Ice hockey is considered one of Latvia's national sports. Dinamo Riga's successes drew much attention to the sport. In contrast, clubs in the 1990s did not attract many fans to the arenas, whereas the national team has become increasingly popular since its re-founding. For every world championship, large numbers of Latvian fans travel to and support to support national team, despite Latvia being one of the poorest countries in the European Union. \\"In Oslo they were seen sleeping in buses and outside\\" \\", said IIHF president Ren√© Fasel in 1999 about the fans he described as the best in the world. During the 2000 World Championship, the Latvian Parliament interrupted its sessions so that the politicians could follow the national team's games on television. After beating Russia 3‚Äì1, the members of the Opposition and ruling party in the arms and sang together. At the 2006 World Championship held in Latvia, Latvian fans caused a scandal during their 11-0 defeat against Canada. The audience felt discriminated against by referee Rick Looker in the first period, as he called many penalties against the Latvian team with the Canadian team scoring on the power play. The home crowd, predominantly made up of Latvian supporters, began throwing items onto the ice. The officiating crew took the break so that the ice could be cleaned and the crowd could be calmed down. But trouble began again in the third period as more objects were thrown onto the ice and the teams left the ice once again. To calm the situation, the Latvian player JƒÅnis Sprukts spoke to the audience over the stadium speakers: \\"Of course the referee makes many mistakes and we are not happy either, but please do not throw anything on the ice.\\" After that, the game ended without further interference from the crowd. There have also been many Latvians who have gone overseas to play in the Canadian Hockey League hoping to be drafted in the NHL Entry Draft.

It took place on the same day as many other local elections in Wales and England. This was the second annual all-Cardiff elections since the 1914-18 Great War. The previous elections were in November 1919 and the next annual all-Cardiff elections were to take place in November 1921. The election saw campaigning to stop the Labour Party repeating its successes of November 1919. Background Cardiff County Borough Council had been created in 1889. Cardiff became a city in 1905. Elections to the local authority were held annually, though not all council seats were included in each contest, because the three councillors in each ward stood down for election in three-yearly rotation. Ten seats in ten electoral wards were up for election in November 1920. The council consisted of 30 councillors who were elected by the town's voters and ten aldermen who were elected by the councillors. The previous all-Cardiff elections in 1919 had seen significant gains of seats for the Labour Party and Ex-Servicemen candidates. Overview of the result In November 1920 contests took place in eight of the ten Cardiff electoral wards. The two retiring Conservative Party councillors in the Central and South wards were elected unopposed. The Western Mail was partisan in South Wales, having campaigned for two months to stop the Labour \\"extremists\\" from repeating their successes of 1919. In the Canton, Grangetown, Riverside, Roath and Splott wards the Conservative and Liberal parties came together to put forward a joint candidate, so as to not split the vote. The Liberal-Conservative Coalition candidates won by substantial majorities over Labour in four of the five wards in which they stood. In contrast, Labour's Herbert Hiles won against the Coalition candidate (who was the retiring member) in the Splott ward. The only other sitting candidate (a Liberal) to lose their seat was in the Park ward, where the Conservatives won the contest. Turnout was substantially up on 1919 (42.4%) with 55.1% turning up to vote in November 1920. Women voters often outnumbered men, in some wards by 2 to 1. =Council composition= Following the November 1919 election the balance on the city council was 17 Liberal, 15 Conservative, 4 Labour, 3 Ex- Servicemen, 1 Independent. In 1920 Labour increased their number by one, as did the Independents. Four previously Liberal/Conservative members were elected as, or were replaced by 'Coalition' members.

Production On December 12, 2003 The Chinese City Creativity Index is funded by Shenzhen Propaganda Cultural Undertaking Foundation, and hosted and developed by Cultural Industry Research Institute of Shenzhen University.This is an important brand activity held by Shenzhen University since the establishment of the national cultural innovation research center. Methods The Chinese City Creativity Index is based on the theoretical methods related to Michael Porter's diamond Model, Systems Theory, etc. A Chinese City Creativity Index model is established, which consists of 4 modules including factor driving force, demand pull force, relevant support force and industrial influence force, 9 secondary indexes and 18 tertiary indexes. The model takes into account not only the promoting effect of various resources such as talents, funds, technologies and culture, but also the pulling function of cultural needs and consumption potentials as well as the supporting role of relevant industries such as communication and network. Moreover, all the indexes adopt the form of both absolute value and relative value, and the index summarization method uses a multiplicative model rather than an additive model. The final index system contains 1 comprehensive index (CCCI) and 4 sub-indexes (factor driving force index, demand pull force index, relevant support force index and industrial influence force index). Ranking In 2016, 50 large and medium size cities in China were evaluated, including capitals, sub-provincial cities, direct-controlled municipalities and economically developed cities.

The station broadcasts nationwide. It is owned by the country's public broadcaster, ZBC. History In the country, television was introduced in 1960, making it the second country after Nigeria to launch such services in the Sub Saharan Africa EBU Review: Programmes, Administration, Law, Volume 71, Administrative Office of the European Broadcasting Union, 1962, page 12 and the first in Southern Africa. It was operated by a private company called Rhodesian Television (RTV) with its major shareholders being South African companies. RTV was taken over by the government and became part of the then state broadcaster, Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation (RBC) in 1976. Television was mainly accessible in major cities of the country and mostly to the white population. Soon after the launch in 1960, television became available in Salisbury now Harare and months later became available in Bulawayo. Back then, the station was broadcasting in black and white until 1982, when it upgraded to full colour using PAL B system. After the country's independence on 18 April 1980,'MuckRaker: ZBC has taken over the RBC's mantle', Zimbabwe Independent, 16 February 2012 RTV became ZBC TV and RBC became ZBC. This followed after the country changed its name from Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Zimbabwe Rhodesia to Independent Zimbabwe. The station is sometimes called ZTV, abbreviation for Zimbabwe Television, a name that was officially used in the 2000s. In the late 90s, the country's main opposition party MDC led by Morgan Tsvangirai was launched. This saw the majority of the opposition supporters, local independent media houses, non governmental organisations and international media monitors accusing the state broadcaster for only reporting biased news favouring the ruling ZANU PF.

The launch of the station was delayed despite the fact that the transmitter was already installed. In 2005, Minister Moyo was fired and the project collapsed. In 2015 when he was reappointed as the information minister, Moyo promised to revive the NTV project but that never happened. On 1 May 2010, ZBC reported the successful launch of another TV channel called Channel 2.Zimbabwe: ZBC to Launch Channel Two, The Herald, 13 April 2010 The TV channel transmitted on 199.5 MHz within an 80 km (50 mile) radius of Harare.

Background The sources used are in European languages only; he never used sources originally written in Armenian or in Turkish. Justin McCarthy of the University of Louisville wrote that Armenian sources would get more representation compared to Turkish sources and documents from the imperial archives since more Armenian sources had been translated into European languages.McCarthy, p. 337. Armenian Genocide historian Taner Ak√ßam of Clark University stated that in general Western researchers were not aware of the majority of Armenian or Turkish materials, as well as Russian ones, due to the language barrier.Ak√ßam, p. 117. Contents The work focuses on the Armenian Genocide during 1915-1916 and provides no coverage of subsequent years. \\\\- Available on Questia Lewy argued that there was not enough evidence to support the conclusion that the Ottoman government deliberately attempted to destroy the Armenian population through a genocide. Ak√ßam stated that this was the \\"central thesis\\" of the book with this statement made on several occasions. The author stated that the high death toll was simply a byproduct of the conditions of the marches and on sporadic attacks rather than a planned attempt to kill the Armenians.Ak√ßam, p. 112. Edward J. Erickson of The Middle East Journal stated \\"He does not attempt to answer the question, \\"was it a genocide or not?\\"\\" According to the author, evidence that stated that the genocide was deliberate was doctored: The Memoirs of Naim Bey, the documents of the Turkish courts-martial of 1919‚Äì1920, and other documents related to the Special Organization (SO). He also argued that hearsay formed the basis of The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire (nicknamed the \\"Blue Book\\"),Ak√ßam, p. 114. and that the speech made by Re≈üit Akif Pasha accusing the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) Central Committee of instigating a genocide was dishonestly made.Ak√ßam, p. 113. Lewy, who decided that a lack of competence in the Ottoman authorities was the reason for the deaths, as well as local government officials disobeying the central government,Ak√ßam, p. 115. includes criticisms of the Ottoman government, stating that it took too harsh action against perceived Armenian threats, that the amount of Armenian deaths and damage exceeded that of what the Turks experienced, and that the Ottoman government did not provide adequate protections for any ethnic group. Lewy's book includes criticisms of Vahakn Dadrian's work. Reception Ak√ßam argued that the central thesis of the book was an unproven theory while Lewy himself argued that the idea of genocide being planned was a theory; Ak√ßam also stated that there were other documents that proved the genocide was planned.Ak√ßam, p. 116. Ak√ßam also stated that the author misinterpreted some documents, that his lack of skills in Turkish hampered his research, and that Lewy was not informed of current research. In addition Ak√ßam disliked the author's dichotomy of \\"Armenian\\" and \\"Turkish\\" \\"sides\\" to the Armenian genocide denial dispute,Ak√ßam, p. 118. as it conflates Armenians of differing allegances together and because \\"it should be an unacceptable attitude for asocial scientist to classify the differences of interpretation of these events according to ethnic origin.\\"Ak√ßam, p. 119. McCarthy wrote that it as \\"an outstanding work of historiography\\". Michael M. Gunter, after having written a positive statement that was used on the cover of The Armenian Massacres in Ottoman Turkey, wrote a review of the book for the International Journal of Middle East Studies (IJMES) without the editors' knowledge that he had made the positive statement. History News Network stated that the review \\"reportedly arrived in their office sans cover.\\" Two academics, Joseph A. K√©chichian,K√©chichian, p. 509. and Keith David Watenpaugh,Watenpaugh, Extract. criticized the presence of the review in the IJMES. Gunter issued a response to his critics.

Being part of the Mickey Mouse film series, it was the twenty-ninth Mickey Mouse short to be produced, and the fifth of 1931. Synopsis Mickey Mouse is driving a rickety donkey cart piled high with musical instruments, with his dog Pluto running alongside. They stop when they reach Minnie's house, and spy on her while she is washing and hanging up clothes. She is singing \\"In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree\\", and her enthusiasm is so infectious that even the laundry is dancing along. Mickey mischievously hides in a large pair of bloomers hanging on the line, teasing her by singing along and twanging her tail. Catching on to his trick, she drops him into the washtub, which breaks. That puts a stop to Minnie's laundry chores, so the mice break into a jazzy Charleston dance number. Excited by the dance, Mickey punches a hornet's nest off a branch, and it lands on the donkey's tail. In his panic, the donkey smashes the cart to pieces, and the musical instruments land all over the barnyard. Undaunted by this disaster, Minnie asks Mickey to play the piano for her, and they break into a spirited duet of \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\". The animals all play along, and everything is jolly until Pluto investigates a nearby road crew's work, and picks up a lit stick of dynamite. Thinking that he is fetching a stick, Pluto brings the dynamite back to Mickey and Minnie, and it blows the mice into the sky. Even that fails to dampen their spirits, and they conclude the number with a flourish. Production The Charleston sequence was animated by Dick Lundy, the studio's dance specialist. Peg-leg Pete makes a brief cameo, as one of the road crew. Reception In Mickey's Movies: The Theatrical Films of Mickey Mouse, Gijs Grob writes: \\"This short is as joyous as it is boring. After three years of song-and-dance routines, one grows tired of it. Morever, cartoons like Traffic Troubles and The Moose Hunt had proven that Mickey could do very well without them... Pluto's storyline, however brief, is the most interesting aspect of the cartoon, as it contains the germinal idea of a grand finale. Indeed, Pluto would cause havoc again in subsequent films, like Mickey Steps Out (1931), Mickey Cuts Up (1931), and The Grocery Boy (1932). In these films the song-and-dance routine would give way to well-built gag-filled finales, of which the one in The Delivery Boy is only an embryonic version.\\" Voice cast * Mickey Mouse: Walt Disney * Minnie Mouse: Marcellite Garner * Pluto: unknown Releases The cartoon was released on the 2004 Walt Disney Treasures DVD set Mickey Mouse in Black and White: Volume Two.

He became known, in particular, as the pioneering designer of a series of major railway bridges. Peredery enjoyed a distinguished parallel career as a university teacher, becoming rector at the Petrograd State Transport University (as it was then known) in 1921. He was the author of over 80 published pieces of academic work, including a detailed course on bridge design and construction. Biography Grigory Petrovich Peredery was born at Yeysk, an important port town and a noted spa resort beside the Sea of Azov. His father was a builder. He attended school in Yeysk and then, more briefly, in the city of Kharkiv. That was followed, during 1888/89, by a year at Agricultural College at Nowo Aleksandria (previously and again subsequently known as Pu≈Çawy) in Poland, and a four month visit to Paris. During 1890/91 he served in a field battery battalion with the 13th Artillery brigade at Sevastopol. He then enrolled in 1892 at the Emperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University, a university-level institution with a focus on railway transport. He graduated in 1897. The Russian railways were enjoying a period of rapid expansion, and later that year Peredery went to work of the construction of the Dankov-Smolensk line which would open in 1899. He then went on to work on various new railways in the Caucasus region. While still a young engineer he took charge at \\"–ò–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–µ –¥–µ–ª–æ\\" (loosely, \\"Engineering\\") Magazine which was published in Tbilisi, and it was here that his first written contributions were published. Peredery successfully combined research and teaching with practical engineering work focused on bridge design and construction. He was a pioneer in the use of steel-reinforced concrete, developing as early as 1915 the concept of standardised designs for reinforced concrete beam structures. Later he advanced the idea of building from precast concrete bridge structures. In 1912 he published \\"–ö—É—Ä—Å –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–æ–±–µ—Ç–æ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –º–æ—Å—Ç–æ–≤. –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ü–∏—è, –ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏ —Ä–∞—Å—á–µ—Ç\\" which dealt with the design of reinforced concrete bridges, and the necessary parameters and calculations to be applied. This amounted to a detailed written instruction course. It was reprinted several times and became extremely influential. In 1902, while he was working as an engineer on the construction of the Moscow-Kazan railway, Peredery took a teaching job with the railways department at the Moscow Engineering Academy (\\"–ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–≥–æ —É—á–∏–ª–∏—â–∞\\"). Between 1907 and 1914 he also lectured at the Engineering Institute of Transport Communications (–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ \\"–ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç–∞ –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–æ–≤ –ø—É—Ç–µ–π —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏—è \\") in St. Petersburg. In 1919 became a professor. In 1920 he was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Engineering Structures and in 1921 he became rector at the Petrograd State Transport University (as it was known at that time). Between 1923 and 1927 he also held the post of rector at the Institute of Civil Engineers (\\"–ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç–∞ –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–æ–≤ \\"). The period since 1914 had been one of enduring crisis, which for the transportation sector meant addressing the urgent need for reconstruction following the widespread destruction and degradation caused by the Civil War and surrounding events. The State Transport University was one of the country's main engineering universities, training engineers in respect of all forms of transport. However, during the period 1918 - 1920 it was only producing approximately 60-70 trained engineers each year. There was a desperately urgent need to implement educational reforms that would permit the mass training of dedicated transport engineers to restore the railways and develop a modern rail infrastructure worthy of the young republic. Students had traditionally been recruited from the nobility, officer families and the middle classes. Social and political upheavals during 1917/18 and the subsequent Civil War had led to great changes. Some of the teachers had died while others had escaped to the west. Social classes that had traditionally provided the students were much diminished. The government installed a commissar who was able to resolve some of the political issues that arose and ensure that the university progressed in a manner acceptable to the government, but that did not, on its own, address all the challenges. Restructuring therefore involved what one source identifies as rapid proletarianisation of the university. The first step was the creation of \\"workers' faculties\\" designed to prepare the country's proletarians for university admission. The courses involved lasted 2-3 years. Meanwhile in May 1921 the university opened a \\"day-time work school\\" where approximately 250 were trained. In November 1922 an evening branch was opened. By the start of the 1922/23 academic year the day-time department was able to welcome 380 new students. In 1922 the constitutional structure of the university was re- engineered. The Council of Elders was eliminated and replaced by new student organisations. One of the main challenges driving the restructuring involved making a start on changing the social composition of the student body. All this involved a drastic restructuring of study patterns. A number of new curricula had to be created, while other curricula that were retained needed extensive revision. Graduation and work-experience arrangements were comprehensively re-engineered. Preparing large numbers of fully-fledged engineers capable of solving the technical and practical challenges involved in restoring and reconstructing the transport network meant identifying and applying the most politically acceptable methods for training young proletarian comrades whose shared defining characteristic was an insufficiency of basic general education. Prof. Peredery led the re-engineering work. Grigory Petrovich Peredery died at Moscow aged 82 on 14 December 1953, by which time his work had earned him a number of significant state awards and honours. His mortal remains were buried in the Vvedenskoye Cemetery on the eastern edge of the city. Works Peredery masterminded over 30 major concrete and metal bridges over the Volkhov, Moskva, Dnieper, Vologda and Ob rivers. One of the earliest was the 1910 Borodinsky Bridge (subsequently widened and extended) in the heart of Moscow. Another, in 1916, was the reinforced concrete bridge (subsequently reworked and extended) over the great Amur River at Khabarovsk. Later constructions were the October Bridge (1928-1931) in Vologda, the Volodarsky Bridge (1932-1936) and Annunciation Bridge (1936-1938) in Saint Petersburg, and the Kuznechevsky Bridge (opened 1956) in Arkhangelsk, far to the north. Awards and honours (selection) Grigory Peredery became a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1939 (Mechanics Department) and a full academician in 1943 (Bridge Engineering Department).

The party's name, Barabri, is an Urdu word meaning 'equality' because the fundamental underlying philosophy of the party is equitable distribution of resources and equality of access to opportunities for all citizens of Pakistan regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, nationality or gender. BPP fielded 12 candidates for 5 Provincial and 7 National Assembly, including one woman, in 2018 General Elections, all of them belonging to the middle class, working class and youth, against the political stalwarts in the country. Jawad Ahmad himself challenged Imran Khan, Shehbaz Sharif and Bilawal Zardari Bhutto representing the three major political parties in Pakistan, in 2018 elections. He believes that these parties represent the elites in the country and election is a form of business for these parties. Jawad Ahmad further elaborates that ninety-nine percent of Pakistan population belongs to the middle and working class and unless candidates representing this ninety-nine percent of the population enter the parliament to work on people-centric legislation, nothing will change and status quo will keep on existing.

Bloxham concludes that the Armenian Genocide was planned by the Ottoman government. It focuses on the geopolitical relations between the powers of World War I and the genocide, and how some countries supported the Armenians for geopolitical reasons but ended support due to new geopolitical factors in regards to the empire and the successor, the Republic of Turkey. The book includes an overview of relations between Ottoman Armenians and Ottoman Turks while many other works on the genocide focus solely on that.Oktem, p. 712. The final chapter discusses how the government and people of the United States responded to the Armenian genocide. Jay Winter said in his review that as Bloxham affirms the genocide, the \\"bitter irony of the title\\" is not a denial of the genocide.Winter, p. 126.

She was inducted into the California Library Hall of Fame in 2013.  Early life  Gretchen D. Knief was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the daughter of Frederick Constantine Knief and Dora Mueller Knief. Her father was a Lutheran minister, who moved the family to southern California in 1923. She attended Milwaukee State Normal School, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Illinois Library School.  Career  Knief's early library jobs included work at the Milwaukee Public Library, the Los Angeles Public Library, the Santa Monica Public Library, and the Siskiyou County Free Library in Yreka, California. In 1939, Knief was the county librarian of Kern County, California, when the county Board of Supervisors ordered that the libraries remove all copies of John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. She announced that, once removed, the books would not be discarded, but instead offered to other county libraries in California. The book was restored to Kern County library shelves in January 1941. \\"Banning books is so utterly hopeless and futile,\\" she wrote in a letter to the Board. \\"Ideas don't die because a book is forbidden reading. If Steinbeck has written the truth, that truth will survive.\\" In 1941 she announced the availability of another controversial title, Jan Valtin's Out of the Night, a bestselling autobiography said to contain \\"lurid tales of violence and horror\\" by an ex-spy. Schenk moved to Washington soon after the Steinbeck controversy, and was Washington State Librarian from 1942 to 1945. After World War II, she became a library consultant based in Summerdale, Alabama, conducting studies of county and statewide public library systems, and making recommendations for improvement. She was president of the Alabama Library Association from 1949 to 1950, and led the association's first, contentious discussions about admitting black librarians into its membership. The American Library Association published Schenk's County and Regional Library Development in 1954. Schenk was presented with the second Beta Phi Mu Award in 1955, for \\"distinguished service to librarianship\\". She was posthumously inducted into the California Library Hall of Fame in 2013.  Personal life  Gretchen Knief married German-born dairy farmer Franz Schenk in 1942. She died in Foley, Alabama, in 1989, aged 87 years, the same year as the fiftieth anniversary of The Grapes of Wrath's publication, and of her efforts to keep the book on California library shelves.

She was assigned the hull classification symbol WAGL-206 in 1942. =Post-World War II= Returned to U.S. Coast Guard control after the conclusion of World War II, Camellia was decommissioned on 29 December 1947. =Dominican Republic= The United States Government transferred the ship to the Dominican Republic in 1949. In Dominican Navy service, she was renamed Capotillo (FB 101) and reclassified as \\"Service Craft No. 1.\\" She was still in service in the 1980s, but her subsequent fate is unknown.

The area around the village occupies an area of 21.4 km¬≤, with forests covering an area of 1,511 hectares , with arable land of 330 hectares, and 269 hectares of pastures. The climate in the settlement is mountainous. It is bordered easterly by the Plakenska Mountain. There are two rivers running through the village: Bela Reka (Golemacha) and Levacha. History In the 19th century, Sloeshtica was a Christian village within the Sanjak of Monastir of the sub- district (kaza) of Monastir of the Ottoman Empire. During the Ilinden Uprising, the village was attacked on August 18, 1903 by Turkish forces. Villagers Bogoya Ivanov, Nikola Talev and Stoycho Ristev were killed from the village, and Mets Stoyanov and Dole Ristev from Slepche died as chetas near the village.Ilinden Illustration, No. 147, p.15 In October 1910 the village suffered during the disarmament action of the young Turks. A Bulgarian teacher in the village, Doychinov was arrested and jailed in the village of Pribilci.Debarski voice, year 2, issue 28, 7 November 1910, p. 4. =Legend= The village is known for its legend for Alexander the Great. Namely, in the vicinity of the village, there is a rocky hill on which there are impressions from the hoof of the cavalry of Alexander the Great. These traces are seen in the area of Bela Reka, where the soldiers of Alexander cut wood (hazel) for the phalanx spears.

He served as one of his father's military commanders and may have been favoured as his preferred successor. However, he died of illness in 1445, predeceasing Shah Rukh by two years. Life Born on 27 April 1402, Muhammad Juki was the youngest of the three sons of Shah Rukh by his empress consort, Gawhar Shad. Somewhat younger than his full brothers Ulugh Beg and Baysunghur, Muhammad Juki also appears to have held a lower status. He began his military career with his father's first campaign against the Qara Qoyunlu in Azerbaijan in 1420-21, during which he is recorded to have led troops. In later years, he played an important part in Shah Rukh's major military expeditions and seems to have been a common presence at court. He appears to have performed the role of a sort of troubleshooter, often being sent on special missions requiring status and finesse, such as dealing with difficult local rulers and frontier regions. At one point, he was instructed to lead an army into Transoxiana, the domain of his brother Ulugh Beg, when the latter was discovered to be planning an expedition which their father had not approved. In 1425-6, Barak Khan, ruler of the Golden Horde laid claim to and began raiding the region of Sighnaq. Though Shah Rukh forbade a retaliatory expedition, in 1427, both Muhammad Juki and Ulugh Beg embarked on one regardless. This resulted in their heavy defeat and disordered return to Samarqand. While his brothers received appointments as provincial governors at a young age, he was only given his first posting in 1429-30, over the region of Khuttalan. Following the death of Baysunghur, Muhammad Juki appears to have become his father's favourite as well as his desired heir, though his mother was opposed to his candidacy, instead preferring Baysunghur's son Ala al- Dawla. Gawhar Shad kept Muhammad Juki excluded from positions of power, refusing him any influence in the divan, something which was bestowed on Ala al-Dawla as well as his other nephew Abdal-Latif. Additionally, she did not honour any of his children by raising them in the royal court, as she had done with the sons of his elder brothers. When Shah Rukh fell dangerously ill in 1444, Muhammad Juki, by then also governor of Balkh, immediately moved to the capital Herat in order to gain an advantage in the expected succession struggle. However, Gawhar Shad had already obtained the backing of the head of the military forces, Jalal ud-din Firuzshah, for Ala al-Dawla's accession. These preparations proved to be pointless when Shah Rukh unexpectedly recovered from his illness. However Firuzshah, already being investigated for abuse of power by Muhammad Juki on the emperor's orders, had angered the former with his backing of Ala al-Dawla. Muhammad Juki presented his findings to Shah Rukh, who reprimanded the noble. Unable to bear the disgrace, Firuzshah died of illness soon after. Muhammad Juki, suffering from a lingering illness which may have been exasperated by Gawhar Shad's hostility, died in Sarakhs in 1445, predeceasing his father. His governorships of Khuttalan and Balkh passed to his sons Abu Bakr and Muhammad Qasim respectively.

Siegel played a critical role in the revitalization of the Scotland community in the mid-1960s, founded and served as board member of multiple community organizations, and served as a Board Member of the Montgomery County Housing Opportunities Commission (HOC). She worked as a Head Start teacher, on the Sentinel newspapers staff (and created its Newspaper in the Classroom program), and on the HOC staff. She attended Smith College and Towson State College. She has a MPA from the University of Southern California (USC) and a BA in American Studies from the University of Maryland, College Park. She is married to Alan R. Siegel and has three grown children.  Scotland Community  Joyce Siegel (l) and Geneva Mason (r), Scotland, 1965 (Photo by Alan R. Siegel, Courtesy of Maryland History) Soon after moving to Bethesda, MD, in 1962, Siegel became aware of the Black community of Scotland along Seven Locks Road in Potomac, Maryland. Formed by former slaves in the 1880s, Scotland continued to suffer from segregation and lack of public services (no sewage, running water, trash collection). The housing stock was in poor shape (with the majority of buildings condemned by the County). Land speculators, with increasing housing developments, were seeking to buy out Scotland's residents. And, the County was creating and expanding Cabin John Regional Park and sought Scotland community land. In fall 1964, Scotland's future \\"looked bleak\\" as the Inverness North townhouse development would pave over the stream that was the community's primary water source. > It looked like Scotland would quietly disappear until a seemingly > unimportant event occurred just before Christmas of 1964. Onto the scene > came Mrs. Joyce Siegel, a housewife from nearby Bethesda, who drove up to > deliver a load of toys for Scotland's children. It was Siegel's first look > at the community, and she was horrified by what she saw and heard. Outraged at the evident discrimination against the community and its residents, Siegel looked for ways to engage and support Scotland. This began with efforts to help secure water and sewage services. Challenges and learning in this process were illustrative of the battles and education in the effort to enable the Scotland community to protect its future. Land titles were not clear throughout the community, with uncertain legal status for some homes. The Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission required clear title records as a prerequisite for providing sewage service and thus wouldn't provide Scotland water services. As well, Siegel built an understanding of the need for broader set of solutions. > \\"Sewer and water lines aren't the full answer. The present houses won't > support them.\\" Geneva Mason (L) and Joyce Siegel (R) commemorate key milestone in Scotland development (1969) [Photo: Alan R. Siegel, Courtesy of Montgomery HistoryAs this process went on, Siegel worked to mobilize a broader community to assist Scotland residents. She formed \\"Save Our Scotland\\" and a formal committee structure created in February 1965 (with Scotland residents (such as Geneva Mason), ministers, and Siegel on its board of directors). Save Our Scotland built heavily on faith communities. > \\"We just feel that it is basically morally wrong for affluent people, real- > estate operators, and others, to drive these people out of houses just > because they do not have enough money and because their skin is not white.\\" > Rev. Carl Pritchett, Pastor, Bethesda Presbyterian Church, President, Save > Our Scotland, 1966 The group leveraged the human resources of the Washington, DC, area: many current or former Federal employees volunteered their time bringing critical expertise to navigate emergent challenges in what was a rather complex set of processes over time. After many years of extended struggle, negotiation, and planning, the Scotland Development Corporation took control of land and built 100 townhouses (25 owned and 75 rental) on ten acres in the late 1960s and early 1970s to replace the deteriorating existing housing stock. > 'Scotland community is an example of how a number of people and institutions > - many of them incompatible only a few years ago - can involve themselves in > the problems of a community and work together to solve these problems,' U.S. > Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Robert C.

Members testified in front of the U.S. Senate committee for a rent-supplement program that had been created to help the Scotland community. Members also testified to the Maryland General Assembly for tax exemptions for housing non- profits. These still existed decades later. = Not just about housing stock = The Save Our Scotland effort and the resulting external engagement sought to support the Scotland community. For example, Siegel helped formed and participated in tutoring in the community's church basement. By 1966, this was open three nights a week and half the community's school children attended each session. When this started, this was almost solely assistance from outside the community but the outside volunteers supported Scotland parents as they took over supervising the tutoring.  Housing Opportunities Commission (HOC) and broader housing policy  Siegel's work on Scotland led to her having a recognized leadership in housing equity issues within Montgomery County and across the country. She played a leading role in the struggle for and then adoption by Montgomery County of zoning regulations requiring developers to set aside a share of their units for low-income tenants (with the County having the right to buy up to one-third of such units). > \\"We saw the segregation,\\" said Joyce Siegel, county housing commissioner at > the time. \\"It was a fairness issue ‚Äî that one part of the county wasn't > going to have more affordable housing than another. We had to be fair.\\" While it took seven years to get the legislation passed and signed by the County Executive, \\"Montgomery County's law was the first such zoning ordinance in the country, and it has spurred construction of more than 13,000 affordable housing units tucked into some of the county's most exclusive zip codes.\\" Siegel was appointed as a Commissioner of HOC. She resigned that position at the request of its director, Bernie Tetrault, to become HOC's Community Relations Officer. In her time at HOC, Siegel was involved in many of the developing initiatives to better strengthen and enable better quality and greater availability of low-income (public) housing in Montgomery County and nation-wide. For example, she fostered the first tax-equity swap that led to taxable entities providing financing for public housing developments.  Other community leadership and engagement  Siegel created the West Fernwood Civic Association in 1962. She served as President of the Interfaith Housing Coalition. The Sentinel Newspapers in the Classroom Siegel played a key role in the creation of and has served as chair of the Bernie Scholarship which supports residents of Montgomery County public housing pay for college education or vocational training. This was established in honor of Bernard Tetreault, who served for 24 years as HOC's Executive Director. From 2009 to date, she has served on the Forum condominium board where she has focused on boosting the association's energy efficiency. As with Scotland, she has leveraged the challenges of and learning in this process to impact energy policy in Montgomery County and in Maryland. This work, primarily focused on issues related to master-metered buildings, led to a 2013 award from the Maryland Clean Energy Center.  Career  Siegel was a Head Start teacher early in the program's years. She worked for the Montgomery County Sentinel where she created its Newspaper in the Classroom program and, in 1977, published The Sentinel Newspaper in the Classroom.'Let's Eat Out in Montgomery County, Fourth Edition, 1997Scotland project experiences and broader efforts to boost housing equity led to Siegel's appointment as a Board Member of the Montgomery County Housing Opportunities Commission (HOC). She resigned that position when asked to become HOC's Public Information Officer. For several decades, under the nom-de-plumes Joyce and Alan Rogers, the Siegels did restaurant reviews for several Washington, DC, local newspapers. From this, they published four editions of Let's Eat Out, Montgomery County.

With a multiplicity of steps it is not accessible to disabled persons. The close leads from Market Street at the foot of Cockburn Street to the Royal Mile, exiting opposite St Giles Cathedral close to the Supreme Court of Scotland. Viewing from the Royal Mile down the close it frames a classic and iconic view of the Scott Monument. History 16th century doorway, Advocates Close 1870 drawing of the Lord Advocates house at the foot of Advocates Close The street dates from at least the 15th century, and elements survive from at least the mid-16th century. At this time the street was a fashionable address, where the Scottish gentry and professionals would live with their family and servants. The name derives from the house of Sir James Stewart who was Lord Advocate of Scotland. Adam Bothwell's house stands on the west side of the close and was originally accessed from Byers Close. By the 19th century the Edinburgh gentry had abandoned the Old Town and moved to the New Town or suburbs. Streets such as Advocates Close passed to the lower classes and were split into tenements. In this form, given the huge density and dark, narrow streets, the area quickly became a slum. A major part of this stemmed from the lack of sewerage, with waste being thrown out of the window to run down the steep slope. The main non-residential building in the 19th century was the Imperial Hotel, which stood at the lower end on the site of the Lord Advocate's house. This site was redeveloped several times: next as offices for the Edinburgh Evening News then as the main office for the Edinburgh Festival. The iconic framed view of the Scott Monument from the top of Advocates Close A number of 16th century buildings survive on the east side of the close. In the 1920s, as a result of slum clearance programmes, most of the buildings on the west side of the close were removed. This demolition retained various carved doorways but moved them together, where they now stand in a mutually impossible relationship for each to be used. The demolitions created a new view of the Scott Monument, which stands slightly off axis to the close. The bronze plaque at the head of the close was added in 1935 by the City Architect, Ebenezer James MacRae. The first renewal of interest in the street (other than as a viewpoint) was in 1993 when the newly created Old Town Conservation Committee chose to site their office in the oldest remaining building: at the head of the close on its east side. This involved a wholesale restoration of the building, revealing a large 16th century fireplace within and several painted ceilings. This block lost its top two floors in the slum clearance of the 1920s. Old Town News June 1993 A doorpiece slightly further down the close echoes the fireplace design. Redevelopment Roxburgh Court viewing down Warriston Close including the greatly rebuilt and extended building on the close - part of the award winning Advocates Close scheme The scope of the scheme, although centred on Advocates Close, ran from Warriston Close to Byers Close/Evening News Steps, and from Market Street to the Royal Mile: one of the largest development sites ever in the Old Town, therefore highly sensitive. The City of Edinburgh Council sold a large section of its former offices early in the 21st century, stretching along the length of Advocates Close. These ran from Market Street to the Royal Mile. In order to control the sensitive suite (which was expected to go to multiple developers) a rigid but generous development brief was created, with multiple urban design objectives: retaining the view of Scott Monument: retaining all closes and re-opening closed closes; creating a new square at Roxburgh Court; and adding missing storeys. A mix of modern and traditional forms was encouraged. The buildings on the Royal Mile were converted first, including reopening of the long-closed Roxburgh Close. The Royal Mile section is so authentic that it is frequently forgotten that the entire ground floor is new. It is often forgotten that this was part of the redevelopment. The section of the site between Roxburgh Close and Warriston Close was previously the huge publishing works of W & R Chambers.1877 Ordnance Survey The bulk of the lower buildings were originally obtained by a local company, Station Properties. A scheme was drawn up for redevelopment, mainly as flats, by Morgan McDonnell architects. Unfortunately, as a result of the banking scares at the end of 2008, despite being close to completion, the original developer was declared bankrupt and the scheme was relaunched under new ownership. The development brief for the site required a new pedestrian link between the Evening News Steps and the centre of Advocates Close. It clarified which buildings had to be preserved, whilst allowing generous new-build, especially above the existing structures.City of Edinburgh Council: Development Brief The resultant mix of old and new is highly respectful of Edinburgh's historic character, whilst creating a vibrant new scheme of hotels, offices and bars.Scotsman (newspaper) 15 December 2015 At the centre of the redevelopment (topographically rather than conceptually) lies the bar, the \\"Devil's Advocate\\", converted from the 19th century boilerhouse which served the buildings to north and east. The northern part of the site is mainly occupied by a hotel operated by Motel One. The zone to the south and east includes a new restaurant, Angels with Bagpipes, which was part of the development brief site, but developed by a separate architect. This overlooks Roxburgh Court to the east, which is the area of most change in the development as a whole. Here the planner co-ordinated different architects and developers to create a vibrant new square, connecting to Warriston Close. Arguably the most dramatic change is the re-addition of two floors and a pitched roof on the Warriston Close building. This presents a new stone gable to Princes Street. On the courtyard side the architecture echoes the forms of the past but is 100% new. The development won several awards including RIAS Andrew Doolan Best Building in Scotland Award for 2014,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-29917930 and due to the high planning input of the Planning function of City of Edinburgh it won the RTPI's Best Development on the Ground 2014.https://blogs.gov.scot/planning- architecture/wp.../7/.../SAQP-Award-Winners.docx It also won the RICS award of 2015.https://www.scottishconstructionnow.com/article/advocates-close-scoops- top-prize-at-rics-awards-2015 Famous Residents *Andrew Crosbie FRSE (advocate) *Sir James Stewart (Lord Advocate) *David Dalrymple, Lord Westhall *Adam Bothwell son of Francis Bothwell *John Scougal, artist References Category:New Town, Edinburgh Category:Streets in Edinburgh Category:Tourist attractions in Edinburgh ","title":"Advocates Close"},{"id":"61107030","text":"Franklin (Lynn) M.

It is one of the city's most recognizable landmarks, the most important Christian temple alongside the Cathedral and the finest example of Baroque architecture in Poland. The full name of the Church is Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, Mary Magdalene and Saint Stanislaus. It is currently part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Pozna≈Ñ. Built between 1651 and 1701, the structure was engineered by Polish and Italian masters in the Baroque style, who also incorporated Roman architectural aspects such as the monumental Corinthian columns in the interior. In the mid-18th century Pompeo Ferrari designed the main altar standing at 17 meters in height and the main entrance from the Old Town. In 1876 an organ constructed by Friedrich Ladegast was installed inside the Church. The Fara, like most of the city, was spared from destruction during World War II. History In 1570 Bishop Adam Konarski brought the Jesuits to Pozna≈Ñ, who were given permission to occupy the former Church of Saint Stanislaus.https://www.przewodnik- katolicki.pl/Archiwum/2006/Przewodnik-Katolicki-18-2006/Archidiecezja- Poznanska/Prastara-fara In 1651, the construction of a new temple began and the plans of which were probably sent from Rome (traditionally the author of the project was Bart≈Çomiej Nataniel WƒÖsowski - rector of the Jesuit College in Pozna≈Ñ and theoretician of architecture). Initial work (until 1652) was directed by Italian-born Tomasz Poncino. The Swedish Deluge (1655-1660) suspended the work. In 1705, the Fara was consecrated, despite the Church being incomplete. In the years 1727-1732 Pompeo Ferrari remodelled the main entry and the interior, thus bringing the final phase of construction to an end. Following the 1773 fire and the 1780 collapse of the nearby Mary Magdalene Collegiate Church, the Fara became the new seat of the Pozna≈Ñ clergy. In 1913 the whole complex was renovated; the work was cut short by World War I. During the Invasion of Poland and World War II, the Fara was spared but stripped of its rich ornaments and turned into a warehouse by the Wehrmacht. War damage was cleared by 1950. Legend According to a popular legend, a woman in black appears on the hardly-accessible organ balcony. The ghost was sighted on many occasions, which was often featured in media and news coverage. The woman is said to have donated a large sum to purchase the organ in the 1870s and is guarding the instrument.

In five first-class appearances, he scored 31 runs and took 4 wickets. After graduating he returned to Australia and joined the firm Strachan, Murray, and Shannon at Geelong. Following the death of his father, he resigned from the firm to oversee the running of the Marion Downs Station in western Queensland. He later became involved in the running of the Wyangarie Estate in northern New South Wales, where he subdivided the farm into dairy farms that today form the rich dairying area around Kyogle. He also helped to maintain the family venture at Tintaldra Station in Victoria. He served on the council of the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria and was president of the Melbourne Club in 1938.

Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed in the Gentlemen of England's first-innings for 10 runs by Lionel Palairet, while in their second-innings he was dismissed for 21 runs by Percy Farrant. Having played for Hong Kong in the interport match against Shanghai in February 1892, he was unable to fulfil the return October fixture in Shanghai. His unavailability likely saved his life, as the transporting the Hong Kong team to Shanghai sunk, resulting in the deaths of all but two members of the Hong Kong team. Coxon later died in France at Neuilly-sur-Seine in April 1924.

The experiment, which established that objects of identical size and different mass fall at the same speed, was conducted by dropping lead balls from the Nieuwe Kerk in the Dutch city of Delft. The experiment is considered a foundational moment in the history of statics, which Stevin's work helped to codify.  History  In the late 16th century, increasing interest in physics resulted in a number European scientists conducting experiments into the intricacies of the scientific field. Many of these experiments were‚Äîdirectly or indirectly‚Äîpresenting a challenge to the laws of physics formulated by Aristotle, whose theory was then the dominant school of thought in Europe. While most contemporaneous scientific experimentation was undertaken by Italian scholars, by the 1580s new ideas on physics had proliferated to the rest of Europe.Asimov, Isaac (1964). Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology. One of the European scientists to embrace the new view of physics was Simon Stevin, a Flemish engineer and mathematician. Stevin was employed as a military adviser for the court of William the Silent, and as such resided in the city of Delft while William's government occupied the citySarton, George (1934). \\"Simon Stevin of Bruges (1548-1620)\\". Isis. 21 (2): 241‚Äì303. ; one of Stevin's main benefactors was Maurice, Prince of Orange, whose patronage allowed Stevin to further his scientific interests. While Stevin's primary concern at court was the design of defensive fortifications, he also took interest in fluid dynamics, designing a series of improvements for Delft's windmills. To gain permission to tinker with Delft's mills, Stevin employed the services of Jan Cornets de Groot, a local lawyer and future father of legal scholar Hugo de Groot. The elder de Groot and Stevin became friends, with the former eventually investing in several new mills built using Stevin's design. In 1586 Stevin and de Groot collaborated to perform an experiment intended to challenge Aristotle's theory that objects fall at a speed directly proportional to their mass. To conduct their experiment, the two carried a pair of identically-sized lead balls up the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft before dropping them onto a wooden platform 30 feet below; of the pair, one ball was ten times heavier than the other. When the balls were dropped, both spheres hit the wooden platform below at substantively the same time, indicating that objects of the same size fall at the same speed regardless of mass. Stevin concluded that Aristotle's theory was therefore incorrect. While the Delft tower experiment had been a success, it was not conducted with the same scientific rigor that later experiments were; Stevin lacked an instrument to accurately measure the speed of the falling spheres, and was forced to rely on audio feedback (caused by the spheres impacting the wooden platform below) and eyewitness accounts to deduce that the balls had fallen at the same speed. As such, the experiment staged at the Nieuwe Kerk was given less credence than similar experiments, namely the more substantive work of Galileo Galilei and his famous thought experiment at the Leaning Tower of Pisa in 1589. Stevin published his findings in his 1586 work De Beghinselen Der Weeghconst‚Äîtranslatable to The Principles of Statics & The Principles of the Art of Weighing. Stevin and de Groot's experiment is‚Äîalong with those of their Italian contemporaries‚Äîconsidered to be one of the foundational experiments in the history of modern statics.

It is a part of the Affinity product line along with Affinity Photo and Affinity Designer.  Overview  Affinity Publisher serves as a successor to Serif's own PagePlus software, which the company discontinued in August 2017 in order to focus on the Affinity product range. It has been described as an alternative to Adobe InDesign, due to its primary focus on desktop publishing workflows for both printed and online media, including common features from this industry, such as master pages, OpenType support, linked text frames, and end-to-end support for the CMYK color model. Affinity Publisher includes StudioLink technology, developed by Serif, which allows owners of Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo to use the vector and raster graphic editing functionality of those applications for editing content directly within Publisher (in addition to its own, smaller set of native vector and raster editing features). = File format support = File formats supported by Affinity Publisher (in addition to the Affinity suite's native file format) include Adobe InDesign Markup Language (IDML), Adobe Photoshop PSD, Adobe Illustrator AI, PDF, JPG, TIFF, PNG, and EPS, with export functionality for the PDF/X-1a, PDF/X-3, PDF/X-4 standards of the PDF/X file format. The iPadOS editions of Affinity Photo and Designer also include support for Affinity Publisher files.  Development  The first promotional video for Affinity Publisher was shown by Serif in December 2017, demonstrating features such as the drag & drop functionality, and text flow between frames. A free public beta of the software was made available for both macOS and Windows on August 30, 2018. The first full version of Publisher (using the 1.7 version number, to align with other Affinity products) was first released on June 19, 2019, in conjunction with Serif's 2019 'Affinity Live' event, during which the company also announced the StudioLink integration features for the first time. Publisher was made available for purchase directly from Serif's website and also available from the Mac App Store and Microsoft Store. Publisher was updated to version 1.8 in February 2020, introducing support for importing Adobe InDesign's IMDL file format. Serif have stated that an iPadOS version of the software is planned for release in 2020.  Reception  Affinity Publisher received generally favorable reviews following its initial release in 2019, with the application's range of features, its StudioLink integration with Affinity Designer/Photo, and non-subscription pricing model commonly cited as positive areas. Limitations noted by reviewers of the initial release included its lack of support for InDesign's document (INDD) & markup (IDML) files (although Serif added IMDL support in February 2020), for footnotes & endnotes, and for GREP-based styles & nested styles. Many reviews drew comparisons between Publisher and InDesign, often noting that Publisher's first release did not have all of the features required to serve as a full replacement; however, CreativePro also acknowledged it as having additional tools that are not present in InDesign or other desktop publishing applications. In December 2019, Apple named Publisher the ‚ÄúMac App of the Year‚Äù.

He is best known as the scribe and assistant cameraman for the 1955-1956 Oxford and Cambridge Far Eastern Expedition from London to Singapore. Graduating from Cambridge University with a degree in Geography, he joined the BBC in 1957 and for more than 30 years worked with the BBC making documentaries all over the world, receiving a Peabody award. Slessor ended his BBC career as deputy head of its features documentary department and subsequently turned to freelance work ‚Äì writing for various magazines and producing for National Geographic. His filmography includes, as Producer and Director, \\"Australia\\", \\"Looking at Britain\\", and \\"Looking at the United States\\". At the age of 87, Tim and others in one of the original Land Rovers, are re-creating the first London to Singapore trip by doing it in reverse; they are starting from Singapore on August 25, 2019 on a trip called the Last Overland. Biography =Early life and education= Tim Slessor was born in England in 1931. His father was an officer in the Royal Navy's Air Arm; consequently Tim spent most of his pre-war boyhood in Malta ‚Äì the then home- base of the RN's Mediterranean fleet. But in June, 1940, when his father (along with over 1,500 others) was lost in the sinking of the carrier, HMS Glorious and her two escorting destroyers, his mother took him back to her home country of Australia. In late 1945, with the War over, he and his mother eventually returned to the UK. Tim attended Cambridge University in 1952, and graduated in 1955 with a degree in Geography. =Military= At 18, after completing a middle-class education, Tim chose to do his military service in the Navy, specifically in the Royal Marines Commandos. After a year he was commissioned as a Lieutenant, and then posted to an active service unit in Malaya ‚Äì fighting communist terrorists. =Oxford and Cambridge Far Eastern Expedition= During his last year at Cambridge, he and a friend put together a six-man expedition; they aimed to become the first people to drive all-the- way-overland (in two early Land Rovers) from Europe to Singapore. A number of people had already tried ‚Äì and failed. From 1955-1956 after a long and difficult journey of 12,000 miles, the Cambridge crew succeeded. Their films were later shown on both the BBC-TV and NBC. And Tim's book, ‚ÄúFirst Overland‚Äù, is still, after 63 years, in print. =BBC, PBS, and Nebraska= In 1957, he joined the BBC as a documentary trainee. In subsequent years, as he became more experienced (and a presenter/director) he travelled the world and won several awards both in the UK and US, including a citation from the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma for a five part-series on the American West. In 1965 he quit the BBC. and migrated with his wife and their two small children to Chadron, Nebraska. He taught English and Journalism. Later, the family moved east to Syracuse, NY where, for two years, he worked for the local PBS station (WCNY-TV). The family returned to the UK; Tim went back to the BBC where he joined a team making a 13-part documentary series about the UK ‚Äì shot entirely from a helicopter. Later he made the BBC's five- part tribute to Australia on the occasion of that country's bi-centenary (1788-1988). He also became a specialist on documentaries about the US; amongst many other assignments in those parts, he worked on Alistair Cooke's 13-part NBC/BBC series about the history of the US. He eventually wound up in a largely administrative/executive role as the number two in the BBC's general documentary department. He retired in 1990 =After the BBC= He retired from the BBC in 1990, and produced more documentaries‚Äîfilming from the Himalayas to the Arctic, and Australia to the Africa. Since then he has written two more books. The first, ‚ÄúLying in State‚Äù, is a heavily researched polemic questioning Britain's Ministry of Defense for a series of nine ‚Äúofficial‚Äù cover-ups and deceptions ‚Äì ranging, for example, from the 20-year denial of Gulf-War Syndrome to the true circumstances behind the loss of his father's ship back in 1940. His other book, ‚ÄúOut West‚Äù, continues his fascination with the many veined story of the American West. He perioidically travels back to Nebraska and Wyoming. =The Last Overland= In 2017 Tim, his grand son Nat George, Alex Bescoby, Leo Belanger, David Israeli, Therese-Marie Becker, Larry Leong, Silverius Purba and Marcus Allender planned a reverse trip of the original 1955-1956 expedition. Tim Slessor was originally planning to drive, but on the first day of the trip he developed medical issues and was not able to proceed. On August 25, 2019, the team and three Land Rovers, including one of the original vehicles (named by the first expedition the \\"Oxford\\") set off from Singapore to London. After 111 days the team made it to London. Bibliography # First published 1957 by George Harrap &Co.;, Ltd.

She investigated the role of hormones in pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoporosis.  Early life and education  Barrett-Connor was born in Evanston, Illinois. She was the only child of Florence Hershey and William Barrett. Her father was a chemical engineer, and working in ammunition companies. She grew up in Lee, Massachusetts, and learned to read with her grandmother, who was a postal worker. As a child she saw Leonard Bernstein in orchestra and attended the Northfield Preparatory School. Barrett-Connor studied zoology at Mount Holyoke College and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. She graduated in 1956.https://profiles.ucsd.edu/elizabeth.barrett-connor In 1960 she earned her medical degree at Cornell University, before completing her internal medicine residency at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Her early work studied the diarrhea of United States students in Mexico. Barrett-Connor was a National Institutes of Health postdoctoral researcher at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. She earned a diploma in the Clinical Medicine of the Tropics at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in 1965. She moved to the University of Miami as an infectious disease epidemiologist.  Research and career  Barrett-Connor specialised in healthy ageing and women's health. In particular, she championed studying cardiovascular disease in women as well as men. She was recruited to the faculty at the University of California, San Diego in 1972. In 1972 Barrett- Connor founded the Rancho Bernardo Heart and Chronic Disease Study (RBS), which involved over 6,000 people in Rancho Bernardo, San Diego. For the study, Barrett-Connor recruited people from Rancho Bernardo, and studied the connection between lipids and heart disease. She managed to recruit almost 70% of the Rancho Bernardo population. She selected the area as it was reported as having a healthy population. She has collected data for over forty years, including frozen blood samples, and transcends changes in lifestyle and cholesterol. She investigated how family history, fat distribution, cholesterol, physical activity and cigarette smoking impact chronic diseases. Barrett-Connor used the RBS to study sex differences in cardiovascular disease. As of 2011, one third of the participants still reported on their health, and half still have health tests at the Bernado Center Drive Clinic. Barrett-Connor identified many aspects of women's health, including that women with diabetes have a high triglyceride and that diabetes eliminates women's protection against cardiovascular disease. It included innovative techniques to assess bone density, demonstrating that low calcium can result in hip fracture. She also showed that smoking during middle age can result in osteoporosis, and that drinking coffee can result in low bone mineral density. Alongside RBS, Barrett-Connor led the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study. She was also interested in overlooked issues in men's health, including osteoporosis, and was involved with the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study and Testosterone Trials. In 1971 Barrett-Cohen established the UCSD Epidemiology and Biostatistics Course. Her approach to storing blood samples to investigate new hypotheses at a later date was adopted by the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition and the UK Biobank study. = Awards and honours = * 1986 American College of Preventive Medicine Boucot Sturgis Lecture * 1987 American Diabetes Association Kelly West Memorial Lecture * 1994 American College of Physicians James D.

The family flourished in the 14th century. The family was of humble origins, but managed to raise its status through military service and advantageous marriages. Although originally Greek Orthodox by confession, two prominent members became Roman Catholics. The name is derived from the tagarion (œÑŒ±Œ≥Œ¨œÅŒπŒøŒΩ), a unit of dry measure, equal to about one eighth of a modios or five Roman pounds (1.6 kg). The first known Tagaris was George, mentioned by Manuel Philes in a poem. He probably lived in the early 14th century. The first prominent member of the family was Manuel Tagaris, who rose to the rank of megas stratopedarches and was governor of Philadelphia in 1309‚Äì27. He made two important marriages. His first marriage was to a woman of the houses of Doukas and Monomachos. Through his second marriage to Theodora, daughter of Tsar John III of Bulgaria and Irene, daughter of the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII, he related himself to the ruling Asanid and Palaiologos families. Manuel had at least one son, George, who rose to the same rank as his father. George is recorded as having a niece who married a Monomachos. He may also have retained his father's close connection with Philadelphia. Another Tagaris, Paul Palaiologos Tagaris, may have been a son of either Manuel or George, but although he took the Palaiologos name, it is unclear if he was related to Theodora. Manuel also had at least one daughter by his first wife; she married a Tarchaneiotes. During the civil wars of the 14th century, the Tagaris family were loyalists. Manuel supported the reigning emperor against his upstart grandson during the civil war of 1321‚Äì1328 and George supported the Emperor John V Palaiologos against the rebel John Kantakouzenos during the civil war of 1341‚Äì1347. On foreign policy the family favoured close ties with the Catholic powers of the West. George seems to have converted to Catholicism late in life. His brother Paul was a Catholic prelate for a time. The last mention of the family is in 1400, when Anna Laskarina Tagarina brought a lawsuit before the court of the Patriarch of Constantinople. The family probably died out soon after.

He was moved to the Milwaukee County Zoo in 1959, and quickly became the main attraction. Samson was one of the largest gorillas in captivity. Main Attraction Samson was the main attraction for the Washington Park Zoo in Milwaukee from the moment he arrived. The Zoo celebrated his fifth birthday with soda and a cake in front of his cage. Samson attracted huge crowds that came to see him in his tiled stall every day. He appeared on television, in magazines and even on a Milwaukee bus pass. Because of Samson's isolation, glass pounding, and expressions: people saw him as sad, bored and lonely. His poor living conditions also seemed to contribute to that belief.

The plot revolves around Riley (Laura Bilgeri) who has transferred to a new high school where her father is working as an English teacher. Riley initially has a hard time finding new friends, but eventually meets Kyla (Lucy Loken) and they become close friends. It turns out, though, that Kyla is obsessed with Riley's father.  Plot  Riley is a high school senior starting her first day at a new school along with her father, Chris, the school's newest english teacher. During his first lesson, Chris catches the attention of both Tricia, a popular girl, and Kyla, the school's yearbook photographer. After class, Kyla befriends Riley, who reveals she is Chris's daughter, and asks to come over to her house for a study session. At her house, Riley tells Kyla about her mother's infidelity which led to her parents' divorce. That night, Kyla dreams of Chris and becomes infatuated with him. The next day, Tricia befriends Riley, infuriating Kyla. She warns Riley that Tricia is dangerous and claims she has a history of messing around with teachers, as she had slept with a history teacher the prior year. Later that night, Kyla's mother, Jess, is preparing for a date, which is revealed to be Chris. As she watches them flirt, Kyla grows jealous and sabotages their date, forcing Chris to spend the night, and allowing Kyla to get closer to him. The following morning at school, Kyla confronts Riley about going out with Tricia despite her warning, and tells her she's being used by Tricia to get to her father. Riley tells her that Tricia claims it wasn't her who had slept with their history teacher, but Kyla herself. Kyla denies the accusation and Riley leaves. Later, Kyla confronts Tricia, threatening her to leave Riley alone, but Tricia refuses to back down. The next day, Kyla, having filled her locker with lewd photos she had taken of herself the night before, tells Chris she is being harassed, and he promises to help find whoever is responsible. Kyla and Riley eventually make amends, and Kyla confesses to having slept with her history teacher, claiming he had manipulated her. Later that night as Chris and Jess prepare for a date, Kyla, posing as Tricia, sends sexually suggestive messages to Chris's phone. Jess, believing Chris is having sex with one of his students, throws him out. As Chris sits in his truck, Kyla enters and seduces him into kissing her. The following day, police arrive and take Tricia away, having found the phone used to text Chris the sexually suggestive messages, as well as containing the lewd photos of Kyla, in her locker. That night at Riley's birthday party, Kyla enters Chris' office at his home and seduces him into having sex. Riley discovers them, and runs away distraught. The next morning Jess confronts Chris, having been told everything by Riley. As she takes Kyla away, Kyla denies any wrongdoing, as she is of legal age and claims Chris and her are in love. Chris apologizes to Riley and tells her he will not see Kyla anymore, and Riley forgives him. The next day, Kyla calls Tricia and asks to meet her before school. When Tricia arrives, Kyla admits to framing her, and harms herself by breaking her fingers. As Riley and Chris arrive, Kyla cries for help, claiming Tricia attacked her. Tricia is arrested and Kyla goes to the hospital. There, Riley tells Kyla her relationship with her father is over, and Kyla appears to agree. She asks Riley to take over her yearbook responsibilities for a basketball game that night, which Riley reluctantly accepts. When Riley leaves, Kyla tells Chris they can finally be together with Tricia gone, but Chris denies her, telling her their relationship is over and to leave him alone. Kyla declares she will never leave Chris, and reminds him he will have to see her everyday in class. Chris decides to quit his job to get away from her, and leaves to gather his belongings from the classroom. Kyla takes a scalpel from the hospital and flees. At the school, Kyla confronts Riley, declaring only one of them can be in Chris's life, and stabs her in the stomach. Making her way to Chris's class, she holds the scalpel to his throat, telling him they are meant to be together, and also revealing she was the one that had manipulated her previous teacher, not vice versa. Chris pushes Kyla off him, but she trips him, causing him to hit his head, rendering him unconscious. A janitor hears the commotion, and stumbles upon Kyla, who pretends to be injured and asks him to get help. As the janitor runs to find assistance, Riley, alive but badly wounded, warns him to run, but Kyla stabs and kills him. The two begin to fight, and Riley eventually beats Kyla into submission. As police arrive, both Riley and Kyla are taken away in separate ambulances. Some time later, Riley is leaving for her first day of college. As she says goodbye to her father, unseen by either of them, a hooded figure watches them from afar.

Invasion of China (1934)  In 1934, Ma Zhongying's troops, supported by the Kuomintang government of the Republic of China were on the verge of defeating the Soviet client Sheng Shicai during the Battle of √úr√ºmqi (1933‚Äì34) in the Kumul Rebellion. Ma Zhongying, a Hui (Chinese Muslim), had earlier attended the Whampoa Military Academy in Nanjing in 1929, when it was run by Chiang Kai-shek, who was also the head of the Kuomintang and leader of China.[4][5] Ma Zhongying then was sent back to Gansu after graduating from the academy and fought in the Kumul Rebellion where, with the tacit support of the Kuomintang government of China, he tried to overthrow the pro-Soviet provincial government first led by Governor Jin Shuren then Sheng Shicai. Ma invaded Xinjiang in support of Kumul Khanate loyalists and received official approval and designation from the Kuomintang as the 36th Division. In late 1933, the Han Chinese provincial commander General Zhang Peiyuan and his army defected from the provincial government side to Ma Zhongying's side and joined him in waging war against Jin Shuren's provincial government. In 1934, two brigades of about 7,000 Soviet GPU troops, backed by tanks, airplanes and artillery with mustard gas, crossed the border to assist Sheng Shicai in gaining control of Xinjiang. The brigades were named \\"Altayiiskii\\" and \\"Tarbakhataiskii\\".[6] Sheng's Manchurian army was being severely beaten by an alliance of the Han Chinese army led by general Zhang Peiyuan, and the 36th Division led by Ma Zhongying.[7] Ma fought under the banner of the Kuomintang Republic of China government. The joint Soviet-White Russian force was called \\"The Altai Volunteers\\". Soviet soldiers disguised themselves in uniforms lacking markings, and were dispersed among the White Russians.[8] Despite his early successes, Zhang's forces were overrun at Kulja and Chuguchak, and he committed suicide after the battle at Muzart Pass to avoid capture. Even though the Soviets were superior to the 36th Division in both manpower and technology, they were held off for weeks and took severe casualties. The 36th Division managed to halt the Soviet forces from supplying Sheng with military equipment. Chinese Muslim troops led by Ma Shih-ming managed to hold off the superior Red Army forces armed with machine guns, tanks, and planes for about 30 days.[9] When reports that the Chinese forces had defeated and killed the Soviets reached Chinese prisoners in √úr√ºmqi, they were reportedly so jubilant that they jumped around in their cells.[10] Ma Hushan, Deputy Divisional Commander of the 36th division, became well known for victories over Russian forces during the invasion.[11] At this point, Chiang Kai-shek was ready to send Huang Shaohong and his expeditionary force which he assembled to assist Ma Zhongying against Sheng, but when Chiang heard about the Soviet invasion, he decided to withdraw to avoid an international incident if his troops directly engaged the Soviets.[12]  Winter War (1939-40)  Soviet alt=A Soviet light tank, seen from its left side, is described by the Finnish photographer as advancing aggressively in the snowy forested landscape during the Battle of Kollaa. On 30 November 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland, three months after the outbreak of World War II, and ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the organisation. The conflict began after the Soviets sought to obtain some Finnish territory, demanding among other concessions that Finland cede substantial border territories in exchange for land elsewhere, claiming security reasons‚Äîprimarily the protection of Leningrad, 32 km (20 mi) from the Finnish border. Finland refused, so the USSR invaded the country. Many sources conclude that the Soviet Union had intended to conquer all of Finland, and use the establishment of the puppet Finnish Communist government and the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact's secret protocols as evidence of this,[F 8] while other sources argue against the idea of the full Soviet conquest.[F 9] Finland repelled Soviet attacks for more than two months and inflicted substantial losses on the invaders while temperatures ranged as low as ‚àí43 ¬∞C (‚àí45 ¬∞F). After the Soviet military reorganised and adopted different tactics, they renewed their offensive in February and overcame Finnish defences. Hostilities ceased in March 1940 with the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty. Finland ceded 11 percent of its territory representing 30 percent of its economy to the Soviet Union. Soviet losses were heavy, and the country's international reputation suffered. Soviet gains exceeded their pre- war demands and the USSR received substantial territory along Lake Ladoga and in northern Finland. Finland retained its sovereignty and enhanced its international reputation. The poor performance of the Red Army encouraged Adolf Hitler to think that an attack on the Soviet Union would be successful and confirmed negative Western opinions of the Soviet military. After 15 months of Interim Peace, in June 1941, Nazi Germany commenced Operation Barbarossa and the Continuation War between Finland and the USSR began.  World War II (1939-45)  A Soviet T-26 light tank and its crew in Tabriz, Iran. The Soviet Union policy during World War II was neutrality until August 1939, followed by friendly relations with Germany in order to carve up Eastern Europe. The USSR helped supply oil and munitions to Germany as its armies rolled across Western Europe in May‚ÄìJune 1940. Despite repeated warnings, Stalin refused to believe that Hitler was planning an all-out war on the USSR. Stalin was stunned and temporarily helpless when Hitler invaded in June 1941. Stalin quickly came to terms with Britain and the United States, cemented through a series of summit meetings. The U.S. and Britain supplied war materials in large quantity through Lend Lease.

The invasion began on 9 August 1945, exactly three months after the German surrender on 8 May (9 May, 0:43 Moscow time). Although the commencement of the invasion fell between the American atomic bombing of Hiroshima, on 6 August, and only hours before the Nagasaki bombing on 9 August, the timing of the invasion had been planned well in advance and was determined by the timing of the agreements at Tehran and Yalta, the long-term buildup of Soviet forces in the Far East since Tehran, and the date of the German surrender some three months earlier; on 3 August, Marshal Vasilevsky reported to Premier Joseph Stalin that, if necessary, he could attack on the morning of 5 August. At 11pm Trans-Baikal (UTC+10) time on 8 August 1945, Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov informed Japanese ambassador Naotake Sat≈ç that the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan, and that from 9 August the Soviet government would consider itself to be at war with Japan.\\"Soviet Declaration of War on Japan\\", 8 August 1945.

The Soviets claimed 510 UN aircraft shot down in just the first year of the war and a total of 1,300 during the entire war while losing only 345 of their own. = Hungarian Revolution of 1956 = Soviet T-54 tanks in Budapest on 31 October After Stalinist Hungarian dictator M√°ty√°s R√°kosi was replaced by Imre Nagy following Stalin's death[44][not in citation given] and Polish reformist W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka was able to enact some reformist requests,[45] large numbers of protesting Hungarians compiled a list of demands,[46] including free secret-ballot elections, independent tribunals, and inquiries into Stalin and R√°kosi Hungarian activities. Under the orders of Soviet defense minister Georgy Zhukov, Soviet tanks entered Budapest.[47] Protester attacks at the Parliament forced the collapse of the Soviet-backed government.[48] The new government that came to power during the revolution formally disbanded the Hungarian secret police, declared its intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact and pledged to re-establish free elections. The Soviet Politburo thereafter moved to crush the revolution with a large Soviet force invading Budapest and other regions of the country.[49]Approximately 200,000 Hungarians fled Hungary,[50] some 26,000 Hungarians were put on trial by the new Soviet-installed J√°nos K√°d√°r government and, of those, 13,000 were imprisoned.[51] Imre Nagy was executed, along with P√°l Mal√©ter and Mikl√≥s Gimes, after secret trials in June 1958. By January 1957, the Hungarian government had suppressed all public opposition. These Hungarian government's violent oppressive actions alienated many Western Marxists, yet strengthened communist control in all the European communist states, cultivating the perception that communism was both irreversible and monolithic. = Invasion of Czechoslovakia (1968) = national flag past a burning Soviet tank in Prague. A period of political liberalization took place in 1968 in Eastern Bloc country Czechoslovakia called the Prague Spring. The event was spurred by several events, including economic reforms that addressed an early 1960s economic downturn. In April, Czechoslovakian leader Alexander Dubƒçek launched an \\"Action Program\\" of liberalizations, which included increasing freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of movement, along with an economic emphasis on consumer goods, the possibility of a multiparty government and limiting the power of the secret police.Ello (ed.), Paul (April 1968). Control Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, \\"Action Plan of the (Prague, April 1968)\\" in Dubcek's Blueprint for Freedom: His original documents leading to the invasion of Czechoslovakia. William Kimber & Co. 1968, pp 32, 54 Initial reaction within the Eastern Bloc was mixed, with Hungary's J√°nos K√°d√°r expressing support, while Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and others grew concerned about Dubƒçek's reforms, which they feared might weaken the Eastern Bloc's position during the Cold War. On 3 August, representatives from the Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia met in Bratislava and signed the Bratislava Declaration, which declaration affirmed unshakable fidelity to Marxism- Leninism and proletarian internationalism and declared an implacable struggle against \\"bourgeois\\" ideology and all \\"anti-socialist\\" forces. On the night of 20‚Äì21 August 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from four Warsaw Pact countries ‚Äì the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary ‚Äì invaded Czechoslovakia. The invasion comported with the Brezhnev Doctrine, a policy of compelling Eastern Bloc states to subordinate national interests to those of the Bloc as a whole and the exercise of a Soviet right to intervene if an Eastern Bloc country appeared to shift towards capitalism. The invasion was followed by a wave of emigration, including an estimated 70,000 Czechs initially fleeing, with the total eventually reaching 300,000. In April 1969, Dubƒçek was replaced as first secretary by Gust√°v Hus√°k, and a period of \\"normalization\\" began. Hus√°k reversed Dubƒçek's reforms, purged the party of liberal members, dismissed opponents from public office, reinstated the power of the police authorities, sought to re-centralize the economy and re-instated the disallowance of political commentary in mainstream media and by persons not considered to have \\"full political trust\\". The international image of the Soviet Union suffered considerably, especially among Western student movements inspired by the \\"New Left\\" and non-Aligned Movement states. Mao Zedong's People's Republic of China, for example, condemned both the Soviets and the Americans as imperialists. = Other wars = Soviet \\"military advisors\\" played an important role in at least four wars: * The Angolan Civil War (1975‚Äì92), where the USSR supported the left-wing MPLA; * The Mozambican Civil War (1977‚Äì92), where Moscow also sided with Socialist government; * The Ogaden War between Ethiopia and Somalia (1977‚Äì78). * War of Attrition between Arab countries and Israel. * Vietnam War between North Vietnam, and South Vietnam and USA. * Congo Crisis, where USSR backed Republic of the Congo against Katanga Province. * Operation Trikora : The Indonesian operation to seize Netherlands New Guinea was backed by Soviet troops manning submarines. = Invasion of Afghanistan (1979-89) = Soviet infantry at the time of deployment During a 1978 coup d' √©tat in Afghanistan, where the communist party took power, it started a series of radical modernization reforms throughout the country that were forced and deeply unpopular, particularly among the more traditional rural population and the established traditional power structures.[37] The regime's nature[38] of vigorously suppressing opposition, including executing thousands of political prisoners, led to the rise of anti-government armed groups, and by April 1979 large parts of the country were in open rebellion.[39] The ruling party itself experienced deep rivalries, and in September 1979 the President, Nur Mohammad Taraki, was murdered under orders of the second-in-command, Hafizullah Amin, which soured relations with the Soviet Union. Eventually the Soviet government, under leader Leonid Brezhnev, decided to deploy the 40th Army on 24 December 1979.[40] Arriving in the capital of Kabul, they staged a coup,[41] killing president Amin and installing Soviet loyalist Babrak Karmal from a rival faction.[39] The deployment had been variously called an \\"invasion\\" (by Western media and the rebels) or a legitimate supporting intervention (by the Soviet Union and the Afghan government)[42][43] on the basis of the Brezhnev Doctrine. In January 1980, foreign ministers from 34 nations of the Islamic Conference adopted a resolution demanding \\"the immediate, urgent and unconditional withdrawal of Soviet troops\\" from Afghanistan.[44] The UN General Assembly passed a resolution protesting the Soviet intervention by a vote of 104 (for) to 18 (against), with 18 abstentions and 12 members of the 152-nation Assembly absent or not participating in the vote;[44][45] only Soviet allies Angola, East Germany and Vietnam, along with India, supported the intervention.[46] Afghan insurgents began to receive massive amounts of aid and military training in neighboring Pakistan and China,[15] paid for primarily by the United States and Arab monarchies in the Persian Gulf.[7][8][15][11][47][48][49][50]As documented by the National Security Archive, \\"the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) played a significant role in asserting U.S. influence in Afghanistan by funding military operations designed to frustrate the Soviet invasion of that country. CIA covert action worked through Pakistani intelligence services to reach Afghan rebel groups.\\"[51] Soviet troops occupied the cities and main arteries of communication, while the mujahideen waged guerrilla war in small groups operating in the almost 80 percent of the country that was outside government and Soviet control, almost exclusively being the rural countryside.[52] The Soviets used their air power to deal harshly with both rebels and civilians, levelling villages to deny safe haven to the mujahideen, destroying vital irrigation ditches, and laying millions of land mines.[53][54][55][56] The international community imposed numerous sanctions and embargoes against the Soviet Union, and the U.S. led a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow. The boycott and sanctions exacerbated Cold War tensions and enraged the Soviet government, which later led a revenge boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles.[57] The Soviets initially planned to secure towns and roads, stabilize the government under new leader Karmal, and withdraw within six months or a year. But they were met with fierce resistance from the guerillas,[58] and were stuck in a bloody war that lasted nine years.[59] By the mid-1980s, the Soviet contingent was increased to 108,800 and fighting increased, but the military and diplomatic cost of the war to the USSR was high.[9] By mid-1987 the Soviet Union, now under reformist leader Mikhail Gorbachev, announced it would start withdrawing its forces after meetings with the Afghan government.[5][6] The final troop withdrawal started on 15 May 1988, and ended on 15 February 1989, leaving government forces alone in the battle against the insurgents, which continued until 1992 when the former Soviet-backed government collapsed. Due to its length, it has sometimes been referred to as the \\"Soviet Union's Vietnam War\\" or the \\"Bear Trap\\" by the Western media.[60][61][62] The Soviets' failure in the war[63] is thought to be a contributing factor to the fall of the Soviet Union.[64]  See also  * Foreign interventions by China * Foreign interventions by Cuba * Foreign interventions by the United States * History of the Soviet Union * Proletarian internationalism * List of conflicts related to the Cold War  References  Sources  Category:Foreign relations of the Soviet Union Category:Foreign intervention ","title":"Foreign interventions by the Soviet Union"},{"id":"61107826","text":"Luise, Princess of Anhalt-Pless (n√©e Princess Maria Dorothea Henriette Luise of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck; 28 September 1783 ‚Äì 24 November 1803) was a member of the Danish royal family and, as the first wife of Frederick Ferdinand, Prince of Anhalt-Pless, the princess consort of Anhalt-Pless.

He won a qualifying heat on 27 May (at odds of 1-6) and first round on 7 June (at odds of 4-7), but lost to the new track record holder Fearless Action in the second round but still qualified. In the quarter finals he bounced back on 19 June in the quarter finals and impressed when beating Fearless Action and Lodge Prince in the semi finals two days later. In the final he ran brilliantly to win by over five lengths helped by Murlens Slippy moving off and hampering Fearless Action, kennelmate Master Hardy finished second. Tico then travelled to Shelbourne Park in an attempt to double up and win the 1986 Irish Greyhound Derby. The English champion progressed to the final which included a semi final win in 30.06 for 550 yards, just three spots off the track record. Although hot favourite for the final on 20 September he could only finish third after a poor start ruined his chances.

The principle drives the punishment for crimes to focus only on the restriction of liberty and to not deprive the sentenced offender of other rights, where feasible.  Description  The Norwegian Correctional Service describes the normality principle as follows: * The punishment is the restriction of liberty; no other rights have been removed by the sentencing court. Therefore the sentenced offender has all the same rights as all other who live in Norway. * No-one shall serve their sentence under stricter circumstances than necessary for the security in the community. Therefore offenders shall be placed in the lowest possible security regime. * During the serving of a sentence, life inside will resemble life outside as much as possible. In addition to security reasons, infrastructural and financial reasons are cited as possible reasons for further denying sentenced offenders some rights. A similar description of the principle is provided by Marianne Vollan, Director General of the Norwegian Correctional Service, in an interview.  Reception  The article Maintaining normality when serving a prison sentence in the digital society in the Croatian Medical Journal discusses the practice of the normality principle in Norway. It notes that the restrictions on Internet use and telephone use runs against the normality principle, and may prevent inmates from learning digital skills necessary to reintegrate into society. An article in The Atlantic about Scandinavian prison systems discusses the normality principle as part of its discussion of the Norwegian prison system.

The techno club belonged, besides the Tresor and E-Werk in Berlin, the Dorian Gray and Omen in Frankfurt, and the Munich-based clubs Ultraschall, Natraj Temple and Millennium, to the most renowned clubs of Germany's 1990s techno culture.  History and description  Stairway to the upper area The nightclub, which in everyday language often was just called KW or Kraftwerk (English: power plant), opened in 1996 in a former combined heat and power plant on the grounds of the Kunstpark Ost, a former factory site of 90.000 m¬≤ close to the Ostbahnhof train station in Munich's Berg am Laim district. It was the first large techno club on the grounds of the Kunstpark factory site. = Reputation and star DJs= The club was renowned for featuring international stars of the techno, house and pop scene. The New Yorker David Morales was the premiere guest at the regular Saturday event called World League, which was held for the first time on 31 October 1996. Alongside Morales, international star DJs and live acts such as Sven V√§th, Carl Cox, Paul van Dyk, Armand van Helden, Daft Punk, Masters at Work, Talla 2XLC, Marc Spoon, DJ Sneak, Frankie Knuckles, Bob Sinclar or Westbam performed regularly and often exclusively at the KW, when they were in Munich. Likewise, international pop stars such as Boy George or Jimmy Somerville of Bronski Beat chose the KW for their concerts. Such events then frequently attracted thousands of visitors, many of them arriving from afar, to the Kunstpark Ost, and soon the KW had built up a reputation all over Europe. = Program and festivals = The musical program of the nightclub concentrated on techno and house music. The Friday event Powerplant laid the focus on techno. In contrast, the Saturday event called World League, which lives on as one of Munich's most famous event series in other clubs to this day, was dedicated to house music as well as guest appearances of international stars. Among the residents of the KW were Ren√© Vaitl and DJ Tomcraft. The door policy of the club was regarded as comparably tough. Repeatedly the KW supplied lovemobiles to popular technoparades such as Berlin's Love Parade or Munich's Union Move. As well, the club was involved in major events of the techno scene such as Rave City. = Closing of the club = When the Kunstpark Ost party area had to close after the operator changed, the KW had to close as well on 31 January 2003. The reason given was that the club was too loud. The last record at KW was played again by David Morales, who had already been the premiere guest. While the regular club nights such as the World League continued at other locations and clubs in Munich, the former power plant and techno club was re- used as an indoor adventure park for kids in a cooperation with Munich's Kindl foundation for kids in 2004. It is planned that the old power plant, which still exists today, must make way for the projected central park of Munich's new Werksviertel district.  Club architecture The club was located in a decommissioned cogeneration power plant of the food manufacturer Pfanni, and poured on the charm of an old industrial production site. Thus it represents an early example of the reutilization of disused power plants and their robust industrial setting as techno clubs, an approach that was later followed by clubs such as Berlin's Berghain (2004), the second Tresor (2007), and Munich's MMA Club (2014). The KW was subdivided into 3 levels: the main area with the main dancefloor, the upper level with the lounge area, and the basement. The hall-like main area was subdivided by several tall concrete columns and a large steel staircase, which led on to the upper level. The club housed several bars, and also had an outdoor chill-out area. Due to the geographical proximity to other popular clubs in Munich such as Ultraschall und Natraj Temple, the club had to deal with a phenomenon called club sharing.

In a special by German news magazine Der Spiegel on club culture from 1998, Sven V√§th recommends the KW as one of the 5 most trendy clubs. DJ Tomcraft, who was one of the residents at KW, reported that it was at KW where he tested his world-famous hit Loneliness (#1 UK Single Charts, #1 UK Dance Charts, #10 DE) on the crowd for the first time.

Buttino writes about his career as a special agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and his dismissal once his homosexuality was made public. Buttino writes that the FBI had a policy of blackmailing gay men into resigning, but the Department of Justice said he was fired because he had lied to investigators and he was therefore susceptible to blackmail by members of the public. Buttino's class-action lawsuit was settled by the FBI in 1994, and it led to an end to homophobic discrimination for employees of the United States federal government. Summary Buttino writes about growing up as a closeted gay man in Canastota, New York. He graduated from Colgate University and joined the FBI in 1968. He was based in their San Diego field office in the late 1980s. Buttino was suspended on September 29, 1989, and he lost his security clearance in January 1991. According to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), Buttino was dismissed from his job because he lied to investigators and he was therefore susceptible to blackmail by members of the public. However, Buttino writes that he was framed by the FBI when an anonymous note revealing his homosexuality was sent to a co-worker in 1988, and Buttino lied about it to his supervisor to keep his job before admitting it was true. He was subsequently probed about every single aspect of his gay identity while his past heterosexual encounters were ignored. Buttino adds that the Office of Professional Responsibility had a policy of blackmailing homosexual agents into resigning. Buttino draws a distinction between field agents, who supported him, and the bureaucracy, whom he blames for his dismissal. By 1991, Buttino was described as an \\"activist\\" by The Los Angeles Times, and he attended the San Diego Pride festival. He was interviewed on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Larry King Live, and 60 Minutes. He co- authored his memoir with his brother, and it was published in June 1993. He also sued the DOJ in December 1993. Impact The FBI decided to stop discriminating against LGBT applicants in December 1993. They settled Buttino's lawsuit in 1994, and Buttino received $153,000 in compensation plus a pension of $1,746 from 2007, the year of his retirement. In 2011, Buttino hosted a book signing in Palm Springs, California. The Desert Sun noted that his lawsuit had led to an end to homophobic discrimination for all employees of the United States federal government.

Souter, was a Scottish painter, sculptor, and illustrator, best known for his Jazz Age-themed work The Breakdown.  Biography  Born in Aberdeen in northeast Scotland, he was a skilled pupil at Ferryhill School, then Gray's School of Art, and then the Allan Fraser School in Arbroath. He won the Byrne Travelling Scholarship awarded by the Scottish Education Department which enabled him to comfortably tour the European continent. During this continental tour, he was purportedly much impressed by Diego Vel√°zquez, Johannes Vermeer, and Jean-Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin. Following the outbreak of World War I, Souter served in the Gordon Highlanders and the Royal Army Medical Corps. Upon returning to civilian life, he married Christian Grace Reid and relocated to London. During the post-war period, he garnered a reputation as a talented portraitist, and his many subjects included such personalities as Gladys Cooper, Ivor Novello, and Fay Compton. Souter exhibited his creations at Redfern Gallery, the Fine Art Society, Royal Scottish Academy and the Royal Academy's Summer Exhibition where his notorious painting The Breakdown was exhibited in 1926 to great controversy. Within days of its exhibition, the British Colonial office contacted the Royal Academy and demanded the immediate removal of the picture as a perceived threat to the British empire. Following negative attacks in the national and world press, Souter's wife convinced him to destroy the painting‚Äîhis greatest work‚Äîwhich he reluctantly assented to do, but he clandestinely retained his preparatory drawings. Amid the chaos and nightly bombing of World War II, he labored in the Censorship Department as a translator but spent the majority of his time restoring paintings at Windsor Castle. In 1952, he retired to Aberdeen where ten years later, despite his failing eyesight, he drew upon his earlier sketches to reconstruct his original work The Breakdown nearly thirty years after its destruction. Souter remained in Aberdeen until his death in 1972.

The 16-story building opened in 1983. Its construction is considered to represent the beginning of revitalization of the city's central business district. Design left The complex is situated on a 12-acre downtown site and comprises a 16-story tower and seven connecting three-story modules sheathed in glass and white enameled aluminum. It was designed by Henry N. Cobb from Pei Cobb Freed & Partners. The white tower, one of tallest buildings in New Brunswick, and surrounding buildings in a park- like setting are across the Northeast Corridor. The buildings were updated in the 2010s following a design by Kimmerle Newman Architects. History The company had historically been located on the Delaware and Raritan Canal in New Brunswick. The company considered moving its headquarters out of New Brunswick in the 1960s, but decided to stay after city officials promised to revitalize downtown New Brunswick by demolishing old buildings and constructing new ones. The chairman of J&J; at the time was instrumental in the plan. While New Brunswick lost many historic structures, including the early home of Rutgers University, and most of its historic commercial waterfront to the redevelopment effort, the gentrification did attract people back to New Brunswick. The stretch of Delaware and Raritan canal by the company's headquarters was replaced by a stretch of Route 18 in the late 1970s, after a lengthy dispute.2 Long-Disputed Projects to Begin, The New York Times, July 9, 1977Old Raritan Canal Lock Is Focus of a Classic Dispute, The New York Times, April 16, 1977.

The site is located at the confluence of two streams, Nahal Besor and Nahal Gerar. Both have changed their course in this area many times throughout history. Re'im is a modern town located to the east nearby. Tell Jemmeh is one of three major sites along the Besor Stream along with Tell el-Far'ah and Tell el-Ajjul. Some archaeologists identify the Besor Stream with the biblical \\"Brook of Egypt\\". There are also a number of ancient sites to the east along the Gerar Stream. Tell Jemmeh is famous for two significant archaeological discoveries: an Assyrian structure, probably a palace, from the Assyrian occupation of the northern Kingdom of Israel, and a grain storage facility from the time of the Ptolemaic Kingdom.Gus w. van Beek, Digging up Tell Jemmeh, Archaeology, Vol. 31, No. 1, January/February 1983, Archaeological Institute of America pp.12‚Äì19Ben-Shlomo and van Beek, 2014, p. 1-3 The mound is 23 metres high and dominates its surrounding plains, which are excellent for agriculture. It spans an area of 12 acres or 43 dunams. Tell Jemmeh is located about 10 kilometers from Tell el-Farah (South) and Tell el-Ajjul, which allows for them to communicate by signal fires. This orientation of the sites suggests it was a border zone. The ancient inhabitants of Tell Jemmeh have probably depended on spring water from the nearby Besor Stream. Most of the building material used in the site is sun-dried mudbrick. Tell Jemmeh was first settled as a hunter-farmer village during the Chalcolithic period, six thousand years ago. It was inhabited for 200 years and then abandoned until it was rebuilt in the Middle Bronze Age. From here the site would be settled for 1,600 years. It is identified with Yursa, mentioned in the Egyptian Amarna Letters from 1350‚Äì1330 BCE. Geography 400px The site of Tell Jemmeh is a mound located on the southern bank of the Besor River. The natural hill is about 45 meters high, with the accumulation of layers representing human activity, spanning from the Chalcolithic through the Persian periods, adding about 18 meters to the height of the hill. The tell suffers from continuous erosion due to the flooding of the Besor River located on the north side of the mound. This phenomenon is intensified because of the fragile character of the local loess soil. Excavation and identification =Gerar= Tell Jemmeh was excavated for the first time by W. J. Phythian-Adams of the Palestine Exploration Fund in 1922. His expedition lasted only one day because of security problems. He identified the site with biblical Gerar (mentioned in the Book of Genesis), as he found remains of human occupation by the Middle Bronze Age, the supposed time of biblical Abraham and Isaac. A nearby Byzantine site called Umm Gerar, some 3.6 kilometres south on the Besor river, further convinced him that Tell Jemmeh is biblical Gerar. Flinders Petrie excavated the site in 1927 for five months and accepted the identification with Gerar. =Yursa/Arsa/Yarda/Orda= In 1952, Benjamin Mazar from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem had challenged this identification. He believed Tell Jemmeh should be identified with Yursa, a city mentioned in the Amarna Letters; Yarda, mentioned by Jewish-Roman scholar Josephus; and Orda, in documents from the Byzantine period. Today, most scholars accept this identification. The association of Tell Jemmeh to Yursa is based on the site's prominence and strategic positing, controlling the coastal route on the southernmost edge of the Canaanite territory. This identification is further substantiated by the petrographic provenancing of two Amarna letters written from Yursa's governor Pu-Ba'lu to the king of Egypt. The next excavation of the site was spread across nine seasons from 1970 to 1978 and was conducted by a team of archaeologists from the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., United States. They have later returned to the site four more times between 1982 and 1990.Gerald L. Mattingly, Gus W. Van Beek (1922‚Äì2012), Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 369 (May 2013), The American Schools of Oriental Research, p.6 The expedition, headed by Gus W. Van Beek, had found evidence to support Mazar's identification, and also identified the site with Arsa from Neo-Assyrian inscriptions. Archaeology and history =Chalcolithic period= The first human settlement to be found in Tell Jemmeh is from the fourth millennium BCE during the Chalcolithic period. The people were hunters and farmers and it was one of the small settlements which existed along the Besor Stream. This settlement lasted for only 200 years. From then the site was abandoned for more than a thousand years as the region became a hub for nomadism. =Bronze Age= Middle Bronze II A settlement appeared during the Middle Bronze Age II period, around 1800 BCE. The site saw continuous human settlement for the next 1600 years. Late Bronze II During the Late Bronze Age II, subsequent with the golden age of the New Kingdom of Egypt (ca. 1450‚Äì1200 BCE), the region of Canaan, to which Tell Jemmeh belongs, was under the control of the Egyptian Empire and the city at Tell Jemmeh saw its height as well. During this particular period, Tell Jemmeh was known as Yursa and was mentioned in some Egyptian sources. First, it was mentioned in the list of 119 cities conquered by Pharaoh Thutmose III in his campaign to thwart a Canaanite rebellion against Egypt (1468 BCE). Yursa is mentioned with Sharuhen as the southwestern border of Canaan. One of the passages in the story of Thutmose's conquests states that Sharuhen remained loyal to the Pharaoh and served as a garrison town, while Yursa turned on Egypt. According to the Egyptian source, Yursa was captured and thus included in the list of cities taken by Thutmose. Also, it is later mentioned in the two of the Amarna Letters (1350 BCE - 1330 BCE). Its king was called Pu-Ba'lu and his kingdom was important to the Egyptians as it was on the main route connecting Egypt with the rest of the Fertile Crescent, dubbed in modern times as the Via Maris. The most prominent archaeological feature of this period is a huge structure (19x16 meters) which served as either a palace or a large house with a big courthouse. This settlement was the first to be fortified. Remains of the wall and a gateway are found in the northeast side of the mound. A large quantity of imported ware was found, including ware of Mycenaean and Cypriot origin. =Iron Age= Tell Jemmeh was conquered by the Philistines at around 1175 BCE, along with what were to become the five major Philistine cities: Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Gath and Ekron. Tell Jemmeh appears to have been a daughter-town of Gaza, under its control. The only Philistine ceramic kiln in Israel was found in Tell Jemmeh. It was an enormous, technologically advanced installation, the most prominent structure discovered from the Philistine period. Only a small part of the settlement of the 10th to 8th centuries BCE was excavated. The main part of these settlements was located mostly on the western side of the site. At least two fortification systems of that period were discovered. The better-preserved wall was constructed in the 8th century BCE and is a casemate wall (double city wall, with transversal walls creating separate chambers). =Assyrian period= During the 7th century BCE, the Neo-Assyrian Empire had expanded and under Tiglath-Pileser III, Sargon II and Sennacherib, Israel and Philistia were conquered. Esarhaddon, the son of Sennacherib, is mentioned in some text to have taken a city called Arsa near the River of Egypt, and its king Asuhili was taken back to the Assyrian capital Ninveh in the year 679 BCE. Esarhaddon probably built a military camp at Tell Jemmeh to defend the new frontier of his empire and to use as a base camp in his later campaigns against the Egyptians in 674, 671 and 669 BCE. A large structure, with mudbrick self- supporting arch roof, was discovered and dated specifically to a period between 679 and 630 BCE. It is believed to have been the seat of a military governor or general. As preserved, the structure measures 12.5 m long and 10 m wide. The original length of the structure is unknown because of previous archaeological work of Petrie and due to erosion. The structure has at least six rooms, three large and long and three short and small. Its plan corresponds with common Assyrian buildings (categorised as \\"Reception Suite Type F\\"). The Assyrians built a new casemate wall atop of the destroyed eighth-century wall. The large Assyrian structure was still in use after Esarhaddon's death in 660 BCE, as it was during the reign of Ashurbanipal. It was likely abandoned rather than destroyed as the Assyrians withdraw from the region. =Hellenistic period= Has found a grain storage from the time of the Ptolemaic Kingdom.Gus w. van Beek, Digging up Tell Jemmeh, Archaeology, Vol. 31, No. 1, January/February 1983, Archaeological Institute of America pp.12‚Äì19Ben-Shlomo and van Beek, 2014, p. 1-3 =Later periods= Later periods are not represented on the tell, indicating that the location of the settlement (especially during the Byzantine and Mamluk period) likely shifted to the lower city south of the tell.

The peak of his career occurred during the 1990s, when he made 113 appearances in La Liga. Most notably, he spent four years with Atl√©tico Madrid, one of Spain's most successful clubs. Club career Pedro was born in Villarcayo de Merindad de Castilla la Vieja in the province of Burgos, Castile and Le√≥n, and turned professional with local club Real Burgos in 1987. After two years with Burgos in Segunda Divisi√≥n, he earned a move to La Liga with Logro√±√©s. He made his La Liga debut on 5 November 1989 in a match against Mallorca at Estadio Las Gaunas, in which Logro√±√©s were defeated 1-0 by the visitors. His first goal came on 3 December, scoring the third goal in a 4-1 home win against Tenerife. Ultimately, he made 28 appearances for Logro√±√©s that season, scoring twice, and his good form earned him a move to Spanish giants Atl√©tico Madrid in the summer of 1990. He made his debut for Los Rojiblancos in their first La Liga game of the season, a 1-1 draw away at Valencia's Mestalla Stadium on 2 September 1990. He had to wait until 23 September to make his home debut, in another 1-1 draw against Tenerife at the Vicente Calder√≥n Stadium. He made 18 appearances in a solid first season with Atleti, but could only manage five the following year. 1992-93 was also a difficult season for Pedro, as he made just 13 appearances. However, this season did include his European debut, as he featured in the home legs of Atl√©tico's first two European Cup Winners' Cup ties: against Slovenia's Maribor on 30 September 1992, and Turkey's Trabzonspor on 3 November. Although the team made it all the way to the semi-finals, Pedro did not feature again. By far Pedro's best season at Atl√©tico Madrid was his last, the 1993-94 season. He was able to make 32 appearances in all competitions, but also had some success as a goalscorer. Having failed to score in his first three seasons with Atleti, he netted seven times during his final season, with the first coming on 28 September 1993 in a home UEFA Cup match against Scotland's Heart of Midlothian. At the end of the season, former Atleti boss Luis Aragon√©s signed him for La Liga rivals Sevilla. He made his Sevilla debut in a home fixture against Sporting de Gij√≥n at the Ram√≥n S√°nchez Pizju√°n Stadium on 30 October 1994. This turned out to be a very good day for Sevilla, as they secured a 5-1 victory. He made 13 appearances in all competitions in his first season with Sevilla, as the club finished a creditable 5th in the league. He made a further 24 appearances the following season, before leaving the club in the summer of 1996. Pedro finished his career with two seasons in Segunda Divisi√≥n, the first for Deportivo Alav√©s, and the second with Extremadura. He retired in 1998. International career Pedro made a single appearance for Spain's under-21s, which came in the second leg of their 1990 UEFA European Under-21 Championship quarter-final against Italy on 28 March 1990. The match was held at the home stadium of Pedro's then club, Logro√±√©s, and although they won the match 1-0, this was not enough to progress to the semi-finals. Pedro never received a call-up to the senior national team.

Dongan Oak Monument at Battle Pass in 2009. Battle Pass in 1866, shortly before the creation of Prospect Park. Battle Pass, formerly known as Flatbush Pass or Valley Grove or The Porte, is a historic hill pass that played a significant part in the 1776 Battle of Long Island, and that is currently part of Prospect Park in Brooklyn. Flatbush Pass went through Heights of Guan along the Native American trail that preceded the original route of Flatbush Road, and was at the border between the Towns of Brooklyn and Flatbush in Kings County under the Dongan Charter of November 12, 1685. Earlier, Governor Lovelace mentioned the pass in documents from 1670.  Battle of Long Island  Battle Pass was the site of a skirmish between Americans under John Sullivan and Hessians under Leopold Philip de Heister during the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776. The Hessians had 5,000 troops and the Americans had 1,300, and had two cannon on the eastern Redoubt Hill. One account says that the Dongan Oak was felled by local farmer Simon Voorhis. The skirmish was over by late morning, and Sullivan was captured. The Hessian killed a number of Americans in a devastating bayonet charge. Many of the American dead were buried at the Flatbush Reformed Dutch Church Complex, although occasionally remains were discovered in the area for years afterward. Some of the Hessians who participated in the battle appear to have etched their names at the Wyckoff- Bennett Homestead.  Prospect Park  Preservation of the battlefield was one of the reasons given for the creation of Prospect Park, with the pass currently running for about 150 feet (45 m) along the car-free East Drive inside the park. It is marked by the small Dongan Oak Monument, which commemorates the boundary tree felled and used as a barricade by the American defenders against the northward invasion. The stump of the Donegan Oak was still recorded in the 1840s, and it may have actually been destroyed in the landscaping that created Prospect Park, when parts of the hills were also leveled. Battle Pass was the site of a vineyard planted with Isabella grapes in the early 19th century. An emphasis on naturalistic landscape architecture in the park's original design discouraged a large memorial, and the site is little-noticed today. The United States Centennial of 1876 saw the Line of Defense monument sponsored by the Sons of the Revolution and the planting of a Centennial Oak. A symbolic new Dongan Oak was planted by John W. Hunter on Arbor Day 1890 with descendants of the Dongan family in attendance. Raymond Ingersoll put up some temporary markers in the 1910s for Battle Pass and other Revolutionary sites in the park that have since been lost, several written by Charles M. Higgins, who also proposed a more elaborate series of Battle of Long Island monument, including the placing of Revolutionary era cannon or captured cannon from Imperial Germany on Redoubt Hill . Cleveland Moffett also wrote a fantasy piece of invasion literature at this time set partially set in Prospect Park and recreating the battle. The Dongan Oak Monument with its bronze eagle atop a stele was dedicated on Evacuation Day 1922, designed by Frederick Ruckstull and sponsored by the Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York. The local \\"Battle Pass Chapter\\" of the Daughters of the American Revolution dedicated another boulder marker in 1929. The eagle of the Dongan Oak Monument was stolen in the 1970s, and again in the 1990s, and has been replaced both times by the Prospect Park Alliance. The area around the monument has been vulnerable to flooding and was repaired in the 2010s. Two historic tablets set in boulders also mark Battle Pass.

The actress secured the role following an audition. She was sceptical that it would lead to much and initially presumed that the producers would keep her around for a short time. However, positive viewer reaction led to her role within the show being increased. She made her debut appearance in the episode broadcast on 14 December 1992. Fiona is portrayed as ambitious, hard working, uncomplicated, and someone who lives for the moment. Griffin found the lack of information about Fiona's background to be a benefit, as it allowed her time to establish her character's personality. Fiona was introduced as the Street's new hairdresser, who took up a job at Denise Osbourne's (Denise Black) salon, which she later purchased with the help of her brother Lee Middleton (Nicholas Bailey). Fiona also embarked on careers as a singer and a model, which helped to increase her confidence. Fiona became best friends with Maxine Heavey (Tracy Shaw) during her time on the Street, and had a long on-off relationship with Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson). After breaking up with Steve, Fiona has a relationship with mechanic Tony Horrocks (Lee Warburton), which is complicated by Maxine's feelings for him. Fiona eventually becomes engaged to policeman Alan McKenna (Glenn Hugill), but their relationship is tested by his dark persona and Fiona's affair with Steve's father Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson). Fiona finds out she is pregnant with Alan's child shortly before his departure. She reunites with Steve, who wants to help her raise her son, Morgan (Connor Chatburn). After six years of playing Fiona, Griffin chose to leave Coronation Street to pursue further acting roles, as she did not want to wait around for her next big storyline. On-screen, Fiona discovers that Steve has cheated on her with Maxine. She sells her salon and leaves Weatherfield with Morgan in September 1998. For her portrayal of Fiona, Griffin won the Most Popular Newcomer accolade at the 1st National Television Awards. Griffin reprised the role in June 2019, and made a brief cameo appearance on 21 August. Casting Following a guest appearance in fellow British soap Emmerdale, sixteen year old actress Angela Griffin successfully auditioned for the role of hairdresser Fiona. Singer Melanie Brown also auditioned for the role, before joining the Spice Girls. Of her casting, Griffin stated \\"I feel as if I've been lucky, I've been gradually introduced into the programme and have had a chance to get used to everything, whereas some actors come into Coronation Street and get thrown in at the deep end straight away.\\"Little 1995, p.234. Griffin made her first appearance as Fiona on 14 December 1992. Fiona was only Coronation Street's second black character. Griffin was initially sceptical that the part would lead to much, but the audience reacted well to the character and her role within the show was increased. Shortly after, Griffin gave up her studies due to her new workload. Griffin never expected Fiona to become a central character in the series and presumed producers would keep her around for a short time. Her brother also joked that she was originally a glorified on-set extra, which Griffin believed helped her remain grounded in her early years. Development =Characterisation and career= Griffin admitted that she loved her character, and said she can be loud, yet quite reserved at times. She thought the writers could take Fiona in any direction as her background had not been revealed and viewers did not know \\"what makes her tick.\\" Griffin told an Inside Soap writer that because very little was known about Fiona when she was introduced, she found it to be a benefit, as it allowed her the time to establish Fiona's personality. Griffin called Fiona \\"very uncomplicated\\" and a hard worker. She also said that Fiona just wants to earn her money and go out and have fun. Griffin further described her as someone who \\"lives for the moment and she has absolutely no hang-ups about what she does ‚Äì or what she says!\\" In The Official Coronation Street Annual, Rob Sharp describes Fiona as a \\"cute crimper\\" who \\"certainly turned a few heads\\" when she starts working at Denise Osbourne's (Denise Black) hair salon. He added \\"the prospect of a quick trim immediately became more alluring for the men of Weatherfield.\\"Sharp 1997, p.38. Fiona is an \\"ambitious career girl\\" and since her move onto Coronation Street, her \\"fortunes soared\\" and she began managing her own business called Hair by Fiona Middleton. Fiona and her best friend Maxine Heavey (Tracy Shaw) both had distinct styles. A writer from Inside Soap profiled her stating \\"stylish hairdresser Fiona avoids the sex kitten look of her best friend Maxine, favouring autumnal shades and natural fibers, which she mixes and matches with aplomb.\\" In 1997, Griffin believed that Fiona had changed so much \\"she was in danger of becoming a bit hard.\\" Writers decided to show a \\"softer side\\" to Fiona by showing she can be vulnerable. Producers lined up a second career for Fiona as a singer. When she outshines Maxine during drunken gig, Alec Gilroy (Roy Barraclough) notices her talent. He becomes her agent and secures her more shows. When Griffin learned of the story she was \\"terrified\\". She told Steven Murphy from Inside Soap that she was scared about singing in front of others and hired a singing coach to help her improve. She added \\"he just gave me the confidence to get up there, do it and not care.\\" Fiona's gig was filmed on location and Griffin did not have time to do rehearsals and found the experience \\"daunting\\". The actress did not think that a singing career was right for Fiona because she had begun to achieve more in her hairdressing business. She added \\"I think she might get up and sing occasionally, but she won't do it full time.\\" In the wake of Steve's marriage, Fiona is offered a modelling job that was originally meant for Raquel Wolstenhulme (Sarah Lancashire). The offer boosts her confidence and brings her out of a depression. Griffin told Richard Arnold from Inside Soap that Fiona is \\"quite flattered\\" with the attentions she receives while modelling. She likes having the \\"ego boost that came along just when she was feeling unattractive.\\" When Denise decides to sell the hair salon, Fiona's brother Lee Middleton (Nicholas Bailey) agrees to loan her the money to buy the business. She is eager to show her new found maturity by naming the salon after herself rather than creating a pun styled name. Griffin thought that her character was ambitious and buying the salon proved it. She sets herself goals and achieves them. Fiona feels great because she has always wanted her own Salon. Fiona admires fellow character and businesswoman Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox). Griffin told Peake that Rita is \\"Fiona's role model [...] if she can be as successful as her, she'd be very pleased.\\" She also envisioned Fiona becoming a stronger character in the same way that Coronation Street had previously developed their \\"great women\\" characters. Fiona also has to deal with Maxine, who does not behave professionally at work. She continues to test Fiona's patience. Griffin concluded that \\"Fiona will just let her know who's in charge.\\" =Relationship with Steve McDonald= After Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) breaks up with his girlfriend Vicky Arden (Chloe Newsome), he decides to pursue Fiona. Gregson reckoned she was a good match for his character, as he needed someone he could have a good time with and who shared his interests. He also wanted someone who was not looking for a serious relationship. Gregson described Fiona as a female version of Steve, and said \\"She's a real woman of the Nineties who knows what she wants. She's also pretty streetwise, which Steve loves.\\" Fiona and Steve's relationship is strained when she becomes fed up of playing hard to get, and then shows him up at a party. Griffin said Fiona is giving Steve \\"a run for his money\\" and that he is not sure how to react, as he has never met someone like her before. The actress also said that Steve treated Vicky badly, and Fiona will not put up with the same behaviour, which is why she was angry that he treated her as \\"an unpaid skivvy\\" at his party. Fiona makes plans to go on holiday with her friends without telling Steve. Griffin explained \\"Fiona is just out for a good time and the relationship with Steve is too much like hard work. Eventually she gets so sick of trying to keep out of his way that she opts for a trip to Tenerife and deliberately keeps him in the dark.\\" Fiona's actions force Steve to realise that he really cares about her and he tries to stop her from leaving. He offers to take Fiona to Miami, but this causes her to break up with him before she goes to Tenerife. Griffin said that Fiona felt like he was bullying her into going on holiday with him and she will not put up with him ordering her around. Griffin thought that when Fiona returns from the holiday, she might realise how much she missed Steve. She also noted that Fiona obviously liked him or she would not be dating him. Upon her return, Fiona is taken aback at how nice Steve is to her, so she feels that she cannot be mean to him. Her time away also made her realise that Steve had good intentions with the Miami tickets and he just wanted to spend more time with her. The couple become closer when Steve goes to Fiona for support, following a meeting with the probation services. Fiona was touched that he trusted her and in return she \\"made it clear that she's there for him.\\" Griffin believed that when Steve is with Fiona he is unsure of himself, which she likes. The actress reckoned that Fiona was falling in love with him, which surprised her, as their relationship had not been serious to begin with. Griffin also said that her off-screen friendship with Gregson initially made their character's love scenes embarrassing to film. When Fiona meets Steve's ex-girlfriend Vicky Arden, she immediately sees her as a threat to her relationship. Steve carries on gambling and it becomes clear that Vicky still has feelings for Steve. Vicky discovers that Fiona and Steve's relationship has been difficult despite them deciding to move in together. Steve promises to stop gambling but when he learns that Vicky has inherited ¬£240,000, he gets back with her. When Fiona discovers that the pair are getting married, she turns to Des Barnes (Philip Middlemiss) for comfort. This causes problems with her best friend Maxine, who has romantic feelings for Des. Griffin believed that Fiona was actually more annoyed at Steve for flaunting his relationship with Vicky in her presence than losing him. She concluded \\"I reckon she's had a pretty lucky escape.\\" =Relationship with Tony Horrocks= Fiona begins a relationship with Tony Horrocks (Lee Warburton), who arrives in Weatherfield to work as a mechanic. Tony is a \\"strong but silent\\" type of character which works in his favour. Fiona takes an instant liking to Tony because he is so unlike Steve. Griffin told Inside Soap's Arnold that in comparison to Steve, Tony is \\"quite shy and doesn't talk about himself the whole time.\\" Fiona is initially unsure about starting a serious relationship with him because she fears all men are like Steve. But Tony \\"soon persuades her he's worth it\\" and Fiona decides \\"she's gonna have some fun\\" with him. Fiona begins to push Tony away and avoids the topic of moving in together. Griffin revealed that \\"Fiona likes to keep Tony at arms length. She doesn't want to live with him in case he turns out to be a drug dealer or something!\\" When Steve is sent to prison he asks Fiona to visit him. His request makes Fiona realise that she still has feelings for him. Griffin told Jon Peake of Inside Soap that \\"just because you hate someone, you don't stop loving them.\\" She likes becoming his confidant and excuses his past behaviour. She added \\"she realises he's only human and she's very confused about her feelings.\\" Fiona decides to hide her confusion from Tony because she is not ready to be with Steve again. Griffin also thought that Fiona needed to decide what she wanted before causing Tony any hurt because he \\"feels threatened by Steve as it is.\\" Tony and Steve are completely different and acts as a safe option for Fiona. Griffin explained that her character tried dating the \\"rough lad\\" but decided on the \\"nice boy\\". She enjoyed the security he provided for six months but ultimately \\"it's not enough\\". Writers made the story more complicated when they depicted Maxine secretly lusting after Tony. Fiona lies to Maxine about visiting Steve because she advices her against associating with him. Fiona later admits to Tony that she has been visiting Steve. He angrily issues her with an ultimatum to chose between him and Steve, which forces them to break up. Just days after their split, Maxine decides to seduce Tony. This makes their friendship \\"volatile\\" and Fiona is left unable to forgive Maxine. =Alan McKenna= Producers next paired Fiona with show newcomer policeman Alan McKenna (Glenn Hugill). Alan is older than Fiona who thinks she needs an older man's influence in her life. Griffin told Inside Soap's Helen Childs that Alan is independent which Fiona finds \\"very appealing\\" because \\"she loves being looked after.\\" Fiona wants an \\"adult relationship\\" considering Steve and Tony were immature. Griffin also revealed that her character was longing for a \\"father figure\\" because her father had never supported Fiona. She added \\"it was quite obvious that he has never paid Fiona a compliment in her life.\\" This makes Fiona determined to gain respect from an older man. Writers once again included Fiona's interfering friend Maxine in the story. This time Maxine disapproves because she suspects that Alan is hiding a secret wife. She also takes issue with Alan changing his plans when they arranged romantic dates. Fiona does not listen to Maxine's concerns and Griffin even believed Fiona envisioned settling down with Alan. Fiona and Alan's relationship progressed rapidly with writers creating no end of drama between the two. They become very serious about their future together but Alan is hiding a dark persona. Fiona accuses Alan of being a racist when he does not ask her to accompany him to the policeman's ball. The real reason being that Alan finds it difficult to commit. Hugill told Peake (Inside Soap) that Alan feels that he has not experienced the same successes as Fiona. He views her as a \\"single-minded, ambitious woman who manages to achieve what she wants without anyone hating her, which is something Alan hasn't achieved yet.\\" Alan thinks Fiona is \\"the better person\\" and he creates a tough persona to hide his vulnerabilities and he \\"fears greatly\\" he may lose her. Like her previous stories, writers gave Steve a role in her relationship dramas. Fiona keeps her past with Steve from Alan. When he discovers they used to date he is furious. Hugill said it \\"rankles him badly\\". Alan is unable to deal with things calmly and puts his issues with Fiona and Steve aside. But Hugill believed this behaviour would end badly because \\"inside is a lot of lava waiting to pour out.\\" Alan uses Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) to try apprehend criminal Fraser Henderson (Glyn Grain). Fiona informs Liz which causes a row with Alan. Hugill explained that is \\"the first time we've seen him crack. Up to now, he's been cool and manipulative.\\" With Alan working long shifts on the police force the pair do not get much time together. He suggests they move in together which she immediately accepts. They also become engaged but Griffin hoped they would not marry because she feared them becoming a \\"dull\\" couple. Another problem is Alan's personality, but Griffin explained \\"she does trust him, but whether he's trustworthy or not, who knows?\\" =Affair with Jim McDonald= Writers decided to introduce infidelity into the plot. When Steve is released from prison, Fiona \\"feels sorry for him\\" because no one will support him. She tries to be there for him which annoys Alan. Griffin defended her character stating that she \\"doesn't want to bed him again\\" and \\"will help anyone who needs it.\\" Alan dislikes Fiona being associated with an ex-prisoner and her ex-lover. This causes their relationship to become so volatile that she turns to Steve's father Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson) for support. Griffin explained that \\"Jim is always someone she's had a soft spot for, she's always felt like she could confide in him.\\" This encounters brings the two characters closer towards intimacy. Jim provides Fiona with comfort and after talking, they go upstairs where they have sex. Jim is \\"delighted with himself\\" and believes he and Fiona have a future together, but she would rather forget that it happened. Fiona keeps her night with Jim a secret. But during her wedding to Alan, Jim turns up at the church and \\"flies into a jealous rage\\". Griffin admitted that she felt nervous while filming the episode and said the cast really did jump when Jim burst into the church. She called it \\"one of the most dramatic episodes I have ever been involved with.\\" Of Alan's reaction to the revelation, Griffin stated \\"Finding out about her and Jim would definitely bring out Alan's violent side. I think he would flip and can imagine he might not know who to hit first. Alan might be prepared to forgive her eventually, but he would have to have everything on his terms and Fiona's too independent for that.\\" She dubbed Alan \\"a real control freak\\" because of his position and power as a detective. Hugill enjoyed working alongside Griffin and praised her for being \\"so talented and so giving.\\" Fiona finds out she is pregnant with Alan's child but he leaves the show following the discovery of Fiona and Jim's affair. =Pregnancy and reconciliation with Steve= Following her break-up with Alan, Fiona needs support and Steve decides to help her. Gregson did not think Steve and Fiona could realistically get back together straight away. In an interview with Inside Soap's Simon Timblick he teased \\"all good things come to those who wait.\\" But Fiona and Jim's affair is \\"a complete shock\\" for Steve and he is \\"very angry\\" and needs time to adjust. He added that \\"a lot has happened between Steve and Fiona over the last few monthd, but there's absolutely no reason why they can't become good friends again.\\" Fiona has to come to terms with the prospect of being a single parent. Steve decides he wants to be with Fiona and help her raise her child. Fiona is unsure about giving their relationship another try. Griffin said that Fiona \\"doesn't know what she wants\\". She is \\"excited\\" about having a baby but \\"nervous\\" about being a lone parent. She does love Steve because he was her \\"first love, but the fact he's done so many nasty things to her in the past is weighing heavily on her mind.\\" Fiona gives birth five weeks premature and calls the baby Morgan. She was not required to film a birth scene but did portray Fiona going into labour. To prepare for the scenes she worked with a midwife who coached her on making realistic contractions that would occur when a woman goes into labour. Griffin said that it \\"terrified\\" her because it made her realise that giving birth is not easy. Producers hired a baby, Connor Chatburn, to play Morgan. He was cast after his family believed that his mother bared a physical resemblance to Griffin. The actress enjoyed filming the mother and son scenes as she portrayed Fiona's journey into motherhood. =Departure= After six years of playing Fiona, Griffin chose to leave Coronation Street to pursue further acting roles. Producers did not want to kill her character off, as Fiona was popular with viewers, giving Griffin the chance to return to the serial in the future. Griffin filmed her final scenes on 28 August 1998. She later told Rebecca Fletcher of the Daily Mirror that while there was a lot more her character could do, she knew there would be around a year long wait between her last storyline and the next big one. She continued, \\"I was 21 and impatient. I didn't want to wait that long. I wanted to get out in the big wide world and see what else there was. And I whispered to myself, 'If it doesn't work out, I can always go back'.\\" In the lead up to her exit, Fiona discovers that Steve has cheated on her with Maxine. The storyline begins when Fiona goes to visit her mother. Steve and Maxine go out and get drunk together, which leads them to discuss what things could have been like if they had worked out differently. They end up having sex and Steve \\"doesn't give Fiona a second thought.\\" Upon her return, Fiona asks Steve to marry her and he accepts. Of Steve's decision, Gregson commented, \\"He thinks the world of Fiona's son Morgan and does love Fiona. He thinks of the night with Maxine as just a temporary aberration. He's a randy bugger.\\" Gregson admitted he was ready for the criticism he was likely to receive from fans of Fiona and Steve. Fiona \\"has a huge bust-up\\" with Maxine and Steve when she learns of their one- night stand. She \\"goes ballistic\\" at them and says that they are suited to one another. She also argues with Jim, after he discovers she knew that Steve pushed him off some scaffolding. Fiona then receives an offer for the salon from Fred Elliott (John Savident) and she decides to sell up and leave Weatherfield. =Return= In September 2014, Griffin mooted a potential return storyline for Fiona, saying \\"My idea for a return storyline ‚Äì if I were to go back ‚Äì was that I‚Äôd have been pregnant by Steve when I left. And I could then return with the child.\\" She also thought that Fiona could return alongside Steve's former girlfriends and wives. In January 2018, Griffin said she would be open to a return, following the news that her former co-star Sean Wilson was returning as Martin Platt. She told Lorraine Kelly, \\"If he's going back you never know who else might go back. You never know. Never say never!\\" Griffin also said that any return storyline would have to involve Steve. A few months later, viewers speculated that newcomer Emma Brooker, played by Alexandra Mardell, could be Fiona and Steve's secret daughter. At the time, Mardell stated that it was not true, and her character was just an apprentice hairdresser, who has come to work at the local salon. In June 2019, it was announced Griffin was reprising her role, and that Emma was likely Fiona and Steve's daughter. Griffin made a brief return on 21 August 2019, as the truth about Emma's parentage is revealed. The storyline begins when Emma's father dies, leading her to contact Fiona. After learning that Steve is her biological father, Emma contacts Fiona via Skype, as she is living in Australia, to talk about their family. Griffin filmed the scene in the show's studios. Reception For her portrayal of Fiona, Griffin won the Most Popular Newcomer accolade at the 1st National Television Awards in 1995. She was nominated for \\"Best Actress\\" at the 1997 and the 1998 Inside Soap Awards. Of Fiona's early impact on the show, the Daily Mirror's Helen Weathers stated, \\"The audience reaction to the Street's new wild-haired saucepot was so positive that Granada bosses decided Fiona Middleton had to stay.\\" An All About Soap writer called Fiona \\"one of the show's best-loved characters\\", and said Griffin played her \\"with a confidence, fire and attitude that made her a hit with the public.\\" Inside Soap's Steven Murphy branded Fiona as \\"feisty\\" and a \\"crooning crimper\\". Another writer for the magazine observed that Fiona \\"knows how to treat her men to keep them keen, and there's no doubt local whiz kid Steve McDonald was happy to play kiss chase for as long as it took to reel in feisty Fee!\\" Helen Childs branded her a \\"sexy snipper\\". Fellow writer Jon Peake opined that \\"canny crimper\\" Fiona \\"really should know better\\" than to ever get involved with Steve again. Not impressed by Steve's treatment of Fiona, Arnold joked that \\"it's a wonder the street's top hairdresser didn't take her scissors to him.\\" Griffin was praised during Fiona's singing storyline by John Millar of the Daily Record. He wrote, \\"Perplexity has also struck the usually razor-sharp hairdresser Fiona Middleton - who can't decide whether to take up Alec Gilroy's offer of more showbiz bookings. The scenes between Fiona (Angela Griffin) and Alec (Roy Barrowclough) were excellent because they're both fine actors.\\" Millar later commented on the character's poor romantic history, writing \\"Poor wee Fiona (Angela Griffin) really does seem destined to be unlucky in love. Even though she's the sexiest looking girl in the Street. she has had a series of ill-fated romances. Now I'll bet that her fling with dashing copper Alan is about to hit a dead-end.\\" The character's exit from the show was seen by over 16 million viewers. In 2016, David Brown of the Radio Times thought Fiona could be one of ten characters that could return to the show, saying \\"Ideally you'd want all of Steve McDonald's ex-wives and girlfriends to turn up at once in a stretch limo, but the likeliest candidate for a return would be Fiona. She could be on her uppers and seeking help from Steve, perhaps accompanied by her now-teenaged son Morgan, who could set about breaking some hearts.\\" In a similar feature in 2019, Charlie Milward of Digital Spy included Fiona on his list of seven characters new producer Iain MacLeod should bring back. Milward said Fiona's \\"time on the street would have clients in the salon gossiping for weeks.\\" References  Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1992 Category:Fictional hairdressers Category:Fictional singers Category:Fictional models Category:Fictional people from Manchester Category:Fictional Black British people Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Fiona Middleton"},{"id":"61108740","text":"2016‚Äì17 Eerste Klasse was a Dutch association football season of the Eerste Klasse.

Life and work He was born to a prominent family that was active in civic affairs, as he would be throughout much of his life. His interest in painting was apparently the result of a friendship with Van Rensselaer Hawkins (1797‚Äì1847), an itinerant painter and art teacher who came to live in Alexander.Biography @ AskArt. His career as an artist was very brief; almost entirely confined to the 1830s. In addition to Alexander, he also worked in Rochester, Cleveland and Cincinnati (1836/37) and possibly northern Kentucky. His portraits resemble those of Ammi Phillips, another New York painter, originally from Connecticut. Milton W. Hopkins may have also been an influence as he apparently lived in close proximity to North. In fact, census records indicate that North may have boarded with Hopkins. His style is very simple and also reminiscent of the early New England limners. Many of his works feature people holding pets. His first dated portrait is from 1833, although it is identified as \\"number 11\\", which naturally suggest that ten paintings have been lost. No signed portraits are known from after 1840. In 1841, he returned to New York, got married, and settled in Livingston County. From 1845 to 1847, he operated a daguerreotype studio in Mount Morris. He also did occasional work as an ornamental painter, although farming appears to have been his primary activity until his death.

With the Earl of Mar, Loudoun was the last Secretary of State of the Kingdom of Scotland. He supported the Union with England of 1707 and was Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland between 1708 and 1713. Early life and family Campbell was the oldest son of James Campbell, 2nd Earl of Loudoun, by his marriage to Lady Margaret Montgomerie, a daughter of Hugh Montgomerie, 7th Earl of Eglinton.Burke's Peerage, vol. 2 (2003), p. 2406 In 1684, he succeeded his father as Earl of Loudoun, Lord Campbell of Loudoun, and Lord Tarrinzean and Mauchline, which gave him a seat in the unicameral Parliament of Scotland as soon as he came of age. While his year of birth is unknown, it can be estimated from the fact that he took his seat on 8 September 1696 and would normally have done so at the age of twenty- one. Loudoun‚Äôs brother, Colonel John Campbell, was a Whig Member of Parliament for Ayrshire before the Union of 1707, as was another brother, Sir James Campbell, after it. Sir James married Lady Jane Boyle, a daughter of David Boyle, 1st Earl of Glasgow, was Colonel of the Scots Greys and a Knight of the Order of the Bath, and was killed at the Battle of Fontenoy (1745). His brother James's son James Mure-Campbell eventually became the 5th Earl of Loudoun. Career In April 1697, Loudoun was appointed a Privy Councillor for Scotland. From February 1699 until his death, he was also an Extraordinary Lord of Session, having been appointed at an unusually early age.George Fisher Russell Barker, \\"Campbell, Hugh, third Earl of Loudoun\\", in Dictionary of National Biography, vol. 8, online at Wikisource In recommending Loudoun for the Court of Session, the Earl of Argyll wrote to William Carstares Loudoun's son John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun From 1703 to 1705 Loudoun was a Commissioner of the Treasury, then from 1705 to 1707 Secretary of State of the Kingdom of Scotland, holding the office jointly with John Erskine, Earl of Mar, the two men becoming the last holders of that office before the Acts of Union 1707 combined England and Scotland into a single Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1706, he was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Thistle. On 26 October of that year he wrote to Sidney Godolphin, Earl of Godolphin, that \\"manie of the common people are so much impos'd on us to be against the union in manie places of the Countrie,\\" but he believed that the benefits it would bring would ultimately pacify the dissenting voices.R. Betteridge, R. McLean, Northern Lights: The Scottish Enlightenment (National Library of Scotland, 2019), p. 6 From 1707 he was a Scottish representative peer, with a seat in the House of Lords at Westminster. Loudoun was Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland between 1708 and 1713. In 1715, he fought at the Battle of Sheriffmuir, taking the side of King George I against the Jacobites. Personal life On 6 April 1700, Loudoun married his cousin, Lady Margaret Dalrymple (c. 1677‚Äì1777), a daughter of John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair and Elizabeth Dundas, daughter and heiress of Sir John Dundas of Newliston. They had a daughter and a son: * Lady Margaret Campbell,H.

On 7 February 1707, Loudoun's peerages were regranted by the Crown, with new remainders to the heirs general of the first Earl of his own nomination, and in default of that to the heirs male. He died on 20 November 1731 and was succeeded by his son John.

E. Nobel was a tobacco company based in Copenhagen, Denmark. History Emilius Ferdinand Nobel by Harald Frederik Jensen The company was founded when Christian Kastrup opened a tobacco factory at Vestergade 11 (formerly No. 44) in 1806. The company was in 1854 acquired by E. F. Nobel (1810-1892). He had back in 1835 established a tobacco company in Nyk√∏bing Falster but that company was now left in the hands of and later acquired by B. C. Nobel (1825‚Äì1890) and H. Baag√∏e (died 1900). E. Nobel: Its building at Vestergade 11 is seen in the middle. E. F. Nobel's new venture in Copenhagen grew rapidly and he soon expanded it with a large, new cigar factory at Smallegade in Frederiksberg (now Porcel√¶nshaven) and a chewing tobacco factory at Prinsessegade 60 (formerly 50) in Christianshavn. The Frederiksberg site was later ceded to the Royal Porcelain Factory in exchange for the porcelain factory's site at Prinsessegade 62 (formerly 52). E. F. Nobel made T. S. Braun a partner in the company in 1855 and Nobel's son Chr. P. Nobel (1841‚Äì1899) became a partner in1879. T. S. Braun's son, P. Braun, became a partner in 1887. Bruun Sr. died shortly thereafter and the firm was the following year split in two when Nobel's son kept the cigar and smoking tobacco activities while Braun's two sons continued the chewing tobacco activities under the name Br√∏dr. Braun. E. F. Nobel's death in 1892 left Chr. P. Nobel as the sole owner of the company. After his death in 1899 it was continued by his widow, Nanna Nobel, and son, E. F. Nobel (1875-1941). The Nyk√∏bing Falster company was continued by B. C. Nobel and H. Baag√∏e until B. C. Nobel's death in 1890. His share of the company was passed to his son, Emil Nobel (1861‚Äì1906). H. Baag√∏e died in 1900 and the company was then continued by Emil Nobel alone until his death in 1906. The company was then passed to his widow, Emma Nobel, but H. Nobel (born 1880), a son of Chr. P. Nobel and Nanna Nobel), became a partner. The company was in 1908 taken over by E. Nobel in Copenhagen and H. Nobel then joined his mother and elder brother as a partner. E. Nobel merged with Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker and Horwitz & Kattentid under the name De Danske Cigar- & Tobaksfabrikker in 1919. E. F. Nobel and H. Nobel were both board members of the new company. In 1938, E. F. Nobel and H. Nobel bought E. Nobels Fabrikker out of the merger. E. F. Nobel passed away in 1941 and his share of the company was then taken over by his son B. Nobel. One of H. Nobel's sons, H. J. Nobel, became a partner in 1945. Legacy Vestergade 11 Vestergade 11 The company name is still seen on the facade of its former building at Vestergade 11 in Copenhagen. Its former factory at Prinsessegade 60-62 is now used by Christianshavn Gymnasium. The cigar factory in Nyk√∏bing Falster was taken over by Scandinavian Tobacco Group in 1991. It closed in 2016.

It was also known as Gray's Regiment to differentiate it from the 28th (Thomas') Louisiana Infantry Regiment, which was also numbered as 29th. Raised in 1862 it served in the Trans-Mississippi Theater and along the Gulf Coast until it disbanded in 1865.  History  The 28th Louisiana was organized at Monroe during April or May 1862, under the command of Colonel Henry Gray. The regiment included ten companies and fielded 902 men when it mustered in. After completing its organization, the regiment moved to Vienna and drilled there for the next few months before being encamped near Milliken's Bend. Sent to south Louisiana in November to join General Richard Taylor's command, the 28th encamped at Avery Island for a brief period before relocating to Fort Bisland. A detachment from the regiment participated in the 28 June 1863 capture of the Union gunboat Diana on the Atchafalaya River, and Company K was embarked on the gunboat when it reentered Confederate service. After fighting in the Battle of Fort Bisland between 12 and 13 April, the 28th Louisiana proved decisive in the Confederate victory at Irish Bend on 14 April. The regiment then retreated to Natchitoches with Taylor's army, returning to south Louisiana in June. Gray became commander of General Alfred Mouton's brigade during the summer and fall of 1863. With the brigade, the 28th Louisiana marched to Monroe in December and thence to Pineville for camp in January 1864. When the Red River Campaign commenced in mid-March, the brigade crossed to Alexandria and retreated towards Natchitoches once again. Distinguishing itself in the attack at the Battle of Mansfield on 8 April, the regiment was in reserve with the brigade for most of the day on 9 April during the Battle of Pleasant Hill, being involved in desultory action. In the subsequent Battle of Yellow Bayou on 18 May, the regiment suffered many casualties. With the brigade, it marched to Monroe in August and moved into southern Arkansas. Late in 1864, the brigade returned to Alexandria through Minden. It camped on Bayou Cotile May 1865, when the regiment marched to Mansfield and disbanded there on 19 May, just before Taylor surrendered his command.

It is both the first title to be created and released by Exact for the X68000 platform, as well as the first project produced by the company. Set in a futuristic sci-fi 2143 setting, the players assume the role of fighter pilot Manami Katagiri taking control of the ASP space fighter craft in an effort to stop the titular artificial intelligence that has turned antagonistic against humankind. Although the game was first launched by Exact on retail stores, it would later be distributed through the Takeru software vending machines, which allowed users to write commercial titles or d≈çjin soft on blank 5.25\\" floppy disks. Despite receiving little promotion, Naious became a sleeper hit among the X68000 userbase for Exact during its initial release and received praise for various aspects such as the graphics and gameplay that would eventually lead it to be named \\"Game of the Year\\" by Japanese magazine Oh!X in its genre. After its release, Exact would go on to develop their second title for the X68000; Aquales, which was released almost a year later and garnered positive response from critics and audience alike.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Naious is a scrolling shoot 'em up game reminiscent of Hellfire, Thunder Cross and Whip Rush, where players assume the role of pilot Manami Katagiri taking control of the ASP space fighter craft across seven stages that take place on a futuristic sci-fi setting in a last-ditch effort to stop the titular artificial intelligence that has become rogue against humankind and defeat his army of enemies.Naious („Éä„Ç§„Ç¢„Çπ) operation manual (X68000, JP) Prior to starting, players have access to the configuration menu at the title screen of the game, where various settings can be adjusted. The players starts with only one weapon at the beginning of the game; a Vulcan shot but the ship can expand its inventory by collecting new weapons scattered on the stage such as a Wide shot and a Laser, while other power-ups appear at certain points during the stages that changes or enhances the arsenal. Players can also equip the ship with a set of two satellite \\"options\\", whose positions can be arranged and attack at the player's will. At the end of each stage, a boss must be fought in order to progress further through the game, with each stage increasing in difficulty. If the ship is hit by enemy fire, the players lose a live as well as both the options and the weapon in use, instead of losing all collected weapons and once all lives are lost, the game is over.  Synopsis  The plotline of Naious takes place between the 21st and 22nd centuries, where the Earth has become overpopulated and uninhabitable due to constant pollution that prompted humankind towards space colonization, which expanded their technological advances as a result. The humans first discovered a series of machines in Mars and scientists spent several years in reverse engineering their technology for beneficial purposes, while habitable spots in a weakened Jupiter are found for temporary colonization and the existence of extraterrestrial life is later confirmed. The technological expansion led to widespread pollution once again and in order to counter it, a satellite containing the titular artificial intelligence is built by the Earth Federation Bureau for the task of purifying the atmosphere of Earth, however it eventually becomes sentient and ultimately threatens humanity by first obliterating various cities with a powerful blast. Manami Katagiri, pilot of the ASP space fighter craft, is assigned with the mission of stopping the rogue AI in a last-ditch effort.  Development and release  Naious was both the first title to be created and released by Exact for the X68000 platform, as well as the first overall project produced by the company. The game was first previewed across a few magazine such as Oh!X, before being released on October 26, 1990 in stores with a retail price of with a retail price of JP¬•8,700.

Education  He was born in Aston, now part of Birmingham, in 1893, then educated at Erdington High School. He then studied for three years at Birmingham School of Art, the subjects including machine design and metallurgy.  World War I  During World War I, he was appointed to the post of tool room superintendent of National Aircraft Factory No. 1. His study of airframe and engine design during this period, and in the years immediately following the war, convinced him of the possibilities of forged light alloys. Aircraft airframes, as well as engines, were now in a transitional phase and moving to the increased use of light alloys for construction, rather than wood or iron.  Between the wars  Following the end of the war he became works manager at Peter Hooker's where he began to realise the increasing value of light alloy forgings and castings. During WWI, Hooker's had licence-built the Gn√¥me engine, amongst other things, and for the aero engines chose to be known as The British Gn√¥me and Le Rh√¥ne Engine Co. They had become expert at working Y alloy, the first heat-resistant aluminium alloy, which had become important for making engine parts, particularly pistons. The post-war reduction in demand and the plentiful supply of war- surplus engines made times hard for all engine and component makers. After buying Hooker's at the beginning of 1920, BSA reviewed its operations and decided Hooker's should be liquidated. After some years in voluntary liquidation, Hooker's operations ended in late 1927 when its workshops were sold. In 1927 Devereux founded High Duty Alloys Ltd. at Farnham Road, Slough Initial backing for this had been provided by John Siddeley of Armstrong- Siddeley, who were already significant early adopters of aluminium castings for car engine parts. About that time a large order was received, of some thousands of pistons for the Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar engine. Armstrong- Siddeley had no other capable source for these pistons, so Devereux proposed to set up a new company to complete this order. Siddeley loaned the money to re-purchase the necessary equipment and re-employ some of the staff from Hooker. As the buildings had already been sold, the new company had to relocate to Slough. High Duty Alloys began as a small company, but was equipped for applied research with a well-equipped laboratory, foundry, and machine shop. Much of their early work was still on Y alloy and then on 'DU' from which Hiduminium was developed. In 1935 Hawker Siddeley Aircraft was formed, when Hawker Aircraft purchased the business empire of the retiring 70-year-old John Siddeley, including High Duty Alloys. In 1933 he was elected an Associate Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, followed by a Fellowship in 1937. In 1938 he became the Honorary Colonel of the 56th (1st London) Divisional Engineers of the Royal Engineers, succeeding Sir Samuel G. Joseph. In 1938 Devereux assisted the automotive engineer Stewart Tresilian to setup his Templewood Engineering consultancy, to sell High Duty Alloys' products into the motor and motor-racing industries. This also encouraged the development of these alloys as extrusions, and the development of alloys more suitable for extrusion.  World War II  When World War II broke out, Devereux was appointed Director of Forgings and Castings at the Ministry of Aircraft Production. In 1941 he was made Controller of North American Aircraft Supply, and responsible for the receipt, assembly and repair of American aircraft supplied under Lend-Lease.  Personal life  When war ended he returned once more to the metallurgical research side of engineering, and among his enterprises in 1945 were the founding of the Fulmer Research Institute at Stoke Poges and the Associated Light Metal Industries Group (Almin). He was awarded the CBE in 1949 in recognition of his services to research and industry. He was a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society and, in 1952 was elected vice-chairman of the Royal Aero Club. For the second time he became an Honorary Colonel, of the newly-reformed as a Territorial regiment, the 114 (1st London) Army Engineer Regiment, Royal Engineers. He was also a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Coachmakers and Coach Harness Makers and a member of the Institution of Naval Architects. From 1939 he had been elected a Life Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. Post-war he lived at Meads, on the Stoke Park estate, Buckinghamshire. He also owned Round Hill Farm, a Dairy Shorthorn farm at Kimble, Buckinghamshire. This farm was one of the first to adopt artificial insemination in the UK. He hunted, aided by his daughter, Ethne. In 1946 he was the master of the Old Berkeley Hunt (West) and joint master of the South Oxfordshire Hunt. Ethne Gamble, (n√©e Devereux) (1918‚Äì1994), lived at the farm until her death, aged 76. He fell ill at Ascot on 21 June 1952 and died at home at Stoke Park the same day.

It has smooth dark grey to tan-coloured or creamy white bark, glossy dark green, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and cup-shaped to conical fruit. Description Eucalyptus distuberosa is a mallet that typically grows to a height of but does not form a lignotuber. It has smooth dark grey to tan- coloured or creamy-white bark that is shed in long ribbons. Adult leaves are glossy dark green, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils, usually in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and wide with a conical to turban-shaped operculum. The flowers are white and the fruit is a woody cup-shaped to conical capsule, long and wide with the valves near the level of the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus distuberosa was first formally described in 2009 by Dean Nicolle and the description was published in the journal Nuytsia from a specimen he collected in 2000 north-east of Yellowdine. The specific epithet (distuberosa) is derived from the Latin words dis meaning \\"without\\" or \\"not\\" and tuberosus meaning \\"full of lumps\\", referring to the lack of a lignotuber in this species. There are two subspecies recognised by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus distuberosa subsp. aerata that has prominently ribbed buds and fruit; * Eucalyptus distuberosa subsp. distuberosa that lacks ornamentation on the buds and fruit, although intermediates are known. Distribution This mallet grows in mallee mainly between Yellowdine, the Frank Hann National Park and Norseman in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions of Western Australia. Subspecies aerata is only known from the Bronzite Ridge between Lake Johnston and Norseman. Conservation status Eucalyptus distuberosa subsp. distuberosa is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife but subspecies aerata is classified as \\"Priority One\\" meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.

When his younger brother Archie Bray became truant, family legend relates that Roger became adamant that his brother would have the education he lacked and personally marched him to school every day. Archie would later go on to attend University of Cambridge as a First Class King's Scholar, Triple distinction and became a prominent professor of biology at the University of Montana, Harvard and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute along with mentor to Nobel laureate Harold Urey.

Bray was a former Methodist lay preacher, who said he had discovered ‚Äúthat Christianity was not the means of correcting social injustice‚Äù. Bray joined the Canadian Army in 1916 while unemployed; later explaining he had ‚Äúno job and a large family.‚Äù After World War I, Bray left religion and became an active socialist and vocal admirer of the Bolshevik Revolution.Family audio recorded interview with son-in-law of Roger Ernest Bray - Thomas Riggs Youngson (husband of Constance Ethel Bray) by William Todd Hudson about 1985.  Conditions leading to his arrest  Bray had returned to Winnipeg from England on 31 December 1918. Inflation had risen 75% and the workweek had increased since 1914 making living conditions for the working class very difficult. It was evident that some of the elites had made a tremendous amount of money off of the war but wages had changed little for workers and jobs were sparse for returning soldiers. In many cases families were worse off than before the soldiers left. Owners were unwilling to agree to collective bargaining only dealing directly with their impoverished workers on an individual basis. The city ground to a halt on May 15, 1919 when about one-sixth of Winnipeg's population ‚Äî an estimated 25,000 to 35,000 people ‚Äî walked off the job. On the heals of the Russian Revolution, the strike committee effectively took over control of the distribution of food in the city, and the elites of the city became concerned that socialist strikers like Bray were seeking to overthrow the government. As the strike wore on, Bray became a spokesman for returned soldiers in a series of meetings in Victoria Park, and chairman of an informal group of returned soldier strikers. Led by Bray thousands of these veterans in early June 1919 defied mayoral decrees to stop protest marches and instead marched on the office of Winnipeg Mayor Charles Gray and made repeated calls for his resignation. On 14 June 1919, a secret agent of the Royal North West Mounted Police informed the superintendent of the Winnipeg District that Bray was ‚Äúat the present time the most dangerous person in the City.‚Äù Bray was arrested along with seven other strike leaders on 17 June 1919 by the government on charges of seditious conspiracy. Bray became Vice-President of the Winnipeg Labour Council formed by the One Big Union on 5 August 1919. At his sedition trial in 1920, Bray was acquitted on most charges and convicted only on the charge of conspiracy to commit a common criminal nuisance. He was sentenced to six months in prison. Bray subsequently became an organizer for the One Big Union.  Later political activities and death  Bray eventually moved to North Vancouver where he raised gladioli and was an organizer for the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation a precursor political party to the New Democratic Party.

The car is set to be eligible in a series of Championships worldwide, such as the European Le Mans Series, and the IMSA Prototype Challenge. The car was launched on the 4th of June 2019, and was the first Gen II LMP3 to be revealed.  Developmental History  On 23rd of May 2018, the Automobile Club de I'Ouest announced a brief outline for the 2020 Generation 2 Le Mans Prototype 3 (LMP3) regulations, alongside chassis models from four manufacturers ‚Äì Onroak Automotive (Ligier), Duqueine Automotive (Norma), ADESS AG and Ginetta being announced as granted homologation for the new ruleset. On 7th of February 2019, the ACO announced the new 2nd Generation Le Mans Prototype 3 (LMP3) regulations, with full implementation due by 2021, and to be raced from 2020 to 2024. Its predecessor, the Ligier JS P3 was released at a time when LMP3 cars were not intended to race on the Circuit de la Sarthe, and as such, the car was less focused on Aerodynamic efficiency, leading to its lower top speed relative to later LMP3 cars, most notably the Norma M30. As a result, the design department of Ligier Automotive moved to optimise the car's aerodynamics to make the car efficient on all the circuits, in collaboration with Exa Corporation. The car features 95% new bodywork, Ohlins dampers and an adapted cooling system. In addition, as per the new Generation 2 Regulations, Traction control has been introduced, while some safety-related changes have been made to the driver's headrest and seat, along with Zylon side panels. A new engine, the Nissan VK56 is also introduced, with an additional 35 hp. The car had its initial shakedown at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours, ahead of its unveiling.

Municipal Building/Old City Hall The district is in area and is roughly bounded by Grand St., Lincoln St., 7th St., and University Ave. It was deemed significant as \\"the best example of a turn-of- the-century commercial and institutional center remaining in New Mexico. In addition to stores, offices and banks, the district housed various institutions of civic improvement, including the state's first city hall, an opera house (now demolished), a Masonic Temple and a YMCA. Its buildings retain the scale, space, and‚Äîto a large extent‚Äî the architectural quality of the district as it had developed by 1922. The buildings represent a sometimes provincial, though competent, realization of a variety of architectural styles originating in the East and California. The district contains a significant collection of buildings (at least four and perhaps as many as eight) designed by the important, though little studied, Western architects, Rapp and Rapp. Of secondary significance, the district contains three examples of local stonecarving and, in addition, represents a typical example of railroad-era, speculative town planning.\\" With It includes the Masonic Temple, at 514 Douglas, (see photos 5, 8, 18), a Richardsonian Romanesque structure built in 1894‚Äì95, designed by Rapp and Rapp and built by W.F.
