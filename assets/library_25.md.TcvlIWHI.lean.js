Concentration camp career Julius Ludolf worked at concentration camps from January 1940 to May 1945. At first he was commander of concentration camp Loibl, a satellite camp of the Mauthusen Gusen concentration camp system in the Karavanke mountains. In August 1943 he took over for Karl Sch√∂pperle in the subcamp of Gro√üraming and starting from May 1944 the final commander of satellite camp Melk affiliated with the Steyr-Daimler-Puch company. After 1945 After the end of war Julius Ludolf was charged along with sixty other camp personnel in the Mauthausen-Gusen camp trials held before a United States military court at Dachau (part of the Dachau Trials). Apart from overall conditions in the camps, which stood under his responsibility, Ludolf was accused of having on different occasions to have personally struck or killed Polish and Russian prisoners between October 1943 - May 1944. He was also accused of having ordered, in October 1944, that sixteen hospitalized Czech and Slovak prisoners be killed by lethal injection. He was charged with having arranged, in July 1944, the execution of Russian prisoner who was recaptured after an escape. Heard as a witness in his own case, Ludolf said he never killed a prisoner and at most took actions to enforce camp discipline. Executions of camp escapees would not have taken place on his authority. On 13 May 1946 the US court in Dachau found Ludolf guilty and condemned him to death. After his wife's plea for clemency was rejected, Julius Ludolf was executed on 28 May 1947 at Landsberg Prison. References Klee, Ernst, Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich.

It was intended to be the first Palm Springs building visitors saw when approaching the city from the north via California State Route 111. The building, with its distinctive, cantilevered, wedge-shaped canopy (referred to as a hyperbolic paraboloid on a historic marker mounted on the building) was built in 1965 and designed by Albert Frey and Robson C. Chambers. It is considered to be a prime example of modernist architecture. The station had closed by the mid-1990s, and its fate was in doubt until its purchase by a private interest, who erected a wall around the property and converted it into an art gallery.

The Harderian gland is a gland found within the eye's orbit that occurs in tetrapods (reptiles, amphibians, birds and mammals) that possess a nictitating membrane. The gland can be compound tubular or compound tubuloalveolar, and the fluid it secretes (mucous, serous or lipid) varies between different groups of animals. In some animals, it acts as an accessory to the lacrimal gland, secreting fluid that eases movement of the nictitating membrane. Research has proposed that the gland has several other functions, including that of a photoprotective organ, a location of immune response, a source of thermoregulatory lipids, a source of pheromones, a site of osmoregulation, inter alia. In mammals, the gland secretes an oily substance used to preen the fur. The presence or absence of this gland is one of the cues used by palaeontologists to determine when fur evolved in the ancestors of mammals. The Harderian gland was first described in 1694 by Swiss anatomist Johann Jacob Harder (1656‚Äì1711). He documented his findings in a paper titled Glandula nova lachrymalis una cum ductu excretorio in cervis et damis, (\\"A new lachrymal gland with an excretory duct in red and fallow deer\\", English translation).

Bryn Mawr: Friends of the Wanamaker Organ Press, 1999. and is remembered for building pipe organs of exceptional beauty and quality. Background Originally from Illinois, Harris and his family moved to Los Angeles when he was 18. The young Harris went into business as a jeweler and watchmaker. In 1888 he married and shortly thereafter moved back to the East Coast, where he tuned pianos. He eventually apprenticed in organ building with George Hutchings in Boston where he honed his skill at voicing organ pipes, which is one of the most difficult tasks in the organ-building process. In 1894 the 28-year-old Harris was on his way back to Los Angeles to install several organs there for Hutchings but shortly thereafter broke away from Hutchings to open his own organ building company. He began making organs in Los Angeles in 1895. California was an ideal place for the organ factory due to its abundant natural resources. Both metal and wood resources were plentiful and so Los Angeles saw the birth of its first organ factory. Harris knew that to expand his workforce he would need to adapt to the new electro-pneumatic developments that allowed pipes to be placed at any distance from the console and organs of virtually unlimited size. In September 1900 an insurgent group led by master organbuilder William Boone Fleming was lured from the Votey Organ Co. in Detroit to begin building windchests for Harris using the Fleming electro-pneumatic system. Organ architect George Ashdown Audsley also made design contributions to Harris Organs. Harris looked toward making luxury organs and also made forays into the lucrative residence-organ market headed by the Aeolian Company. In 1904 Aeolian would begin a series of successful lawsuits against the Harris Co. for patent infringement. Harris Organs At the turn of the century California was experiencing an incredible growth in population due, in large part, to the discovery of oil there. The growing population meant the need for more churches and, in turn, for more organs. By 1899 there were 154 churches in Los Angeles. This meant that there was a large demand for organs there and Harris intended to meet this demand. Consequently, many of the organs produced went to area churches. Two of the most notable organs produced are the 1901 Stanford University Memorial Church and the 1905 Congregation Sherith Israel organs. Both of these organs are still in use and both have been recently restored. Perhaps Harris's most important historical contribution, however, comes in the building of the organ for the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair which, after the fair, became the core of the famed Wanamaker Grand Court Organ (see Wanamaker Grand Court Organ for more information about the instrument). With around 10,000 pipes, it was, at the time, the world's largest organ. Harris is quoted as saying, \\"It will be the largest in the world. Positively the largest.\\" The organ was so large (and expensive), in fact, that it wound up causing Harris significant financial trouble. Nonetheless the organ was completed and at the fair it brought down the house (literally during one concert where vibrations from the bass pipes in the organ brought down part of Festival Hall's plaster ceiling) winning a gold medal. Angered by Harris's careless planning, heavy spending and speculative indiscretions, the company ousted him and reorganized as the Los Angeles Art Organ Company under new majority stockholder Eben Smith. Harris re-entered organ building under his own name in 1906. By 1913 Harris's new company experienced financial difficulties and came under the umbrella of the Johnston Piano and Organ Co. For a time Harris became a car salesman. Harris then ran his own brokerage firm in Los Angeles until his death in 1922. He is buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, Cal.

Prehistoric art  Native Americans have lived in southeastern Oregon for at least 15,000 years, according to a 2012 find in the Paisley Caves. At that time, pluvial lakes filled many of the high desert basins. Little is known about the people who occupied the land at that time, except that they camped and hunted near the lakes.

In 1840, when the first white men came through southern Oregon, the Fort Bidwell Band and the Harney Valley Band of the Northern Paiute tribe lived in the southeastern part of Oregon around Greaser Canyon. However, given the age of the carvings, it is possible that the Northern Paiute people had nothing to do with their creation. The meanings of the Greaser petroglyphs are not known. They may have been used in religious ceremonies or marked tribal ownership of territory. The designs may have been map directions or simply art created to tell a personal story. No one knows.  Protection  Because prehistoric petroglyph sites have great archaeological value and are often associated with Native American cultural practices, they are identified for protection when located on federal lands. A majority of the government-owned petroglyph sites have been officially designated as \\"Areas of Critical Environmental Concern\\". This ensures maximum protection and careful preservation of these valuable cultural resources. There are also some sites of unique importance to the study of prehistory or of particularly cultural significance that have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Because of its cultural significance and unique archaeological value, the Greaser Petroglyph Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 20 November 1974.\\"Greaser Petroglyph Site\\", National Register of Historic Places, www.nationalregisterofhistoricalplaces.com, 19 January 2009.\\"Greaser Petroglyph Site\\" , www.ourhistoricplaces.com, 2008. The Greaser petroglyphs were vandalized at least once. However, Bureau of Land Management archaeologists were able to repair the damage. Today, a sign warns visitors that altering the petroglyph designs in any way is a violation of federal law and can ruin the works.  Location  The Greaser Petroglyph Site is located east of Lakeview, Oregon. The site is in the Warner Valley near Greaser Canyon, east of the unincorporated community of Adel.

It is the sequel to the 1989 film Psycho Cop.  Plot  In a coffeehouse, Officer Joe Vickers, a serial killer empowered by Satan, overhears Brian and Larry, a pair white- collar workers, discussing a bachelor party that they are planning to throw in their workplace for their friend Gary. Vickers follows the two to their office, and stakes it out in his car (which is full of body parts and demonic imagery) until after hours, which is when Larry bribes the security guard into letting in three strippers. Vickers tricks the guard into letting him in, then stabs him in the eye with a pencil. Vickers sabotages the lifts, and when Mike goes downstairs to tell the night watchman about it, Vickers throws him down an elevator shaft. Vickers proceeds to send vaguely threatening faxes to the partiers, though this does not deter the drunken Gary from going up onto the roof with one of the strippers. The two are found by Vickers, who shoots Gary in the head, and throws the stripper off of the building. Vickers continues to send faxes, prompting Brian, Larry, and the remaining two strippers to go to the copy room, while elsewhere Vickers uses a decorative spear to impale a pair of workers who were having sex in a storage closet. Larry, Brian, and the strippers flee when Mike and Gary's bodies fall through the ceiling of the copy room, and run into Sharon, an accountant who had stayed late. The quintet try to call 911, but the lines are not working, and while looking around to see if anyone else is in the building, they find the skewered couple, and are confronted by Vickers. Initially feigning being there to help, Vickers shoots Larry in the mouth, wounds Brian, and chases the others. The women try to escape through the front entrance, but the door is shatterproof, and handcuffed shut. While the trio make their way up to the garage exit, they are attacked by Vickers, who shoots one stripper, and snaps the neck of the other. Sharon is pursued by Vickers, but manages to set his face on fire (causing one of his sunglasses lenses to melt to his eye) and knock him down an elevator shaft, but he survives the fall. Sharon makes it out through the garage, and is chased through the streets by Vickers, who catches her outside a bar. The patrons of the bar see Vickers attacking Sharon, and in a parody of the Rodney King incident, they beat down the officer as a bystander videotapes the scene from his apartment balcony. Sharon, Brian, and Vickers are all taken to a hospital, where Vickers is healed by demonic forces, massacres the police officers and medical staff watching him, and storms out of his room.

Both games were later distributed in the United Kingdom and translated into English. Quicksilva distributed Fred while Mikro-Gen handled Sir Fred's UK release. Both games were well received with critics, and Crash Magazine gave Sir Fred a 91 percent rating. La abad√≠a del crimen In 1988, Men√©ndez teamed with Juan Delc√°n to write La abad√≠a del crimen (The Abbey of Crime) for Opera Soft. The game was to be a version of Umberto Eco's book The Name of the Rose but a license was not obtained as Eco never replied to Men√©ndez's request, so the game was renamed La abad√≠a del crimen. Originally made for the Amstrad CPC, it was then ported to other 8-bit computers the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and the MSX. The game was critically acclaimed for its graphics, sound and detail. The game helped Men√©ndez claim the Best Spanish Programmer award from Spanish Spectrum magazine MicroHobby. Despite its very positive critical reviews, and its moderate commercial success, the game was never officially released outside Spain. Aftermath After La abad√≠a del crimen, Men√©ndez left the scene in order to finish his degree in Telecom Engineering. It is believed that the progressive commercialism in the videogame market and bad experiences with Mikro-Gen's distribution of Sir Fred was Men√©ndez's reasons for his sudden departure.

While construction on the apartment complex above and behind the mansion site was underway one builder was killed and many others were injured whilst working on the eighth storey. The company involved in pouring the molds for the concrete pillars, Melbourne Transit Pty Ltd was convicted and fined $100,000 by county court judge for breaching occupation and safety regulations and forced into liquidation. The heritage listed property needed to be excavated to make way for a 3-storey underground car park that extended 10 metres below ground surface level. The Mansion building had to be safely supported during all phases of the work, especially during excavation of the 10m deep basement. This excavation was the critical activity that could result in damage to the Mansion. The retention of a heritage building on this commercial site imposed financial penalties on the development as well as physical constraints.

While a student at the University of Michigan, Doherty won the American decathlon championship in 1928 and 1929 and won the bronze medal in the event at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. He later served as a track coach at Princeton University (1929‚Äì1930), the University of Michigan (1930‚Äì1948), and the University of Pennsylvania (1948‚Äì1957). He was also the meet director for the Penn Relays from 1956 to 1969 and of the first dual track meet between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1959. He was also a published author of works on track coaching, and his Track & Field Omnibook was regarded as \\"the track coach's bible\\" from the 1970s through the 1990s. Doherty has been inducted into at least six athletic halls of fame, including the National Track and Field Hall of Fame and athletic halls of fame at the University of Pennsylvania, University of Michigan, and Wayne State University. Early years Born of Canadian parents who crossed the Detroit River to find work in Detroit, Michigan, Doherty recalled learning about track and field at age six when the local pole vault champion lived across the street: \\"I took my mother's clothes pole and tried to clear a string stretched across two fence posts.\\" Doherty attended Detroit's Western High School where he did not earn a letter. He later recalled being small for his age in high school and joked that, at the end of high school, \\"they gave me a letter for long and faithful service!\\" Two-time decathlon champion He enrolled in the College of the City of Detroit (later known as Wayne State University) in 1923 but did not try out for the track team until his junior year. He tried out for the track team as a high jumper, but the school's track coach, David L. Holmes, saw Doherty's potential as an all-around athlete in the decathlon, and entered him in competitions in the Penn Relays, the Illinois relays and the Ohio Relays. Doherty won four letters at Detroit City College, and was elected the student body president. He trained indoor on a track built in the 1880s for City College's \\"Old Main,\\" when that large building served as Detroit's Central High School. He trained for outdoor track on a field maintained by the City of Detroit on an island in the Detroit River, Belle Isle, two miles from City College. As Doherty indicates in his autobiography, the outdoors team had neither dressing room nor showers. Even in his time, these facilities were outdated. Doherty graduated from Detroit City College in 1927 and enrolled at the University of Michigan where he trained for the Olympics under Wolverines track coaches, Steve Farrell and Charles B. Hoyt. He also earned a master's degree at Michigan in 1933. In 1928 Doherty won the decathlon at the United States Olympic Trials (which doubled as the AAU national outdoor championships) with a score of 7,600.52 points; due to poor weather conditions, the competition was held over three days instead of the usual two. At the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, he placed third in the decathlon with a score of 7,706.65 behind Paavo Yrj√∂l√§ (8,053.29 points) and Akilles J√§rvinen (7,624.135 points). Doherty was in fifth place for most of the Olympic competition, but moved into third as a result of his performance in the javelin throw and running the 1,500 meters in 4 minutes, 54 seconds.Ken Doherty. sports-reference.com Doherty capped his career as a decathlete in 1929 when he repeated as AAU champion in Denver with an American record score of 7,784.68 points. Sports writer Paul Lowry wrote about Doherty's record- setting performance: \\"Ken Doherty broke the record in the decathlon ‚Äì ten of the most grueling events imaginable, and all run off on the same day.\\" Doherty reported that he felt fresh after the 1929 decathlon championship taking in a banquet and motion-picture show the night after the competition and arising the next day \\"to make a 350-mile auto trip without a feeling of strain or exhaustion.\\" Doherty's trip to Denver for the 1929 also doubled as a honeymoon tour with his wife of a few weeks. Track coach =University of Michigan= Doherty, described as \\"a lean, quiet Scot,\\" retired from competition in 1929 and accepted a position as a coach at Detroit Southwestern High School in 1929. He next accepted a position as an assistant track coach at Princeton University where he worked under the school's legendary track coach Keene Fitzpatrick in 1929‚Äì1930. In 1930, Doherty was hired by the University of Michigan as its assistant track coach serving under the Wolverines' new head coach, Charles B. Hoyt. He remained Hoyt's assistant for nine years and took over as Michigan's head track coach in 1939 when Hoyt accepted a job at Yale. Doherty served nine years as Michigan's head coach, leading Michigan to seven Big Ten Conference championships (four indoor and three outdoor). In his 18 years as an assistant and head coach at Michigan, he coached some of the schools all-time great athletes, including the following: *Eddie Tolan ‚Äì set the world record in the 100-yard dash and won Olympic gold medals at the 1932 Summer Olympics in the 100-meter and 200-meter runs. *Sam Stoller ‚Äì one of two Jews on the American track team at the 1936 Berlin Olympics; controversy sparked when he was pulled from the 4 x 100 meter relay event *William Watson ‚Äì won 12 individual Big Ten Conference championships, including three consecutive championships (1937‚Äì1939) in the long jump, discus and shot put; first African-American to win the AAU decathlon championship in 1940 *Elmer Gedeon ‚Äì tied a world record in the high hurdles in 1938; shot down and killed while piloting a B-26 bomber on a mission over France in April 1944. *Willis Ward ‚Äì collegiate champion in the high jump, long jump, 100-yard dash, and 400-yard dash; finished second in voting for AP Big Ten Athlete of the Year in 1933; second African-American to letter in football at Michigan. *Bob Osgood ‚Äì set a world record in the 120-yard high hurdles in 1937 and Big Ten champion in 1936 and 1937 *Robert H. Hume and H. Ross Hume ‚Äì the \\"dead heat twins\\" who were champions in the mile and regularly finished their races holding hands in dead heat victories. *Bob Ufer ‚Äì set the world indoor record in the 440 yards and later the radio voice of Michigan football *Don Canham ‚Äì All-America who won the 1940 NCAA title in the high jump and was both the indoor and outdoor Big Ten Conference champion in both 1940 and 1941; succeeded Doherty as Michigan's track coach and became a school legend as its athletic director in 1968‚Äì1988 *Charlie Fonville ‚Äì NCAA shot put champion in 1947 and 1948; set world record in 1948 Doherty earned a Ph.D. degree in educational psychology from the University of Michigan in 1948. =University of Pennsylvania= In April 1948, Doherty accepted the job as track coach at the University of Pennsylvania At Penn, Doherty developed track stars, including Dick Hart, Charles Emermy, Willie Lee and John Haines. Doherty drew national publicity in February 1957 when he suspended 20-year-old runner (and future movie star) Bruce Dern from the Penn track team. Dern drew Doherty's ire for his sideburns that a United Press reporter compared to those of Elvis Presley. It was reported that \\"the bobby-soxers squealed and howled and shrieked, 'Go, Elvis, go!' when Dern ran on Penn's two-mile relay team.\\" Doherty insisted that Dern shave, and Dern declined. In removing Dern from the track team, Doherty refused to say the sideburns were the cause and instead told a reporter: \\"He preferred not to continue with the team is the best way of putting it. Team members are expected to be representatives of the university and this applies to many things. Obviously, any man who can't live up to these things automatically puts himself off the team.\\" Press accounts at the time noted that Dern's father was a Chicago lawyer and a University of Pennsylvania Trustee. An associate of Doherty recalled Doherty as \\"a very thorough man with a stubborn streak.\\" When Doherty kicked Dern off the team after he refused to cut his hair, Fabricus recalled that people told him, \\"You can't do that. His father is a trustee.\\" But, according to Doherty's associate, \\"Ken said he had ground rules, and that was that.\\" In May 1957, three months after the negative publicity resulting from the Dern incident, Doherty announced his retirement after nine years as Penn's coach. Doherty stated at the time that he wanted to free up his time to devote himself to more intensive planning of the relays. Meet director After retiring as a track coach, Doherty devoted himself to work as a meet director. In 1956‚Äì1969, Doherty served as the meet director for the Penn Relays, a three-day event that became known as \\"the world's largest track and field carnival.\\" From 1959 to 1967, he was also the meet director of The Philadelphia Inquirer Games, a major indoor track and field competition. In 1959, he was the meet director for the first dual meet between the United States and the Soviet Union. He was also the meet director for the 1961 NCAA Outdoor Championships. In addition to his work as a meet director, Doherty conducted track clinics in the Soviet Union, Finland, Canada and India. Author He was also the author of articles and popular books on coaching track and field. In 1941, he published the book Solving Camp Behavior Problems based on his work as a director of the Boys' Camp at the National Music Camp in Michigan. In 1953, he published Modern Track & Field. His most popular work was the multi-edition Track & Field Omnibook, first published in 1971 and \\"generally regarded as the track coach's bible.\\" The Omnibook, published in four editions and in print until 1995, was the first comprehensive book on track coaching; it went beyond technique and also covered sports psychology and methods of motivation. Doherty's books were translated into Russian, Finnish, Spanish and Japanese. It has been said that Doherty had \\"more knowledge about track and field techniques than any man of his generation.\\" When the Track and Field Hall of Fame Library was established at Butler University, Doherty donated his collection to the library, which included thousands of books, periodicals and manuscripts related to the history of track and field in the United States; the collection was moved to the library of the AAFLA in Los Angeles in 2001 where it is open for public view. Honors Doherty has received many honors for his achievements in the world of track and field, including the following: * Inducted into the Helms Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1961. * Inducted in the University of Michigan Men's Track Hall of Fame in 1970. * Inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1976. * Inducted into the Wayne State University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1977. * Inducted into the University of Pennsylvania Athletics Hall of Fame in 1998. * Inducted into the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2001. * An annual fellowship in Doherty's name is administered by the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles. Doherty also served as President of the National Track and Field Coaches Association in 1956 and became a fellow of the American College of Sports Medicine in 1957. Prior to his induction into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame, Doherty had been chairman of the selection committee for two years. He was inducted the year after he stepped down from the committee and, on his selection, Doherty said: > Each part of my career has its own significance to me. I look back at the > decathlon, which at that time was not as popular as it is today. My > coaching, well, it was great working with the boys. My books are more > important than anything to me now. And being recognized by those within my > sport is the greatest compliment I could hope for. Family and death Doherty died in 1996 at age 90 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, three years after his wife Lucile Mason. They had two sons, Dr. Lynn M. Doherty and Dr. Robert W. Doherty, and five grandchildren: Robert G. Doherty, Kathryn Doherty, Ian Doherty, Michael Doherty, and Sue Ann Doherty.

He died on 21 January 2009 in Cardiff from emphysema. Career Born at 13 Garth Street, Cardiff, Gee's early influences were Scotty Moore and Chet Atkins and, aged 18, he went to Nashville and Memphis, but failed to meet his heroes. He worked in New York, on a working visa, but quickly left when he received draft papers for the US Army. Early in his career Gee was the musical director of The Senators, Tom Jones' backing band when he was still known as Tommy Scott. Gee left and joined Joe Cocker's Grease Band. Later in the 1960s, he played alongside Dave Edmunds and close friend, bassist John David Williams, in the band Human Beans. His relationship with Edmunds continued for many years playing on several of his records, most notably on his multi-million selling number one single \\"I Hear You Knocking\\" in 1970. Mickey also teamed up with drummer Rob (Congo) Jones and bassist/vocalist Eddie Williams to form the band Arthur Mellow in the 1960s. This trio produced some outstanding music and were highly thought of by fellow musicians. Congo went on to work with Dave Edmunds in Love Sculpture, spent time with Sassafras and toured with Budgie. During the 1980s, Gee became a member of Shakin' Stevens' backing band adding lead guitar to the number one singles This Ole House, Green Door and Oh Julie (a relationship that dated back to a brief stint in Shaky's earlier backing band The Sunsets in 1971). Gee's distinctive playing style was much in demand during the 1980s. Gee's band Memphis Bend regularly supported Carl Perkins on Uk tours which led to Gee becoming part of Carl Perkins' star studded backing band in 1985, which, along with Edmunds, also included George Harrison, Ringo Starr and Eric Clapton for his Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session. During the same year, Gee was involved in Bill Wyman's Willie and the Poor Boys project which also featured Charlie Watts and Jimmy Page. Gee provided the soundtrack of the 1997 film Twin Town, and was still regularly performing until shortly before his death from emphysema at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales in January 2009.

However, upon entering a church on a certain occasion he heard the words of the Prophet Isaiah (1:16) 'Wash you (of your sins), make you clean;' with this a profound conversion was effected in his soul. Thus converted Nikita left all he possessed and entered upon the ascetic life near Pereyaslavl. His discipline led him to bind himself in chains and enclose himself within a pillar, thus the title 'stylite'. He became well known as a healer.

Early life Francisco Jos√© de Ovando was born in the city of Caceres in Extremadura. In 1710, at the age of seventeen, he joined the Spanish Army as a cadet, and in 1717 he transferred to the naval infantry, as a member of which he participated in the capture of Sicily in July 1718, during the War of the Quadruple Alliance. After a period of several years in which he returned to administrative work within the Spanish Army, he returned to the navy in 1728 as a lieutenant in charge of the frigate G√©nova. Two years later, he was commissioned to study naval construction at C√°diz. In 1731, he was given the command of the frigate Guip√∫zcoa, which as part of the fleet under Admiral Cornejo, took part in the attack to Livorno. =Capture of Brindisi= He was promoted to Captain in 1733 and took command of the frigate Galga, which as part of the fleet of the Marquis of Clavijo captured Naples during the War of the Polish Succession. In 1734 he was sent to capture the castle of Brindisi near Tarento. In that opportunity, he personally landed and led a force composed of 200 men from his ship and 100 naval infantry to capture the fortress. After the battle he sailed back to Naples, where he was personally congratulated by the Infante Don Carlos for his outstanding valor and performance in battle, and was rewarded with the title of Marquis of Brindisi (in most literature he appears credited as Marquis of Ovando, which is simply a corruption of his title and his last name), was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and was given the command of the Man-of-war El Le√≥n, of seventy cannons. In 1736, Ovando took command of the frigate San Cayetano, which he sailed to Veracruz to join the Windward Fleet (), and was sent to the Antilles to root out smugglers and European traders, mainly British and Dutch, who were violating the monopoly of the Spanish Main. In 1740 he participated, with his ship Drag√≥n, in the defense of Cartagena de Indias from the British attack of Admiral Vernon. The Spanish Prime Minister Marquis of Ensenada promoted Ovando in 1743 to Fleet Commander, charging him with the inspection of all the fortresses, harbors and arsenals in the Viceroyalty of Peru as inspector and commander-in-chief of the Southern Seas' Fleet (3). As Governor of Chile Francisco Jos√© de Ovando was appointed interim Governor of Chile by his predecessor Jos√© Antonio Manso de Velasco, who had been promoted to Viceroy of Peru and whom he had travelled to Valpara√≠so to escort back to Peru. He took over his position on July 28, 1745 and remained there until March 26 of the following year, when his successor, Domingo Ort√≠z de Rosas, arrived. He immediately returned to his fleet command on board of the ship San Ferm√≠n and departed to chart the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands. On October 26, 1746, he was eyewitness of the devastating Lima-Callao earthquake of which he (and his family) was one of the few survivors.Ovando's letter to a friend, printed in Antonio Valladares Semanario erudito. Madrid : Blas Roman 1799 XVI, S.239-264 (in Spanish) Other notable acts undertaken during his government were the creation, on March 11, 1747, of the first University in the colonial territory of Chile: the Royal University of San Felipe (Real Universidad de San Felipe), of which the first rector was Tom√°s de Az√∫a e Iturgoyen.

Etymology of the name After his wars with the Taira clan and ≈åsh≈´'s Fujiwara clan, in 1189 sh≈çgun Yoritomo founded a temple called Y≈çfuku-ji to comfort the souls of the samurai that had died in them.Kusumoto (2002:44-45) The temple was erected in a location next to today's Kamakura-g≈´. Its main hall was a two-story building called Nikaid≈ç, which was copied from Chuson-ji's in Hiraizumi, a building the sh≈çgun had greatly admired. In time, that famous building gave its name to the entire area where it stood. According to another theory, however, the name comes from that of an important clan vassal of the Minamoto, also called Nikaid≈ç, because that's where the clan's mansion used to stand. Y≈çfuku-ji was expanded several times, finally becoming a great temple with many pavilions and a great artificial lake. It was often visited by Yoritomo, his wife H≈çj≈ç Masako, and their descendants, who liked spending time there. The temple no longer exists, but exactly when and how it was destroyed isn't known. We do know that at the end of the Muromachi period it stopped appearing in written records and that it burned down many times, the last we know of in 1405. The area where it used to stand is now public property, and the city of Kamakura plans to turn it into an historical park.

Accessed on: January 24, 2009. Plot First version The play was written for the anniversary of the 1917 revolution, and was accepted by the Central Bureau to be part of the festivities. The title is likely a reference to the opera buffa/op√©ra bouffe, comic opera genres popular at the time. This original version was directed and produced by Vsevolod Meyerhold, and the art was done by Kazimir Malevich. The premiere was in the Theatre of Musical Drama on November 7, 1918. Mayakovsky himself played the role of the \\"simple man\\", as well as some bit roles including Methuselah and one of the demons. This version of the play lasted three seasons. Second version After two years, Mayakovsky reworked the text of his play. This second version premiered in the First Theatre of the RSFSR on May 1, 1921. A printed edition of the second version was released in June of that year. This version of the play lasted about 100 shows. Later versions A 60-minute animated film adaptation of the play was made in 1969, directed by David Cherkasskiy. It was the first animated feature to be made in Ukraine. The Soviet government banned screenings outside of the Ukrainian SSR.Collection of Russian articles about the 1969 film, translated to English. Accessed on: Jan. 30, 2009.

Ken Ota Kenji Ota (May 14, 1923 ‚Äì November 10, 2015) was a second-generation Japanese-American, also known as Nisei, raised in Lompoc, California. He and his family were placed in the Japanese internment camps of World War II. There, he met and married his wife, Miye Ota. In 1948, after his release from the internment camp, Ota settled in Goleta, California, and with his family's help, built a home from bricks on the converted swamplands. Ota died November 10, 2015, in Goleta, California. Miye Ota Miye Tachihara Ota (born August 26, 1918), was raised in Guadalupe, California. Like Ken, she is also Nisei and she and her family were placed in the Japanese internment camps of World War II, where she met her future husband at the Gila River Relocation Center. Following her release from internment camp and a brief stay in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Miye leveraged her pre-war beauty school training to open her own salon, which the Otas built themselves from bricks attached to their home in Goleta. Miye would go on to be one of the founding members of the Goleta Chamber of Commerce and was recognized decades later as \\"Goleta's Finest Woman of the Year\\" during the Chamber's 69th year. Ballroom dance Ken dancing on television with Sheila Webber-Sloan at the California Star BallThe Otas were avid partner-dancers involved with various social dance circles within the Santa Barbara County. Following their mastery of square dancing, they began ballroom dance training at the local Arthur Murray Dance Studio. As they progressed in their dance training they sought out higher levels of instruction, which involved commuting to Los Angeles for lessons from a new group of English instructors teaching International Style.http://www.goletaaikido.net/about.html Alex Moore certified both Ken and Miye in the International Style of ballroom dance. Ken went on to be the first man in the U.S. to get the highest Arthur Murray student credentials, Triple Gold Star and Gold Bar. The Otas were also certified through the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD). Ken's most notable instructor was Sheila Webber-Sloan, a national ballroom dance champion; the Webber-Sloan and Ota partnership garnered multiple awards and had several appearances on television, including a broadcast of the California Star Ball. It was not until chaperoning a school dance for their son, Steve Ota, did they feel compelled to start teaching dance lessons to children; they believed children could learn more tasteful ways of dancing with each other. Having achieved their competitive goals, they founded a junior cotillion, where they could teach their son and his friends lessons in dance, manners, and other social graces. The Otas were also contracted to teach these classes by several schools and organizations over the years, including the Junior League of Santa Barbara. The popularity of their classes grew such that they built their own \\"cultural school\\" adjacent to their Goleta home. The school's brick structure houses a spacious hardwood floor surrounded by white benches and mirrors, and a ceiling that adorns two crystal chandeliers. For decades, Ken Ota taught ballroom dancing for UC Santa Barbara as a class for physical education credit, along with separate sessions open to the community through the university's leisure arts program. His classes also spawned several student-run social clubs that revolve around swing dancing, ballroom, and competitive ballroom dancing. Martial arts Ken Ota teaching Aikido, 1988Ken Ota originally practiced the grappling arts Sumo and Judo, which he regularly participated in from the time he had been placed in the Japanese internment camps of World War II. It was not until 1963 during his regular commutes to Los Angeles for dance lessons that he came across the art of Aikido. The whole Ota family enrolled in classes under Isao Takahashi. The Otas then moved onto training in Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido under Koichi Tohei. The Otas built their own \\"cultural school\\" next to their Goleta home, which could easily transform into a dojo when fitted with removable ' mats; the main wall adorns a traditional Japanese shomen, which includes photos of Morihei Ueshiba, Koichi Tohei, and a large ' symbol painted by Tohei himself. The Otas offered classes to children and adults in Judo and Aikido, and also consulted local law enforcement. Ken was hired to teach martial arts at UC Santa Barbara and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where he became advisor for several clubs, including a women's Judo team. Ken was also contracted by Panther Productions to produce a series of Aikido instructional videos. Ken and Miye's son, Steve, returned to Santa Barbara after completing his studies at San Jose State University, where he was a member of the championship Judo team. In the years since Steve's return, many of the adult and high-level classes have transitioned to Steve's direction, as he continues to train and receive recognized ranks in KI Aikido, along with teaching Aikido at UCSB.

John Carlin and Aaron Dessner approached Martin Mills and Richard Russell of Beggars Group with the idea for the album.

Production of the album was focused on supporting the Red Hot Organization, as Dessner says \\"a lot of the artists wouldn't take the money...Beggars agreed to be really transparent about how it's done, so as much money flows to the charity side as possible.\\" As of May 2012, Dark Was the Night has raised over $1.6 million, a sum that represents all the profits from worldwide sales.

It is based on the medieval legend of Pope Joan. For the most part this novel is the story of a young woman, whose desire to gain more knowledge compels her to dress up as a man, who (due to events beyond her control) eventually rises to become the pope. The novel has been adapted into a film, Pope Joan, released in 2009. Plot Joan, the daughter of a priest and his Saxon wife, is born in 814 as the last of three children. When he discovers that Joan has learned to read, her father calls her ‚Äúchild of the devil‚Äù and blames the illness and death of his oldest son, Matthew, on her as a punishment. When the middle child, John, is sent away to school, Joan goes with him and is reluctantly accepted as well due to her brilliance. As she cannot live with the other male students, she is sent to live with a knight, Gerold, and his family while she attends the school. Joan and Gerold soon fall in love. Although he remains faithful to his wife, she resents Joan and seizes an opportunity to force her into marriage at age 14. However, the ceremony is interrupted by Viking invaders. Joan narrowly escapes the attack, but her brother John is killed. She then decides to dress as a young man and joins the monastery at Fulda in her brother's place. There she becomes a skilled physician and is ordained as a priest. Her father visits her in Fulda, believing her to be John. When he discovers who she is, he dies of a stroke before he can expose her. When the plague comes to Fulda, Joan sickens. Afraid that they will discover that she is a woman, she flees and finds refuge with a family she once helped. After her convalescence she goes to Rome, where she becomes the personal physician to the Pope, Sergius, a weak man easily led by his venal brother Benedict. Joan attempts to guide Sergius so that the papacy becomes a force for good. Benedict resents her influence and attempts to frame her for breaking her vow of chastity. When the Frankish Emperor Lothar marches on Rome, Benedict flees with funds intended to try to placate him, and Joan is restored to her former place of authority. Benedict is apprehended by Gerold, now serving Lothar, and executed on Sergius' orders. Meanwhile, Gerold accidentally meets and recognizes Joan. He keeps her secret, but declares he loves her. Eventually they consummate their relationship and Joan becomes pregnant. Lothar and Anastasius charge Gerold, now commander of the Pope's militia, with corruption. Joan's quick thinking saves Gerold and they realise they must flee the city before her condition becomes obvious. Joan delays, insisting on staying until Easter as the people need her. Anastasius plans to seize the throne and realises he needs to remove Gerold before he can attack Joan directly. During a papal procession, Gerold is lured into a trap, stabbed from behind and killed. Already in pain, Joan runs to be with him but then miscarries in public and dies from blood loss. An epilogue reveals that Anastasius indeed took the papacy but could not hold it. He gained revenge of a sort by obliterating Joan from history, excluding her from his book on the lives of the Popes. However, an archbishop secretly makes restitution by restoring Joan's papacy in a copy of the book he makes himself‚Äîfor the archbishop is also secretly a woman, the daughter of the peasant family saved by Joan many years earlier.

Parts of the body of the rider and horse were found ten years earlier in a ditch filled with statues broken during the 480 BC Persian sack of Athens.

The statue is displayed with a plaster cast of the head at the Acropolis Museum while the head remains at the Louvre where it is displayed with a cast of the rest of the statue. The rider has many of the features typical of an Archaic kouros, but has several asymmetrical features that break with the period's conventions. Interpretations The statue was originally thought to be a part of a set of statues, perhaps paired with another as a mounted presentation of Castor and Pollux common on vases from this period.

The John Brownlee sex scandal occurred in 1934 in Alberta, Canada, and forced the resignation of the provincial Premier, John Edward Brownlee. Brownlee was accused of seducing Vivian MacMillan, a family friend and a secretary for Brownlee's attorney- general in 1930, when she was 18 years old, and continuing the affair for three years. MacMillan claimed that the married premier had told her that she must have sex with him for his own sake and that of his invalid wife. She had, she testified, relented after physical and emotional pressure. Brownlee called her story a fabrication, and suggested that it was the result of a conspiracy by MacMillan, her would-be fianc√©, and several of Brownlee's political opponents in the Alberta Liberal Party. MacMillan and her father sued Brownlee for seduction. After a sensational trial in June 1934, the six-man jury found in favour of the plaintiffs, awarding them $10,000 and $5,000, respectively. In an unusual move, trial judge William Ives disregarded the jury's finding and dismissed the case. The Supreme Court of Canada eventually overturned the decision and awarded MacMillan $10,000 in damages. This award was affirmed by the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council, Canada's highest court of appeal at the time. All of this was largely academic to Brownlee, who resigned after the jury's finding. During the next election, his United Farmers of Alberta were wiped out of the legislature, losing every seat. Background John Brownlee became Premier of Alberta in 1925 as the leader of the parliamentary caucus of the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA). Early in his premiership, he achieved a number of successes, including winning control of the province's natural resources from the federal government, but by 1933 the Great Depression was taking its toll on his government's popularity. Political forces were advocating radical overhauls of the financial system. The Co- operative Commonwealth Federation and elements of the UFA's grassroots favored socialism and government ownership of the means of production, while the Alberta Liberal Party, many within the UFA, and William Aberhart's new provincial movement favored social credit, although in differing forms and with differing levels of enthusiasm. In 1934, Brownlee was embroiled in a sex scandal, with major consequences to his political career. Those involved with the scandal gave widely disparate accounts of the surrounding facts; on only a minority of details did the parties agree. In 1930, Brownlee visited Edson while campaigning in the 1930 provincial election. While there, Allan MacMillan‚Äîthe mayor of Edson and a political ally of Brownlee's‚Äîtook him to a farmers' picnic. On the way to the event, Brownlee chatted with MacMillan's daughter, Vivian, then seventeen years old and unsure as to her future. The premier encouraged her to come to Edmonton and study business at Alberta College. She did so and, after graduating in June 1931, started working in the office of the provincial Attorney-General as a stenographer on July 3\\\\. While in Edmonton, she became close to the Brownlee family. On July 5, 1933, while the rest of his family was vacationing at Sylvan Lake, Brownlee was taking MacMillan for a car ride when he noticed they were being followed. In the pursuing vehicle were John Caldwell, a suitor of MacMillan's and third-year medical student at the University of Alberta, and Neil MacLean, a prominent Edmonton lawyer and Liberal Party supporter who had been opposing counsel in the acrimonious and high profile divorce proceeding of Brownlee's Minister of Public Works, Oran McPherson. Brownlee made a series of sharp turns and reversals, in an effort to first ascertain whether he was indeed being followed and, once satisfied that he was, to evade the other car. Unable to do so, he dropped MacMillan off at her home and returned to his. That August, Brownlee received a letter from MacLean reading in part \\"We have been instructed to commence action against you for damages for the seduction of Miss Vivian MacMillan.\\" Later that month, he took advantage of a recess in the federal Royal Commission on Banking and Currency, of which he was a member, to visit Allan MacMillan in Edson. He spoke instead to Mrs. MacMillan, who initially refused to let him into the house and asked him to leave. She eventually relented and let him in; he told her that pursuing the matter could ruin Vivian's future, to which she responded \\"what about you?\\" Concluding that the meeting was pointless, Brownlee parted by announcing \\"I am not asking you to refrain from your action, but I want to tell you that the allegation is not true and I will face them frankly and answer any questions ... If its money you are after, I haven't got it.\\" On September 22, MacLean filed a statement of claim before Judge John R. Boyle on behalf of Allan and Vivian MacMillan. The claim was made under the Alberta Seduction Act, and sought damages of $10,000 for Vivian and $5,000 for Allan. It alleged that Brownlee, after arranging for Vivian's move from Edson to Edmonton, had seduced her in the fall of 1930 when she was eighteen, and had had regular sexual contact with her for a period of three years. Brownlee denied the allegations immediately (and made a rejected offer to resign from the Royal Commission) and on November 13 filed a counter-claim against Vivian MacMillan and John Caldwell, alleging that they had conspired to obtain money through false allegations. Vivian MacMillan's story According to Vivian MacMillan, when she met Brownlee in 1930 he told her that she would \\"grow up to be a beautiful woman\\", urged her to move to Edmonton, and offered to arrange a government job for her. He further offered to act as guardian to her and allow her to live in his house until she found a place of her own. On his advice and assurances, she moved to Edmonton and, after graduating from Alberta College, received the stenographer's position that she claimed had been arranged for her by the premier. Immediately after her arrival in Edmonton, she said, Brownlee had telephoned her‚Äîcommenting that \\"a little birdie\\" had told him that she was in town‚Äîand invited her to his home to meet his family; she soon became a regular visitor there. She alleged that in October 1930, while Brownlee was driving her home after one such visit, the premier took her hand and asked her what she knew \\"about life\\". On her response that she knew probably as much as any girl of eighteen, he invited her out the next evening for what she presumed would be some advice. Instead, he drove her west of town on Highway 16 and parked on a side road before asking her to have sex with him. He said that he had been madly in love with her from the start, that he was lonely, that he and his wife had not lived together as man and wife in a long time, that his wife (an invalid) would be endangered by a pregnancy, and that he could not be premier any longer unless MacMillan agreed to have sex with him. He told her that if she refused him, he would be forced to resume his sexual relationship with his wife, and that this would likely kill her. MacMillan reacted fearfully, and asked if there was anything else she could do to help Brownlee and his wife; he replied that there was not. Vivian MacMillan, the woman at the centre of the scandalThe next week on another ride home, a similar conversation ensued, this one culminating in Brownlee forcing a resisting MacMillan into the car's back seat where he partially penetrated her against her will. Two weeks later, she alleged, they had complete consensual intercourse. After, when she expressed concern about becoming pregnant, he told her that \\"he knew of some pills that he would give me and if I took them at the end of each month before I menstruated that they would be very safe and there would not be any danger of me becoming pregnant.\\" MacMillan recounted that their relationship continued in this way, with sex occurring an average of three times per week. In September 1931, she stayed in the Brownlee house for three days while Mrs. Brownlee was in Vancouver; she alleged that during that time, Brownlee had his son, who usually slept in Brownlee's room, transferred to a different room so that Brownlee and MacMillan could have sex. Some of MacMillan's most sensational allegations concerned a six-week period in the spring of 1932 when she was filling in at the Brownlee household for an absent maid. She said that she slept in the maid's room, one of three bedrooms on the second floor of Brownlee's house; a second room was occupied by Brownlee and his son Jack, and the third by Florence Brownlee and her son Alan. During this six-week period, she claimed, she and Brownlee had had sex every night; Brownlee would signal her to leave her room by turning on the tap in the second floor bathroom, and then flush the toilet and walk in lockstep with her to mask the sound of her movement. Once in the premier's room, they would have sex next to his sleeping son, taking care to be quiet. She recounted how on one occasion Jack had seemed to stir, and Brownlee had turned on the light in the middle of intercourse to make sure that his son was all right. MacMillan said that during the summer of 1932 she experienced a nervous breakdown (for which Florence Brownlee paid the hospital bills), and that she met and fell in love with Caldwell soon after. She resolved to end her affair with Brownlee but he reacted angrily, telling her that it would mean his wife's death and MacMillan's inability to find a job anywhere in Alberta. That evening, she confided the affair to her landlady. On October 31, 1932, she had dinner with Brownlee's sons and visited Brownlee, who was sick in bed. Despite her protestations that she was on her way to a Halloween party with Caldwell, he insisted that they have sex, which they did. Thereafter, the affair resumed. On another occasion, he called her away from her visiting mother to have sex with him at the legislature building. In late January 1933, Caldwell proposed to her. She broke down and told him of the affair. She described his reaction as sympathetic, though he rescinded the marriage proposal. In May, at Caldwell's urging, she consulted a lawyer, but continued the affair until July 5, the night of the fateful drive. MacMillan testified that for the duration of the affair she continued to have sex with Brownlee \\"from terror and because he told me it was my duty to do it and he seemed to have an influence over me which I could not break.\\" She claimed that there had been no love accompanying the sex, and that it had been physically painful for her on each occasion. John Brownlee's story Brownlee denied absolutely MacMillan's claims. He said that there had been no sexual activity between him and MacMillan, likening their relationship instead to that of an uncle and his favourite niece. To claims that he had induced MacMillan to move to Edmonton and arranged a position for her in the Attorney General's office, he asserted \\"in the thirteen years I have been in public life I have never promised any person in this Province a position.\\" He denied having convinced MacMillan to move to Edmonton and stated that he had not even known that she had done so until Christopher Pattinson, Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Edson, told him. He further claimed that his sex life with Mrs. Brownlee was what he would consider normal for a husband and wife (which was corroborated by his wife). John Caldwell and Sam MacMillan, Vivian's brother, at the courthouseHe acknowledged that he had been driving MacMillan around the evening of July 5, 1933, when he was followed by Caldwell and MacLean, but gave a dramatically different account of his reasons for doing so. According to him, there had been talk of MacMillan joining his family at their rental cottage at Sylvan Lake that weekend provided that she could get the necessary time off work, and that evening he called her to see whether or not she had been able to. During the ensuing phone conversation, MacMillan told him that she had other problems bothering her, and asked if Brownlee would take her for a drive to discuss them. He agreed to do so, and it was during this drive that he noticed that he was being followed. In support of this story, Brownlee pointed to investigational work by Harry Brace, a private detective in the employ of Attorney General John Lymburn. According to Brace, Caldwell had told at least three witnesses that he expected to soon receive a large amount of money from someone \\"high up in political life\\". He also specifically told one of Brace's agents that he had deliberately set out to frame Brownlee, that in selecting Neil MacLean as his lawyer he had deliberately chosen a Liberal (the Liberals were considered the major opposition to Brownlee's government at the time), and that if the Liberals won the next election there would be \\"nothing I want I won't be able to get\\". Disappointingly for Brownlee, Brace did not uncover evidence that MacMillan was lying about the affair itself: Caldwell, based on his comments to Brace's men, seemed very much under the impression that the affair had occurred exactly as claimed. Moreover, Brace found that Carl Snell, MacMillan's one-time suitor, claimed to have been told in 1932 that MacMillan was having a consensual affair with the premier. Brownlee's defenders called into doubt MacLean's motivation for involvement in the case: according to rumour, MacLean had been involved in a drunk driving incident several years previous in which he had driven his car into a ditch. When another motorist had pulled him out, MacLean had attempted unsuccessfully to drive away with the chains still attached to his vehicle, for which he was charged. He had reputedly asked Brownlee, then the Attorney General, to have the charges dropped. Upon Brownlee's refusal, he had allegedly vowed to \\"get\\" him. Finally, Brownlee made a point of noting that, as a medical student, Caldwell would have been well-positioned to coach MacMillan on her claims about the pills she was taking to avoid pregnancy. According to Brownlee, the events alleged were a complete fabrication, the result of scheming by an opportunistic young medical student and his impressionable girlfriend, encouraged by a vindictive lawyer and unscrupulous political opponents. Legal processes =Trial= The trial began in June 1934 before Justice William Ives with three days of testimony from MacMillan. Brownlee's lawyer, Arthur LeRoy Smith, used his cross examination to call into question almost everything MacMillan said. To refute her claim that Brownlee had convinced her to move to Edmonton, he entered into evidence a letter she had written to Alberta College seeking information on its programs, dated before she had even met Brownlee. He further demonstrated that on the evening of the seduction, which had allegedly taken place in a car on a side road west of Edmonton, the city had been engulfed in a blizzard. Moreover, the government car in which the seduction was supposed to have taken place had not been purchased until more than a year after that date. In response to her testimony that she had always slept in the maid's room while staying with the Brownlees, Smith produced letters showing that she had actually slept in Mrs. Brownlee's room. After MacMillan conceded her mistake, Smith noted that Mrs. Brownlee's room had a large deadbolt on the door: if she had feared Brownlee, why had she not used it? \\"Because I just did as Mr. Brownlee said,\\" was the plaintiff's response. MacMillan, when questioned, admitted that the period during which she had been staying in the Brownlee home in the spring of 1932, which she had initially placed at six weeks, was actually only four. When she identified these four weeks as the last two weeks of April and the first two of May, Smith showed that Brownlee had been out of town for all but ten nights of that period. W. C. Ives presided over the trial and ultimately overturned the jury's verdict against Brownlee. Other witnesses for the plaintiffs included a former maid of Brownlee's, who testified that she had seen the premier pick MacMillan up in his car late one night, and MacMillan's landlady's daughter, who testified that she found MacMillan sobbing in her room one night. Allan MacMillan was also called: though he testified that Brownlee had encouraged his daughter to move to Edmonton and promised to forward information about Alberta College, he acknowledged that the premier had not followed through and not contacted her again until she was in Edmonton. The defence called Brownlee, who recounted his version of events. He testified that he had been otherwise occupied on many of the days that he and MacMillan had supposedly had sex; in one case, he produced newspaper stories showing that he had been making a speech in Stettler at a time that MacMillan had claimed he was forcing himself upon her in Edmonton. In another, he testified that he was meeting with O. H. Snow, the mayor of Raymond. MacLean on cross-examination tried to paint Brownlee as a man of tremendous persuasive powers, recalling his time as a lawyer in Calgary, only to have Brownlee retort that he had only ever tried two cases, spending most of his time drafting commercial documents. MacLean also emphasized the $1,400 that Lymburn as Attorney General had spent investigating the case, suggesting that this amounted to government funds being spent to vindicate Brownlee personally; outside of the courtroom, Lymburn responded that his office had received a complaint that an \\"Edmonton lawyer\\"‚Äîtaken by all involved to be MacLean‚Äîhad approached a young woman offering money to place Brownlee in a compromising position, and that, as a criminal allegation, it had been the obligation of his office to investigate. He further emphasized that, against his protestations, Brownlee had insisted on reimbursing the government for the full cost of the investigation. After the premier's testimony was completed, Smith called his wife, Florence Brownlee. She supported her husband's account of MacMillan's relationship with the Brownlee family and reported that, when the premier drove MacMillan home at night, he was very seldom late returning. On cross-examination, she denied that she would have defended her husband if she believed him to be guilty. Additional witnesses for the defence included Brownlee's personal secretary, Civil Service Commissioner Frederick Smailes, and four legislature janitors. Smailes acknowledged knowing at the time of MacMillan's hiring that she was acquainted with Brownlee, but denied involvement on Brownlee's part in the decision to hire her, while the janitors denied ever seeing a young woman enter the premier's office in the evenings. Jessie Ellergert, who had worked for the Brownlees as a maid, said that she had no reason to believe that there was a sexual relationship between the premier and MacMillan; moreover, she specifically recalled the Halloween night MacMillan had referred to in her testimony, and testified that the household was far too bustling for the alleged sex to have occurred. John and Florence Brownlee leaving the courthouseThe trial concluded with a field trip, as the jury went to view both Brownlee's house and two stretches of road where MacMillan had claimed key encounters took place. Rainy weather meant that on more than one occasion the jurors and lawyers had to push cars out of the mud. Though one road essentially matched MacMillan's description, it was located next to a populated settlement rather than deserted as she had claimed. The other, in contrast to her description of it as a side road, was a busy highway. Upon the jury's return, Smith surprised them by announcing that Brownlee's counter- claim was being dropped; he said that there was no need to complicate the clear cut issue of \\"seduction or no seduction\\" with evidence about a conspiracy on the part of MacMillan and Caldwell. Legal historian Patrick Brode criticized this decision, suggesting that the jury was expecting proof of a conspiracy and that, when this proof was not forthcoming, Brownlee's credibility was hurt. Besides the factual issues that the jury was called on to adjudicate, there was a legal issue of what constituted \\"seduction\\" under the law. The basis of the claim was a two-hundred-year-old tort which allowed a man to sue anybody who impregnated his female servant. The basis for damages under such a claim was the servant's inability to perform her duties to the detriment of the employer. The tort was later broadened to allow the seductee's father to sue; only in statute in 1903 was the law amended to give standing to the woman herself. At issue was what damage, if any, she needed to show in order to have a cause of action. The defence argued that in all precedents there had been a pregnancy resulting, and that without one the plaintiffs could not claim damages. In response, MacLean emphasized the not entirely consensual nature of the alleged relationship. Brownlee himself responded that if the alleged relationship had been non-consensual, he should have been charged under the criminal law for rape, not sued for seduction; that the plaintiffs had not attempted to press criminal charges was evidence, he believed, of their bad faith and financial motivation. After six days of testimony, closing arguments were given: Smith's lasted two hours and fifteen minutes and emphasized the discrepancies in MacMillan's story. MacLean's was a relatively brief forty minutes, in which he argued that the improbable and fantastic nature of his client's tale was evidence that she could not possibly have invented it. Ives then instructed the jurors, and defined \\"seduction\\" as \\"inducing a woman to part with her virtue ... [which] may be by any artful device that brings about her consent.\\" After four hours and forty minutes the jury returned and announced its finding that Brownlee had seduced MacMillan in October 1930 when he had partially penetrated her, and that both she and her father had suffered damage in the amounts claimed. Ives immediately announced that he strongly disagreed with the jury's findings, and that \\"the evidence does not warrant them\\". On July 2, he issued his written ruling, overturning the jury's verdict and dismissing the action; his reason for doing so was what he viewed as the lack of damage being demonstrated by the plaintiffs. According to Ives, even if the facts had been exactly as MacMillan had described, as a matter of law the plaintiffs could not claim damages without a pregnancy or an illness. =Media and public reception= The trial was covered in lurid detail, especially by the Edmonton Bulletin, which called it \\"the greatest drama ever to be heard in an Alberta court\\". The Bulletin was a Liberal paper, and MacLean had given it an advance copy of his statement of claim, which allowed MacMillan's allegations to be published and disseminated before the statement of claim was filed. The Bulletin was emphatically sympathetic to MacMillan in its coverage, and printed her detailed testimony (which included the dates and times of specific encounters) almost verbatim. Under the headline \\"Vivian Testifies to Harrowing Ordeal\\", it praised the young plaintiff as \\"bearing up with wonderful fortitude\\" and facing the ordeal \\"with courageous mien\\". Brownlee, in contrast, was a \\"love-torn, sex crazed victim of passion and jealousy, forcing his will upon her in parked autos and on country highways\\". The jury was not sequestered and was free to read these accounts. Edmontonians were no less enthralled than their newspaper, and many showed up to the courthouse early on the days of trial, hoping to get a seat. Towards the end of the trial, Ives revoked the Bulletin's press privileges at the trial and fined its publisher $300 and a reporter $100 for publishing writing \\"likely to inflame public opinion and interfere with the even-handed course of justice.\\" Vivian MacMillan arriving at court with a man variously identified as Neil MacLean and Allan MacMillanMedia attention on the trial spread beyond the provincial and national borders: Time magazine published at least two articles on the trial in the United States, and the Daily Mail and Paris Midi covered it from across the Atlantic. Reaction to the trial's outcome was mixed. The Bulletin was outraged, as was the Canadian Civil Liberties Protective Association, which called Ives' decision to overturn the jury's finding one that \\"set the clock back 300 years\\". Both organized subscriptions to finance an expected appeal. The Winnipeg Free Press called for an investigation of Ives for apparent favouritism towards Brownlee. The Vancouver Sun, on the other hand, sympathized with the premier, arguing that his \\"personal difficulties should not have been aired publicly\\". Brownlee's political allies, including Irene Parlby and Henry Wise Wood, remained loyal, with Wood keeping a large picture of Brownlee on the wall of his guest bedroom. =Appeals= The plaintiffs appealed and the case went before the Alberta Supreme Court appeals division in January 1935. On February 2, by a 3‚Äì2 decision, the court upheld Ives' ruling. The majority ruling by Chief Justice Horace Harvey cast serious doubts on MacMillan's credibility, calling her story \\"quite unsupported by other evidence\\" and noting that she \\"showed a readiness to admit that she may have been mistaken as regards very positive statements previously made when by the questions it appeared there may be independent evidence she was wrong\\". In addition to agreeing with Ives on the points of law, he felt that the jury had not based its finding of fact on the evidence in the case. Justices Mitchell and Ford concurred. Justice Clarke, in dissent, agreed that MacMillan's story was unlikely, but expressed a willingness to defer to the jury on questions of fact. On the legal questions, he cited a precedent written by Justice Harvey himself in which the chief justice had argued that the inclusion of seduced women as potential plaintiffs under the Seduction Act proved that its framers intended a broader definition of damage than financial damage. Justice Lunney concurred. The court was unanimous in upholding Ives' dismissal of Allan MacMillan's action, and he did not appeal further. Not satisfied with the verdict, the Bulletin again organized a campaign to fund an appeal, which was submitted to the Supreme Court of Canada; on March 1, 1937, Ives' decision was overturned. Chief Justice Lyman Duff, writing for the majority, accepted the jury's finding of fact and, echoing Justice Clarke, concluded that the framers of the Alberta Seduction Act had not intended that damage to a seductee be required to be the same as those to her father or employer (i.e. financial) in order to be actionable. The court ordered Brownlee to pay $10,000 in damages to MacMillan, plus trial costs. Henry Hague Davis in dissent focussed less on the questions of law and more on the evidence in the case, and argued that the jury's finding of fact was perverse and that the appeal should be dismissed. After the Supreme Court ruling, Brownlee settled with MacMillan, but still desired to clear his name. On July 1, 1937, the federal government by Order in Council gave him leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council, at the time Canada's highest court of appeal. On March 11 and 12, 1940, the committee heard Brownlee's appeal. It was denied, as the committee endorsed the Supreme Court of Canada's focus on statutory interpretation. Legacy After Brownlee's resignation, William Aberhart swept to power in the next election. For John Brownlee's political career, Ives' ruling and the subsequent appeals were irrelevant: once the jury ruled in MacMillan's favour, he immediately announced that he would resign as soon as a replacement could be found. On July 10, 1934, he was succeeded as Premier by Richard Gavin Reid, his government's Treasurer and Minister of Health and Municipal Affairs. Brownlee stayed on as MLA and sought to retain his Ponoka seat in the 1935 provincial election, but was trounced by Edith Rogers of William Aberhart's Alberta Social Credit League. Not a single UFA member won re-election as Aberhart's movement and its promises of innovative solutions to the western world's economic problems rode to a decisive victory. In evaluating Social Credit's victory, historians unanimously cite the province's dire economic straits as the main factor, though University of Alberta historian David Elliott has acknowledged that \\"Aberhart and his cause were also helped\\" by the seduction scandal. This view has been endorsed by University of Western Ontario sociologist Edward Bell. John Barr, in his history of the Alberta Social Credit Party, is more dismissive, calling it \\"unlikely\\" that the scandal was a major factor in the UFA's defeat. Brode acknowledges that the question of whether Brownlee seduced MacMillan \\"defies any definitive answer\\" but says that the evidence presented in the trial did not justify a finding that he did, and speculates that if MacMillan had brought her suit in a later generation she would have been \\"laughed out of court\\". Lakeland College historian and Brownlee biographer Franklin Foster does not take a position on whether or not Brownlee was guilty of seduction, but hints that a likely truth might lie \\"between the two extremes\\" of the parties' claims: that Brownlee and MacMillan did have a consensual affair which was then highjacked and exploited by the premier's more opportunistic and vengeful opponents. He leaves little doubt that he considers the behaviour of the Edmonton Bulletin and of the Liberal Party, especially its leader, William R. Howson, to have been profoundly unethical. Athabasca University historian Alvin Finkel has criticized Foster for being too friendly towards Brownlee, saying that he does not consider the scandal sufficiently from MacMillan's perspective. A play at the 2008 Edmonton International Fringe Festival, Respecting the Action for Seduction: The Brownlee Affair, was based on the scandal, and received average to above average reviews. After leaving office, John Brownlee returned to the practice of law. He died in 1961. Vivian MacMillan stayed out of the limelight. She did not marry Caldwell, and returned to Edson, where on August 7, 1935, she wed confectioner Henry Sorenson. Following her husband's death, she became the bookkeeper for a Calgary construction company. After an affair, she married her boss, Frank Howie, in 1955. Vivian Howie died in 1980.

He spent much of his career wrestling as part of a tag team with Rip Hawk. Together, they held championships in four different promotions. Hanson and Hawk were heel (villain) wrestlers and competed against some of the most popular teams of their time. They later feuded with each other when Hawk found a new partner after Hanson suffered a legitimate heart attack. Hanson retired in 1986 and lived in South Carolina until his death in 2002. Early life Hanson was born in East Orange, New Jersey. He attended high school until his senior year; although he was offered a football scholarship to Wake Forest University, he declined the offer and stopped attending school. His mother was struggling financially, so Hanson became an aircraft mechanic to help his family. He also competed as an amateur boxer, and he compiled a 61-3 record in New Jersey Golden Gloves competitions. Career Boxing and professional wrestling promoter Willie Gilzenberg discovered Hanson and convinced him to compete in wrestling. He trained with George Tragos and debuted in WWWF (now World Wrestling Entertainment) in Paterson, New Jersey against Miguel Torres in 1957. Hanson was sent to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to compete while he continued to develop his skills. While there, he wrestled against Bruno Sammartino in Sammartino's debut match. He was later hired by Jim Crockett and moved to the Carolinas to compete. While there, he began teaming with Rip Hawk to form a tag team known as the \\"Blond Bombers\\". They competed as heels (villains) and were hated by the crowds. During appearances, fans would throw acid or threaten them with knives and guns. In one attack, Hanson was stabbed in the leg and required 72 stitches. Hawk taught Hanson a move called the reverse neckbreaker, which saw Hanson stand back-to-back with his opponent, clasp his hands under the opponent's chin, and fall to the ring floor while pulling the opponent with him. This became Hanson's signature manoeuvre that he used in most matches. Hanson remained silent during the team's interviews while Hawk did most of the talking. The team won its first title on August 3, 1965, when they defeated Hiro Matsuda and Duke Keomuka to win the Florida version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship. They also competed in Mid- Atlantic Championship Wrestling, where they became the inaugural NWA Atlantic Coast Tag Team Champions. They held the title belts four times between 1968 and 1971 while feuding with George Becker and Johnny Weaver. During that time, they also won the IWA World Tag Team Championship while competing in Tasmania. While in the Carolinas, Hanson and Hawk spent a lot of time with Ric Flair when Flair entered the wrestling business. Hawk stated that Flair used to cause trouble for the group, including one incident in which Flair flirted with the girlfriend of a Mafia member. Hanson and Hawk used their friendship with the Mafia member to help Flair escape from being killed in revenge. In 1971, Hanson suffered a heart attack and had to take time away from wrestling. After returning, he formed a tag team with Super Destroyer. The partnership was short lived, as Super Destroyer later turned on Hanson. As a result, Hanson become a face (fan favorite) and the two feuded for several months. In 1974, Hanson and his new partner, Tiger Conway Jr., began a feud with Hawk and Ric Flair. The series of matches later evolved into singles matches that pitted former partners Hanson and Hawk against each other. Hanson later became a less high-profile wrestler and was given the role of putting over new wrestlers in the promotion. Hanson left the territory for a while but later returned with a new gimmick. He had frizzy hair and wore psychedelic clothes while teaming with Gene Anderson and Sgt. Jacques Goulet. Hanson returned to the WWWF in 1979 as a vicious heel under the management of Fred Blassie. To build up his heat, many of his opponents were stretchered-out of the ring following their matches with Swede. He unsuccessfully challenged World champion Bob Backlund at Madison Square Garden in October of that year. Hanson and Hawk later reformed their team and competed together in the Amarillo, Texas-based NWA Western States Sports. While there, they won the NWA Western States Tag Team Championship three times. Hanson's final title reign was the only one that did not involve Hawk, as he teamed with The Hangman in Montreal, Quebec to win the Canadian International Tag Team Championship in 1981. Hanson then returned to McMahon's New England-based Capitol Wrestling, which had since become the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Using the gimmick of a redneck, complete with long hair and a Confederate flag, he competed for the WWF as a face until his retirement in 1986. =Legacy= Hanson is regarded as an intimidating but honest wrestler. The character he portrayed was hated by many fans, but Hanson was different from many heel wrestlers because he did not cheat to win matches. Even while competing as a heel, however, Hanson and Hawk were admired by many spectators and had a fan club devoted to them. In contrast to Hawk, who remained a heel during his entire run in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, Hanson gained popularity with even more fans when he feuded with Hawk and became the promotion's top face wrestler. Writers who have looked back on his career have noted that he wrestled with \\"heart\\" and always worked his hardest in the ring. Hanson has had a lasting impact on the business, as he was willing to put over other wrestlers, including Blackjack Mulligan and Angelo Mosca to help boost their careers. He and Hawk also helped popularize the quick tag, which saw them trading places in the ring every few seconds to remain energized while their opponents became worn down. Personal life During the course of his wrestling career, he was married twice. While both marriages ended in divorce, he and his second wife remained close until the day he died. Swede's marriages brought him seven children and twelve grandchildren. Swede's first marriage to a woman named Vicky, brought him a daughter and son, named Linda and Lance. Then he married a woman named Doris, which brought him another daughter and son, Luana and Bobby. He also gained a stepson, Billy Roy and two adopted children, Mary and Carol, through his second marriage. Hanson lived in Charlotte, NC for over 20+ years. In the late 80's, Hanson and his second wife moved to Fort Mill, SC. After divorcing his second wife, he remained living in a double-wide mobile home on five acres of land in Fort Mill, South Carolina. He was later engaged to a woman named Patsy Hughes. During his wrestling career, Hanson also worked in construction and had a position as a bouncer. After retiring from wrestling, Hanson worked a series of jobs. He was a trainer at a fitness center and later returned to construction work. His final position was as manager of a nightclub. Hanson also participated in several golf tournaments to raise money for charities. In his later life, Hanson suffered from diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. He also had high blood pressure and heart problems. He was hospitalized in Columbia, South Carolina in October 2001 due to dementia and died from sepsis, on February 19, 2002.

He began his wrestling career in the Mid-Western United States before joining Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) in the early 1960s. In the company, he teamed with fellow wrestler Swede Hanson as the \\"Blond Bombers,\\" and the duo held several championships. In the 1970s, he worked as a booker in JCP. Early life Evers was born on June 6, 1930 in Indiana. He was raised in Ohio. Professional wrestling career =Early career= Hawk made his wrestling debut in 1949. He began as an amateur in Ohio and was discovered by professional boxer Jack Dempsey, who convinced him to wrestle professionally. His ring name came from a variety of sources: his sister called him \\"Rip\\" as a nickname, while a promoter gave him the last name \\"Hawk\\" due to his nose and his movements in the wrestling ring. His nickname, \\"The Profile\\", was taken from actor John Barrymore. He began wrestling professionally in Ohio around his 18th birthday, and later moved to Chicago, where he trained for a year with Karl Pojello. He also briefly wrestled in New York City. Hawk was soon drafted to serve in the Korean War. He joined the United States Marine Corps and continued to wrestle during his service. He was discharged from the Marine Corps in 1954, believing he could make a better living from wrestling. He competed in several territories after returning to the United States, including Tennessee and Atlanta, Georgia, Iowa. He later moved to Missouri, where he competed in St. Joseph and St. Louis. In St. Joseph, he had a scripted feud with Sonny Myers and Larry Hamilton. He continued to move around and held his first championship, the NWA Rocky Mountain Heavyweight Championship, while wrestling for NWA Western States Sports in 1958. =Jim Crockett Promotions= Hawk moved to North Carolina in the early 1960s, where he began competing for Jim Crockett Promotions, an organization run by Jim Crockett Sr. that promoted events in the Carolinas. He met fellow wrestler Swede Hanson and approached Crockett about forming a tag team with Hanson. Crockett agreed to the idea, and Hawk and Hanson began competing as the \\"Blond Bombers\\", named after their matching blond hair and their strength in the ring. While competing in Australia, Hawk met manager Gary Hart. He approached Crockett and convinced him to bring Hart to the Carolinas to manage Hawk and Hanson. The team competed as heels (villains) and was unique for wearing suits to their matches, as most wrestlers did not worry about dressing like professionals outside of the ring. They aroused anger from many spectators, some of whom threw acid or threatened the team with knives and guns. They also had a following among some fans, and a fan club was formed for them at one point. During interviews, Hawk spoke for the team while Hanson stood silently; Hawk occasionally insulted Hanson in the interviews, but Hanson did not respond. The team competed in the Carolinas and Virginia, as well as touring overseas in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. Hawk wrestled in other territories, including Texas, where he held the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship and the Texas version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship (the latter while teaming with Rock Hunter). Nine of his championships came as a member of the Blond Bombers, however. Hawk and Hanson were booked in an angle to win their first title together, the Florida version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship, on August 3, 1965. They combined to hold the NWA Atlantic Coast Tag Team Championship on four occasions, which was the center of their feud with Johnny Weaver and George Becker. They were also booked to win the IWA World Tag Team Championship on a wrestling tour of Tasmania. The Blond Bombers were involved in a series of unusual matches in Jim Crockett Promotions; they faced other heel tag teams, which was a rarity at the time because most promoters stuck to good versus evil storylines. They competed against such teams as Aldo Bogni and Bronko Lubich, Gene and Ole Anderson, and Skull Murphy and Brute Bernard. Hawk, along with Johnny Weaver, was also involved in booking, or scheduling, events in Jim Crockett Promotions, a task he took on in the early 1970s. He also collaborated with Johnny Ringo to design the National Wrestling Alliance logo. In 1971, Hanson suffered a heart attack and had to take time off of wrestling. Hawk competed as a singles wrestler and feuded with the Brisco brothers (Jack and Jerry). During this rivalry, Hawk held the NWA Eastern States Heavyweight Championship four times. He was then paired with Ric Flair, who was billed as his nephew. On July 4, 1974, Hawk and Flair were booked the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship. Hanson returned to wrestling but soon became a face (fan favorite) and feuded with Hawk. The former partners faced each other in tag team matches in which Hanson teamed with Tiger Conway Jr. and Hawk teamed with Flair. Eventually, the partners were dropped and the two faced each other in a series of singles matches. Hawk left Jim Crockett Promotions permanently in 1975 due to differences with booker George Scott. =Later career= Hawk then took on a new partner, Roger Kirby, with whom he held the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship twice over the next two years. Hawk and Hanson reunited as a tag team in Texas, where they competed for NWA Western States Sports. In 1976 and 1977, they were booked to win the NWA Western States Tag Team Championship three times. After their final title reign, Hanson left to wrestle elsewhere while Hawk continued to wrestle in Texas. Hawk and Hanson were inducted into the NWA Legends Hall of Heroes in 2007. Hawk returned in 2008 to posthumously induct long-time rival and real-life friend Johnny Weaver. Personal life After retiring from wrestling, he moved to Hereford, Texas, where he lived with his wife, Kitty. They have 2 daughters. He worked as a personal trainer and wrestling coach at the YMCA in Hereford until 2011. Several of his trainees went to the Junior Olympics and received athletic scholarships to college. Evers died on December 22, 2012. He had suffered from cardiac problems prior to his death.

He began his career wrestling in Canada and later worked at Jim Crockett Promotions and Georgia Championship Wrestling in the United States. In the 1960s, he teamed with Brute Bernard in the World Wide Wrestling Federation and won championships in several professional wrestling promotions. In his later career, he worked primarily in Australia. Early life Murphy grew up in Hamilton, Ontario. As a child, he developed a disease that prevented him from growing any hair on his body. He attended Hamilton Central Technical School, where he met professional wrestler Chuck Molnar. Molnar convinced Murphy to become a wrestler, and Murphy began training at the Hamilton Jewish YMCA under Jimmy Simms. Author Mordecai Richler states that Murphy told him that he rubbed baby oil on his bald head before matches to reduce irritation from the ring floor. Career =Early career= Murphy began competing in 1952. He wrestled in Welland, Ontario as well as Larry Kasaboski's Northland Wrestling Enterprises in northeastern Ontario. He soon began competing for promotions on the east coast of the United States, including Jim Crockett Promotions. He was billed as living in Ireland. By 1959, he was competing for Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW), where he feuded with Dickie Gunkel. Professional boxer Joey Maxim was the referee for one match between Murphy and Gunkel. After Gunkel won, Murphy challenged Maxim to a \\"wrestler vs. boxer\\" match the following week, which Murphy won. He competed in GCW for several years and won five championships in 1961, which included three reigns with the Georgia version of the NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship. He also formed a tag team with Gypsy Joe and won both the NWA International Tag Team Championship and the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship. =Teaming with Brute Bernard= Murphy was paired with Brute Bernard, a fellow Canadian. They competed together in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), where they won the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship on May 16, 1963. They also wrestled for Championship Wrestling from Florida and won the Florida version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship on two occasions. In addition to competing in the United States, Murphy and Bernard were successful in Australia. They won the IWA World Tag Team Championship twice in 1966 while competing for the Australian World Championship Wrestling. =Australia and reunion with Bernard= Murphy remained in Australia while Bernard returned to the United States. Murphy never won a title belt in the United States again, but he held several championships in Australia as both a singles wrestler and tag team competitor. Over the next two years, he had two reigns as the IWA World Heavyweight Champion. He also formed a tag team with Killer Kowalski and won the IWA World Tag Team Championship twice more, defeating Red Bastien and Mario Milano for the title both times. He then reunited with Bernard to hold the IWA tag team belts again. The team returned to the United States, where they worked in Jim Crockett Promotions. While there, they wrestled as heels (villains) against other heel teams in an unusual series of matches. These \\"Battle of the Bullies\\" matches pitted them against such teams as the pairing of Swede Hanson and Rip Hawk or the Anderson Brothers (Gene and Ole). The majority of Murphy's remaining career, however, was spent in Australia. In 1968, he had two more reigns as IWA World Tag Team Champion, pairing with Killer Karl Kox and Toru Tanaka. He also held the IWA World Heavyweight Championship again after winning the belt on November 18, 1968. Competing in Japan for All Japan Pro Wrestling, he teamed with Klondike Bill to win the All Asia Tag Team Championship. His final title came on December 5, 1969, when he reunited with Bernard once again to win his final IWA World Tag Team Championship.

He spent much of his career wrestling as part of a tag team with Skull Murphy. He competed for several wrestling promotions associated with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). He also worked for the Australia-based World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as well as the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). He died of a gunshot while cleaning a rifle in 1984. Career =Early career= Bernard was discovered by wrestling promoter Jack Britton, who convinced him to become a wrestler. He made his debut in 1957, competing in Ontario. He initially wrestled under his real name, but he later took on the name Brute Bernard. He also competed as in Detroit for a promotion run by Ed Farhat. He teamed up with fellow Canadian wrestler Skull Murphy throughout the 1960s. Their first championship came on May 16, 1963, when they won the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship. They held the title belts for almost six months before dropping them to Killer Kowalski and Gorilla Monsoon on November 14. They then began competing for Championship Wrestling from Florida, an NWA territory. They participated in a tag team tournament and won the vacant Florida version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship in 1964. Bernard and Murphy feuded with Hiro Matsuda and Duke Keomurka over the belts and traded the belts back and forth before losing them to Matsusa and Keomurka for good. Bernard and Murphy worked for World Championship Wrestling in 1966, where they won the IWA World Tag Team Championship twice. =Texas= Murphy remained in Australia, while Bernard returned to the United States to compete for World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas.

They also competed for Jim Crockett Promotions in the Carolinas, where they participated in a series of \\"battle of the bullies\\" matches. These bouts went against the tradition of having faces (fan favorites) competing against heels (villains), as Bernard and Murphy competed against fellow heels the Blond Bombers (Swede Hanson and Rip Hawk). Murphy died of a heart attack on March 23, 1970. Bernard took on a new partner, Larry Hamilton, and the pair won the NWA Atlantic Coast Tag Team Championship in October 1971. They also competed in Texas, where they won the NWA American Tag Team Championship. Bernard continued to wrestle in Australia and won the NWA Austra-Asian Heavyweight Championship by defeating Spiros Arion on November 4, 1972. He held the belt for three weeks before dropping it back to Arion. He also won the country's World Brass Knuckles Championship twice. Back in Jim Crockett Promotions, he formed a tag team with Jay York. They had rivalries with the team of George Scott and Nelson Royal as well as the Anderson family (Gene and Ole). Bernard and York were managed by Beauregarde, who also teamed with them in six-man matches. Bernard and York won the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship by defeating Scott and Royal on November 26, 1973 but lost the belts to the Andersons one month later. Bernard wrestled for several promotions in his final years as a wrestler. He returned to Detroit, where he competed as The Brute. He also teamed with Frank Morrell in Texas to win the NWA Western States Tag Team Championship in 1977. He returned to the Carolinas and wrestled for Jim Crockett Promotions until he was released due to his age. He continued to wrestle occasionally; in his final match, he refused to go along with the scripted finish. The referee, Dave Routh, declared the result a double countout. Bernard got upset in the locker room and attacked Routh. He broke Routh's nose and was fired as a result. Personal life Bernard was married to female professional wrestler Betty Joe Hawkins. He died in 1984 of a self-inflicted gunshot; it was not determined if his death was a suicide or an accident. One story states that Bernard was playing Russian roulette.

The first team to use the name was the combination of Rip Hawk and Swede Hanson. It was later used by Pat Patterson and Ray Stevens, who began teaming in 1965. Larry Latham and Wayne Farris used the name in the late 1970s in the Continental Wrestling Association and, from 1979 to 1980, Stanley Lane and Bryan St. John competed as the Blonde Bombers while wrestling in Championship Wrestling from Florida. In the early 2000s, the team of Tank and Chad Toland appeared as the Blond Bombers in Ohio Valley Wrestling before changing their team name upon entering World Wrestling Entertainment. Each incarnation held title belts together at least once. Patterson and Stevens were inducted as a team into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2006.  History  = Rip Hawk and Swede Hanson = After joining Jim Crockett Promotions in the early 1960s, Rip Hawk met Swede Hanson, who was competing as a singles wrestler. Hawk approached Jim Crockett, Sr. about forming a tag team with Hanson, and Crockett agreed. Both had blond hair and were powerful wrestlers, so they called themselves the Blond Bombers. They were managed by Gary Hart and later by Homer O'Dell. Hawk spoke for the team during interviews while Hanson stood silently beside him. After teaming for several years, Hawk and Hanson won the Florida version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship by defeating Hiro Matsuda and Duke Keomuka on August 3, 1965. They also competed in Australia's World Championship Wrestling, where they won the IWA World Tag Team Championship in 1970. Much of their success, however, came in Jim Crockett Promotions, where they were hated heel (villain) wrestlers. They won the NWA Atlantic Coast Tag Team Championship four times between 1968 and 1971. They feuded with several teams, including Johnny Weaver and George Becker as well as the pairing of Paul Jones and Nelson Royal. Jim Crockett Promotions also held matches in which heel teams faced other heel teams. The Blond Bombers faced such teams as the Anderson Brothers (Gene and Ole) or Brute Bernard and Skull Murphy These matches, known as \\"Battles of the Bullies\\", were unusual because heels almost always compete against faces (fan favorites). Hanson had a heart attack in 1971, and Hawk was teamed with rookie wrestler Ric Flair. Hanson became a face upon his return to the ring, and he feuded with Hawk and faced him in a series of matches. They began wrestling in Texas, where they won the NWA Western States Tag Team Championship three times from 1976 to 1977. Hanson left the territory after their final reign, which ended the tag team combination. They were inducted as a team into the NWA Legends Hall of Heroes in 2007 by former manager Gary Hart. = Pat Patterson and Ray Stevens = While wrestling in Oregon, Pat Patterson heard many wrestlers tell him that he would be a natural fit as a tag team partner of Ray Stevens, who competed in San Francisco. Patterson moved to San Francisco and dyed his hair blond to match Stevens, who had used the nickname \\"The Blond Bomber\\" as a singles wrestler. They defeated the team of The Destroyer and Billy Red Lyons to win the San Francisco version of the AWA World Tag Team Championship on April 17, 1965. They held the belts for over a year and a half before dropping them to the Mongolian Stomper and Ciclon Negro in December 1966. They won the title back in a rematch the following month and held it for another three months. On April 8, 1967, they lost the belts to longtime rival Pepper Gomez and future World Wide Wrestling Federation Champion Pedro Morales. They continued to team together, however, until the end of the year, when Patterson left the area to compete in Japan. When Patterson returned to the San Francisco area, he feuded with Stevens, who had become a face. This feud included Stevens and Peter Maivia defeating Patterson and Superstar Billy Graham to win the San Francisco version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship on January 23, 1971 and Patterson and Graham regaining the belts in a rematch the following month. Patterson and Stevens also competed in singles matches; Stevens defeated Patterson in a Texas Death match on July 11, 1970 to win the San Francisco version of the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship. The pair were later reunited in the American Wrestling Association, where they won the AWA World Tag Team Championship on September 23, 1978. The following year, Patterson began competing primarily in the World Wrestling Federation, although he and Stevens continued to team occasionally in the AWA until late 1982. They were inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame as a team in 2006 and have been described as the \\"single greatest tag team\\" of all time. = Larry Latham and Wayne Farris = Latham and Farris both made their wrestling debuts in 1976 and later signed with the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA). CWA owners Jerry Jarrett and Jerry Lawler paired Latham and Farris as a new incarnation of the Blond Bombers. Managed by Sergeant Danny Davis, the Bombers were the promotion's top heel tag team, Their first championship came on June 15, 1979, when they won an infamous match against Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee in Tupelo, Mississippi. After the Blond Bombers controversially won the title, Lawler and Dundee attacked the new champions and fought with them in the concession stands. They soon dropped the belts to Robert Gibson and his real-life brother Ricky, but they regained them in a rematch later that summer. Meanwhile, the Fabulous Freebirds, who had been the region's number two heel tag team became faces and challenged the Bombers for the belts. They won the title from the Latham and Farris in September 1979, but the Bombers won a rematch to reclaim the championship. After dropping the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship for a third and final time, the Blond Bombers began to challenge for the NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship. They defeated George Gulas and Ken Lucas to win the belts on December 15, 1979. While holding the title, they continued to feud with Gulas. When they attacked him one day, his estranged partner Bobby Eaton rescued him; Gulas and Eaton reunited as The Jet Set and defeated the Bombers to win the championship. Latham and Farris regained the belts in a rematch against The Jet Set but later dropped them to Rocky Brewer and Pat Rose. The Blond Bombers had one last reign with the Mid-America belts, as they defeated Eaton and Great Togo in July 1980. They held the title until September 3, when they lost a match to Robert Gibson and Don Fargo. After losing the belts, Farris left to compete in Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council. Upon returning to Tennessee, he found other partners and had two more reigns as an AWA Southern Tag Team Champion. Latham soon left Tennessee to compete in the World Wrestling Federation, where he held the WWF Tag Team Championship as Spot, a member of The Moondogs. = Stanley Lane and Bryan St. John = Stanley Lane, who had dubbed himself the \\"Nature Boy\\" in honor of his trainer, \\"Nature Boy\\" Ric Flair, debuted for Championship Wrestling from Florida in December 1978. He was soon paired with Bryan St. John, and the team dubbed themselves the Blonde Bombers. St. John had been feuding with Ray Stevens, and the Bombers continued this rivalry. Together, they challenged NWA Florida Tag Team Champions Stevens and Mike Graham for the title belts. On October 30, 1979, the heel duo of Lane and St. John defeated the champions to win the title. As a result, St. John claimed victory in his rivalry with Stevens. The following week, they defended the belts against Mr. Hito and Mr. Sakurada. Because of a controversial finish, the championship was vacated, and a tournament was held. St. John sustained a wrist injury, however, and the Bombers were unable to participate. Graham teamed with Steve Keirn to win the tournament on November 13 by defeating Hito and Sakurada. When St. John recovered, he and Lane faced the new champions and defeated them for the title on November 25. They defended the title against several team and entered into a feud with the Brisco Brothers (Jack and Jerry), who had held the belts together on seven previous occasions. This rivalry also included a singles match between St. John and Jack Brisco, in which their partners were handcuffed together outside of the ring to prevent interference. In March 1980, Jack Brisco teamed with Jim Garvin to win the belts from the Bombers. Lane and St. John had one final reign with the championship after defeating Garvin and Keirn, who was substituting for Brisco, on June 7, 1980. That summer, the Brisco Brothers regained the belts, after which the Blonde Bombers parted ways. St. John soon retired, and Lane focused on building a career as a singles wrestler in Georgia before forming several other tag teams. Later in his career, he teamed with former rival Steve Keirn to form The Fabulous Ones; he was also a member of The Midnight Express and The Heavenly Bodies. = Tank Toland and Chad Toland = The Toland Brothers (Tank and Chad) also used the name in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), a developmental territory of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). They won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on April 6, 2005 by defeating The Thrillseekers (Matt Cappotelli and Johnny Jeter). They held the belts for six months before dropping them to Seth Skyfire and Chet Jablonski. The Tolands later competed for WWE as The Dicks (James and Chad Dick), a team dressed as Chippendales dancers. They debuted in October 2005 and were released five months later.

Extreme morning temperatures coupled with strong north-westerly winds contributed to the breakout of numerous fires in the Adelaide Hills, Jamestown, Waterloo, Kingston and Millicent. Most were caused by sparks from powerlines in the wind. Around 1,000 Emergency Fire Service volunteers from 60 brigades were tasked to the fires, but were overwhelmed. At 10am, the EFS head office requested urgent public assistance. Around 2,500 citizens volunteered. The fires were contained by 9:30pm, thanks largely to a fortuitous change in the weather and widespread public assistance. The fires resulted in two deaths, destroyed 40 homes and numerous other buildings, and caused more than 4 million worth of property damage, most notably the destruction of the Governor's summer residence at Marble Hill. Governor Robert George, his family and staff were lucky to escape with their lives. The Premier, Sir Thomas Playford, also narrowly escaped death, sheltering with five other men in a patch of hoed earth near Cherryville.

Early life Archer was born in Leicestershire, England on 3 March 1865, the son of Mary Kendrick and her husband, Thomas Archer, a master butcher. John was raised as a Methodist and educated at Market Bosworth Grammar School, Leicestershire, and University College Nottingham. From 1888 to 1891 he attended Midland Baptist College, Nottingham. In 1901 he made a tentative entry into public life, being elected to the board of Hebden Bridge Grammar School. He was a poor law guardian at Grimsby from 1907 to 1908. He married Phoebe Elizabeth Gee on 10 July 1894 at the Baptist chapel, Peterborough, Northamptonshire and they had two sons. Rev Archer and his family came to New Zealand in 1908. Baptist church involvement  After his ordination in 1891 he served in the north of England as pastor at Peterborough (1891‚Äì1895), Heptonstall Slack (1895‚Äì1903) and Grimsby (1903‚Äì1908). When Archer and his family moved to New Zealand in 1908, he became minister of the Baptist Church, Napier until 1913 and serving as chairman of the Main School Committee and the local Technical Education Board. Subsequently, he was minister at Esk Street, Invercargill (1913‚Äì1916), and Vivian Street, Wellington (1916‚Äì1919). He also served for part of that time as a military chaplain at Tauherenikau Camp, near Featherston. From 1919 until 1932 he was minister of the Baptist Church in Sydenham, Christchurch. After his retirement in 1932 he remained active in the church, serving as president of the Canterbury Auxiliary of the Baptist Union, organising a Sunday school in Christchurch and helping to start a Baptist church at Greymouth. He was President of the Baptist Union of New Zealand between 1916‚Äì1918 and Foundation President of the Invercargill WEA (Workers Educational Association) in 1915. Political career =Local body= In 1914 he was transferred to Invercargill and, while there, spent 12 months on the borough council. He was a Councillor for Invercargill Borough in 1915‚Äì1916. He next went to Wellington, leaving there for the Trentham Military Camp where he served as a chaplain until the end of the war. He served as a Councillor for Christchurch City Council from 1921 to 1925 and from 1931 to 1935. He was Mayor of Christchurch from 1925 to 1931. He was also a top- polling candidate for the North Canterbury Hospital Board and served on the Christchurch Tramway Board and Christchurch Fire Board. =Labour Party= Archer was not only a prominent leader in the Baptist church but also gave long and influential service to the early New Zealand Labour Party. Prior to its formation in 1916 he was an active advocate of such a party. In 1910 at Napier he delivered six evening lectures on socialism, and in 1913 he was editor of the United Labour Leader. Following the July 1913 unity congress he joined the new Social Democratic Party, which was absorbed into the Labour Party in 1916. Archer stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate for the House of Representatives four times: in (), ( and ), and (). He was President of the New Zealand Labour Party in 1928‚Äì1929, and its Vice-President 1922‚Äì1925, 1927‚Äì1928 and 1929‚Äì1931. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. =Legislative Council= He was a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council 1937‚Äì1949. Death Described as 'a man of war from his youth up', Archer was a blunt, some suggested abrasive, man. Certainly, he was not one to compromise his principles or the message which he believed had been entrusted to him by God. His preaching and actions reflected the moral righteousness and millennialism of British puritanism and the urgent and total commitment to social change of the Old Testament prophets such as Isaiah and Amos. Nonconformist in religion and politics, he argued that 'faith without works is dead' and that imperfect human relationships arose out of economic and social injustice caused by sin, which he defined as selfishness and the worship of material self-interest. To Archer there was no conflict between his political and religious activities; both were the same sacred vocation. In 1944 the Archers celebrated their golden wedding. In 1949 ill-health forced Archer to retire from the Legislative Council. Rev Archer died in Christchurch on 25 July 1949. He was survived by his wife, Phoebe, and two sons. Phoebe Elizabeth Archer, 87, died on 13 November 1953. The Baptist Union bought the couple's home at 166 Colombo Street and obtained a pound for pound subsidy from the Government with the intention that this should become 'a home for aged Baptists of the Canterbury-Westland Auxiliary Area'. Eventually the property was vested in the Baptist Union of New Zealand and the emphasis on the residents being Baptists removed. Instead the home would provide the residents with 'a maximum of individuality' and 'comfort and Christian fellowship for their declining years'. The institution was named in John and Phoebe's honour 'as an expression of thanksgiving to Almighty God for the outstanding and devoted service of the late Rev. and Mrs. J. K. Archer and as a permanent memorial'. One of the Archers' sons, Kendrick Gee, was born at Heptonstall in the historic county of the West Riding, Yorkshire. He was educated at Napier and at Southland Boys' High School. In 1914 the Royal Humane Society awarded him its bronze medal and he graduated with an LL.B. from Canterbury University College, before practising as a barrister and solicitor in Christchurch.

Style Wersin's early designs are characterized by East-Asian forms; however, he eventually developed a style free of any kind clear of influence (including rural folk art) and achieved a timelessly classical style of great objectivity, revealed above all in articles for everyday use, such as porcelain, glass, tableware fabric and wallpaper.JACKSON, Lesley, Twentieth Century Pattern Design: Textile & Wallpaper Pioneers, Princeton: Princeton Architectural Press, 2007, p. 44, 224 pages, , 978-1-56898-712-5  Orthogon information  Wolfgang Von Wersin's book about the Orthogons gives detailed information about how to construct and use a special set of 12 inter-related rectangles to create a design. They are similar to what Jay Hambidge called dynamic rectangles. The set of 12 Orthogons is determined by expanding a square through a series of arcs and cross-points until another square is formed on top, an exact duplication of the original square. Wersin also explains in the book how Orthogons can be detected and used in architecture, ceramics, furniture and works of art. The value of using Orthogons is explained in an excerpt that includes an extraordinary copy of text from the year 1558 (Renaissance). Diagrams of seven of the 12 orthogons are accompanied by a passage from the 1558 text cautioning that careful attention be given as the \\"ancient\\" architects believed \\"nothing excels these proportions\\" as \\"a thing of the purest abstraction.\\"WERSIN, op. cit., pp. 36 One of the orthogons, the hemidiagon, is apparent in the designs of synagogues in ancient Galilee.http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/sbf/Books/LA41/LA41449Milson_SynagoguesV.pdf Mathematical ratios and another source for the term Orthogon:http://wfgw.diemorgengab.at/WfGWformel.htm A well-known Orthogon, the Auron (golden rectangle), has been employed to create a range of designs from postersELAM, pp. 80 and chapelsELAM, pp. 76 (Mies van der Rohe), to chairs.ELAM, pp. 70 and glasswareZiffer The Auron is related to musical harmony, in that the golden ratio is among the most dissonant musical intervals, and is also included in discussions on sacred architecture and sacred geometry as well as information regarding dynamic symmetry and aesthetics.

The calculations for measure relations of the Orthogons are based, without exception, on the Pythagorean doctrine.\\"WERSIN, pp. 80 Examples of these root figure relations are: the Diagon relation is 1: square root of 2, the Sixton is 1: square root of 3 and the Doppelquadrat is 1: square root of 4.

It also went by the name of Chromated Copper Arsenate or CCA in the United States of America from around the 1950s. In his treatment, copper is a fungicide, arsenic is a secondary fungicide and insecticide, while chromium is a fixative which also provides ultraviolet (UV) light resistance. Recognized for the greenish tint it imparts to timber. this preservative was extremely popular for many decades until arsenic toxicity and carcinogenicity was recognized by the US EPA and other regulators. ASCU trademark issued by the USPTO. Kamesam was born in Narsapur in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh and was a younger brother of S. V. Ramamurthy. After primary education at Visakhapatnam, he graduated from Presidency College, Chennai and obtained his B.E. from Guindy Engineering College. He also obtained an ME (honours) and became a Member of the Institution of Engineers (India). He joined in Forest Research Institute, Dehra Dun and later promoted as an Expert-in-charge of Wood Preservation. He was sent to Germany for research and worked with Richard Falck (1873-1955), a specialist on fungi and their damage to wood.

Until then Wolman's formulation ‚Äì famously known as Wolman Salts ‚Äì contained dinitrophenol, a chemical manufactured by Hicksons, UK. In 1933, Kamesam added Copper sulphate as an anti-fungal to the formula of Wolman Salts which worked against termite damage. In addition Kamesam introduced the use of chromium to bind the two salts to the fibres of wood. He received an Indian patent in 1933, a British patent in 1934 and a US patent in 1938.Kamesam, S.

Various aircraft were used, including ship or shore-based single-engine seaplanes, and, on occasion a two-engine airplane, probably a Betty bomber whose pilot had made sure his engines were out of synchronization. The vibration was bad enough to wake most people, and then the waiting for the bombs (most of which missed) kept the men awake for the rest of the night. Later in the war, night fighters were developed to help stop these raiders. Independent of these Japanese raiders, Bedcheck Charlie was well known to American troops in the European theater, when lone German planes appeared over their lines in late afternoon/evenings.

Its population in 1945 was 2,740 and it was depopulated in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. It had an average elevation of . Archaeology In 2013, an archaeological survey was conducted on the site by Hardin W. James, Rachel Hallote, and Benjamin Adam Saidel, on behalf of Mississippi State University.Israel Antiquities Authority, Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2013, Survey Permit # S-429 On the basis of Philistine pottery from the 10th or 9th centuries BCE found in excavations of the tell, archaeologist Jeffrey Blakely of University of Wisconsin-Madison believes that Burayr may be the site of a Philistine village contemporary with the nearby Judaean hill forts. History It has been suggested that Burayr was the Jewish town named Bror Hayil in the 1st century CE, mentioned in the Talmud as where rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai lived.Neubauer, 1868, pp. 68-69Tsafrir et al, 1994, p. 93 In Byzantine sources it was named Buriron,Khalidi, 1992, p. 91 and ceramics from the Byzantine era have been found here.Dauphin, 1998, p. 881 =Middle Ages= The village's current name dates from the Arab conquest of Palestine in the 7th century.Sharon, 2004, p. XLVI ff In the ruins of the village was discovered Fatimid inscriptions dating from the 10th centuries. During Mamluk rule, it was positioned on a main highway leading from Gaza to Beit Jibrin, branching off the Via Maris at Beit Hanoun. Burayr had its own independent source for water, making it a desired rest place for travelers. =Ottoman period= Burayr was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and in the 1596 tax records, it was under the administration of the Nahiya of Gaza, part of the Sanjak of Gaza. It had a population of 210 household;H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 144 an estimated population of 1,155. All the villagers were Muslims. The villagers paid a 40% tax rate on agricultural products, such as wheat, barley, fruits, beehives, and goats; a total of 32,000 ak√ße. 5/24 parts of the revenues went to a waqf. In 1838, Edward Robinson found that Burayr was \\"a flourishing village forming a sort of central point in the plain.. [It had] a large public well, at which camels were drawing water by means of a sakia, or water wheel with jars...\\"Robinson and Smith, 1842, II, p. 370 Cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 92 (Note: typing-error in Khalidi; he writes p.35) He further noted it as a Muslim village, located in the Gaza district.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 118 In 1863, Burayr was described as a \\"large and prosperous village of 1,000\\" and all of its houses were made of mud, except for that of the village sheikh whose home was built of stone,Gu√©rin, 1869, p. 293Sharon, 2004, p. XLVIII and \\"round the well, which is broad and deep, ten ancient shafts in greyish white marble are built up in masonry, serving to make a trough.\\"Gu√©rin, 1869, p. 293; as translated in Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 274 An official Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Bureir had 167 houses and a population of 579, counting only the men.Socin, 1879, p. 149Hartmann, 1883, p. 133 also noted 167 houses In 1883, the SWP described the village as large, with a water wheel to the east, a pool to the north and a garden to the south.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 259. Cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 92 Burayr was strategically important in World War I and on November 9, 1917, was one of the first places captured by the Allied Forces from the Ottoman Empire, consolidating British hold on positions controlling the approaches to Jaffa and Jerusalem. =British Mandate of Palestine= Burayr 1931 1:20,000 Burayr 1945 1:250,000 During the British Mandate period, Burayr expanded westward, a mosque was built in the center of the village along with a clinic and grain mill. There were two primary schools‚Äîone for girls and one for boys‚Äîfounded in 1920. Water was supplied by three wells inside the village and toward the end of the Mandate, villagers had drilled artesian wells. The local economy boosted in the 1940s when the Iraqi Petroleum Company discovered oil in the vicinity of Burayr and drilled an oil well. The activities of the marketplace were supplemented by a weekly Wednesday market that attracted other villagers and Bedouin. Agriculture and animal husbandry employed most of the residents and the main crops were citrus, grapes, and figs. In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Bureir had a population of 1,591 inhabitants, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table V, Sub- district of Gaza, p. 8 increasing in the 1931 census to 1894, still all Muslim, in 414 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 3 In the 1945 statistics Bureir had a population of 2,740, all Muslims, with 44,220 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 409 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 43,319 used for cereals,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 86 while 130 dunams were built-up land.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 136 1947-48 civil war On January 29, 1948, Yishuv forces entered the village in five armored vehicles, but were repulsed without casualties. On February 14, an Israeli convoy exchanged fire with the local militia and withdrew. The villagers built a barricade at the entrance of Burayr which was dismantled by British troops the next day. According to the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, Jewish World War II veterans established kibbutz Bror Hayil on a hilltop about a mile from Burayr on April 20, 1948. He says The New York Times reported that \\"when the Arabs of Burayr awoke, they found the Jews setting up pre-fabricated houses and building a defensive wall and watchtower.\\" The villagers opened fire on them, but the work was completed by noon. Benny Morris says the founding date was May 18,Morris, 2008, p. 307 and Israeli sources say the founders were mostly Jewish immigrants from Egypt. In the course of Operation Barak, which commenced in early May, the Palmach's Negev Brigade and Givati Brigade captured Burayr, which was referred to as \\"the village of the killers.\\" Dozens of army-age villagers were apparently executed and a teenage girl was apparently raped and killed.Morris, 2004, p. 258, note 777 p. 306:\\"Giv‚Äòati, Desert and Fire, 45‚Äì47; and Rami Rosen, ‚ÄòCol.

Or as Simha Shiloni, one of them, put it: ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think one can call what happened there a ‚Äúmassacre‚Äù . . .

The moshavim of Tlamim and Heletz were established on village land in 1950, with Sde David later established in 1955, and Zohar in 1956, both also on village land. In 1992, the Arab village site was described: \\"Scattered cactuses as well as some lotus and sycamore trees grow on the site. One can see remnants of houses, including an insubstantial portion of a cement wall, among some eucalyptus trees at the entrance of one house. Some village streets are still visible.

The park operated from 1850 until 2005. It is standing but not operating. The owners still live there and are trying to preserve the park and the historic buildings on the property but face frequent vandalism. History The Williams family began hosting picnics in 1850 at a small grove located in the village of Williams Grove outside Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. Within a few years, the grove was developed into a park. Two decades later, the park became the Mechanicsburg Fairgrounds. After World War I, the park's ownership changed hands several times. The first rides appeared at the park in 1928. The adjacent Williams Grove Speedway half-mile track opened in 1938.coastergallery.com/ An entrepreneur named Morgan Hughes purchased the park in 1972 for $1.2 million. Several rides were relocated to Williams Grove from the defunct New Jersey Palisades Amusement Park, which closed in 1972. Williams Grove Park was nearly destroyed in the summer of the same year due to Hurricane Agnes, and subsequent flooding from nearby Yellow Breeches Creek. The park was rebuilt and operated through the end of the 2005 season, when the Hughes family decided to focus all of their energies on the Williams Grove Speedway. Hughes, who was in his mid-80s when the park closed, attempted to sell the property in 2006 to a prospective owner who would keep the park intact and operational, but was unable to find a buyer. Several rides were auctioned off the same year. Hughes died in his sleep at his Pennsylvania home on April 12, 2008 at age 88.http://www.williamsgrove.com/  Rides  The Cyclone The Cyclone is a wooden roller coaster and was the main attraction of the park. The Cyclone rises to a height of 65 feet and travels at the top speed of 45 mph. Unfortunately, the Cyclone closed after the 2005 season, leaving it standing but not operational as of 2020, abandoned and in disrepair with the train parked at the loading station. The cars have since been returned to Fort Lee, NJ, where they will be displayed at a museum. In 2001, the park erected The Wildcat, a steel roller coaster. Upon the park's closing, the Wildcat was relocated to Adventure Park USA in New Market, Maryland. There were two smaller coasters, the Kiddie Coaster, from 1992 until the park's closing, and the Little Dipper, from 1950 until 1963. Fun Houses The park featured a dark ride called \\"Dante's Inferno\\", which is still standing, and it used to have a walk-through fun house called \\"Allotria\\" Water Slides In the early 1980s, the park erected one of the first water slides in the area. The slide's platform is still standing abandoned where the two watersides were.

His best bowling performance came that season when he took 7 for 17 to dismiss Eastern Province for just 50 runs, which prompted Western Province's captain to make an unusual declaration when it was their turn to bat, calling the openers back after just one ball.

It is the largest town in Mareka woreda. Wacca is reported as having a telephone station in the 1930s, but this service had vanished by 1994. Two roads connecting the town to the outside world, one to Chida 73 kilometers in length and the other to Sodo 75 kilometers long, were under construction by 1996.

History  Arnold Weinholt Hodson visited Wacca when he was the British resident in southern Ethiopia (1914-1923), where he shared a meal with a local chief which he obviously did not enjoy: : I had to go through the ordeal of a meal with him for the sake of policy, and it is an ordeal. They cook very fat meat, and all their food is full of butter; they have also a very hot sauce. To add to this the servants tear the meat off in chunks for you to eat and hand it to you with their fingers. This is a special honour, and if you are not careful they put butter into your coffee, which is the nastiest drink one can possibly imagine. It is tiresome if one is a teetotaller, as they worry you to drink their liquor, tej by name, made out of honey.Arnold Hodson, \\"Southern Abyssinia\\", Geographical Journal, 53 (1919), p. 75 The Sudan Interior Mission had a station at Wacca from 1952 until it was nationalized in 1988 and the buildings used as a school. Foreign travelers who came to the station in early 1965 found the original missionaries still in residence, and learned they were the first non-natives to visit the station in three years. A visitor in 1972 described Wacca as a town on top of a mountain, with a post office, a pharmacy, and an Ethiopian Orthodox church. Most buildings had iron sheet roofs and there were numerous eucalyptus trees.

Early life and exile Harpsfield was educated at Winchester College and studied canon and civil law in New College, Oxford, receiving a BCL in 1543. In Oxford he became connected to the circle of Thomas More, of whom he later wrote a biography, which he dedicated to William Roper in gratitude for his patronage. With the more aggressive religious policies of the English Reformation following the accession of Edward VI in 1547, he left England in 1550 to pursue his studies at the University of Louvain. Role in the Marian Persecutions Upon the accession of Mary I in 1553, Harpsfield returned to England, took the degree of DCL at Oxford in 1554, and became Archdeacon of Canterbury in the same year, serving under Reginald Pole. He superintended hundreds of trials targeting lay Protestants in London, which resulted in punishments and intimidation (though not any charges under the revived Heresy Acts). He played an active role in the administration of the diocese of Canterbury, where he zealously promoted heresy trials. Foxe's Book of Martyrs (1563 edition) identifies him as \\"the sorest and of leaste compassion\\" among the archdeacons involved in the Marian Persecutions and holds him responsible for many deaths in the diocese. Imprisonment and death Harpsfield defiantly opposed the new regime of Elizabeth I, opposing the election of Matthew Parker and refusing to subscribe to the Book of Common Prayer. At some point between 1559 and 1562, he was committed to Fleet Prison, together with his brother John Harpsfield, for his refusal to swear the Oath of Supremacy. He remained in prison until his release on health grounds in 1574, sixteen months before his death.

The tree gains its name from the conjoined lower trunk that the two trees share. It grows in the Kauri Grove, one of the few remaining stands of mature kauri on the Coromandel Peninsula. It is about 500 metres off the 309 Road, and is accessed by a 30-minute walking track.  History  The tree began as two separate seedlings. Over the centuries they grew in diameter, and the space between them reduced until eventually the two trees fused at the base. It is not known why the Siamese Kauri, and other trees of the same species in Kauri Grove were never felled, unlike almost all the kauri of the Coromandel Peninsula. One suggestion is that the land was controlled by mining companies that hoped to find gold in the area, and so access to the land was restricted.

Life He was born on the island of S√£o Nicolau, growing up with his grandparents on S√£o Vicente Island after his parents left to find work in Europe, a common occurrence in the country. His father ended up in Rotterdam and his mother settled in Paris after a time in Hamburg. He moved to be with his mother at age 14, but he missed his grandparents, leading to an attachment to the concept of saudade, the Portuguese word for longing and present in much Cabo Verde music. He learned the guitar at age 16 and continues to live in France. Career Chantre first became known for his work composing songs for Cape Verde singer Ces√°ria √âvora, who he met in Paris in the 1990s, after a concert both performed in. Shortly after, her producer asked me to write for her. He was responsible for three tracks on her Miss Perfumado album, which brought her fame and popularized Cape Verde music. This made him one of Evora‚Äôs favorite composers and the worked with her for decades afterwards. He has also collaborated with other artists such as Angolan singer Bonga, guitarist Bau, bass player Jos√© Paris, composer Amandio Cabral and his father, Vitorino Chantre, writing several songs with him. Chantre also wrote the lyrics for the song Ausencia, with music by Balkan composer Goran Bregovic, (sung by Evora) for the movie Underground, which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. His work has found popularity in Europe and the United States as well as Cape Verde. His band contains musicians with whom he has worked for years: Jacky Fourniret on accordion; Fabrice Thompson on drums and percussion; S√©bastien Gastine ondouble bass and electric bass and Kim Dan Le Oc Mach on violin. They have toured France and the rest of Europe, playing venues such as the 1999 Sfinks Festival and the Barakaldo Folk Festival. At the 2014 Festival Internacional Cervantino in Mexico, Chantre paid tribute to Evora, who died in 2011. Musical style Chantre is a singer, musician, arranger and composer. The base of Chantre‚Äôs melodies are Capeverdean, morna and the slightly father coladero, and he sticks with traditional instruments guitar, cavaquinho (a mandolin-like instrument from Cape Verde), violin and piano. He sings in Creole, Portuguese and French. What distinguishes Chantre‚Äôs work is influence from his love of Cuban and Brazilian music. Bossa nova and Cuban charanga can be heard, especially in voice and strings respectively. Other influences include bolero, blues and jazz. Lyrically, the concept of saudade (Portuguese for longing for the past or home) is dominant, a common theme in Cape Verde culture. However, other themes appear including the severity of life as well as happier emotions. Discography =Albums= Chantre‚Äôs first albums did not receive much attention, but the release of the Azulando album in 2004, made him a recording artist in his own right. *Terra & Cretcheu (1993) *Di Alma (1997) *Rodatempo (2000) *Live (2002) *Azulando (2004) *Metissage (2013) =Singles= *\\"Crepuscolare Solitudine\\" (\\"Crepuscular Solid√£o\\"), sang with Ces√°ria √âvora in Italian, released as part of the LP Capo Verde terra d'amore, Vol. 1 in 2009 *\\"Ricordo d'Infanzia\\", sang with Ces√°ria √âvora in Italian, released as part of the LP Capo Verde terra d'amore, Vol. 1 in 2009 *\\"La Voce dell'Amore\\" (\\"Voz d'Amor\\"), sang with Ces√°ria √âvora in Italian, released as part of the LP Capo Verde, terra d'amore, Vol. 2 in 2010 *\\"Mar de Canal\\", sang with Ces√°ria √âvora in Italian, released as part of the LP Capo Verde, terra d'amore, Vol. 3 in 2012 =Recordings= *\\"Luz Dum Estrela\\" by Ces√°ria √âvora in the album Miss Perfumado (1992) *\\"Recorda√Ø\\" by Ces√°ria √âvora in the album Miss Perfumado (1992) *\\"Tortura\\" by Ces√°ria √âvora in the album Miss Perfumado (1992) *\\"Quel Casinha\\" by Adriano Celentano, sang in Creole by Ces√°ria √âvora in the album C‚Äô√® sempre un motivo (2004) *\\"Elle chante\\" by Bernard Lavilliers with Ces√°ria √âvora, also recorded with Bernard Lavilliers and Pascal Arroyo in the album Carnets de bord (2004) References  External links  * Te√≥filo Chantre at Myspace * Te√≥filo Chantre at Funkhaus Europa * BBC Review 1964 births Living people Cape Verdean singers People from S√£o Nicolau, Cape Verde ","title":"Te√≥filo Chantre"},{"id":"21233788","text":"Edwin de Leon Edwin de Leon (May 4, 1818 ‚Äì November 30, 1891) was a Confederate diplomat, writer, and journalist. Biography De Leon was born in Columbia, South Carolina of parents Mordecai Hendricks De Leon and Rebecca Lopez. He was the brother of newspaperman Thomas Cooper de Leon as well as another brother David Camden De Leon and three sisters: Agnes, Maria Louisa, and Adeline Mary (who married Joseph Henry Adams, of Boston). Edwin's father Mordecai De Leon, a physician, removed from Philadelphia to Columbia, South Carolina, and was mayor of that city for several years. De Leon married Ellen Mary Novlan of Rothgar, Ireland, on August 25, 1858, in Somerset, England. (In a biography of Jefferson Davis Edwin De Leon is incorrectly identified as \\"Daniel De Leon\\". Daniel De Leon was an American socialist organizer and theoretician and the long-time leader of the Socialist Labor Party. When the Civil War began Daniel De Leon was eight years old and living on the island of Cura√ßao.) De Leon graduated from South Carolina College, where he was a member of the Euphradian Society, and studied law, but soon turned to literature and politics. He became an active collaborator on the Southern Review, the Magnolia, the Southern Literary Messenger, and other periodicals. Removing to Savannah, Georgia, he took editorial charge of the Savannah Republican and made it a political factor in the state; his next charge was the Columbia, South Carolina Telegraph, a daily. Young America De Leon was a leader of the Young America movement. At the invitation of a committee of Southern members of Congress, De Leon established, in Washington The Southern Press, which had a large circulation during the early fifties. For his services during the Pierce campaign, Pierce appointed him consul-general to Egypt, which position he filled for two terms with marked success. At the commencement of the Crimean War, an order was issued by the Porte expelling all Greeks from the Ottoman dominion. The Greeks in Egypt appealed to De Leon, who took them under the protection of the American flag, guaranteed their good behavior, and insisted that they should not be interfered with. The home government approved his course, and Congress paid him the compliment of ordering the printing of his dispatches. The King of Greece tendered him the grand cross of the Order of San Sauveur, but Leon declined on the ground that it was anti-republican. De Leon rendered conspicuous services in protecting American missionaries at Jaffa, and for this he received for the second time the thanks of the State Department. Through his influence American commerce with Egypt was largely extended and American machinery introduced into that country. It was during his incumbency of the consul-general-ship that he heard of the secession of his native state from the Union. He at once forwarded his resignation. Returning home, he ran the blockade and made his way to New Orleans. Thence he proceeded to Richmond and reported to Jefferson Davis, volunteering for military duty. Davis sent him instead on a confidential mission to Europe to secure the recognition of the Southern Confederacy by foreign powers. De Leon refused any salary or remuneration for his services, but advanced from his own purse considerable sums for the use of the Confederacy. He again ran the blockade, reached Nassau, and arrived in England in July, 1862. As diplomatic agent he was received in the highest circles, both in England and in France, and personally pleaded the cause of the Confederacy with Lord Palmerston and the emperor Napoleon. His dispatches to the Southern government were intercepted, however, and were published by order of secretary of state, William H. Seward. Through his friend Thackeray, De Leon became a member of the Garrick Club and a contributor to the Cornhill Magazine. After the Civil War, De Leon returned to America and settled in New York City. He frequently contributed to the leading magazines, chiefly on Eastern topics. Among his works are: \\"Thirty Years of My Life on Three Continents\\";\\"The Khedive's Egypt\\"; \\"Under the Star and Under the Crescent\\"; \\"Askaros Kassis, the Copt,\\" a novel, republished in England.

There had been ample rain during the winter of 1938 resulting in heavy understorey, but drought set in toward the end of the year. A heatwave in early January 1939 ensured the fuel load was very dry and particularly susceptible to fire. The fires were finally extinguished when thunderstorms arrived during Saturday evening of 14 January. Damage was assessed at ‚Ç§650,000, including the destruction of ninety houses. No lives were lost, but the fire highlighted the inadequacy of South Australia's fire-fighting capability. Six thousand city volunteers had helped to combat the fires, using mainly branches and wet bags. As a result, the Emergency Fire Service was set up, the precursor to the modern Country Fire Service.

Because of its economic consequences energy rationing is used as method of last resort, often at times of emergency such as during an energy crisis. Forms Examples of energy rationing include fuel rationing and the use of ration books or ration stamps to restrict personal consumption. Energy rationing may include penalties such as surcharges and disconnection from electrical supply for those who choose not to reduce their demand voluntarily. Load shedding is a common form of energy rationing used when electricity markets cannot keep up to demand, particularly peak demand. Limited electrical supply from power stations at times of drought or after infrastructure is damaged, can lead authorities to implement rationing. Brazil was forced to implement energy rationing due to drought in 2001. Reducing demand in this way aims to avoid forced power outages which are more disruptive than rationing. Tradable Energy Quotas is an energy rationing system designed to enable nations to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases along with their use of oil, gas and coal, and to ensure fair access to energy for all. Issues One issue with energy rationing is the cost of setting up a rationing schemes. Another criticism is that energy rationing schemes are unworkable and face many practical problems including consumer lawsuits. Due to the general disdain for restrictions that interfere with existing personal freedoms, such as ecotaxes and carbon rationing, energy rationing is not favoured by policy makers to mitigate global warming. =Peak oil= As oil becomes more scarce due to oil depletion countries that have reserve currencies will prefer to buy oil rather than ration it. The Oil Depletion Protocol is form of energy rationing that was developed by Richard Heinberg to ensure that price rationing does not price out poorer countries.

Coat of arms of the last chief of Maxton, the Maxton of Cultoquhey Clan Maxton is a Scottish clan. The clan does not have a chief recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms therefore the clan has no standing under Scots Law. Clan Maxton is considered an armigerous clan, meaning that it is considered to have had at one time a chief who possessed the chiefly arms, or who was considered chief of the name. However no one at present is in possession of such arms, and no one is considered chief of the name. The surname Maxton is considered to be a habitational name from the lands and barony of Maxton in Roxburghshire, on the Scottish Borders. The name roughly means \\"settlement (tun) of Maccus\\". Around 1153, during the reign of David I, Maccus, son of Undwin is thought to have obtained the lands. The family however are thought to have lost their lands, which passed into the possession of Robert de Berkley in the 12th century. In 1261, Adam de Maxton was elected Abbot of Melrose. He may be the same Alexander de Maxton, who was styled \\"constable of Roxburgh\\", and the individual who is recorded as submitting to Edward I, king of England, on the Ragman Rolls in 1296. In around 1410, Robert de Maxton received the lands of Cultoquhey near Crieff in Perthshire. This man's coat of arms may allude to the earlier Abbot of Melrose, as they bear three crosses. Robert Maxton died at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. The clan prospered in Perthshire, allying themselves by marriages to other clans such as the Oliphants and the Grahams of Balgowan and of Grahams Murrayshall. In 1859, James Maxton of Cultoquhey succeeded his uncle Robert Graham of Balgowan and since then the Maxtons of Cultoquhey borne the double-barrelled surname Maxtone-Graham and quartered the arms of both families.

It should not be confused with other sandwiches that use lettuce as one of many ingredients, such as the BLT sandwich or the tomato and lettuce sandwich. The lettuce sandwich has a long history in both the United States and the United Kingdom. It has been used as a metaphor to represent things like mundanity, weakness and poverty. Shanghai-style lettuce wraps with sauces at Auburn Alehouse History The lettuce sandwich was mentioned in print as early as 1894 in The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. The lettuce sandwich (bread with a lettuce filling) was a common food in the United States and England during the first half of the 20th century. Lettuce sandwiches have been served at fine luncheons, The lettuce sandwich (bread with lettuce filling) is also an old- fashioned English food. Lettuce sandwiches are still eaten in the US and elsewhere. Preparation =Bread and lettuce= When making a bread and lettuce sandwich, the bread is sometimes buttered or spread with mayonnaise, and then lettuce is placed between the two slices of bread. =Breadless lettuce sandwich= To prepare a breadless lettuce sandwich, roll any filling inside a large leaf of lettuce or place it between two leaves of lettuce. The west-coast hamburger chain In-N-Out offers a lettuce sandwich variation called \\"the Protein\\" or \\"Protein Style\\" on their hidden menu. It is a hamburger patty wrapped in lettuce instead of the traditional bun. Metaphors The lettuce sandwich has also become a cultural metaphor to represent something unattractive, unappealing, weak, or mundane. In this sense, the term \\"limp (or soggy) lettuce sandwich\\" is often used. Being on a \\"lettuce sandwich diet\\" refers to getting by on the bare minimum with absolutely nothing more than the necessities of life. The lettuce sandwich is sometimes indicative of poverty or hardship, and also represents lack of sufficient nourishment. The lettuce sandwich is considered a humble, tasteless food. It can be used to represent disappointment as in \\"life need not be a lettuce sandwich over the sink\\". Health benefits A lettuce sandwich has been claimed to be a sleep-inducing remedy for insomnia. Lettuce sandwiches (no bread) are also eaten to promote weight loss. Lettuce sandwiches (bread filled with lettuce) can also be a good food choice for the health-conscious. The lettuce sandwich (bread filled with lettuce)‚Äîwhich contains no meat‚Äîis mentioned in a book about vegetarian diets.

In 2006, it was disassembled at its location over Big Monon Ditch, near Medaryville in Pulaski County, and moved to the Wabash and Erie Canal park in Delphi in Carroll County, Indiana. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2003, thanks to the efforts of a local Boy Scout. It is believed to be the last surviving Stearns Truss Bridge in the United States. History The bridge was erected over the Big Monon Ditch in 1905 by the Winamac Bridge Company. It was designed by William E. Stearns, and is the only Stearns Truss Bridge known left in existence in the United States. A unique feature of the bridge is that it was designed to be easily moved. Various connecting points were made to easily pivot into and out of place, and the caissons were made to be loaded and unloaded with ballast to anchor the structure in place. This allowed the bridge to carry a much greater load as a function of its weight. It was placed on the National Register as part of an Eagle Scout project by Bradley Nielsen, who began the effort in 2002. The bridge and the road it served sat on farm property owned by his grandparents, and had been abandoned for some time. With the assistance of the Pulaski County Historical society, Nielsen researched the bridge's history and construction, and filled out the application to place the structure on the NRHP. In 2003 the bridge was placed on the Register as \\"Pulaski County Bridge No. 31\\". The bridge was owned by the county, and in 2005 when the contracts were let to clean the Big Monon Ditch the bridge was in the way of the dredging equipment. The commissioners discussed demolishing the bridge, and it was decided that removal of the bridge was necessary. A group of concerned historians involved with the Wabash and Erie Canal Park in Delphi came to the bridge's rescue. In December, 2005, the Pulaski County commissioners sold the bridge for $10 to the Delphi group. They moved the bridge to Delphi, and over the past several years‚Äîwith assistance from various funding agencies‚Äîhave rebuilt the structure. It was dedicated on November 11, 2007 as a featured element of the interpretive park, known as the \\"Blue Bridge\\". It was subsequently removed from the National Register in 2014.

Jean-Philippe-Eug√®ne de Merode was the only surviving child of Maximilian de Merode and Isabella-Margaretha de Merode. His father died one year after his birth and his mother remarried with the Joachim Ernest II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Rethwisch. This was an army commander who guided Jean-Philippe towards a military career. At the age of five Jean- Philippe was already present at the siege of Oran in North Africa. During the consecutive wars which raged in the Spanish Netherlands, Jean-Philippe switched sides a few times to maintain his possessions. First he and his Regiment of Westerloo served the anti-French coalition under King William III of England and King Charles II of Spain. In 1694 he was made Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece. During the War of Spanish Succession he served the new Bourbon King Philip V of Spain, and fought on the side of the French and Bavarians under Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, new governor of the Southern Netherlands. He played an important role in the Battle of Eckeren in 1703. The next year he fought in the Battle of Blenheim on the side of the French under Tallard and Marsin. The battle was a great defeat and M√©rode narrowly escaped death. After the battle, M√©rode retired to his castles in Westerlo, Pietersheim and Merode. From then on he served the new rulers of the Southern Netherlands: the Austrian Emperors Joseph I and Charles VI. In 1717 he was rewarded with the title of Field Marshal. Merode had a difficult character and had personal conflicts with Prince Eugene of Savoy and the Marquis de Pri√©.  Marriage and children  He married first in 1701 in Bayonne in 1701 with Maria-Theresia de Aragon y Pignatelli, daughter of Nicolas Pignatelli, Duke de Monteleone and Viceroy of Sardinia. They had three children of whom only Isabella-Marie (1703-1780) survived infancy, marrying a Count Czernin. Maria-Theresia died of Smallpox on 9 August 1718. Merode married again on 29 September 1721 with Princess Charlotte Wilhelmine Amalie Alexandrina (1703‚Äì1740), daughter of Francis Alexander, Prince of Nassau-Hadamar.

Mallon in 1899. It replaced a frame structure on the same site, built in 1872, which burned. Mallon came to Francesville from Morgan County, Indiana in 1865, and in 1868 began to clerk with Samuel Reishling, who is credited as having begun the second-ever business in the town. A few years later Mallon struck out on his own, and the 1883 history of the county says of him, \\"He is probably doing the leading business of this town.\\" It was built in 1899, and is a two-story, rectangular brick building measuring 40 feet wide and 80 feet deep. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. After Mallon's death in 1915 the store was taken over by his son Cecil, who operated it until 1949, 77 years of continuous business under the ownership of father and son. The store had an extremely close call in December, 1945, when a massive fire enveloped the block of buildings to its immediate east, on a bitterly cold night. Francesville historian Alyce Onken remembers standing on the street during the fire looking at the building, thinking, \\"It's gone for sure.\\" Miraculously, despite the near-total destruction of its neighbors, the building survived with only minor damage. A careful eye will note a cosmetic repair to the east wall as the only reminder of the calamity Many current residents of the town remember the store under the tenure of its second owners, Oscar and Jean Minkert. They came from North Judson to open Minkert's Dry Goods and Variety Store in 1949. Until Oscar's death in 1992 it retained the same old-fashioned look and feel of its predecessor, as well some of its longstanding stock of dry goods and merchandise. To visit Minkert's was to take a trip through time to a now-lost era in American retailing, with high ceilings, narrow aisles, hand-crafted wooden display cases, and husband-and-wife proprietors who knew their customers as friends. After Minkert died the building was purchased by Edison and Chrisann Gutwein, who moved their insurance business from a smaller building on Bill Street into the two-story structure. It was during their tenure that Mrs. Gutwein took an interest in the building's history, and she supervised its restoration back to the genteel beauty of its turn-of-the century provenance. She also did the research that in 1999 led to its addition to the National Register of Historic Places, one of the few structures in the county so far to achieve that designation. In 2002 the building and insurance business were sold to Dennis and Kitty Gutwein, the fourth, and current, owners. The building is used for multiple commercial purposes. The Mallon/Minkert building is almost completely intact and original, and is a notable historical asset.

Most of the exterior, and much of the interior, is covered in the local Carrara marble. History An older church, Ecclesia Sancti Andree de Carraria, is mentioned as existing on this site as early as 1035, but of it, only a bas-relief remains. The first written documentation of the Carrara Cathedral dates to 1099. The church was first enlarged in 1099, when it received the status of pieve. It is the first Medieval church to be constructed entirely of marble. The marble used for its construction is Apuan marble, more commonly known as Carrara marble. The lower section of the fa√ßade and the side area near the St. John Portal are characterized by a bichrome decoration with geometrical marble tarsias. This part of the building can be dated to the early 12th century by the influences of the Pisan Gothic style on the capitals and the architrave as well as the similarities in the alternating black and white marble patterning with the Tuscan churches of Pisa and Lucca. This style was also widespread in Liguria at the time, as shown by the similarity of the cathedral's portal with that of Genoa Cathedral, finished before 1142. The sculptors of the main portal and of the capitals of the first three spans in the interior belonged to the school of Maestor Wiligelmo. In 1151 the church came under the jurisdiction of the Lateranense Canons of San Frediano of Lucca and the second building phase began, lasting until about 1235 when the apse is known to have existed. The presbytery was added around this time as well, which lengthened the building from its original floor plan. There are similarities of style to contemporary Lucchese architecture. The lateral walls continued without the bichrome decoration. In the interior, the capitals are in the Corinthian and Composite orders, and the mullioned windows have leaves, human and animal motifs, which are perhaps influenced by ancient Roman structures still existing in Lucca at the time. Overview A design detail Right side aisle The church has a rectangular plan, consisting of three naves, a presbytery and a semi-circular apse. Center aisle The fa√ßade is made up of a combination of Romanesque and Gothic styles. The fa√ßade, which was finished in the second half of the 14th century, is made up of a bichrome pattern of light and dark marble stone. The bottom part of the fa√ßade and the side elevations are Romanesque, while the portal, crowned by sculptures inspired by medieval bestiaries, and surmounted by a Gothic rose window with twisted columns, each different from the others, is consistent with the Gothic style of architecture in the 14th century. The bell tower, standing at , was also built in the 14th century. The interior of the cathedral consists of a taller nave with exposed wooden trusses, and two smaller cross-vaulted aisles. It houses the sarcophagus of St. Ceccardus, patron saint of Carrara, a 14th-century \\"Annunciation\\" (example of Pisan sculpture), and a 14th-century wooden crucifix by Angelo Puccinelli. There is also a white marble pulpit in the presbytery that was installed in the 16th century. Outside the church is the \\"Statua del Gigante\\" (Statue of the Giant), by Baccio Bandinelli.

In January 2013 he became the president of the ACT Party. On 2 February 2014, after unsuccessfully running for ACT Leader, he relinquished the role of president to allow classical liberal philosopher Jamie Whyte to become ACT Leader and David Seymour to become the party's new Epsom candidate. Business career Boscawen was an accountant in the 1980s, but became insolvent after borrowing heavily to invest in the sharemarket before the stockmarket crash of 1987. With help from his parents, he was able to return to investing, developing the K-Mart Plaza in Hastings. He became an associate member of the New Zealand Business Roundtable.

On 17 August 2010 it was announced Boscawen would become ACT's deputy leader and take the ministerial roles of consumer affairs, and associate commerce. The position of deputy leader, and consumer affairs, and associate education and defence were formerly held by Heather Roy before her removal. The associate education role was taken over ACT leader Rodney Hide likewise associate commerce by Boscawen.

He managed to expand his territory considerably during his reign. He took part in the Third Crusade. Biography =Early life= Laurenburg Castle Arnstein Abbey Coat of Arms of the Counts of Nassau Walram was probably a son of Rupert II, Count of Laurenburg and an unknown woman.Cawley. Possibly his mother was called Beatrix, it is uncertain whether that mention should not have been 'grandmother' (namely Beatrix of Limburg, daughter of Walram II the Pagan, Count of Limburg and Duke of Lower Lorraine and Jutta of Guelders (daughter of Gerard I, Count of Guelders). Walram is mentioned between 1176 and 1191 as Count of Laurenburg and then, from 1193, as Count of Nassau. He seems to have had his residence at the Castle of Laurenburg first, which is why he used the title Count of Laurenburg, even when the name Nassau was already in use for a while in his house. In 1198, his widow still used the seal of Walram of Laurenburg.Sauer (1896). Walram ruled with his cousin Rupert III, and later with his son Herman, whom he eventually succeeded. =Territorial expansion= Walram acquired the Herborner Mark, the Kalenberger Zent (including Mengerskirchen, Beilstein and Nenderoth, the second two now being parts of Greifenstein), and the Gericht Heimau (including Driedorf and L√∂hnberg) as a fief from the Landgraviate of Th√ºringen. In this way, Walram was able to make a connection between the family possessions the Vogtship of Weilburg (with its numerous property and lordship rights in the Westerwald and Dill River region), the castles of Laurenburg and Nassau on the River Lahn, and the Vogtship in the Siegerland (the region around the city of Siegen). The same period may also have brought the Lordship of the Westerwald (including Marienberg, Neukirch, and Emmerichenhain, now part of Rennerod). Walram also bought the Vogtships of Koblenz and Ems. To the south of his possessions, Walram took over partial rule of the Einrichgau, later-named the Vierherrengericht (Four Lords' Jurisdiction),The Vierherrengericht was named after its four owners, the counts of Katzenelnbogen (Hessen), Diez (Nassau- Diez), Nassau-Usingen and Nassau-Weilburg. In 1774, these areas, united around the town of Nast√§tten and composed of thirty-eight villages, were divided. See: Huberty, et al. (1981). with its main town of Marienfels. This had been part of the former Countship of Arnstein. The last Count of Arnstein, Louis III, had no heir and had converted his castle of Arnstein into a monastery, Arnstein Abbey, near present-day Obernhof, about east of Nassau. On entering the monastery himself in 1139/1140, he had transferred control of Marienfels to his cousin Reginbold of Isenburg. In 1160, Reginbold sold it jointly to his cousins, the Counts of Nassau and Katzenelnbogen. The Nassau Counts were able to claim part of the inheritance through the marriage of their ancestor Dudo of Laurenburg with one of the seven daughters of Count Louis I of Arnstein.History of Marienfels and the Counts of Arnstein. Retrieved 27 January 2009. Walram became affiliated with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarrossa in the Peace of the Rhine Country in 1179. He placed his lands under the immediate suzerainty of the German king, rather than remaining a vassal of the archbishop of Trier. He would remain a loyal supporter of the Hohenstaufen Emperors. Walram's close ties with the imperial house were rewarded with K√∂nigshof Wiesbaden. At about the same time, he also received possession of the game rights in the forests of the Rheingau (a fief of the Archbishopric of Mainz), so that his rule extended over the Taunus, south to the Middle Rhine. Walram had ongoing feuds with the neighboring houses of Eppstein, Solms, and Katzenelnbogen. =Third Crusade= With his cousin Rupert III, Walram went to the Third Crusade (1189‚Äì1190).L√ºck (1981), p. 18. Walram probably took up the cross with the emperor on the Hoftag at Mainz on 27 March 1188. He was assigned an important task at the start of the journey. Together with his cousin Rupert and Count Henry of Diez, he formed the accompaniment of Bishop Herman II of M√ºnster, who was envoy to Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos in the fall of 1188. The delegation did arrive in Constantinople, but initially snubbed and then actually held as hostages by the Byzantine Emperor.Setton, et al. (2005), p. 896. They were set free as the crusade army approached.Vorsterman van Oyen (1882). On 28 October 1189, Rupert and his companions rejoined the crusade army at Philippopel. From that day, he disappears from the crusade army. The assumption that he was present at the formation of the Teutonic Order in Acre is, as far is known about its course, untenable. Nor is there sufficient evidence that at that time, contrary to his crusade vow, he left the crusade army. It is certain that in 1190, before the news of the death of the emperor arrived in Germany, Walram was a witness in a charter drawn up in Cologne by Archbishop Philip I of Cologne. = Subsequent years = Little is known about the subsequent years of Walram. He is sometimes mentioned as a witness, also in imperial charters, but in general he seems to be far from the emperor and not to have participated in his military activities. On 6 November 1195, after the mediation and approval of Emperor Henry VI, Walram concluded with Bishop Henry I of Worms the important treaty for his house in which the mutual rights - the lordship rights of the bishop and the vogtship rights of the count - to the castle, the city and the lordship Weilburg were established. Castle and lordship Weilburg appear here for the first time as the property of the House of Nassau. In the years following the treaty of 6 November 1195, Walram appears to have stayed at the imperial court, where he participated in the Reichstag of Worms, at which the emperor negotiated a new crusade. It is certain that Walram did not participate in the German army in 1197, several mentionings as witness in charters prove that he did not leave the country. Walram I died on 1 February 1198. He is buried in Arnstein Abbey. He was succeeded by his sons Henry II and Rupert IV. Marriage and children Walram married a certain Kunigunde (‚Ä† 8 November in or after 1198, last mentioned on 20 March 1198), possibly a daughter of a count of Sponheim or a daughter of count Poppo II of Ziegenhain. From this union came three children: # Henry II 'the Rich' (26 April 1247/48/49/50), Count of Nassau (1198-1247). # Rupert IV (‚Ä† after 1 January 1239), Count of Nassau (1198-1230) and Teutonic Knight (since 1230). # Beatrix, mentioned in 1222 as a nun in Affolderbach Abbey near Nast√§tten.

Short Brothers built SS Magnus Mail in 1889. Short Brothers Limited was a British shipbuilding company formed in 1850 and based at Pallion, Sunderland since 1869. The company closed in 1964 when it failed to invest to build bigger ships. 19th century In 1850 George Short founded a shipyard at Hylton to build small wooden ships for local users. In 1860 Short moved the yard downriver to Pallion and his four sons became partners in the business. In 1871 the yard built its first iron-hulled ship the High Stretfield and the company started using the name Short Brothers. John Y Short became a distinguished naval architect and at the 1878 Paris Exhibition he was awarded a gold medal. In 1883 Short's built a cargo liner for James Knott's Prince Line of Newcastle upon Tyne. This was the beginning of a 35-year relationship in which Short's supplied Prince Line with a total of 37 ships. They included the passenger liner , built in 1897, which spent its early years of service carrying thousands of Italian migrants to the USA. In 1895 John Y Short made a substantial investment in John Thomas North's Nitrate Producers' Steamship Company Ltd (\\"Anglo Line\\"). Short's went on to supply the line with 30 ships, starting with and continuing until at least 1929. From 1897 Short's undertook contract work for several Tyneside shipyards. In 1900 John Y Short died, his brother Joseph took over and the business was converted from a partnership into a limited company, Short Brothers Limited. The yard now employed 1,500 people. 20th century In the First World War the yard built 14 barges for the Admiralty, plus merchant ships including four cargo ships to the War Shipping Controller's standard B type design. After the war Short's built its first two turbine steamers; the 7,607 GRT sister ships (1921) and (1922) for Union-Castle Line. During the 1920s shipbuilding declined. Short's workforce struck in 1923 and 1926 and the yard closed in June 1930. on sea trial in 1934 In 1933 Short's reopened to build , a tramp steamer designed by Joseph Isherwood. She was the first of Isherwood's new \\"arcform\\" design, which increased cargo capacity by 10% and increased speed, but also reduced fuel consumption. Arcwear was launched in November 1933 and made her maiden voyage in 1934. Her fuel economy and speed exceeded expectations but she rolled badly in heavy weather and did not even move smoothly in calm weather. Only a few further arcform cargo ships and tankers were built. In 1938 Short's closed again, despite having a tramp ship still under construction. In the summer of 1939 Short's reopened again. During the Second World War it built mostly tramp steamers, plus two tankers and one LCT. Under the direction of the Ministry of War Transport by the end of 1944 Short's switched from building ships to its own design to assembling partly prefabricated government standard C-type cargo ships. By the end of the war Short's was employing about 900 people. In 1946 John H Short was company chairman and H.S. Short, great-grandson of the founder, joined the Board of Directors. In the early 1960s the Short family did not want to invest in lengthening the yard's berths to build bigger ships. Therefore after Short's launched the universal bulk carrier on 17 October 1963 and completed her in January 1964, they closed the business with the loss of 300 jobs. , built by Short Brothers in 1910 *1889 ‚Äì SS Magnus Mail ‚Äì hull 184 *1892 ‚Äì *1910 ‚Äì *1918 ‚Äì *1927 ‚Äì ‚Äì hull 425 *1940 ‚Äì *1941 ‚Äì *1941 ‚Äì ‚Äì hull 466 *1941 ‚Äì *1941 ‚Äì *1941 ‚Äì *1942 ‚Äì ‚Äì hull 474 *1942 ‚Äì *1942 ‚Äì *1942 ‚Äì *1942 ‚Äì *1943 ‚Äì *1943 ‚Äì *1943 ‚Äì *1943 ‚Äì *1943 ‚Äì ‚Äì hull 480 *1944 ‚Äì *1945 ‚Äì *1945 ‚Äì *1945 ‚Äì *1946 ‚Äì *1952 ‚Äì References Defunct shipbuilding companies of the United Kingdom Shipbuilding companies of the City of Sunderland British companies established in 1900 Manufacturing companies established in 1900 Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1964 1900 establishments in England 1964 disestablishments in England British companies disestablished in 1964 ","title":"Short Brothers of Sunderland"},{"id":"21234461","text":"Skeldon is a small town in eastern coastal Guyana, on the estuary of the Courantyne River, which forms Guyana's border with Suriname.

The village is located in Silesian Beskids, alongside Bystra stream. The name of the village is of topographic origin borrowed from an older name of the Bystra stream (nominative bystry: fast, rapid).  History  The village lies along the Bystra stream, left tributary of Bia≈Ça River that historically divided the village into two parts: Bystra Krakowska (Cracovian Bystra) and Bystra ≈ölƒÖska (Silesian Bystra). They were therefore established in the 16th century as two separate villages. = Bystra ≈ölƒÖska = Silesian village lying on the left northern bank of the Bystra stream was first mentioned in 1570 when it was sold together with Silesian Mikuszowice and an adjacent wood by dukes of Cieszyn to the town of Bielsko. Soon after in 1572 it became a part Bielsko state country (since 1754 Duchy of Bielsko) that was split from the Duchy of Teschen. The village also politically belonged to the Habsburg Monarchy. In the second half of the 19th century the village became a spa resort, especially after opening a railway line in 1878 a nearby Wilkowice. After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Bielsko. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 397 in 1880 to 548 in 1910 with a dwindling majority being native German-speakers (from 76.9% in 1880 to 51.7% in 1910) accompanied by a German-speaking minority (at most 14 or 1.9% in 1880), in terms of religion in 1910 majority were Roman Catholics (81.1%), followed by Protestants (14%), Jews (25 or 4.6%) and 2 people adhering to yet another faith. It was then considered to be a part of a German language island around Bielsko (German: Bielitz-Bialaer Sprachinsel). = Bystra Krakowska = Cracovian village lying on the right southern bank of the Bystra stream was also established in the 16th century. It belonged then to ≈ªywiec latifundium and since 1618 to ≈Åodygowice latifundium that was split from it. The village also politically belonged to the Crown of Poland. Upon the First Partition of Poland in 1772 it became part of the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia. According to the Austrian census of 1900 the village had 947 inhabitants, all of them were Polish-speaking Roman Catholics.Ludwig Patryn (ed): Gemeindelexikon der im Reichsrate vertretenen K√∂nigreiche und L√§nder, bearbeitet auf Grund der Ergebnisse der Volksz√§hlung vom 31.

Three people were stabbed to death,Het Laatste Nieuws, (Belgium) and twelve were mutilated in the attack. The suspect has been linked to a separate murder of an elderly lady and police have suggested he was plotting more nursery attacks. The daycare centre where the initial attack occurred is expected never to reopen. Attack Kim de Gelder, a 20-year-old Belgian from Sinaai, entered the Fabeltjesland nursery through an unlocked side-door, claiming that he had a question to ask. He then entered one of the rooms and began attacking small children before moving to another room. The man was reported to be wearing black-and-white makeup with his hair vividly colored red, similar to that of the Joker from the Batman films (who, however, has green hair and white and red facial features). De Gelder's attorney, Jaak Haentjens, later formally denied any link to \\"the Joker\\", attributing the claims of face paint to De Gelder's pale skin. De Gelder was, in the eyes of his friends and colleagues, a silent boy, who never said anything. A total of eighteen infants under the age of three and six adults were in the nursery at the time of the attack. Two infants and one adult were killed; six children, all between one and three years old, were seriously injured; another four suffered minor injuries; and nine escaped unscathed. The alleged perpetrator left the scene on his bike. =Victims= * Leon Garcia-Mannaert, an eight-month-old boy, * Corneel Vermeir, a nine-month-old boy, * Marita Blindeman, a 54-year-old . Initial reports on Belgian television suggested that five people had been killed and twenty others had been injured, with government officials only confirming the death of one adult and one child. This number was later increased, as another infant had died from the injuries he had sustained. It has also been reported that some of the surviving children have needed plastic surgery due to serious mutilations. Arrest and aftermath A massive search operation was mounted, and a man was captured by police a short while later, in the nearby town of Lebbeke. Having been wounded during his capture, the man was taken to a hospital in Aalst, Belgium. Police reported that he was carrying a list of nurseries, which they suspect he may have been planning to attack as well. The mayor of Dendermonde, Piet Buyse, said, \\"The victims are being cared for and those who were not injured have been brought to a centre where they are receiving counseling.\\" At a press conference on the evening of the attack, public prosecutor Christian Du Four provided the following information about the alleged offender, denying several early rumours:Het Laatste Nieuws Some 6,000 people marched through Dendermonde on 25 January 2009, laying hundreds of bouquets and stuffed animals outside the daycare centre as the Mayor of Dendermonde, Piet Buyse, announced that the Fabeltjesland nursery would never reopen. The attacker De Gelder was identified as the attacker on 25 January 2009.Duizend vragen, maar dader zwijgt, Nieuwsblad.be (January 25, 2009) De Gelder confided in his attorney, stating that he had been troubled by depression as a teenager and at one point heard voices in his head. Regardless, a psychiatrist had concluded that he did not need to be sent to a mental institution. On 26 January 2009, Belgian officials named De Gelder as the primary suspect in a further, fourth murder, where a 73-year-old woman was stabbed to death in her apartment in Beveren, near Antwerp, on January 16th. Prosecutor Christian Du Four told journalists that there were \\"very clear indications of links between the murders\\", though De Gelder denies any involvement. Police have stated that he was planning attacks on other nurseries. On 27 January, De Gelder admitted to the attacks. The media originally reported that De Gelder was wearing makeup at the time of the attack, making him look like the Joker, but police have not confirmed that depiction. In further media reports, De Gelder reportedly watched The Dark Knight an unusually high number of times (\\"film obsession\\"), appears to have quoted the character Harvey Dent at the start of the attack. Both police investigators and De Gelder's lawyer have made statements dismissing such as relevant to his motive in the attack. De Gelder's attorneys argued that he was schizophrenic and therefore could not be held fully accountable for his actions. Psychiatrists believed that De Gelder was faking psychosis and instead diagnosed him with schizotypal personality disorder with psychopathic traits and narcissistic features. The College of Psychiatrists concluded the De Gelder was mentally ill but competent to stand trial, and was in control of his actions when he committed the murders.  5 year memorial Dendermonde nursery attack on 23 January 2009 On 22 March 2013, a jury declared De Gelder was fully accountable for the attack and found him guilty of four counts of murder.Belgian man found guilty in quadruple killings; 2 of the victims were babies, Fox News (March 22, 2012) He was sentenced to life imprisonment the following day.Life in prison for Belgian creche killer Kim De Gelder, BBC News (March 23, 2012)  Reactions  Italian singer Luciano Ligabue dedicated a song to the victims, featured on his 2010 album, .

However, he soon rejected the authority of the government and retreated with some of the RCD-Goma troops to the Masisi forests in North Kivu,\\"Arrest Laurent Nkunda For War Crimes\\", Human Rights Watch, February 1, 2006 where he raised the flag of rebellion against the government of Joseph Kabila (who had succeeded his father in 2001). Nkunda claimed to be defending the interests of the Tutsi minority in eastern Congo who were subjected to attacks by Hutus who had fled after their involvement with the Rwandan genocide. This war has come to be known as the Kivu conflict. =Forming a government= In August 2007, the area under Nkunda's control lay north of Lake Kivu in Nord-Kivu in the territories of Masisi and Rutshuru. In this area, Nkunda established his headquarters by building necessary infrastructure and developing institutions of order. He established a political organisation known as the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP). =2008 Nord-Kivu fighting= In fighting that began on 27 October 2008, known as the 2008 Nord-Kivu fighting, Nkunda led CNDP rebels who opposed both the army of the Democratic Republic of Congo, FDLR militias, and United Nations forces of the 17,000 UN contingent in the country. It was reported that he was advancing on the city of Goma with the aim of capturing it, with the Congolese army claimed he was receiving aid from Rwanda. The fighting uprooted 200,000 civilians, bringing the total number of people displaced by the Kivu conflict to 2 million, causing civil unrest large food shortages and what the United Nations calls \\"a humanitarian crisis of catastrophic dimensions.\\" In an interview with the BBC on November 10, 2008, Nkunda threatened to topple the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo if the president, Joseph Kabila, continued to avoid direct negotiations. =Human rights= Throughout the years Nkunda has come under scrutiny and been accused by a number of organizations of committing human rights abuses. Nkunda was indicted by the Congolese government for war crimes in September 2005. According to human rights monitors such as Refugees International, Nkunda's troops have been alleged to have committed acts of murder, rape, and pillaging of civilian villages; a charge which Nkunda denies.Refugees International website.

The force was part of a joint Congolese-Rwandan operation which was launched to hunt Rwandan Hutu militiamen operating in DR Congo. Nkunda is currently being held at an undisclosed location in Rwanda. A Rwandan military spokesman has claimed, however, that Nkunda is being held at Gisenyi, a city in Rubavu district in the Western Province of Rwanda. and On 26 March 2010, the Rwandan Supreme Court ruled that his case could only be heard by a military court, since the military had been responsible for his apprehension.

The human owners of the house must leave a bowl of milk or cream or some other offering for the brownie, usually by the hearth. Brownies are described as easily offended and will leave their homes forever if they feel they have been insulted or in any way taken advantage of. Brownies are characteristically mischievous and are often said to punish or pull pranks on lazy servants. If angered, they are sometimes said to turn malicious, like boggarts. Brownies originated as domestic tutelary spirits, very similar to the Lares of ancient Roman tradition. Descriptions of brownies vary regionally, but they are usually described as ugly, brown-skinned, and covered in hair. In the oldest stories, they are usually human-sized or larger. In more recent times, they have come to be seen as small and wizened. They are often capable of turning invisible and they sometimes appear in the shapes of animals. They are always either naked or dressed in rags. If a person attempts to present a brownie with clothing or if a person attempts to baptize him, he will leave forever. Although the name brownie originated as a dialectal word used only in the UK, it has since become the standard term for all such creatures throughout the UK and Ireland. Regional variants in England and Scotland include hobs, silkies, and √πruisgs. Variants outside England and Scotland are the Welsh Bwbach and the Manx Fenodyree. Brownies have also appeared outside of folklore, including in John Milton's poem L'Allegro. They became popular in works of children's literature in the late nineteenth century and continue to appear in works of modern fantasy. The Brownies in the Girl Guides are named after a short story by Juliana Horatia Ewing based on brownie folklore. Origin Roman Lararium, or household shrine to the Lares, from the House of the Vettii in Pompeii. Brownies bear many similarities to the Roman Lares. Brownies originated as domestic tutelary spirits, very similar to the Lares of ancient Roman tradition, who were envisioned as the protective spirits of deceased ancestors. Brownies and Lares are both regarded as solitary and devoted to serving the members of the house. Both are said to be hairy and dress in rags and both are said to demand offerings of food or dairy. Like Lares, brownies were associated with the dead and a brownie is sometimes described as the ghost of a deceased servant who once worked in the home. The Cauld Lad of Hilton, for instance, was reputed to be the ghost of a stable boy who was murdered by one of the Lords of Hilton Castle in a fit of passion. Those who saw him described him as a naked boy. He was said to clean up anything that was untidy and make messes of things that were tidy. The menehunes of Hawaiian folklore have been compared to brownies as well, seeing they are portrayed as a race of dwarf people who carry out work during night time. The family cult of deceased ancestors in ancient times centred around the hearth, which later became the place where offerings would be left for the brownie. The most significant difference between brownies and Lares is that, while Lares were permanently bound to the house in which they lived, brownies are seen as more mobile, capable of leaving or moving to another house if they became dissatisfied. One story describes a brownie who left the house after the stingy housewife fired all the servants because the brownie was doing all the work and refused to return until all the servants had been re-hired. Traditions =Activities= Traditions about brownies are generally similar across different parts of Great Britain. They are said to inhabit homes and farms. They only work at night, performing necessary housework and farm tasks while the human residents of the home are asleep. The presence of the brownie is believed to ensure household prosperity and the human residents of the home are expected to leave offerings for the brownie, such as a bowl of cream or porridge, or a small cake. These are usually left on the hearth. The brownie will punish household servants who are lazy or slovenly by pinching them while they sleep, breaking or upsetting objects around them, or causing other mischief. Sometimes they are said to create noise at night or leave messes simply for their own amusement. In some early stories, brownies are described as guarding treasure, a non-domestic task outside of their usual repertoire. Brownies are almost always described as solitary creatures who work alone and avoid being seen. There is rarely said to be more than one brownie living in the same house. Usually, the brownie associated with a house is said to live in a specific place, such as a particular nearby cave, stream, rock, or pond. Some individual brownies are occasionally given names. Around 1650, a brownie at Overthwaite in Westmorland was known as \\"Tawny Boy\\" and a brownie from Hilton in County Durham was known as \\"Cauld Lad\\". Brownies are said to be motivated by \\"personal friendships and fancies\\" and may sometimes be moved to perform extra work outside of their normal duties, such as, in one story of a brownie from Balquam, fetching a midwife when the lady of the house went into labour. In 1703, John Brand wrote in his description of Shetland that: =Appearance= Pencil illustration of a brownie by a twenty-first- century artist, based in part on nineteenth century descriptions Brownies are virtually always male, but female brownies, such as Meg Mullach (or \\"Hairy Meg\\"), have occasionally been described as well. They are usually envisioned as ugly and their appearances are sometimes described as frightening or unsettling to members of the houses in which they reside. They received their name from the fact that they are usually described as brown-skinned and completely covered in hair. In the earliest traditions, brownies are either the same size as humans or sometimes larger, but, in later accounts, they are described as \\"small, wizened, and shaggy\\". They are often characterized as short and rotund, a description that may be related to mid-seventeenth-century Scottish descriptions of the Devil. Two Scottish witchcraft confessions, one by Thomas Shanks in 1649 and another by Margaret Comb in 1680, both describe meetings with a \\"thick little man\\". The man in these descriptions may have been conceived as a brownie. In the late nineteenth century, the Irish folklorist Thomas Keightley described the brownie as \\"a personage of small stature, wrinkled visage, covered with short curly brown hair, and wearing a brown mantle and hood\\".Keightley, Thomas (1870). \\"The Brownie\\". The Fairy Mythology. London: H. G. Bohn. Brownies are usually described as either naked or clothed in rags. Brownies of the Scottish Lowlands were said not to have noses, but instead had merely a single hole in the centre of their face. In Aberdeenshire, brownies are sometimes described as having no fingers or toes. Sometimes brownies are stated to appear like children, either naked or dressed in white tunics. Like the Phooka in Irish folklore, brownies are sometimes described as taking the forms of animals. As a rule, they can turn invisible, but they are supposed to rarely need this ability because they are already experts at sneaking and hiding. A story from Peeblesshire tells of two maids who stole a bowl of milk and a bannock that had been left out for the brownie. They sat down together to eat them, but the brownie sat between them invisibly and whenever either of them tried to eat the bannock or drink the milk, the brownie would steal it from them. The two maids began arguing, each accusing the other of stealing her milk and bannock. Finally, the brownie laughed and cried out: \\"Ha, ha, ha! Brownie has't a'!\\" =Leaving the house= If the brownie feels he has been slighted or taken advantage of, he will vanish forever, taking the prosperity of the house with him. Sometimes the brownie is said to fly into a rage and wreck all his work before leaving. In extreme cases, brownies are even sometimes said to turn into malicious boggarts if angered or treated improperly. A brownie is said to take offence if a human observes him working, if a human criticizes him, or if a human laughs at him. Brownies are supposedly especially angered by anything they regard as contempt or condescension. The brownie at Cranshaws in Berwickshire is said to have mown and thrashed the grain for years. Then someone commented that the grain had been poorly mown and stacked, so, that night, the brownie carried all the grain to Raven Crag two miles away and hurled it off the cliff, all the while muttering: > It's no' weel mow'd! It's no' weel mow'd!‚Äî Then it's ne'er be mow'd by me > again; I'll scatter it owre the Raven Stane And they'll hae some wark ere > it's mow'd again! A brownie can also be driven away if someone attempts to baptize him. In some stories, even the manner in which their bowls of cream are given is enough to drive the brownie away. The brownie of Bodsbeck, near the town of Moffat in Scotland, left for the nearby farm of Leithenhall after the owner of Bodsbeck called for him after pouring his cream, instead of letting him find the cream himself. Sometimes giving the brownie a name was enough to drive him away. A brownie who haunted Almor Burn near Pitlochry in Perthshire was often heard splashing and paddling in the water. He was said to go up to the nearby farm every night with wet feet and, if anything was untidy, he would put it in order, but, if anything was tidy, he would hurl it around and make a mess. The people of the area feared him and did not go near the road leading up from the water at night. A man returning from the market one night heard him splashing in the water and called out to him, addressing him by the nickname \\"Puddlefoot\\". Puddlefoot exclaimed in horror, \\"I've gotten a name! 'Tis Puddlefoot they call me!\\" Then he vanished forever and was never heard again. =Gifts of clothing= A recurring folkloric motif holds that, if presented with clothing, a brownie will leave his family forever and never work for them again, similar to the Wichtelm√§nner in the German story of \\"The Elves and the Shoemaker\\". If the family gives the brownie a gift of clothing, he will leave forever and refuse to work for the family. The first mention in English of a brownie disappearing after being presented with clothes comes from Book Four, Chapter Ten of Reginald Scot's The Discoverie of Witchcraft, published in 1584. Sometimes brownies are reported to recite couplets before disappearing. One brownie from Scotland is said to have angrily declared: > Red breeks and a ruffled sark! Ye'll no get me to do your wark! Another brownie from Berwickshire is said to have declared: > Gie Brownie a coat, gie Brownie a sark, Ye'se get nae mair o' Brownie's > wark. Explanations differ regarding why brownies disappear when presented with clothes, but the most common explanation is that the brownie regards the gift of clothing as an insult. One story from Lincolnshire, first recorded in 1891, attempts to rationalize the motif by making a brownie who is accustomed to being presented with linen shirts become enraged upon being presented with a shirt made of sackcloth. The brownie in the story sings before disappearing: > Harden, harden, harden hamp, I will neither grind nor stamp; Had you given > me linen gear, I have served you many a year. Thrift may go, bad luck may > stay, I shall travel far away. The Cauld Lad of Hilton seems to have wanted clothes and to have been grateful for the gift of them, yet still refused to stay after receiving them. At night, people were supposed to have heard him working and somberly singing: > Wae's me! Wae's me! The acorn is not yet Fallen from the tree, That's to > grow to the wood, That's to make the cradle, That's to rock the bairn, > That's to grow a man, That's to lay to me. After the servants presented him with a green mantle and hood, he is supposed to have joyfully sung before disappearing: > Here's a cloak, and here's a hood! The Cauld Lad of Hilton will do no more > good! It is possible that the Cauld Lad may have simply thought himself \\"too grand for work\\", a motif attested to in other folk tales, or that the gift of clothing may have been seen as a means of freeing him from a curse. A brownie from Jedburgh is also said to have desired clothing. The servants are reported to have heard him one night saying, \\"Wae's me for a green sark!\\" The laird ordered for a green shirt to be made for the brownie. It was left out for him and he disappeared forever. People assumed he had gone to Fairyland. =Brownie sway= In the nineteenth century, the pothook used to hang pots over the fire was made with a crook in it, which was known in Herefordshire as the \\"brownie's seat\\" or \\"brownie's sway\\". If the hook did not have crook on it, people would hang a horseshoe on it upside-down so the brownie would have a place to sit. The brownie at the Portway Inn in Staunton on Wye reportedly had a habit of stealing the family keys and the only way to retrieve them was for the whole family sit around the hearth and to set a piece of cake on the hob as an offering to the brownie. Then they would all sit with their eyes closed, absolutely silent, and the missing keys would be hurled at them from behind. Regional variants Although the name brownie originated in the early 16th century as a dialect word used only in the Scottish Lowlands and along the English border, it has become the standard name for a variety of similar creatures appearing in the folklores of various cultures across Britain. Stories about brownies are generally more common in England and the Lowlands of Scotland than in Celtic areas. Nonetheless, stories of Celtic brownies are recorded.  The Welsh name for a brownie is (). Like brownies, are said to have violent tempers if angered. The twelfth-century Welsh historian Gerald of Wales records how a inflicted havoc and mischief upon a certain household that had angered him. The 19th-century folklorist Wirt Sikes describes the as a \\"good-natured goblin\\" who performs chores for Welsh maids. He states that, right before she goes to bed, the maid must sweep the kitchen and make a fire in the fireplace and set a churn filled with cream by the fire with a fresh bowl of cream next to it. The next morning, \\"if she is in luck\\", she will find the bowl of cream had been drunk and the cream in the churn has been dashed. Sikes goes on to explain that, in addition to being a household spirit, the is also the name for a terrifying phantom believed to sweep people away on gusts of air. The is said to do this on the behalf of spirits of the restless dead, who cannot sleep because of the presence of hidden treasure. When these spirits fail to succeed in persuading a living mortal to remove the treasure, they have the whisk the person away instead. Briggs notes that this other aspect of the 's activities make it much more closely resemble the Irish Phooka. John Rhys, a Welsh scholar of Celtic culture and folklore, records a story from Monmouthshire in his 1901 book Celtic Folklore about a young maid suspected of having fairy blood, who left a bowl of cream at the bottom of the stairs every night for a . One night, as a prank, she filled the bowl with stale urine. The attacked her, but she screamed and the was forced to flee to the neighboring farm of . A girl there fed him well and he did her spinning for her, but she wanted to know his name, which he refused to tell. Then, one day when she pretended to be out, she heard him singing his name, , so he left and went to another farm, where he became close friends with the manservant, whose name was Moses. After Moses was killed in the Battle of Bosworth Field, began behaving like a boggart, wreaking havoc across the whole town. An old wise man, however, managed to summon him and banish him to the Red Sea. Elements of this story recur throughout other brownie stories.  The Manx name for a brownie is (). The is envisioned as a \\"hairy spirit of great strength\\", who is capable of threshing an entire barn full of corn in a single night. The is regarded as generally unintelligent. One Manx folktale tells of how the once tried to round up a flock of sheep and had more trouble with a small, hornless, grey one than any of the others; the \\"sheep\\" he had so much difficulty with turned out to be a hare. The exact same mistake is also attributed to a brownie from Lancashire and the story is also told in western North America. Like other brownies, the is believed to leave forever if he is presented with clothing. In one story, a farmer of Ballochrink gave the a gift of clothes in gratitude for all his work. The was offended and lifted up each item of clothing, reciting the various illnesses each one would bring him. The then left to hide away in Glen Rushen alone. =Hobs and hearth spirits= Especially in Yorkshire and Lancashire, brownies are known as \\"Hobs\\" due to their association with the hearth. Like brownies, Hobs would leave forever if presented with clothing. A Hob in Runswick Bay in North Yorkshire was said to live in a natural cave known as the \\"Hob-Hole\\", where parents would bring their children for the Hob to cure them of whooping cough. The Holman Clavel Inn in Somerset is also said to be inhabited by a mischievous Hob named Charlie. The story was recorded by the folklorist R. L. Tongue in 1964 immediately after he heard it from a woman who lived next door to the inn. Everyone in the locality knew about Charlie and he was believed to sit on the beam of holly wood over the fire, which was known as the \\"clavvy\\" or \\"clavey\\". Once, when the woman was having dinner with a local farmer, the servants set the table at the inn with \\"silver and linen\\", but, as soon as they left the room and came back, Charlie had put all the table settings back where they had come from because he did not like the farmer she was meeting with. Hobs are sometimes also known as \\"Lobs\\". Lob-Lie-by-the-Fire is the name of a large brownie who was said to perform farm labour. In Scotland, a similar hearth spirit was known as the Wag-at-the-Wa. The Wag-at-the-Wa was believed to sit on the pothook and it was believed that swinging the pothook served as an invitation for him to come visit. He was believed to pester idle servants, but he was said to enjoy the company of children. He is described as a hideous, short-legged old man with a long tail who always dressed in a red coat and blue breeches with an old nightcap atop his head and a bandage around his face, since he was constantly plagued by toothache. He also sometimes wore a grey cloak. He was often reported to laugh alongside the rest of the family if they were laughing, but he was strongly opposed to the family drinking any beverages with more alcohol content than home-brewed ale. He is said to have fled before the sign of the cross. =Silkie= A female spirit known as the Silkie or Selkie, who received her name from the fact that she was always dressed in grey silk, appears in English and Scottish folklore. Like a ghost, the Silkie is associated with the house rather than the family who lives there, but, like a brownie, she is said to perform chores for the family. A famous Silkie was reported to haunt Denton Hall in Northumberland. Briggs gives the report of a woman named Marjory Sowerby, who, as a little girl, had spoken with the last remaining Hoyles of Denten Hall, two old ladies, about the Silkie and its kindness to them. They told her that the Silkie would clean the hearth and kindle fires for them. They also mentioned \\"something about bunches of flowers left on the staircase\\". Sowerby left the area in around 1902 and, when she returned over half a century later after World War II, the Hoyles were both long dead and the house was owned by a man who did not believe in fairies. The stories about the Silkie were no longer told and instead the house was reputed to be haunted by a vicious poltergeist, who made banging noise and other strange noises and pulled pranks on the man. The man eventually moved out. Briggs calls this an example of a brownie turning into a boggart. Silkies were also sometimes believed to appear suddenly on roads at night to lonely travellers and frighten them. Another Silkie is said to haunt the grounds of Fardel Hall in Devonshire. This one is said to manifest in the form of a \\"beautiful young woman with long, golden hair, wearing a long silken gown\\" and supposedly guards a hoard of treasure buried on the grounds. Few people have seen the spirit, but many claim to have heard the rustling of her silk dress. She is believed to quietly strangle anyone who comes near finding the treasure.  The folklorist John Gregorson Campbell distinguishes between the English brownie, which lived in houses, and the Scottish ( also or urisk), which lived outside in streams and waterfalls and was less likely to offer domestic help. Although brownies and s are very similar in character, they have different origins. s are sometimes described as half-man and half- goat. They are said to have \\"long hair, long teeth, and long claws\\". According to M. L. West, they may be Celtic survivals of goat-like nature spirits from Proto-Indo-European mythology, analogous to the Roman fauns and Greek satyrs. Passersby often reported seeing an sitting atop a rock at dusk, watching them go by. During the summer, the was supposed to remain in the solitude of the wilderness, but, during the winter, he would come down and visit the local farms at night or take up residence in a local mill. Wild s were troublemakers and vandals who perpetrated acts of butchery, arson, and ravaging, but, once domesticated, they were fiercely loyal. Wealthy and prominent families were said to have s as household servants. One chieftain of the MacFarlane clan was said to have been nursed and raised by the wife of an . The Graham clan of Angus told stories of an that had once worked for one of their ancestors as a drudge. The Maclachlan clan in Strathlachlan had an √πruisg servant named \\"Harry\\", possibly shortened from \\"the hairy one\\". The MacNeils of Taynish and the Frazers of Abertarff also claimed to have √πruisg servants. were also known as s or kewachs. A story on the island of Eigg told of a that lived in a cave. In some parts of Scotland, similar domestic spirits were called Shellycoats, a name whose origin is uncertain. =Other variants= \\"O Waken, Waken, Burd Isbel\\", illustration by Arthur Rackham to Young Bekie, showing Billy Blind waking Burd Isobel A figure named \\"Billy Blind\\" or \\"Billy Blin\\", who bears close resemblances to both the brownie and the Irish banshee, appears in ballads of the Anglo-Scottish border. Unlike brownies, who usually provide practical domestic aid, Billy Blind usually only provides advice. He appears in the ballad of \\"Young Bekie\\", in which he warns Burd Isbel, the woman Bekie is pledged to marry, that Bekie is about to marry another woman. He also appears in the ballad of \\"Willie's Lady\\" in which he also provides advice, but offers no practical aid. Briggs notes stories of other household spirits from British folklore who are reputed to haunt specific locations. The \\"cellar ghost\\" is a spirit who guards wine in cellars from would-be thieves; Lazy Lawrence is said to protect orchards; Awd Goggie scares children away from eating unripe gooseberries; and Melch Dick guards nut thickets. The Kilmoulis is a brownie-like creature from the Scottish Lowlands that is often said to inhabit mills. He is said to have no mouth, but an enormous nose that covers most of his face. He is fond of pranks and only the miller himself is able to control him. In Texas in 1895, brownies told Arthur Stillwell to build a Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad terminal and the town of Port Arthur. Stillwell spoke to brownies since he was the age of four and always took their advice regarding anything from where to build to who he would marry. The brownies had warned him not to build his terminal in Galveston as it was going to be destroyed in a tidal wave. Analysis =Classification= Brownies have traditionally been regarded as distinct and different from fairies. In 1777, a vicar of Beetham wrote in his notes on local folklore, \\"A Browny is not a fairey, but a tawny color'd Being which will do a great deal of work for a Family, if used well.\\" The writer Walter Scott agreed in his Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, in which he states, \\"The Brownie formed a class of beings distinct in habit and disposition from the freakish and mischievous elves.\\" Modern scholars, however, categorize brownies as household spirits, which is usually treated as a subcategorization of fairy. Brownies and other household spirits differ significantly from other fairies in folklore, however. Brownies are usually said to dwell alongside humans in houses, barns, and on farms; whereas other fairies are usually said to reside in places of remote wilderness. Brownies are usually regarded as harmless, unless they are angered; other types of folkloric fairies, however, are typically seen as dark and dangerous. Finally, brownies are unusual for their solitary nature, since most other types of fairies are often thought to live in large groups. Briggs notes that brownies are frequently associated with the dead and states that, like the banshee in Irish folklore, \\"a good case\\" could be made for brownies to be classified as ghosts. Nonetheless, she rejects this idea, commenting that the Brownie has \\"an adaptability, individuality and a homely tang which forbids one to think of him as merely a lingering and reminiscent image.\\" In seventeenth-century Scotland, brownies were sometimes regarded as a kind of demon. King James VI and I describes the brownie as a demon in his 1597 treatise Daemonologie: =Functionalist analysis= The folklorist L. F. Newman states that the image of the brownie fits well into a Functionalist analysis of the \\"old, generous rural economy\\" of pre-Industrial Britain, describing him as the epitome of what a good household servant of the era was supposed to be. Belief in brownies could be exploited by both masters and servants. The servants could blame the brownie for messes, breakages, and strange noises heard at night. Meanwhile, the masters of the house who employed them could use stories of the brownie to convince their servants to behave by telling them that the brownie would punish servants who were idle and reward those who performed their duties vigilantly. According to Susan Stewart, brownies also resolved the problem that human storytellers faced of the unending repetition and futility of labour. As immortal spirits, brownies could not be worn out nor revitalized by working, so their work became seen as simply part of \\"a perpetual cycle that is akin to the activities of Nature herself.\\" Outside of folklore =Early literary appearances= In James Hogg's 1818 novel The Brownie of Bodsbeck, the eponymous \\"brownie\\" turns out to be John Brown, the leader of the Covenanters, a persecuted Scottish Presbyterian movement. An illegal meeting of Covenanters is shown in this painting, Covenanters in a Glen by Alexander Carse. An entity referred to as a \\"drudging goblin\\" or the \\"Lubbar Fend\\" is described in lines 105 to 114 of John Milton's 1645 pastoral poem L'Allegro. The \\"goblin\\" churns butter, brews drinks, makes dough rise, sweeps the floor, washes the dishes, and lays by the fire. According to Briggs, like most other early brownies, Milton's Lubbar Fend was probably envisioned as human-sized or larger. In many early literary appearances, the brownie turns out to be an ordinary person. The Scottish novelist James Hogg incorporated brownie folklore into his novel The Brownie of Bodsbeck (1818). The novel is set in 1685, when the Covenanters, a Scottish Presbyterian movement, were being persecuted. Food goes missing from the farm of Walter of Chaplehope, leading villagers to suspect it is the \\"brownie of Bodsbeck\\". In the end, it turns out that the \\"brownie\\" was actually John Brown, the leader of the Covenanters. Hogg later wrote about brownies in his short story \\"The Brownie of Black Haggs\\" (1828). In this story, the evil Lady Wheelhope orders that any of her male servants who openly practices any form of religion must be given over to the military and shot. Female servants who practiced religion are discretely poisoned. A single mysterious servant named Merodach stands up to her. Merodach is described as having \\"the form of a boy, but the features of one a hundred years old\\" and his eyes \\"bear a strong resemblance to the eyes of a well-known species of monkey.\\" Characters in the novel believe Merodach to be a brownie, although others claim that he is a \\"mongrel, between a Jew and an ape... a wizard... a kelpie, or a fairy\\". Like folkloric brownies, Merodach's religion is overtly pagan and he detests the sight of the Bible. He also refuses to accept any form of payment. Lady Wheelhope hates him and attempts to kill him, but all her efforts mysteriously backfire, instead resulting in the deaths of those she loves. The novel never reveals whether Merodach is actually of supernatural origin or if he is merely a peculiar-looking servant. Charlotte and Emily Bront√´ were both familiar with Hogg's stories and his portrayal of Merodach may have greatly influenced Emily's portrayal of her character Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights (1847). Brownies are also briefly referenced in Charlotte's novel Villette (1853). The late nineteenth century saw the growth and profusion of children's literature, which often incorporated fantasy. Brownies in particular were often thought of as especially appealing to children. Juliana Horatia Ewing incorporated brownie folklore remembered from her childhood into her short story \\"The Brownies\\", first published in 1865 in The Monthly Packet and later incorporated into her 1871 collection of short stories The Brownies and Other Tales. In the story, a selfish boy seeks a brownie to do his chores for him because he is too lazy to do them himself. A wise old owl tells him that brownies do not really exist and the only real brownies are good little children who do chores without being asked. The boy goes home and convinces his younger brother in join him in becoming the new household \\"brownies\\". Ewing's short story inspired the idea of calling helpful children \\"brownies\\". =Mass marketing= Illustration of a brownie by Palmer Cox from his Brownies Around the World (1894). The popularity of Cox's poems and illustrations cemented brownies as an element of North American children's literature. The Canadian American children's writer Palmer Cox helped promote brownies in North America through his illustrated poems about them published in St. Nicholas Magazine. Cox portrayed brownies as \\"tiny elf-like figures who often took on tasks en masse\\". These poems and illustrations were later collected and published in his book The Brownies: Their Book in 1887, which became the first of several such collections. In the 1890s, so-called \\"brownie-mania\\" swept across the United States. Cox effectively licensed out his brownie characters rather than selling them, something which he was among the first to do. He and his many business collaborators were able to market brownie-themed tie-in merchandise, including boots, cigars, stoves, dolls, and silverware. The popularity of Cox's poems, illustrations, and tie-in products cemented brownies as an element of North American children's literature and culture. Meanwhile, Cox could not copyright the name \\"brownie\\" because it was a creature from folklore, so unauthorized \\"brownie\\" products began to flood the market as well. The widespread \\"brownie\\" merchandise inspired George Eastman to name his low-cost camera \\"Brownie\\". In 1919, Juliette Gordon Low adopted \\"Brownies\\" as the name for the lowest age group in her organization of \\"Girl Guides\\" on account of Ewing's short story. A brownie character named \\"Big Ears\\" appears in Enid Blyton's Noddy series of children's books, in which he is portrayed as living in a mushroom house just outside the village of Toytown. In Blyton's Book of Brownies (1926), a mischievous trio of brownies named Hop, Skip, and Jump attempt to sneak into a party hosted by the King of Fairyland by pretending to be Twirly-Whirly, the Great Conjuror from the Land of Tiddlywinks, and his two assistants. =Modern fantasy= The Fablehaven book series, written by Brandon Mull, describes the brownies living near the residence on the Fablehaven Sanctuary. These are human-like, save for their minuscule stature and leafy ears. They love to make desserts and will repair and improve (to their abilities) anything broken throughout the house overnight if given any ingredients, which they will use to make a dessert of their choosing. It is said that chocolate brownies were named after them due to being invented by the fairy brownies. George MacDonald incorporated features of Scottish brownie lore in his nineteenth-century works The Princess and the Goblin and Sir Gibbie‚Äîhis brownies have no fingers on their hands. Warrior brownies appear in the 1988 fantasy film Willow, directed by Ron Howard. These brownies are portrayed as only a couple inches tall and are armed with bows and arrows. Though they are initially introduced as the kidnappers of a human infant, they turn out to be benevolent. Creatures known as \\"house elves\\" appear in the Harry Potter series of books by J. K. Rowling, published between 1997 and 2007. Like the traditional brownies of folklore, house elves are loyal to their masters and may be released by a gift of clothing. House elves also resemble brownies in appearance, being small, but they have larger heads and large, bat-like ears. Rowling's books also include boggarts, which are sometimes traditionally described as brownies turned malevolent. A brownie named Thimbletack plays an important role in the children's fantasy book series The Spiderwick Chronicles, written by Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi and published in five volumes from May 2003 to September 2004 by Simon & Schuster. He lives inside the walls of the Spiderwick estate and is only visible when he wishes to be seen. He is described as \\"a little man about the size of a pencil\\" with eyes \\"black and beetles\\" and a nose that is \\"large and red\\". When angered, Thimbletack transforms into a malicious boggart. The series became an international bestseller and was translated into thirty languages. A film adaptation of the same name was released in 2008.

The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colours, most often fawn or black, and a compact square body with well-developed muscles. Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart. In the United Kingdom, in the nineteenth century, Queen Victoria developed a passion for pugs which she passed on to other members of the Royal family. Pugs are known for being sociable and gentle companion dogs. The American Kennel Club describes the breed's personality as \\"even-tempered and charming\\". Pugs remain popular into the twenty-first century, with some famous celebrity owners. A pug was judged Best in Show at the World Dog Show in 2004. Description A fawn Pug puppy =Physical characteristics= While the pugs that are depicted in eighteenth century prints tend to be long and lean, modern breed preferences are for a square cobby body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle. Their smooth and glossy coats can be fawn, apricot fawn, silver fawn, or black.Color: The colors are fawn or black. The fawn color should be decided so as to make the contrast complete between the color and the trace and mask. The markings are clearly defined and there is a trace of a black line extending from the occiput to the tail. The tail normally curls tightly over the hip. Pugs have two distinct shapes for their ears, \\"rose\\" and \\"button\\". \\"Rose\\" ears are smaller than the standard style of \\"button\\" ears, and are folded with the front edge against the side of the head. Breeding preference goes to \\"button\\" style ears. Pugs' legs are strong, straight, of moderate length and are set well under. Their shoulders are moderately laid back. Their ankles are strong, their feet are small, their toes are well split-up, and their nails are black. The lower teeth normally protrude further than their upper, resulting in an under-bite. =Temperament= This breed is often described by the Latin phrase multum in parvo, or \\"much in little\\" or \\"a lot of dog in a small space\\", alluding to the Pug's remarkable and charming personality, despite its small size. Pugs are strong willed but rarely aggressive, and are suitable for families with children. The majority of the breed is very fond of children and sturdy enough to properly play with them. Depending on their owner's mood, they can be quiet and docile but also vivacious and teasing. Pugs tend to be intuitive and sensitive to the moods of their owners and are usually eager to please them. Pugs are playful and thrive on human companionship. They also tend to have a snoozy nature and spend a lot of time napping. Pugs are often called \\"shadows\\" because they follow their owners around and like to stay close to the action, craving attention and affection from their owners. =Birth and reproduction= Pug pregnancies last an average of 63 days. The average sized litter for Pugs is 4 to 6 puppies, though this can vary from 1 to 9 and still be considered normal. File:Pug 600.jpgThe breed has strong, straight legs set well under the body and a tail that curls over the hip.

A portrait of Princess Ekaterina Dmitrievna Golitsyna by Louis-Michel van Loo (1759) Moscow, Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts A favourite Pug bitch depicted in 1802, by Henry Bernard Chalon =Chinese origins= China is the earliest known source for the breed. Similar dogs were popular in the Imperial court during the Song Dynasty. In ancient times, Pugs were bred to be companions for ruling families in China. The pet Pugs were highly valued by Chinese Emperors, and the royal dogs were kept in luxury and guarded by soldiers. Pugs later spread to other parts of Asia. In Tibet, Buddhist monks kept Pugs as pets in their monasteries. The breed has retained its affectionate devotion to its owners since ancient times. =16th and 17th centuries= Pugs were popular at European courts, and reportedly become the official dog of the House of Orange in 1572 after a Pug named Pompey saved the life of the Prince of Orange by alerting him to the approach of assassins. A Pug travelled with William III and Mary II when they left the Netherlands to accept the throne of England in 1688. During this period, the Pug may have been bred with the old type King Charles spaniel, giving the modern King Charles Spaniel its Pug characteristics. The breed eventually became popular in other European countries as well. Pugs were painted by Goya in Spain, and in Italy they rode up front on private carriages, dressed in jackets and pantaloons that matched those of the coachman. They were used by the military to track animals and people, and were also employed as guard dogs. =18th century to present day= The English painter William Hogarth was the devoted owner of a series of Pugs. His 1745 self-portrait, which is now in London's Tate Gallery, includes his Pug, Trump.William Hogarth. The Painter and his Pug, 1745. Tate Gallery, London, England. www.tate.org.uk. Retrieved 9 April 2013. The Pug was also well known in Italy. In 1789, author Hester Piozzi wrote in her journal, \\"The little Pug dog or Dutch mastiff has quitted London for Padua, I perceive. Every carriage I meet here has a Pug in it.\\" The popularity of the Pug continued to spread in France during the eighteenth century. Before her marriage to Napoleon Bonaparte, Jos√©phine had her Pug Fortune carry concealed messages to her family while she was confined at Les Carmes prison, it having alone been given visiting rights. In nineteenth century England, the breed flourished under the patronage of Queen Victoria. Her many Pugs, which she bred herself, included Olga, Pedro, Minka, Fatima and Venus. Her involvement with dogs in general helped to establish the Kennel Club, which was formed in 1873. Queen Victoria favored apricot and fawn colors. Queen Victoria's passion for Pugs was passed on to many other members of the Royal family, including her grandson King George V and his son King Edward VIII. Many responded to the breed's image of anti-functionalism and diminutive size during this period.Yang, C. (2012). Culture in Miniature: Toy Dogs and Object Life. Eighteenth Century Fiction, 25(1), 139-174. In paintings and engravings of the 18th and 19th centuries, Pugs usually appear with longer legs and noses than today, and sometimes with cropped ears. The modern Pug's appearance probably changed after 1860 when a new wave of Pugs were imported directly from China. These Pugs had shorter legs and the modern-style Pug nose. The British aristocrat Lady Brassey is credited with making black Pugs fashionable after she brought some back from China in 1886. Ear cropping was made illegal in 1895. Pugs arrived in the United States during the nineteenth century and were soon making their way into the family home and the show ring. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1885. The Pug Dog Club of America was founded in 1931 and was recognized by the American Kennel Club that same year. In 1981, the Pug Dhandys Favorite Woodchuck won the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in the United States, the only Pug to have won there since the show began in 1877. The World Champion, or Best in Show at the 2004 World Dog Show held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was a Pug named Double D Cinoblu's Masterpiece. Health problems Since pugs lack longer snouts and prominent skeletal brow ridges, they are susceptible to eye injuries such as proptosis, scratched corneas, and painful entropion. They also have compact breathing passageways, leaving many prone to breathing difficulties or unable to efficiently regulate their temperature through evaporation from the tongue by panting. A Pug's normal body temperature is between and . If this temperature rises to , oxygen demand is greatly increased and immediate cooling is required. If body temperature reaches , organ failure can occur. Their breathing problems can be worsened by the stresses of travelling in air cargo, which may involve high temperatures. Following the deaths of pugs and other brachycephalic breeds, several airlines either banned their transport in cargo or enacted seasonal restrictions. Pugs that live a mostly sedentary life can be prone to obesity, though this is avoidable with regular exercise and a healthy diet. The median life span of Pugs is 11 years, which is in line with other breeds of the same size. =Common conditions= An overweight pug. Pugs, like other short-snouted breeds, have elongated palates. When excited, they are prone to \\"reverse sneezing\\" which causes them to quickly (and seemingly laboriously) gasp and snort. The veterinary name for this is pharyngeal gag reflex and it is caused by fluid or debris getting caught under the palate and irritating the throat or limiting breathing. Reverse sneezing episodes are usually not harmful, and massaging the dog's throat or covering its nose in order to make it breathe through its mouth can often shorten a sneezing fit. Some pugs are also born with stenotic nares which can also inhibit their breathing. In serious cases, the pinched nostrils make breathing even more difficult for this breed and put added pressure on the larynx. In some cases, the dog could pass out from blocked airways. If this happens, one should inquire with their veterinarian whether or not surgery is needed to modify the breathing passages. Eye prolapse is a common problem among Pugs and other brachycephalic breeds (see brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome) and can be caused by a trauma to the head or neck, or even by the owner using a tight leash instead of a harness.Dogs 101 Pug Video While the eye can usually be pushed back into its socket by the owner or by a vet, veterinary attention is usually advisable. If the prolapse happens on a regular basis, the Pug might require surgery.Traumatic eye prolapse by Jeff Grognet, D.V.M., B.Sc.(Agr.) Pugs have many wrinkles in their faces, so owners will often clean inside the creases to avoid irritation and infection. If this is not done, the dog may develop a condition known as skin fold dermatitis. An abnormal formation of the hip socket, known as hip dysplasia, affected nearly 64% of Pugs in a 2010 survey performed by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals; the breed was ranked the second worst-affected by this condition out of 157 breeds tested. Pugs are one of several breeds that are more susceptible than other dogs to demodectic mange, also known as \\"demodex\\". This condition is caused when parasitic mites, that are often present in a dog's skin without causing symptoms, are allowed to do damage because their host has a weakened immune system. It is a problem for many young Pugs, although not usually a major one, and is easily treatable, but some are especially susceptible and present with a systemic form of the condition. This vulnerability is thought to be genetic and breeders will avoid producing puppies from adults who have this condition.Demodectic Mange in Dogs PetMD Article by T. J. Dunn, Jr., DVM. Retrieved 9 April 2013. In 2008, an investigative documentary carried out by the BBC found significant inbreeding between pedigree dogs, with a study by Imperial College, London, showing that the 10,000 Pugs in the UK were so inbred that their gene pool was the equivalent of only 50 individuals. =Serious issues= Pugs can suffer from necrotizing meningoencephalitis (NME), also known as Pug dog encephalitis (PDE), an inflammation of the brain and meninges. NME also occurs in other small dogs, such as the Yorkshire Terrier, Maltese, and Chihuahua. There is no known cure for NME, which is believed to be an inherited disease. Dogs usually die or have to be put to sleep within a few months of onset, which, in those susceptible to this condition, is mostly between six months and three years of age. This breed, along with other brachycephalic dogs (e.g., boxers, bulldogs), are also prone to hemivertebrae. The curled tail of a British bulldog is an example of a hemivertebrae, but when it occurs not in the coccygeal vertebrae but in other areas of the spine, it can cause paralysis. The condition occurs when two parts of a spinal vertebra do not fuse properly while a young Pug is still growing, resulting in an irregularly shaped spinal cavity which can put pressure on the spinal cord.

(1836-1918) In popular culture The breed became iconic in India, as it was featured as the mascot in a series of Vodafone (formerly Hutchison Essar) advertising commercials directed by Prakash Varma. The pug that was predominantly featured in the commercials was Cheeka. The advertisement campaign was followed by a rise in the popularity of pugs in India, and the sale of pugs more than doubled within months, with prices for pugs rising considerably. A few other adverts also appeared in the following months, inspired by the idea of a dog following a boy.Jaypal, Renuka. Going Digital in India , Viewpoint, May 2006, retrieved 24 November 2006. The Men in Black film series features Frank the pug, a fictional talking pug played by the animal actor Mushu. Frank has helped to popularize pugs and has become an iconic example of the breed.

They speak the Kalasha language, from the Dardic family of the Indo-Aryan branch. They are considered unique among the people of Pakistan.Augusto S. Cacopardo. Pagan Christmas: Winter Feasts of the Kalasha of the Hindu Kush. p.28. They are also considered to be Pakistan's smallest ethnoreligious group, practising a religion which some authors characterise as a form of animism, while academics classify it as \\"a form of ancient Hinduism\\". The term is used to refer to many distinct people including the V√§i, the ƒåima-ni≈°ei, the V√¢nt√§, plus the Ashkun- and Tregami-speakers. The Kalash are considered to be an indigenous people of Asia, with their ancestors migrating to Chitral valley from another location possibly further south, which the Kalash call \\"Tsiyam\\" in their folk songs and epics. Some of the Kalash traditions consider the various Kalash people to have been migrants or refugees. They are also considered by some to have been descendants of Gandhari people. The neighbouring Nuristani people of the adjacent Nuristan (historically known as Kafiristan) province of Afghanistan once had the same culture and practised the same faith adhered to by the Kalash though with some distinctions. The first historically recorded Islamic invasions of their lands were by the Ghaznavids in the 11th centuryPagan Christmas: Winter Feasts of the Kalasha of the Hindu Kush, By Augusto S. Cacopardo while they themselves are first attested in 1339 during Timur's invasions. Nuristan had been forcibly converted to Islam in 1895‚Äì96, although some evidence has shown the people continued to practice their customs. The Kalash of Chitral have maintained their own separate cultural traditions.Newby, Eric. A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush. 2008. Culture The culture of the Kalash people is unique and differs in many ways from the many contemporary Islamic ethnic groups surrounding them in northwestern Pakistan. They are polytheists and nature plays a highly significant and spiritual role in their daily life. As part of their religious tradition, sacrifices are offered and festivals held to give thanks for the abundant resources of their three valleys. Kalasha Desh (the three Kalash valleys) is made up of two distinct cultural areas, the valleys of Rumbur and Bumburet forming one, and Birir Valley the other; Birir Valley being the more traditional of the two. Kalash mythology and folklore has been compared to that of ancient Greece, but they are much closer to the Hindu traditions in other parts of the Indian subcontinent. The Kalash have fascinated anthropologists due to their unique culture compared to the rest in that region. =Language= The Kalasha language, also known as Kalasha-mun, is a member of the Dardic group of the Indo-Aryan languages. Its closest relative is the neighbouring Khowar language. Kalasha was formerly spoken over a larger area in south Chitral, but it is now mostly confined to the western side valleys having lost ground to Khowar. =Customs= Kalash girl There is some controversy over what defines the ethnic characteristics of the Kalash. Although quite numerous before the 20th century, the non-Muslim minority has seen its numbers dwindle over the past century. A leader of the Kalash, Saifulla Jan, has stated, \\"If any Kalash converts to Islam, they cannot live among us anymore. We keep our identity strong.\\"Raffaele, Paul. Smithsonian Jan. 2007: page 66-68. About three thousand have converted to Islam or are descendants of converts, yet still live nearby in the Kalash villages and maintain their language and many aspects of their ancient culture. By now, sheikhs, or converts to Islam, make up more than half of the total Kalasha- speaking population. Kalasha women usually wear long black robes, often embroidered with cowrie shells. For this reason, they are known in Chitral as \\"the Black Kafirs\\". Men have adopted the Pakistani shalwar kameez, while children wear small versions of adult clothing after the age of four. In contrast to the surrounding Pakistani culture, the Kalasha do not in general separate males and females or frown on contact between the sexes. However, menstruating girls and women are sent to live in the \\"bashaleni\\", the village menstrual building, during their periods, until they regain their \\"purity\\". They are also required to give birth in the bashaleni. There is also a ritual restoring \\"purity\\" to a woman after childbirth which must be performed before a woman can return to her husband. The husband is an active participant in this ritual. Girls are initiated into womanhood at an early age of four or five and married at fourteen or fifteen. If a woman wants to change husbands, she will write a letter to her prospective husband informing him about how much her current husband paid for her. This is because the new husband must pay double if he wants her. Marriage by elopement is rather frequent, also involving women who are already married to another man. Indeed, wife-elopement is counted as one of the \\"great customs\\" (gh≈çna dast≈´r) together with the main festivals. Wife-elopement may lead in some rare cases to a quasi-feud between clans until peace is negotiated by mediators, in the form of the double bride- price paid by the new husband to the ex-husband.Parkes in: Rao and B√∂ck (2000), p. 273 Kalash lineages (kam) separate as marriageable descendants have separated by over seven generations. A rite of \\"breaking agnation\\" (tatb≈ôe ƒçhin) marks that previous agnates (tatb≈ôe) are now permissible affines (d√§rak \\"clan partners\\"). Each kam has a separate shrine in the clan's Jƒì·π£·π≠ak-hƒÅn, the temple to lineal or familial goddess Jƒì·π£·π≠ak. The historical religious practices of the Pahari people are similar to those of the Kalash people in that they \\"ate meat, drank alcohol, and had shamans\\". In addition, the Pahari people \\"had rules of lineage exogamy that produced a segmentary system closely resembling the Kalasha one\\". =Festivals= Joshi, Kalash women and men dance and sing their way from the dancing ground to the village arena, the Charso, for the end of the day's festivities Chilam Joshi festival celebrations The three main festivals (khaws√°·πÖgaw) of the Kalash are the Chilam Joshi in middle of May, the Uchau in autumn, and the Caumus in midwinter. The pastoral god Sorizan protects the herds in Fall and Winter and is thanked at the winter festival, while Goshidai does so until the Pul festival (p≈©. from *p≈´r·πáa, full moon in Sept.) and is thanked at the Joshi (jo·π£i, ≈æ≈ç≈°i) festival in spring. Joshi is celebrated at the end of May each year. The first day of Joshi is \\"Milk Day\\", on which the Kalash offer libations of milk that have been saved for ten days prior to the festival. The most important Kalash festival is the Chawmos (cawm≈çs, ghona chawmos yat, Khowar \\"chitrimas\\" from *cƒÅturmƒÅsya, CDIAL 4742), which is celebrated for two weeks at winter solstice (c. 7‚Äì22 December), at the beginning of the month chawmos mastruk. It marks the end of the year's fieldwork and harvest. It involves much music, dancing, and goats killed for consumption as food. It is dedicated to the god Balimain who is believed to visit from the mythical homeland of the Kalash, Tsyam (Tsiyam, ts√≠am), for the duration of the feast. At Chaumos, impure and uninitiated persons are not admitted; they must be purified by waving a fire brand over women and children and by a special fire ritual for men, involving a shaman waving juniper brands over the men. The 'old rules' of the gods (Devalog, dewal≈çk) are no longer in force, as is typical for year-end and carnival-like rituals. The main Chaumos ritual takes place at a Tok tree, a place called Indra's place, \\"indrunkot\\", or \\"indr√©yin\\". Indrunkot is sometimes believed to belong to Balumain's brother, In(dr), lord of cattle. The men must be divided into two parties: the pure ones have to sing the well-honored songs of the past, but the impure sing wild, passionate, and obscene songs, with an altogether different rhythm. This is accompanied by a 'sex change': men dress as women, women as men (Balumain also is partly seen as female and can change between both forms at will). At this crucial moment the pure get weaker, and the impure try to take hold of the (very pure) boys, pretend to mount them \\"like a hornless ram\\", and proceed in snake procession. At this point, the impure men resist and fight. When the \\"nagayr≈ç\\" song with the response \\"han sar√≠as\\" (from *samrƒ´yate 'flows together', CDIAL 12995) is voiced, Balumain showers all his blessings and disappears. He gives his blessings to seven boys (representing the mythical seven of the eight Devalog who received him on arrival), and these pass the blessings on to all pure men. In myth, Mahandeu had cheated Balumain from superiority, when all the gods had slept together (a euphemism) in the Shawalo meadow; therefore, he went to the mythical home of the Kalash in Tsiyam (ts√≠am), to come back next year like the Vedic Indra (Rigveda 10.86). If this had not happened, Balumain would have taught humans how to have sex as a sacred act. Instead, he could only teach them fertility songs used at the Chaumos ritual. He arrives from the west, the Bashgal valley, in early December, before solstice, and leaves the day after. He was at first shunned by some people, who were annihilated. He was, however, received by seven Devalog and they all went to several villages, such as Batrik village, where seven pure, young boys received him whom he took with him. Therefore, nowadays, one only sends men and older boys to receive him. Balumain is the typical culture hero. He told people about the sacred fire made from junipers, about the sowing ceremony for wheat that involved the blood of a small goat, and he asked for wheat tribute (hushak) for his horse. Finally, Balumain taught how to celebrate the winter festival. He was visible only during his first visit, now he is just felt to be present. During the winter the Kalash play an inter-village tournament of Chikik Gal (ball game) in which villages compete against each other to hit a ball up and down the valley in deep snow. Religion The Kalash people are divided equally between the adherents of Islam, and those that practice the traditional Kalash religion, which some observers label as animism, but others as \\"a form of ancient Hinduism\\". According to Sanskrit linguist Michael Witzel, the traditional Kalash religion shares \\"many of the traits of myths, ritual, society, and echoes many aspects of Rigvedic [religion]\\" but not of the post- Rigvedic religion that later developed in other parts of India.pace FUSSMAN 1977 Kalash culture and belief system differ from the various ethnic groups surrounding them but are similar to those practised by the neighbouring Nuristanis in northeast Afghanistan before their forced conversion to Islam. Various writers have described the faith adhered to by the Kalash in different ways. University of Rochester social anthropologist and professor Barbara A. West, with respect to the Kalash states in the text Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania that their \\"religion is a form of Hinduism that recognizes many gods and spirits\\" and that \\"given their Indo-Aryan language ... the religion of the Kalasha is much more closely aligned to the Hinduism of their Indian neighbors than to the religion of Alexander the Great and his armies.\\" The journalist Frud Bezhan incorporates all of these perspectives, describing the religion followed by the Kalash as being \\"a form of ancient Hinduism infused with old pagan and animist beliefs.\\" M. Witzel describes both pre-Vedic and Vedic influences on the form of ancient Hinduism adhered to by the Kalash. The isolated Kalash have received strong religious influences from pre-Islamic Nuristan. Richard Strand, a prominent expert on languages of the Hindu Kush, spent three decades in the Hindukush. He noted the following about the pre-Islamic Nuristani religion: > \\"Before their conversion to Isl√¢m the Nurist√¢nis practised a form of ancient > Hinduism, infused with accretions developed locally. They acknowledged a > number of human-like deities who lived in the unseen Deity World (K√¢mviri > d'e lu; cf. Sanskrit deva lok'a-).\\" =Deities= Noted linguist and Harvard professor Michael Witzel summarises the faith practised by the Kalash with this description: ;Mahandeo: Mahandeo is a deity whom the Kalash pray to and is known as Mahadev in other languages of the Indian subcontinent in modern Hinduism. ;Imra: Certain deities were revered only in one community or tribe, but one was universally revered as the Creator: the ancient Hindu god Yama R√¢ja called imr'o in K√¢mviri. There is a creator god, appearing under various names, no longer as Father Heaven, but as lord of the nether world and of heaven: Imra (*Yama RƒÅjan), MƒÅra 'death' (Nuristani) He (Yama rajan) is a creator deity called Dezau (·∏çez√°w) whose name is derived from Indo-European *dheig'h 'to form' (Kati Nuristani dez 'to create', CDIAL 14621); Dezauhe is also called by the Pashto term Khodai. There are a number of other deities, semi-gods and spirits. ;Indr: Michael Witzel claims there is an Indra-like figure, often actually called Indr (N., K.) or Varendr (K., war√¶n, wer√≠n, *aparendra). As in the Veda, the rainbow is called after him. When it thunders, Indra is playing Polo. Indra appears, however, in various forms and modern 'disguises', such as Sajigor (Sajig≈çr), also called Shura Verin. The shrine of Sajigor is in Rumbur valley. War√©n(dr-) or In Warƒ´n is the mightiest and most dangerous god. Even the recently popular Balumain (ba·∏∑ima√≠n, K.) has taken over some of Indra's features: He comes from the outside, riding on a horse. Balumain is a culture hero who taught how to celebrate the Kalash winter festival (Chaumos). He is connected with Tsyam, the mythological homeland of the Kalash. Indr has a demon-like counterpart, Je·π£·π≠an, who appears on earth as a dog; the gods (Devalog, Dewal√≥k) are his enemies and throw stones at him, the shooting stars. ;Munjem Mal√©k: Another god, Munjem Mal√©k (munjem 'middle'; mal√©k from Arab. malik 'king'), is the Lord of Middle Earth and killed, like the Indra, his father. Mahandeo (mahand√©o, cf. the Nuristani Mon/MƒÅndi), is the god of crops, and also the god of war and a negotiator with the highest deity. ;Jestak: Jestak (j√©·π£·π≠ak, from *jye·π£·π≠hƒÅ, or *de·π£·π≠rƒ´?) is the goddess of domestic life, family and marriage. Her lodge is the women's house (Je·π£·π≠ak Han). Dezalik (·∏çiz√°lik), the sister of \\"Dezau\\" is the goddess of childbirth, the hearth and of life force; she protects children and women. She is similar to the Nirmali (Indo-Iranian *nirmalikƒÅ). She is also responsible for the Bashaleni lodge. ;Suchi, Var≈çti, and Jach: There also is a general pattern of belief in mountain fairies now often called by their Persian name, Peri, but still called Apsaras in the RƒÅjatara·πÖgi·πáƒ´, Suchi (s√∫ƒçi, now often called Peri), who help in hunting and killing enemies, and the Var≈çti, their violent male partners. They live in the high mountains, such as Tirich Mir, but in late autumn they descend to the mountain meadows. The Jach (j.ac.) are a separate category of female spirits of the soil or of special places, fields and mountain pastures. The religion and culture held by the Kalash has also been influenced by Islamic ideology and culture. Their belief in one supreme God is one example of Muslim influence. They also use some Arabic and Persian words to refer to God.Zaheer- ud-Din, Muslim Impact on Religion and Culture of the Kalash, Al-Adwa 43:30, 2015 =Ritual= A drummer during the Joshi festival in Bumberet, Pakistan. Drumming is a male occupation among the Kalash people. These deities have shrines and altars throughout the valleys, where they frequently receive goat sacrifices. In 1929, as Georg Morgenstierne testifies, such rituals were still carried out by Kalash priests, \\"i≈°tikavan\\" 'priest' (from i≈°tikh√©k 'to praise a god'). This institution has since disappeared but there still is the prominent one of shamans (dehar).Li√®vre and Loude 1990 Witzel writes that \\"In Kalash ritual, the deities are seen, as in Vedic ritual (and in Hindu P≈´jƒÅ), as temporary visitors.\\" Mahandeo shrines are a wooden board with four carved horse heads (the horse being sacred to Kalash) extending out, in 1929 still with the effigy of a human head inside holes at the base of these shrines while the altars of Sajigor are of stone and are under old juniper, oak and cedar trees. Horses, cows, goats and sheep were sacrificed. Wine is a sacred drink of Indr, who owns a vineyard (Indruakun in the Kafiristani wama valley contained both a sacred vineyard and shrine (Idol and altar below a great juniper tree) along with 4 large vates carved out of rocks)‚Äîthat he defends against invaders. Kalash rituals are of the potlatch type; by organising rituals and festivals (up to 12; the highest called biram≈çr) one gains fame and status. As in the Veda, the former local artisan class was excluded from public religious functions. There is a special role for prepubescent boys, who are treated with special awe, combining pre-sexual behaviour and the purity of the high mountains, where they tend goats for the summer month. Purity is very much stressed and centered around altars, goat stables, the space between the hearth and the back wall of houses and in festival periods; the higher up in the valley, the more pure the location. By contrast, women (especially during menstruation and giving birth), as well as death and decomposition and the outside (Muslim) world are impure, and, just as in the Veda and Avesta, many cleansing ceremonies are required if impurity occurs. Crows represent the ancestors, and are frequently fed with the left hand (also at tombs), just as in the Veda. The dead are buried above ground in ornamented wooden coffins. Wooden effigies are erected at the graves of wealthy or honoured people. Music Kalasha traditional music mainly consists of flute-like instruments (usually high in pitch), singing, poetry, clapping and the rhythmic playing of drums, which include the: * w√£c ‚Äì A small hourglass-shaped drum; this is made from 'chizhin' (pine wood), 'kuherik' (pine nut wood), or 'az'a'i' (apricot (tree) wood). It is played with a larger drum called a 'd√£u' for the Kalasha dances. * d√£u ‚Äì A large drum; this is played with a smaller drum called a 'w√£c' for the Kalasha dances, the smaller drum giving a lighter counterpart to the larger one. Location, climate and geography Located in Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan the Kalash people live in three isolated mountain valleys: Bumburet (Kalash: '), Rumbur ('), and Birir ('). These valleys open towards the Kunar River, some 20 km south (downstream) of Chitral, Birir Valley The Bumburet and Rumbur valleys join at (1,640 m), joining the Kunar at the village of Ayrun (, 1,400 m) and they each rise to passes connecting to Afghanistan's Nuristan Province at about 4,500 m. The Birir Valley opens towards the Kunar at the village of Gabhirat (, 1,360 m). A pass connects the Birir and Bumburet valleys at about 3,000 m. The Kalash villages in all three valleys are located at a height of approximately 1,900 to 2,200 m. The region is extremely fertile, covering the mountainside in rich oak forests and allowing for intensive agriculture, despite the fact that most of the work is done not by machinery, but by hand. The powerful and dangerous rivers that flow through the valleys have been harnessed to power grinding mills and to water the farm fields through the use of ingenious irrigation channels. Wheat, maize, grapes (generally used for wine), apples, apricots and walnuts are among the many foodstuffs grown in the area, along with surplus fodder used for feeding the livestock. The climate is typical of high elevation regions without large bodies of water to regulate the temperature. The summers are mild and agreeable with average maximum temperatures between . Winters, on the other hand, can be very cold, with average minimum temperatures between . The average yearly precipitation is . Genetic origins Rosenberg et al. (2006) ran simulations dividing autosomal gene frequencies in selected populations into a given number of clusters. For 7 or more clusters, a cluster (yellow) appears which is nearly unique to the Kalash. Smaller amounts of Kalash gene frequencies join clusters associated with Europe and Middle East (blue) and with South Asia (red). Genetic analysis of Y-chromosome DNA (Y-DNA) by Firasat et al. (2007) on Kalash individuals found high and diverse frequencies of these Y-DNA Haplogroups: L3a (22.7%), H1* (20.5%), R1a (18.2%), G (18.2%), J2 (9.1%), R* (6.8%), R1* (2.3%), and L* (2.3%). Genetic analysis of Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by Quintana-Murci et al. (2004) stated that \\"the western Eurasian presence in the Kalash population reaches a frequency of 100%\\" with the most prevalent mtDNA Haplogroups being U4 (34%), R0 (23%), U2e (16%), and J2 (9%). The study asserted that no East or South Asian lineages were detected and that the Kalash population is composed of western Eurasian lineages (as the associated lineages are rare or absent in the surrounding populations). The authors concluded that a western Eurasian origin for the Kalash is likely, in view of their maternal lineages. A study of ASPM gene variants by Mekel-Bobrov et al. (2005) found that the Kalash people of Pakistan have among the highest rate of the newly evolved ASPM Haplogroup D, at 60% occurrence of the approximately 6,000-year-old allele. The Kalash also have been shown to exhibit the exceedingly rare 19 allele value at autosomal marker D9S1120 at a frequency higher than the majority of other world populations which do have it. A study by Rosenberg et al. (2006) employing genetic testing among the Kalash population concluded that they are a distinct (and perhaps aboriginal) population with only minor contributions from outside peoples. In one cluster analysis with (K = 7), the Kalash formed one cluster, the others being Africans, Europeans, Middle Easterners, South Asians, East Asians, Melanesians, and Native Americans. A study by Li et al. (2008) with geneticists using more than 650,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) samples from the Human Genome Diversity Panel, found deep rooted lineages that could be distinguished in the Kalash. The results showed them clustered within the Central/South Asian populations at (K = 7). The study also showed the Kalash to be a separated group, having no membership within European populations. Lazaridis et al. (2016) further notes that the demographic impact of steppe related populations on South Asia was substantial. According to the results, the Mala, a south Indian Dalit population with minimal Ancestral North Indian (ANI) along the 'Indian Cline' have nevertheless ~ 18 % steppe- related ancestry, showing the strong influence of ANI ancestry in all populations of India. The Kalash of Pakistan are inferred to have ~ 50 % steppe-related ancestry, with the rest being of Iranian Neolithic, Onge and Han.. According to Narasimhan et al. (2019), the Kalash were found to possess the highest ANI ancestry among the population samples analysed in the study. =European descent hypothesis= Some of the Kalash people claim to be descendants of Alexander the Great's soldiers.Michael Wood, In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great: A Journey from Greece to Asia, p. 8, University of California Press, on Internet Archive A study by Qasim Ayub, Massimo Mezzavilla, and Chris Tyler-Smith (2015) found no evidence of their claimed descent from soldiers of Alexander. The study, however, found that they shared a significant portion of genetic drift with MA-1, a 24,000-year-old Paleolithic Siberian hunter-gatherer fossil and the Yamnaya culture. The researchers thus believe they may be an ancient north-drifted Eurasian stock from which some of the modern European and Middle Eastern population also descends. Their mitochondrial lineages are predominantly from western Eurasia. Due to their uniqueness, the researchers believed that they were the earliest group to separate from the ancestral stock of the modern population of the Indian subcontinent estimated around 11,800 years ago. The estimates by Qamar et al. of 20%‚Äì40% Greek admixture in the Kalash has been dismissed by Toomas Kivisild et al. (2003) stating that \\"some admixture models and programs that exist are not always adequate and realistic estimators of gene flow between populations ... this is particularly the case when markers are used that do not have enough restrictive power to determine the source populations ... or when there are more than two parental populations. In that case, a simplistic model using two parental populations would show a bias towards overestimating admixture\\". The study came to the conclusion that the Kalash population estimate by Qamar et al. \\"is unrealistic and is likely also driven by the low marker resolution that pooled southern and western Asian-specific Y-chromosome Haplogroup H together with European-specific Haplogroup I, into an uninformative polyphyletic cluster 2\\". Discover magazine genetics blogger Razib Khan has repeatedly cited information indicating that the Kalash are part of the South Asian genetic continuum with no Macedonian ethnic admixture albeit shifted towards the Iranian people. A study by Firasat et al. (2006) concluded that the Kalash lack typical Greek Haplogroups such as Haplogroup 21 (E-M35). Economy Historically a goat herding and subsistence farming people, the Kalasha are moving towards a cash-based economy whereas previously wealth was measured in livestock and crops. Tourism now makes up a large portion of the economic activities of the Kalash. To cater to these new visitors, small stores and guest houses have been erected, providing new luxury for visitors of the valleys. People attempting to enter the valleys have to pay a toll to the Pakistani government, which is used to preserve and care for the Kalash people and their culture. After building the first jeepable road in the Kalasha valleys in the mid-1970s the people are engaged in other professions like tourism and also joining services like military, police and border force, etc.Muhammad Kashif Ali, Cultural Transitions in Kalash Valley (1947‚Äì2006). (M.Phil Thesis, University of the Punjab, Lahore., 2010) History and social status The Kalash are considered to be an indigenous people of Asia, with their ancestors migrating to Afghanistan from a distant place in South Asia which the Kalash call \\"Tsiyam\\" in their folk songs and epics. This site is said to be near Jalalabad and Lughman according to Morgenstierne. Per their traditions, the V√§i are refugees who fled from Kama to Waigal after the attack of the Ghazanavids. Per the traditions of the Gaw√¢r, the V√§i took the land from them and they migrated to the Kunar Valley. According to Strand, the Askun-speaking Kalash probably later migrated from Nakara in Laghman to lower Waigal. The ƒåima-ni≈°ei people took over their current settlements from the indigenous people. The people V√¢nt are refugees who fled from Tregam due to invasions. According to Kalsha traditions, some of the V√§i who ritually hunted a golden bird every year at a place presently called R√¢mr√¢m in Kunar, settled there after failing to find their quarry and became the speakers of the Gawar-Bati language. Shah Nadir Rais formed the Rais Dynasty of Chitral. The Rais carried out an invasion of Southern Chitral which was back then under Kalasha rule. Kalasha traditions record severe persecution and massacres at the hands of Rais. They were forced to flee the Chitral valley and those that remained while still practising their faith had to pay tribute in kind or with Corv√©e labour. The term \\"Kalasha\\" was used to denote all the \\"Kafir\\" people in general; however, the Kalasha of Chitral weren't considered to be \\"true Kafirs\\" by the Kati people who were interviewed about the term in 1835. The Kalash were ruled by the Mehtar of Chitral from the 18th century onward. They have enjoyed a cordial relationship with the major ethnic group of Chitral, the Kho who are Sunni and Ismaili Muslims. The multi-ethnic and multi-religious State of Chitral ensured that the Kalash were able to live in peace and harmony and practice their culture and religion. The Kalasha were protected by the Chitralis from Afghan Raids, who also generally did not allow Missionaries in Kalash. They allowed for the Kalasha to look after their matters themselves. The Nuristani, their neighbours in the region of former Kafiristan west of the border, were converted, on pain of death, to Islam by Amir Abdur-Rahman of Afghanistan in the 1890s and their land was renamed.Nuristan on Encyclopaedia Iranica.William Dalrymple, Dancing in the hills: a journey to meet Pakistan‚Äôs Kalash people (Financial Times, 21 March 2018). Prior to that event, the people of Kafiristan had paid tribute to the Mehtar of Chitral and accepted his suzerainty. This came to an end with the Durand Agreement when Kafiristan fell under the Afghan sphere of Influence. Prior to the 1940s the Kalash had five valleys, the current three as well as Jinjeret kuh and Urtsun to the south. The last Kalash person in Jinjeret kuh was Mukadar, who passing away in the early 1940s found himself with no one to perform the old rites. The people of Birir valley just north of Jinjeret came to the rescue with a moving funeral procession that is still remembered fondly by the valleys now converted Kalash, firing guns and beating drums as they made their way up the valley to celebrate his passing according to the old custom.Augusto Cacopardo and Alberto ((the other Kalasha - a survey of Kalashamun speaking people in southern Chitral )) - part 3 Jinjeret Kuh and the problem of Kalasha origins - East and west vol 42 no 2/4 December 1992 pp 333 - 375 The Kalash of Urtsun valley had a culture with a large Kam influence from the Bashgul Valley. It was known for its shrines to Waren and Imro‚Äîthe Urtsun version of Dezau‚Äîwhich were visited and photographed by Georg Morgenstierne in 1929 and were built in the Bashgul Valley style unlike those of other Kalash valleys . The last Shaman - was one Azermalik who had been the Dehar when George Scott Robertson visited in the 1890s. His daughter Mranzi who was still alive into the 1980s was the last Urtsun valley Kalash practising the old religion. She had married into the Birir Valley Kalash and left the valley in the late 1930s when the valley had converted to Islam. Unlike the Kalash of the other valleys the women of Urtsun did not wear the Kup'as headress but had their own P'acek - headress worn at casual times and the famous horned headress of the Bashgul valley which was worn at times of ritual and dance.Augusto Cacopardo (( the other Kalasha a survey of Kalashamun speaking people of southern Chitral )) part 2 the Kalasha of Urtsun - East and west vol 41 no 1/4 December 1991 pp 331 - 350 Other theories considered about their origin is that they are descendants of foreign peoples, the Gandhari people and the old Indian population of Eastern Afghanistan. George Scott Robertson put forth the view that the dominant Kafir races like the Wai were refugees who fled to the region from invading fanatical Muslims. The Kafirs are historically recorded for the first time in 1339. Being a very small minority in a Muslim region, the Kalash have increasingly been targeted by some proselytising Muslims. Some Muslims have encouraged the Kalash people to read the Koran so that they would convert to Islam.Reuters: \\"Conversions to Islam threaten Pakistan‚Äôs \\"Macedonian\\" tribe\\" 20 October 2011The Guardian: \\"Taliban threat closes in on isolated Kalash tribe\\" 17 October 2011 The challenges of modernity and the role of outsiders and NGOs in changing the environment of the Kalash valleys have also been mentioned as real threats for the Kalash. During the 1970s, local Muslims and militants tormented the Kalash because of the difference in religion and multiple Taliban attacks on the tribe lead to the death of many, their numbers shrank to just two thousand.Manzar, A. Taliban in Pakistan: A Chronicle of Resurgence (Terrorism, Hot Spots and Conflict-Related Issues). (2009). Nova Science Publishers. However, protection from the government led to a decrease in violence by locals, a decrease in Taliban attacks, and a great reduction in the child mortality rate. The last two decades saw a rise in numbers. In recent times the Kalash and Ismailis have been threatened with death by the Taliban, the threats caused outrage and horrified citizens throughout Pakistan and the Pakistani military responded by fortifying the security around Kalash villages, the Supreme Court also took judicial intervention to protect the Kalash under both the ethnic minorities clause of the constitution and Pakistan's Sharia law penal code which declares it illegal for Muslims to criticise and attack other religions on grounds of personal belief. The Supreme Court termed the Taliban's threats against Islamic teachings. Imran Khan condemned the forced conversions threat as un-Islamic. In 2017, Wazir Zada became the first Kalasha man to win a seat in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Provicional assembly. He became the member of the Provincial Assembly (PA) on a minority reserved seat. In November 2019, the Kalash people were visited by HRH the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, as part of their Pakistan tour and they saw a traditional dance performance there. Appearances in popular culture *The Kalash people's reputed connection to Alexander the Great is the basis of the famous Rudyard Kipling story \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\"; however, it takes place among the Kalasha of Nuristan, then known as Kafiristan, in nearby Afghanistan. The story was made into the film The Man Who Would Be King in 1975, starring Sean Connery and Michael Caine. *The Kalash are briefly visited in the first episode of the 2004 BBC television series Himalaya with Michael Palin. The program featured some cultural background and current customs, highlighting the claim to be descendants of Alexander the Great as well as some of the stunning scenery of the Kalash homeland.

Unlike the Nazis' antisemitic film Jud S√º√ü (1940), the British film was intended to be sympathetic to Jews, and is generally considered to be a faithful adaptation of Feuchtwanger's novel. It was hoped the historical analogy, condemning antisemitism in 1730, would be a successful means of evading the ban by the British censors on political topics in films. The later film with the same title, produced in Nazi Germany, is considered by some to be an antisemitic response to Mendes' philo-semitic film.

V. Ramasamy (17 September 1879 ‚Äì 24 December 1973) was a Dravidian social reformer and politician from India, who founded the Self-Respect Movement and Dravidar Kazhagam.Thakurta, Paranjoy Guha and Shankar Raghuraman (2004) A Time of Coalitions: Divided We Stand, Sage Publications. New Delhi, p. 230. Periyar placed great importance on the Tamil language for its benefit and upliftment to the Tamil people and advocated for its preservation. In the wake of the imposition of Hindi throughout the Indian sub-continent and in Tamil Nadu, Periyar stated that \\"the love of one's tongue is the foremost of all loves that are required of the people born in our land. He said that has no love for his tongue has no love for his land. A nation functions on the basis for the love of one's language. So it is my prayer that Tamils love for their tongue should grow. I affirm again and again that love of the mother-tongue is a must for those born in Tamil Nadu. The Bengalis love Bengali. The Maharashtrians love for the Marathi language. The Andhras love the Telugu language. But the Tamils have no love for the Tamil-tongue. The Tamils will never progress unless they bestow love on their mother-tongue. If I love Tamil, it is not merely because it is the mother-tongue or the language of the Tamil Nadu State. Nor am I attached to Tamil by reason of its uniqueness or its antiquity. If I love Tamil, it is because I am aware of the advantages I expect through it and the measure of loss that will occur by the absence of it\\". Critique of Tamil the language Periyar raised praises and criticisms of Tamil and other Dravidian languages by stating \\"as I am aware of the disadvantages of another language being imposed on our country, I am intolerant of it and oppose it, I do not resist it merely because it is new or it belongs to another land. It is my opinion that the Tamil language is capable of contributing to the progress and freedom of the people in all fields, and will be conductive to a life of dignity and reason. However, people may ask whether all such resources are available in Tamil. Even if all these qualities are not found, I am aware that Tamil has arts, customs, traditions, and an appropriate vocabulary, which can contribute to a greater advancement than most other languages in India. Therefore, other languages that are likely to cause disadvantage to Tamil is unwelcome\\".Veeramani, Collected Works of Periyar, pp. 550-552. Periyar claimed that Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada came from the same tongue, or same mother language of Old Tamil. He explained that the Tamil language is called by four different names since it is spoken in four different Dravidian states, and thus she has four different names. With relation to writing, Periyar stated that using the Tamil script about the arts which are useful to the people in their life and which foster knowledge, talent and courage, and propagating them among the masses, thereby will enlighten the people. Further, he explained that it will enrich the language, and thus it can be regarded as a zeal for Tamil. Periyar believed that Tamil language will make the Dravidian people unite under the banner of Tamil culture, and that it will make the Kannadigas, Andhras and the Malayalees be vigilant. With regards to a Dravidian alliance under a common umbrella language, Periyar stated that \\"a time will come for unity. This will go on till there is an end to the North Indian domination. We shall reclaim an independent sovereign state for us\\".Veeramani, [January 1981](2005) Collected Works of Periyar E.V.R., Third Edition, Chennai. The Vengayam Self-Respect Propaganda Institution, p. 503. Periyar was also known to have issued controversial remarks on Tamil language and Tamil people from time to time. On one occasion, he referred to Tamil people as \\"barbarians\\" and Tamil language as the \\"language of barbarians\\". However, Anita Diehl explains that Periyar made these remarks on Tamil because it had no respective feminine verbal forms. Tamil alphabet reform Periyar's ideas on Tamil alphabet reforms and his reasons were for the following such as the vowel '‡Æà' (i), having a cursive and looped representation of the short form, '‡Æá' (I). In stone inscriptions of 400 or 500 years ago, many Tamil letters are found in other shapes. As a matter of necessity and advantage to cope with the printing technology, Periyar thought that it was sensible to change a few letters, reduce the number of letters, and alter a few signs. He further explained that the older and the more divine a language and its letters were said to be, they need reform. Because of changes brought about by means of modern transport and international contact, and happenings that have attracted words and products from many countries, foreign words and their pronunciations have been assimilated into Tamil quite easily. Just as a few compound characters have separate signs to indicate their length as in ' ‡Æï‡Ææ ', ' ‡Æï‡Øá ' (kA:, kE:), Periyar argued why should not other compound characters like ' ‡Æï‡Æø ', ' ‡Æï‡ØÄ ', '‡Æï‡ØÅ ', ' ‡Æï‡ØÇ ' (kI, ki:,kU, ku:) (indicated integrally as of now), also have separate signs. Further, changing the shape of letters, creating new symbols and adding new letters and similarly, dropping those that are redundant, were quite essential according to Periyar. Thus, the glory and excellence of a language and its script depend on how easily they can be understood or learned and on nothing else\\".Diehl, E.V. Ramasamy Vengayam-Periyar, p. 61.

Gordon Liddy, convicted as part of the Watergate scandal, an act that was described as being \\"in the interest of equity and fairness\\". He also lobbied on behalf of naming a greater proportion of minorities to positions as judges and in the executive branch. Lipshutz drafted a revised policy regarding affirmative action that was ultimately accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States in its decision in the case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke regarding a race-based admission policy at the UC Davis School of Medicine that the plaintiff claimed cost him a spot at the school in which the court ruled that racial quotas were unacceptable, but that affirmative action was allowed. =Key role= During the negotiations between Egyptian Anwar El Sadat and of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at Camp David, Lipshutz provided input from leaders of major Jewish organizations regarding the peace process.

Historical background Joseph S√º√ü Oppenheimer was an 18th-century Court Jew in the employ of Duke Karl Alexander of W√ºrttemberg in Stuttgart. In the course of his work for the duke, Oppenheimer made a number of powerful enemies, some of whom conspired to bring about his arrest and execution after Karl Alexander's death. The story of Joseph S√º√ü Oppenheimer had been the subject of a number of literary and dramatic treatments over the course of more than a century; the earliest of these having been Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. The most successful literary adaptation was the Feuchtwanger novel based on a play that he had written in 1916 but subsequently withdrew. The novel was translated into English by Willa and Edwin Muir. In the afterword to the novel, Feuchtwanger characterized Hauff's novella as 'na√Øvely anti-Semitic.' Feuchtwanger's themes For Feuchtwanger, S√º√ü was a forerunner that symbolized the evolution in European philosophy and cultural mentality, representing a shift towards Eastern philosophy, from Nietzsche to Buddha, from \\"the old to the new covenant.\\" Karl Leydecker writes: > For Feuchtwanger, Jud S√º√ü was primarily a novel of ideas, dealing with a > number of philosophical oppositions such as vita activa versus vita > contemplativa, outer versus inner life, appearance versus essence, power > versus wisdom, the pursuit of one's desires vs. the denial of desires, > Nietzsche vs. Buddha. Plot The novel tells the story of a Jewish businessman, Joseph S√º√ü Oppenheimer, who, because of his exceptional talent for finance and politics, becomes the top advisor for the Duke of W√ºrttemberg. Surrounded by jealous and hateful enemies, S√º√ü helps the Duke create a corrupt state that brings them immense wealth and power. In the meantime, S√º√ü discovers he is the illegitimate son of a respected nobleman, but decides to continue living as a Jew, as he is proud of having achieved such a position despite this. In the meantime, the Duke finds out about S√º√ü's hidden daughter and when trying to rape her accidentally kills her. S√º√ü is devastated. He plans and executes his revenge. After he encourages and then exposes the Duke's plan to overthrow the Parliament, thus infuriating the Duke to death, S√º√ü realizes nothing will bring back his daughter, and apathetically turns himself over. S√º√ü is accused of fraud, embezzlement, treason, lecherous relations with the court ladies and accepting bribes. He is found innocent, but under the pressure of the public he is finally sentenced to death by hanging. Despite it being his last chance for reprieve, he never reveals his noble origins nor converts to Christianity, and dies reciting the Shema Yisrael, the most important prayer in Judaism. Adaptations Ashley Dukes and Paul Kornfeld also wrote dramatic adaptations of the Feuchtwanger novel. Orson Welles made his stage debut (at the Gate Theatre, on October 13, 1931) in Dukes' adaptation, as Duke Karl Alexander of W√ºrttemberg. In 1934, Lothar Mendes directed a film adaptation of the novel. In Nazi Germany, Joseph Goebbels forced Veit Harlan to direct a virulently anti-Semitic film to counter the philo-semitism of Feuchtwanger's novel and Mendes' adaption of it. Harlan's film violated almost everything about the novel's characters and its sentiments. In the Harlan film, S√º√ü rapes a Gentile German girl and tortures her father and fianc√© before being put to death for his crimes. In Feuchtwanger's play and novel, Josef S√º√ü Oppenheimer emerges as a father and his fictional daughter Tamar (play)/Naemi (novel) provides both an ideal centre and turning point of the narrative. In Harlan's Nazi film, the central female figure Dorothea Sturm (played by Kristina S√∂derbaum) is, again, represented as ideal. However, her violation and subsequent suicide transform Josef S√º√ü Oppenheimer's execution (historically a miscarriage of justice) into a symbol of the judicial court's true righteousness that is hailed by the masses. Like a negative image, the film is a total inversion of Feuchtwanger's narrative as it mirrors the literary texts‚Äô central elements in reverse; Lion Feuchtwanger's depiction of Josef S√º√ü Oppenheimer's journey from a power- hungry financial and political genius to a more enlightened human being is turned into an anti-Semitic propaganda piece.

This map does not reflect actual de facto borders of Chile and Argentina. The Boundary Treaty of 1881 () between Argentina and Chile was signed on the 23 July 1881 in Buenos Aires by Bernardo de Irigoyen, on the part of Argentina, and Francisco de Borja Echeverr√≠a, on the part of Chile, with the aim of establishing a precise and exact borderline between the two countries based on the uti possidetis juris principle. Despite dividing largely unexplored lands, the treaty laid the groundwork for nearly all of Chile's and Argentina's current 5600 kmSee Libro de Defensa de Chile CONTINUIDAD: HISTORIA Y GEOGRAF√çA shared border. __TOC__ Background Argentina declared its independence in 1816 and Chile did the same in 1818. Once the Spaniards had been expelled, relations between the two nations soured primarily due to a border dispute: both claimed to have inherited overlapping parts of Patagonia. The Chilean constitution of 1833 established the Andes as its eastern boundary. That was challenged in 1853 by Miguel Luis Amunategui's book Titles of the Republic of Chile to Sovereignty and Dominion of the Extreme South of the American Continent in which he put forward that Chile had valid arguments to claim all of Patagonia. These claims traced Chilean claims back to the conquest of Chile in the 16th century by Pedro de Valdivia, arguing that Pedro de Valdivia obtained rights from the Spanish crown to establish a captaincy limited by the Strait of Magellan to the south. Pedro de Valdivia subsequently founded several cities through southern Chile with the goal of reaching the Strait of Magellan. However, the remoteness of the region and the Mapuche in the War of Arauco limited further expansion to the south. =Occupation of the Straits of Magellan= Fuerte Bulnes The Republic of Chile founded Fuerte Bulnes in 1843, and later moved that settlement to the site of Punta Arenas in 1847, giving a strong impulse to steam navigation through the Strait of Magellan and probably averted the occupation of the strategically crucial strait by the European powers or the United States. As stated in a book about the Strait of Magellan: :An 1837 French expedition of Dumont D'Urville surveyed navigational conditions in the Strait of Magellan and recommended that a French colony be established at the strait to support future traffic along the route.Michael Morris, The Strait of Magellan, Martinus Nijhoff Publisher, 1989, , pages 22 and ff. =Treaty of 1856= The 1855/1856 treaty's Article 40 established a 12 year sunset for its commerce and navigation articles. =Welsh settlement in Chubut= In 1865, Welsh immigrants began to settle around the lower part of Chubut Valley. That colonization, supported by Argentina, meant that Argentina got a new exclave in Patagonia apart from Viedma-Carmen de Patagones, which had been founded in 1779. While the economic and geopolitical impact of this settlement was less than that of Chile's Punta Arenas, it soon became a starting point for further colonization toward the Andes.  Interests of Chile, Argentina, and the great powers  = Chile = Chilean trade and culture were oriented towards Europe and therefore the complete control of the strait was a core Chilean interest.Michael Morris, The Strait of Magellan, Martinus Nijhoff Publisher, 1989, , pages 62 and 63 In contrast the rest of Patagonia was seen by influential Chilean politicians as a worthless desert.According to An√≠bal Pinto Garmendia, President of Chile at the time: :¬´ning√∫n hombre sensato de Chile pretend√≠a la Patagonia¬ª (Translation: \\"no reasonable Chilean man wanted Patagonia\\"), cited in Las negociaciones Barros Arana-Irigoyen retrieved 10.Mai.2009 This view was shared by Diego Barros Arana and was inspired by Charles Darwin's description of the area as a useless moorland. ::The possession of the Straits of Magellan in all its length is of such great importance for Chile, that in that possession she sees linked not only her progress and development, but also her very existence as an independent nation.Adolfo Ib√°√±ez = Argentina = Map of the advance of the Argentina frontier until the establishment of zanja de Alsina Mapuches and araucanized Indians had for a long time pillaged the Argentine southern frontier in search for cattle that were later taken to Chile through the Camino de los chilenos. The cattle were traded in Chile for weapons and alcoholic beverages. These tribes had strong connections with Chile and therefore gave Chile certain influence over the pampas. Argentine authorities feared an eventual war with Chile over the region where the natives would side the Chileans, and that the war would be therefore fought in the vicinities of Buenos Aires.. In the 1870s, Argentina built a more than 500-km long trench called Zanja de Alsina, which Argentina had undertaken during the Conquest of the Desert from 1876 to 1878 to defeat the araucanized Indians occupying northern Patagonia and which aspired to control the eastern third or, at a minimum, the eastern mouth of the strait.See Michael A. Morris, \\"The Strait of Magellan\\", Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, , page 63 = Great powers = The United Kingdom and the United States did not directly intervene in the distribution of land and maritime areas, but the U.S. ambassadors in Santiago de Chile and Buenos Aires, Thomas A. Osborn and Thomas O. Osborn, did serve as mediators. The concern of the great powers was free navigation through the strait. The U.S. administration declared immediately before the negotiations leading to the treaty: :The Government of the United States will not tolerate exclusive claims by any nation whatsoever to the Straits of Magellan, and will hold responsible any Government that undertakes, no matter on what pretext, to lay or impost or check on United States commerce through the Straits.Erik Br√ºel, International Straits, Vol. II, Sweet and Maxwell, Ltd., London, England, 1947, p225. Cited in Michael A. Morris, The Strait of Magellan, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, , page 65 Prior to the U.S. statement, in 1873, via a diplomatic letter to major shipping nations, Chile had already promised freedom of navigation through and neutralization in the strait.Michael A. Morris, The Strait of Magellan, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1988, , page 68 and 104 The colonial powers, United Kingdom and France, viewed Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego as Terra nullius. Jules Verne described in The Survivors of the \\"Jonathan\\" his view of Tierra del Fuego: : The separated geographic location had as consequence that this part of the new world had not been incorporated to any civilized state up to the year 1881 even not by its nearest neighbour Chile and the Republic of Argentina, which were still disputing the pampas of Patagonia. The Magalh√£es archipelago belonged to nobody ...Jules Verne, \\"Die Schiffbr√ºchigen der Jonathan\\", page 17, Edition 1984, Pawlak Taschenbuch Verlag, Berlin, Regarding the position of the USA towards the region, on 28 December 1831, the US Navy Captain Silas Duncan with the USS Lexington destroyed the Port Louis, Falkland Islands settlement in response to Argentine activities. The captain declared the islands to be free of government.Report by Silas Duncan, Commander U.S.S. Lexington, sent to Navy Secretary Levi Woodbury, on 4 April 1832Commander Silas Duncan and the Falkland Island Affair, Accessed 2007-10-02 In addition, the United Kingdom did not trust the Argentine rights to the region and reoccupied the Falklands in 1833. Negotiation and agreement In 1874 Chilean minister Guillermo Blest Gana and the Argentine Minister of Foreign Relations Carlos Tejedor agreed to put the question to arbitration. However, the new Argentine president Nicol√°s Avellaneda, boosted by internal popularity, cancelled the agreement in 1875. Attempts to clear up the dispute about Patagonia were unsuccessful until 1881, when Chile was fighting the War of the Pacific against both Bolivia and Peru. Chile had already defeated Bolivia's and Peru's regular armies and had large contingents in occupying Peru and fighting Andr√©s Avelino C√°ceres' guerrillas. To avoid fighting Argentina as well, Chilean President An√≠bal Pinto authorized his envoy, Diego Barros Arana, to hand over as much territory as was needed to avoid Argentina siding with Bolivia and Peru.See Michael A. Morris, \\"The Strait of Magellan\\", Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, , page 62: : \\"From a Chilean perspective, possible Argentine entry into the War of the Pacific as a belligerent or even as an unfriendly power was a real threat so that Chile was concerned about assuring the neutrality of Argentina and other South American States.\\" Yet Chilean situation was not all that fragile. While Argentina had taken advantage of Chile's conflict to push for a favorable boundary in Patagonia, Chilean diplomacy only agreed to sign the treaty after the triumph at Lima showed Chile to be in a position of power. Thus, the Argentine plans to negotiate with a weakened and troubled Chile were partly forgone with Chile's display of military prowess in Peru.  Treaty  The treaty defined the border in three articles. It defined the border down to latitude 52¬∞S as the line marked by the continental divide and the highest mountains of the Andes. :Article 1: :The boundary between Chile and the Argentine Republic is from north to south, as far as the 52nd parallel of latitude, the Cordillera de los Andes. The boundary-line shall run in that extent over the highest summits of the said Cordilleras which divide the waters, and shall pass between the sources (of streams) flowing down to either side. Articles 2 and 3 recognise the area around the Strait of Magellan (South of the 52¬∞S) as Chilean as well as the islands south of Beagle Channel. Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego was divided in two parts. :Article 2: In the area of the Strait of Magellan, south of the parallel 52¬∞S, the limit would go from Punta D√∫ngenes westward by the chain of hills to Monte Aymond from where a straight line is drawn to the intersection of parallel 52¬∞S and meridian 70¬∞W, and from there west along the 52¬∞ parallel until the last watershed divide point defined by article 1. :Article 3: :In Tierra del Fuego a line shall be drawn, which starting from the point called Cape Esp√≠ritu Santo, in parallel 52¬∞40', shall be prolonged to the south along the meridian 68¬∞34' west of Greenwich until it touches Beagle Channel. Tierra del Fuego, divided in this manner, shall be Chilean on the western side and Argentine on the eastern. As for the islands, to the Argentine Republic shall belong Staten Island, the small islands next to it, and the other islands there may be on the Atlantic to the east of Tierra del Fuego and of the eastern coast of Patagonia; and to Chile shall belong all the islands to the south of Beagle Channel up to Cape Horn, and those there may be to the west of Tierra del Fuego. Furthermore, the treaty defines the status of the Strait of Magellan: :Article 5 :The Straits of Magellan shall be neutralized for ever, and free navigation assured to the flags of all nations. In order to assure this freedom and neutrality, no fortifications or military defences shall be constructed on the coasts that might be contrary to this purpose. Article 6 states that older boundary treaties became obsolete and both countries agreed to submit any future disputes to the decision of a friendly third country. =Maritime border = The law of the sea at the time of the 1881 treaty was different from the articles of the 1982 Law of the Sea, which meant that Chile and Argentina adhered to the accepted practice of a territorial sea. Therefore, the treaty emphasized the delineation of land boundaries including islands but did not stipulate the offshore limits, which have since been expanded to .  Further disputes  A map from 1884. According to the Argentine view of the treaty, called the Magellan/Atlantic transfer, the general agreement was that Argentina was an Atlantic country, and Chile was a Pacific one. Chile has never accepted that and the Chilean view was confirmed by the Court of Arbitration in the Beagle dispute (¬ß31 ): :It is on this basis, as well as on the actual attribution of Patagonian territory to Argentina effected by Article II of the Treaty, that the Court reaches the conclusion that it was the antithesis Patagonia/Magellan, rather than Magellan/Atlantic, which constituted the fundamental element of the Treaty settlement. Some errors that would allow a Pacific coast for Argentina in √öltima Esperanza Sound and an Atlantic coast to Chile in San Sebasti√°n Bay were later corrected, the border in Tierra del Fuego was moved from 68¬∞34'00\\"W (as FitzRoy erroneously marked the \\"Cabo del Espiritu Santo) to 68¬∞34'40\\"W (true longitude of the Cabo) giving 626 km2 to Argentina.Juan Agustin Rodriguez S., Chile en el Canal Beagle y Mares Australe, Grafica Progresion, 1985 Different interpretations of the borderline north of latitude 52¬∞S led to the Arbitration of the British King Edward VII in 1902 (See The Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case). Border disputes continued as Patagonia was still an unexplored area. The concept of the continental divide was easy to apply in northern regions, but in Patagonia, drainage basins crossed the Andes, which led to disputes over whether the highest peaks would be the frontier, favoring Argentina, or the drainage basins, favoring Chile. Argentina argued that previous documents referring to the boundary always mentioned the Snowy Cordillera as the frontier and not the continental divide. Argentine explorer Francisco Perito Moreno suggested that many Patagonian lakes draining to the Pacific were part of the Atlantic basin but had been moraine-dammed during the quaternary glaciations, changing their outlets to the west. In 1902, war was again avoided when King Edward VII of Britain agreed to mediate between the two nations. He established the current border in the Patagonia region in part by dividing many disputed lakes into two equal parts; most of these lakes still have one name on each side of the frontier. The dispute that arose in the northern Puna de Atacama was resolved with the Puna de Atacama Lawsuit of 1899, though its real cause was out of the scope of the 1881 boundary treaty and originated from transfers between Bolivia and Argentina of land occupied by Chile during the Pacific war.

In French, Magellania, En Magellanie, or Les Naufrag√©s du \\"Jonathan\\". is a novel written by Jules Verne in 1897 and published posthumously in 1909, after it had been rewritten by Verne's son Michel under the title Les naufrag√©s du \\"Jonathan\\". The novel tells the story of a mysterious man named Kaw-djer who lives on Nueva island, whose motto is \\"Neither God nor master\\". He refused any contact with western civilization, relying on himself in order to survive and also provides assistance to the indigenous peoples of Magellania. However, the 1881 Boundary Treaty will destroy his paradise of individualist anarchism because it will end the state of terra nullius in the region.  Analysis  Partial reproduction of the first Argentine map showing the boundaries laid down in the Boundary Treaty of 23 July 1881. Because each side was convinced of the legitimacy of its own claim, the pretensions of the other party were considered usurpatory, an ill- omened beginning that burdened the relations of both countries.See Michael Morris, \\"The Strait of Magellan\\", Martinus Nijhoff Publisher, 1989, , page 59. The treaty did resolve an immediate concern of each side, but subsequently it became evident that in the far south, about 42¬∞S to 52¬∞S, Article 1 of the treaty posed problems of interpretation and application. Some Argentine political publicists argue that Articles 2 and 3 of the treaty were ambiguous,See El car√°cter ambiguo del texto del tratado de 1881 but they have to admit the truth that the later Argentine interpretations were refused by the international tribunal, that Argentine maps of the first decade also applied the Chilean interpretation and the two papal proposals as well as the treaty of 1984 maintained the Chilean interpretation of the treaty, at least in so far as the land border line. There could be other reasons for the Argentine difficulties over the interpretation. Michael Morris observes about the Argentine policy: : Rearguard Argentine efforts has been made to gain recognition for some kind of shared management regime for the Strait [of Magellan], in order to mitigate what was perceived as the striking diplomatic defeat for Argentina in the 1881 treaty granting Chile control over the strait.See \\"The Strait of Magellan\\", Michael Morris, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, , pages 120 and 121 The Southern Patagonian Ice Field is the last still pending issue to apply the 1881 Boundary Treaty.

The band was formed after the split from Bulimundo. They performed several songs of the funan√° genre. This style would be brought to an international level and made contracts with foreign labels. They have also been trying to make a new dance craze to rival soca and lambada, but have had little success outside of their native country. Three albums and three singles were recorded, including one single that was originally sang by Cod√© di Dona, a fellow Cape Verdean.  History  In early 1988, arrangements were made for the revival of the band. The drummer, Z√© Augusto, who was Maintenance Technician at Cape Verde National Radio at the time, contacted Palo, (who was Soundman at the same radio station) wondering if this was an opportunity for him to join the band. There were two: Bass player or guitarist. Palo took guitarist, and Augusto got the drummer position. Soon after, Angelo Barbosa joined the band, sharing the title of Keyboardist with Toni di Cando. After that, the band rehearsed for about a year, only playing one show on July 5 for the opening of National Youth Week. Unfortunately, because of health issues, Augusto (drums) was forced to temporarily leave the band for what ended up to be about three years. During this time, di Cando emigrated to the United States, bringing the band down to five members, excluding the Audio engineer, Vava di Santinha. Eventually in November 1989, the band traveled to Lisbon to record their third vinyl record under the name dotorado. Discography =Albums= *Rabecindadi (1987) (Lisbon) *Funan√° (1990) (ed.

The band's line-up has included MC and vocalist Maxim, dancer and vocalist Keith Flint (until his death in March 2019), dancer and live keyboardist Leeroy Thornhill (who left to pursue a solo career in 1999), and dancer and vocalist Sharky (1990‚Äì1991). Along with the Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim, The Prodigy are credited as pioneers of the breakbeat-influenced genre big beat, which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1990s. Howlett's rock-inspired drum rhythms infused with electronic rave music beats/breaks were combined with Maxim's omnipresent mystique, Thornhill's shuffle dancing style and Flint's modern punk appearance. The Prodigy first emerged in the underground rave scene in the early 1990s and achieved popularity and worldwide recognition with UK number one singles such as \\"Firestarter\\" and \\"Breathe\\", both singles coming from their UK and US chart topping album The Fat of the Land (1997). A third single from the album, ‚ÄúSmack My Bitch Up‚Äù, was also successful. They earned titles like \\"the premiere dance act for the alternative masses\\" and \\"the Godfathers of Rave\\", and remain one of the most successful electronic acts of all time. They have sold an estimated 25 million records worldwide, and won numerous music awards during their career, including two Brit Awards for Best British Dance Act, three MTV Video Music Awards, two Kerrang! Awards, five MTV Europe Music Awards, and received two Grammy Award nominations. The Brit Awards: Prodigy Brits.co.uk. Retrieved 12 February 2012 The Prodigy Rock on The Net. Retrieved 12 February 2012  History  = Formation and \\"Charly\\" (1990‚Äì1991) = The band was named after the Moog Prodigy synthesiser The Prodigy were founded in Braintree, Essex, in 1990 by keyboardist and songwriter Liam Howlett. He had taken piano lessons in his youth and gained the ability to play difficult passages in just a few run-throughs. After he decided to pursue a music career, Howlett met dancer and vocalist Keith Flint in mid-1989 at a rave at which Howlett was DJing. After Flint requested Howlett make a mix tape for him, Howlett obliged, returning a cassette several days later with a collection of his own songs on the other side. Howlett had scratched the word \\"Prodigy\\" onto the cassette, the same name as the Moog Prodigy analogue synthesiser, and Howlett's moniker. The tape was well- received by Flint and keyboardist Leeroy Thornhill who developed new dance sequences to the music and suggested to Howlett they begin a group together. They were soon joined by MC and vocalist Maxim, then known as Maxim Reality, and female dancer and vocalist Sharky, a friend of Flint's. Together they became the first line-up of the Prodigy. The group's first live gig occurred at Four Aces in Dalston, London.Emma Warren, \\"From the Dug Out and dreads to DMZ and dubstep: 10 classic club nights\\", The Guardian. Retrieved 20 April 2012. With a group secured, Howlett wrote, produced, and mixed a 10-track demo tape on a Roland W-30 sampling workstation keyboard, and approached Tam Tam Records with the hope of securing a record deal, but they declined. He then turned to XL Recordings, headed by Tim Palmer (Founder) and Nick Halkes (Head of A&R;) who agreed to a meeting and subsequently picked up the demo and signed the group on a 4 x Single contract. In February 1991, the band released the extended play What Evil Lurks on 12-inch vinyl, containing four songs that Howlett had produced on the demo. In August 1991, the Prodigy released their debut single \\"Charly\\", which samples dialogue from the Charley Says series of animated films produced by the Central Office of Information. It became a hit in the rave scene at the time, and reached number 3 on the UK Singles Chart, thus catapulting the band into the wider public attention. The success of \\"Charly\\" began a trend of mixing dance and \\"hardcore rave\\" tracks with cartoon samples, such as \\"A Trip to Trumpton\\" by Urban Hype and \\"Sesame's Treet\\" by Smart E's, which were a hit with clubbers, but not to reviewers and critics, who dismissed the music as \\"kiddie rave\\" or \\"toytown techno\\". = \\"Everybody in the Place\\" and Experience (1991‚Äì1993) = The band's second single, \\"Everybody in the Place (Fairground Edit)\\", was released in December 1991. It reached number 2 in the UK, beaten by a re-release of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" by Queen following the death of their singer Freddie Mercury. In September 1992, the band released their debut full-length album Experience, produced entirely by Howlett. The idea of making one originated from XL, and initially Howlett wanted to produce a \\"rave concept album\\" inspired by the progressive rock band Pink Floyd, but abandoned the idea due to the risk of limiting his musical ideas. It peaked at number 12 on the UK Albums Chart, and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for selling over 300,000 copies. Note: User must define search parameters as \\"Prodigy\\". Note: Reader must type \\"Prodigy\\" into the Search box and hit Go. The album contains many samples of songs from other artists, and closes with a live version of \\"Death of the Prodigy Dancers\\" featuring Maxim on vocals. As with \\"Charly\\", it became landmark release in the history of British rave music. Five singles spawned from the album: \\"Charly\\", \\"Everybody in the Place\\", \\"Fire/Jericho\\", \\"Out of Space\\", and \\"Wind It Up (Rewound)\\"; the latter a remix of \\"Wind It Up\\". After Experience and the run of singles that accompanied it, the Prodigy moved to distance themselves from the \\"kiddie rave\\" reputation that now dogged them. The rave scene was beginning to move on from its hardcore phase, with the Criminal Justice Act's \\"anti-rave\\" legislation on the horizon, calling rave music \\"repetitive beats\\". The Prodigy responded to the bill by writing \\"Their Law\\". = Music for the Jilted Generation (1993‚Äì1995) = In 1993, Howlett released an anonymous white label, bearing only the title \\"Earthbound I\\". Its hypnotic, hard-edged sound won wide underground approval. It was officially released as \\"One Love\\" later that year, and went on to chart at number 8 in the UK. The following year, the Prodigy's second album, Music for the Jilted Generation, debuted in the UK Albums Chart at number one, and received positive reactions from album critics. Adding elements of big beat and electro-industrial to the mix, the album expressed a wider spectrum of musical styles, with heavy breakbeat-based tracks complemented by the concept sequence The Narcotic Suite and a rock-oriented inclination, \\"Their Law\\", featuring Pop Will Eat Itself. The album was later described as a \\"complex, powerful record that propelled dance music into stadiums with rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll swagger\\". The album was nominated for a Mercury Music Prize, although Howlett had reaffirmed his dedication to making the Prodigy a 'hard dance band', commercially successful but without compromise. The band managed to continue to prevent over-exposure in the media by refusing to appear on Top of the Pops or other television shows in the UK. To date, their only studio appearance on British television came when they appeared on the BBC2 series Dance Energy in 1991, performing \\"Everybody in the Place\\". In the ensuing years, their videos received a strong level of support by MTV Europe, which boosted their popularity across the continent. Keith Flint himself hosted an episode of the MTV show 120 Minutes in 1995. Following the international success of Music for the Jilted Generation, the band augmented their line-up with guitarist Jim Davies (a live band member who later joined the group Pitchshifter) in 1995 for tracks such as \\"Their Law\\", \\"Break and Enter 95\\", and various live-only interludes and versions. He was soon to be replaced by Gizz Butt of the band Janus Stark, who remained with the band for the next three years. A number of the songs from the album were used in the film Hackers which starred Jonny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie. = The Fat of the Land (1996‚Äì2002) = The release of \\"Firestarter\\" in 1996, featuring vocals for the first time courtesy of a new- look Keith Flint, helped the band break into the United States and other overseas markets, and reached number one on the UK Singles Chart.Roberts, David (2006). British Hit Singles & Albums. London: Guinness World Records Limited. In this year the Prodigy also headlined the prestigious Lollapalooza festival. The long-awaited third Prodigy album, The Fat of the Land, was released in 1997, just as the band headlined the Glastonbury Festival on its opening night. Featuring simplified melodies, sparser sampling, less rave music influences, and punk-like vocals supplied by a shockingly madeover Flint, the album nevertheless retained the bone-jarring breaks and buzzsaw synths so idiomatic of the band. The album cemented the band's position as one of the most internationally successful acts in the dance genre, entering the UK and US charts at number one. The Prodigy were getting considerable airplay on rock stations with their controversial track \\"Smack My Bitch Up\\"‚Äîand also a negative backlash for the song. The National Organization for Women (NOW) criticized the song and its music video. The song's lyrics consist entirely of the repeated phrase \\"Change my pitch up, smack my bitch up\\", which NOW stated are a \\"dangerous and offensive message advocating violence against women\\". Howlett responded to the criticism by stating that the meaning of the song and its lyrics were being misinterpreted, and the phrase meant \\"doing anything intensely, like being on stage‚Äîgoing for extreme manic energy\\". The band did not actually write the lyric, but rather, sampled it from the hip hop Ultramagnetic MCs' track \\"Give the Drummer Some\\"The Fat of the Land liner notes. which also appears on the Dirtchamber Sessions; they had also sampled another Ultramagnetic MCs song \\"Critical Beatdown\\" on their earlier \\"Out of Space\\" single.Liner notes from \\"Out of Space\\" single and Experience album. The National Organization for Women also believed that the lyrics are in reference to administering heroin (smack) to another person. Several radio stations limited the song's airplay to nighttime hours. In September 1997, the Prodigy performed \\"Breathe\\" at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, and won the Viewer's Choice Award.1997 MTV Video Music Awards MTV.com. Retrieved 5 December 20111997 MTV VMAs Rock On The Net. Retrieved 5 December 2011 The music video for \\"Smack My Bitch Up\\", directed by Jonas √Ökerlund, featured a first-person point of view of someone going clubbing and indulging in large amounts of drugs and alcohol. Other content shown includes the protagonist getting into fist fights with men, abusing women, vomiting repeatedly, and picking up a lap dancer (played by British glamour model Teresa May) and having sex with her. Much of the aforementioned is depicted fairly explicitly. At the end of the video, the camera pans over to a mirror, revealing the subject to be a woman. MTV only aired the video between 1 and 5 a.m due to the controversial material. After one week, MTV removed the music video at NOW's request. The director got the inspiration for the contents of the video after a night of drinking and partying in Copenhagen. During a performance at the Reading Festival on 29 August 1998, the Prodigy and the Beastie Boys had an onstage disagreement over the track, with the Beastie Boys requesting the song should be pulled from their set as it could be considered offensive to those who had suffered domestic abuse. Choosing to ignore the Beastie Boys' plea, Maxim introduced \\"Smack My Bitch Up\\" with the declaration \\"They didn't want us to play this fucking tune. But the way things go, I do what the fuck I want\\". Wal-Mart and Kmart later announced they would pull The Fat of the Land off their shelves. Despite the fact that the LP had resided on their store shelves for over 20 weeks, and the fact that they had sold 150,000 copies of the album in total, the two stores found the marketing campaign for the new single release \\"offensive\\".

The original session came into being following a conversation between journalism and band biographer Martin James and Breezeblock presenter Mary Anne Hobbs. They are subsequently both thanked on the album sleeve notes. In June of the same year, when the band had arguably reached their commercial peak, they parted company with guitarist Gizz Butt. Following 1999, Thornhill departed from the group after splitting up with Sara Cox; the band's website was replaced with their logo and the words \\"We will be back...\\" set against a black background, which would remain until 2002. The band's website after Thornhill left in 2000. = Reunion (2002‚Äì2004) = In 2002, after a break from touring and recording, the single \\"Baby's Got a Temper\\" was released to critical disappointment. The original version of the song was written by Keith Flint's sideband, Flint and was called 'NNNN'. The Prodigy version was a total reworking of Flint's track with only a few of the lyrics and melody remaining from the original and produced by Howlett. The song also featured Jim Davies. Once again, the band courted controversy by including references to the so-called \\"date rape\\" drug Rohypnol in the song's lyrics. The song's music video was also controversial, which featured barely covered women milking cows in a suggestive fashion. The complete, unedited video was aired on MTV2 in 2002 as part of a special late-night countdown showing the most controversial videos ever to air on MTV. In the same year, however, Q magazine named the Prodigy one of the \\"50 Bands to See Before You Die\\". = Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned (2004‚Äì2008) = Liam Howlett live in August 2005. The Prodigy's fourth studio album, Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned, was released on 23 August 2004, and 14 September 2004 in the US. A precursory and experimental single, \\"Memphis Bells\\", was released in very limited numbers, followed by the traditional release of the single \\"Girls\\". The US version of the studio album contained a bonus track; a remix of \\"Girls\\", entitled \\"More Girls\\". The album, which topped the UK Albums Chart in its debut week, was promoted by a two-year-long tour. 5,000 digital copies of \\"Memphis Bells\\" were sold over the Internet. Each copy was a combination of customer-chosen instrumental, rhythmic, and melodic options, of which 39,600 choices were available. Five mixes were sold in three file formats, WAV, two audio mixes in MP3, and a 5.1 DTS surround sound mix, and all were free of digital rights management. In 2005, they released a compilation, Their Law: The Singles 1990‚Äì2005, which spawned a single containing new remixes of the songs \\"Out of Space\\" (\\"Audio Bullys Remix\\") and \\"Voodoo People\\" (the \\"Pendulum Remix\\"). The artwork represented drawn versions of the front covers of the \\"Out of Space\\" and \\"Voodoo People\\" single releases. The latter was also followed by a music video filmed in Romford Market, Essex, which featured on the DVD release of the compilation. Sharky, the group's only female member, is shown running and winning the race depicted in the video. Also in 2005, the song \\"You'll be Under my Wheels\\" from the Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned album was added to the soundtrack of Need for Speed: Most Wanted. The cover artwork included an extended essay by band biographer Martin James. Maxim performing at the 2006 Sziget Festival In 2006, the song \\"You'll be Under my Wheels\\" from the Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned album was added to the soundtrack of The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift. The Prodigy's first two albums, 1992's Experience and 1994's Music for the Jilted Generation, were re- released in expanded, deluxe editions on 4 August 2008. As well as being remastered, the new packages featured a bonus disc including mixes, rarities, and live tracks. The two albums also featured expanded artwork in addition to the new musical content. When asked about the idea, Howlett responded that they were getting ready to make a new album: > No, we're all done with that [those albums] now, all the old material. We > didn't actually want to do the Greatest Hits, we were ready to start our new > record‚Äîuntil the record company pointed out that it was in the contract.

To coincide with the release of the album, the band embarked on a nine-date UK arena tour, with support from Dizzee Rascal, Noisia, Herve, and DJ Kissy Sell Out. The tour included the first edition of the band's own annual dance gig, the Warriors Dance Festival. The single \\"Omen\\" debuted at number 1 on the Canadian Singles Chart the week of 25 February 2009 and won the Kerrang! Award for Best Single. Initial critical response to Invaders Must Die was somewhat mixed. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 60, based on 20 reviews. However, the album was well received by the fans, who welcomed it in a positive light compared to Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned. Two singles followed, \\"Warrior's Dance\\" and \\"Take Me to the Hospital\\", which were released on 11 May and 31 August 2009 respectively. The former song peaked at number 9 on the UK Singles Chart, while the latter included a VHS-filmed music video that premiered on VidZone. A fourth single, \\"Invaders Must Die (Liam H Reamped Version)\\", from the Special Edition of the album, was released. Howlett would later describe the album as \\"more of a celebration. We'd come back together and were like, 'Yeah! We're here, we're really buzzing!\\" In the same year, Howlett co-produced the song \\"Immunize\\" on Pendulum's third album, Immersion.Immersion liner notes. They also played Glastonbury in 2009. = The Day Is My Enemy (2010‚Äì2015) = In May 2011, the band released World's on Fire, their first live album and concert film documenting their 24 July 2010 show at the Milton Keynes Bowl as part of that year's Warriors Dance Festival. The film screened to select theatres across Europe for one night. On 16 November 2010, Howlett announced that after their American tour with Linkin Park, the Prodigy were to re-enter the studio to record new material. On 6 August 2011, the Prodigy headlined the Przystanek Woodstock in Poland, while at their two final shows of 2011 in Brazil, they premiered two new tracks: \\"A.W.O.L\\" and \\"Dogbite\\". They headlined the 2012 Download Festival on 8 June playing a regular setlist, with the addition of three new songs, \\"Jetfighter\\", \\"Dogbite\\" and \\"A.W.O.L\\", accompanied by on-stage imagery of jet aircraft. Howlett has confirmed this album will not be dubstep, but that it will feel \\"fresh\\" whilst darker. In April 2012, to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of The Fat of the Land, the album was re-released alongside a remix EP, The Added Fat EP, featuring remixes from multiple groups such as Major Lazer, Noisia, and Zeds Dead. On 3 May 2012, the Prodigy announced the working title of their new album How to Steal a Jetfighter. In December 2012, a new track titled \\"The Day\\" was debuted at Warrior's Brixton and in June 2013, a new track titled \\"Rockweiler\\" was debuted at Rock am Ring. The band headlined the Sonisphere Festival at Knebworth in 2014. On 2 July 2014, the band revealed their upcoming album would have a different name and a \\"violent sound\\". In August 2014, they signed to the Three Six Zero Group for the United States, returning to Warner Music for the first time since 2004. Maxim indicated in September 2014 that the new Prodigy album would be released in the first quarter of 2015. It was later announced on 6 January 2015 that the next Prodigy album would be releasing 30 March 2015 and that it had been given the title The Day Is My Enemy. On 12 January 2015, the Prodigy released \\"Nasty\\" as the lead single off their upcoming album along with the title track on 26 January 2015. Howlett found that \\"violent is the word that keeps on coming up\\" when describing the album. The entire recording process took almost six years taking in a number of studios and a few restarts to establish that \\"angry, energetic sound\\". Unlike previous efforts The Day Is My Enemy became a band- album where Flint and Maxim worked in tandem with Howlett. This created a degree of friction although Flint noted that \\"four years ago we sat down and talked about where the next album was gonna go, and we knew we had to bust out the most 'band' album we could create\\". The Prodigy at Festival Internacional de Benic√†ssim 2015 The band played at Future Music Festival Australia in February/March 2015 and toured Germany and France in April 2015 and the UK in May 2015. They also performed at the Rock Werchter, Rock am Ring/Rock im Park, Benic√†ssim and Isle of Wight festivals. On 23 February 2015, the Prodigy released \\"Wild Frontier\\" as the second single off their upcoming album The Day Is My Enemy after announcing it three days earlier. The Stop-motion animation was directed by the Dutch filmmaker Mascha Halberstad and animator Elmer Kaan. The Cover Art was designed by Austrian artist and designer Moritz Resl. In 2015, the Prodigy announced a winter 2015 UK and mainland Europe tour on 26 May, with Public Enemy as support. = No Tourists and death of Flint (2016‚Äìpresent) = The Prodigy's seventh studio album, No Tourists, was released on 2 November 2018 under a new recording deal with BMG Rights Management.Tim Ingham, \\"THE PRODIGY SIGN WORLDWIDE DEAL WITH BMG FOR NEW ALBUM IN 2018\\", Music Business Worldwide, 19 September 2017. The deal reunited the group with Howlett's song publishing, which BMG had acquired from EMI Music Publishing in 2012 as part of the Virgin Music catalogue.Scott Roxborough, \\"BMG Buys Virgin, Famous Music Catalog From Sony/ATV\\", The Hollywood Reporter, 21 December 2012. On 4 March 2019, Flint was found dead at his home in Essex, weeks after playing six live dates in Australia and New Zealand. The Prodigy's forthcoming concerts were cancelled. Following Flint's death, fans began using the Twitter hashtag \\"Firestarter4Number1\\" on various social media platforms to get \\"Firestarter\\" to top the British singles charts again. This was done out of respect for Keith Flint and to raise awareness of suicide among men. On 20 August 2019, Howlett announced his intent to continue releasing music under the Prodigy name.  Musical style and influences  Along with the Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim, the Prodigy have been credited as pioneers of the big beat genre, which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1990s. The Prodigy, however, is not considered entirely representative of the genre, as their production \\"often reflected the more intelligent edge of trip-hop, and rarely broke into the mindless arena of true big beat\\" according to AllMusic. The Prodigy are also considered alternative dance, techno, electronica, breakbeat hardcore, and rave. Liam Howlett cited early electro as a big influence, mentioning tunes like \\"Clear\\" by American music group Cybotron and \\"Al Naafiysh\\" by Hashim. Liam Howlett also cited The Bomb Squad, Public Enemy, and Rage Against the Machine as influences.

Life  Agnes of Austria, Queen of Hungary She was a daughter of Albert I of Germany and his wife Elisabeth of Tirol. She was Queen of Hungary by marriage. She was a member of the House of Habsburg. =Queen= On 13 February 1296 in Vienna, Agnes married Andrew III of Hungary.Austria, Medieval Lands Afterwards, with his father-in-law's support, Andrew managed to defeat the revolt of Mikl√≥s K≈ëszegi and M√°t√© Cs√°k III, and occupy the castles of K≈ëszeg and Pozsony. In 1298 Andrew supported with troops his father-in-law's revolt against King Adolf of Germany. Agnes disliked tournaments, but liked sermons. Since she was small of stature, she used to wear dresses her sisters no longer wanted, which gained her praise for modesty. The death of Andrew III on 14 January 1301, at Buda, ended the male line of the √Årp√°ds. Stephen √Åkos, one of his contemporaries called him \\"the last golden twig of the √Årp√°ds\\". =Later life= At that point, Agnes was a widow and she had no children to carry on the √Årp√°d dynasty. However she was only 19 so was still able to remarry and have children but she never did. Agnes became a patroness of K√∂nigsfelden Monastery in the County of Tyrol, which had been founded by her mother in memory of her late husband. Agnes took her stepdaughter Elizabeth with her and went to live there in a small house near the monastery. She was one of the final members of the Arpad family. Elizabeth was expected to marry Wenceslaus III of Bohemia, but the wedding never happened since Wenceslaus instead married Viola Elisabeth of Cieszyn. Left free, she became a Dominican nun at the nearby T√∂ss Monastery, where she gained a reputation for holiness. Agnes was depicted as pious. On the other hand, according to the 16th century Chronicon helveticum of Aegidius Tschudi, she avenged her father's murder by ordering the execution and expulsion of 1000 people (families and followers of his murderers), but it appears this report was to a large extent based on Swiss anti-Habsburg propaganda.Honemann, Volker 'A Medieval Queen and her Stepdaughter', p. 112. Because of her good reputation, she was asked several times to act as mediator. In 1333, she established a treaty between Austria and a number of Swiss towns and regions during the G√ºmmenenkrieg. In 1351, she solved a dispute between Basel and Bremen and did the same in the same year for Albert II, Duke of Austria and the Swiss Confederacy.Duggan, Anne (1997). p. 114. Her brothers often came to see her in K√∂nigsfelden to ask for advice. Agnes died on 10 June 1364 at K√∂nigsfelden, and was buried in the nuns' cemetery of K√∂nigsfelden Monastery.

In 1815 he was made a Spanish knight for his services in the Peninsular War and was awarded a pension of ¬£300 a year from the British government. He remained in service at the end of the Napoleonic Wars and in 1821 was made commodore on the West African station, on which he died in 1823. Life Robert Mends was born into a prominent Pembrokeshire family in the late 1760s, probably 1767. He joined the Royal Navy in 1779, serving on HMS Culloden under Captain George Balfour during the American War of Independence. Mends was almost instantly in action, Culloden fighting at the Battle of Cape St Vincent and at the Great Siege of Gibraltar in 1780. The following year, Mends joined the frigate HMS Guadeloupe and was in action at the Battle of Cape Henry in March 1781 before participating in the Siege of Yorktown. During the fighting, Guadeloupe was destroyed and Mends wounded in the right arm and left knee. Although his leg wound healed, Mends' arm had to be amputated. He was awarded a pension of ¬£7 a year to compensate for his lost limb.Mends, Sir Robert, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, (subscription required), Retrieved 25 January 2009 Recovering from his wounds, Mends joined HMS Conqueror and fought at the Battle of Dominica, where he was again seriously wounded after being struck in the head by a wooden splinter. Mends remained in service at the end of the war and joined HMS Grampus in 1786, under Commodore Edward Thompson off the African coast. In 1789 he was promoted to lieutenant and spent time on the brig HMS Childers in the English Channel. At the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793, Mends was serving on the ship of the line HMS Colossus in the Mediterranean and was present at the Siege of Toulon. In 1795, Colossus joined the Channel Fleet and fought at the Battle of Groix, at which Mends was caught in a large explosion that left him very badly burned. Recovering from his injuries, Mends was promoted commander and took charge of the 16-gun brig HMS Diligence in the West Indies. In May 1800 he was made a post captain and served in a number of ships, including HMS Abergavenny, HMS Thunderer, HMS Quebec and HMS Nereide, before the Peace of Amiens in 1802. After the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, Mends was made commander of the Dublin sea fencibles and in 1808 given command of the frigate HMS Arethusa in the Bay of Biscay. In Arethusa, Mends served on the blockade of the Northern Spanish ports during the Peninsular War and fought at the Action of 6 April 1809, in which Mends was wounded again. Between 1808 and 1811, Mends operated extensively against French held harbours and coastal shipping on the Northern Spanish coast. His operations were a serious nuisance to the French and he was consequently thanked by the Spanish Junta and made a nominal Spanish Major General. Between 1811 and 1814, Mends was recalled to Britain and served as superintendent of the prison hulks in Portsmouth harbour. In 1815, at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Mends was made a knight of the Spanish Order of Charles III, a title he was permitted to wear in British service, but which did not grant him the privileges of a British knight. The following year his pension was increased to ¬£300 a year. In 1821, Mends became commander in chief of the West African Station in the frigate HMS Iphigenia, later transferring to HMS Owen Glendower. Mends died in September 1823, succumbing to fever on Owen Glendower off the Gold Coast. Lieutenant Pringle Stokes took charge of the ship. Commander John Filmore arrived soon after, appointed himself to command the station and transferred to the frigate Owen Glendower. Mends' eldest son died three months later on the same commission at Sierra Leone. Mends had married in 1802 and had two other sons, Captain James Augustus Mends, who died in 1875 and Vice-Admiral George Clarke Mends who died in 1885. His younger brother, William Bowen Mends, also joined the Navy and died as a full admiral in 1864, while his nephew Admiral Sir William Robert Mends died in 1897.

Features a 1923 woodcut design by Eric Gill. The Order of Industrial Heroism was a private civil award given in the United Kingdom by the Daily Herald newspaper to honour examples of heroism carried out by ordinary workers. Many of the 440 awards were posthumous. Only two were made to a woman; six were awarded to large groups of miners, under the auspices of their trade union lodges. The medal of the Order was designed by sculptor Eric Gill and issued in bronze with a burgundy ribbon. The medal bears the image of Saint Christopher bearing the Christ Child. History Eric Gill's design as used on the 'Order Of Industrial Heroism' certificate, with red star, 1923 The Order was instituted in 1923TUC History Online by the Daily Herald specifically to recognise the deeds of valour of those who had saved their fellow workers from danger or death. It was popularly known as the \\"Workers' VC\\".Mines Rescue: Order of Industrial Heroism The institution of the medal was prompted by an incident in which four dockworkers helped control a major fire in the Liverpool docks, thereby saving the docks, shipping and a large part of the city, but were offered a reward of only ¬£17, provoking a public outrage.TUC Recipients were also given a monetary prize, and an Eric Gill designed certificate, depicting Saint Christopher, in front of a smoking chimney, carrying the Christ Child across water, towards a walled garden (\\"A Rose Plant in Jericho\\") with a red star overhead, Certificates for individual men were inscribed:See images Later certificates used a variation on Gill's design. The Daily Herald was the official organ of the Trade Union Congress and one of the world's best-selling newspapers at the time. The award was presented 440 times up to 1964, when the newspaper closed. Sometimes there were multiple awards relating to one event; six of the awards were to miners' union lodges, rather than individuals, where a large number of members had been involved in mine rescues. Only one of the solo awardees, Ruth Stanaway, was a woman; another, Sister Eileen M. S. Wiltshire, received one alongside three men. Eric Gill's original design for the 'Order Of Industrial Heroism' certificate, with dove, 1923 The Herald's records relating to the award, comprising nineteen boxes, are held in perpetuity in the Trades Union Congress Library Collections at London Metropolitan University. The Modern Records Centre at the University of Warwick holds correspondence about the possible continuation of the award, after 1964, in its TUC collection (Ref MSS.292B/790/2). Examples of the medal are in several museums, including the March & District Museum, Abertillery and District Museum, Dorman Museum, and the National Museum Wales; and one is in the House of Commons coins and medal collection; it was donated by Sir Arnold Wilson in 1938. The British Museum holds a specimen of the medal, with Gill's name inscribed on the rim. It also has Gill's 1923 proof copy of the woodcut artwork used on the award's certificates, which has \\"The Holy Ghost as a dove\\" in the place of the eventual red star. Other copies are in the Tate collection, the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, and the Hesburgh Library] at the University of Notre Dame.

Roman emperor Trajan probably created the southern Trajan's Wall, between the Prut and the Tyras area on the Black sea coast, in order to defend the \\"Scythia Minor\\" province against barbarian invasions.Map of the southern Trajan Wall, between Tyras and the Prut Tyras enjoyed great development during Roman times: there it is a series of its coins with heads of emperors from Domitian to Alexander Severus. But in the second half of the 4th century the area was continuously attacked by barbarians and the Roman legionaries left Tyras. Wallachian and Slavic settlement The land and settlements of the Bolokhoveni peoples. Transnistria was an early crossroads of people and cultures, including the South Slavs, who reached it in the 6th century. Some East Slavic tribes (Ulichs and Tivertsy) may have lived in it, but they were pushed further north by Turkic nomads such as Pechenegs and the Cumans.Robin Milner-Gulland, The Russians, Blackwell Publishing, p.44 In the 10th century, the \\"Volohove\\" (Vlachs, i.e. Romanians) are mentioned in the area in the Primary Chronicle. From Kievan Rus' to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Map of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania between 1386 and 1434 showing the Principality of Moldavia as a Polish fief. Transnistria was inhabited by the Cumans and wars against them may have brought the territory under the control of the Kievan Rus' at times around the 11th century.Charles King: \\"The Moldovans\\", Hoover Press, Studies of Nationalities series (Stanford University, 2000), page 179.John Haywood: Cassell Atlas of World HistoryPenguin Atlas of Russian History (Puffin, 1995)David Christian: A History of Russia, Mongolia and Central Asia, Vol. 1 (Blackwell, 1999) The East Slavic Hypatian Chronicle mentions the Bolohoveni, a Vlach population, in the 13th century. The chronicle records that this land bordered on the principalities of Halych, Volhynia and Kiev. Archaeological research has identified the location of 13th-century fortified settlements in this region. Alexandru V. Boldur identified Voscodavie, Voscodavti, Voloscovti, Volcovti, Volosovca and their other towns and villages between the middle course of the rivers Nistru/Dniester and Nipru/Dnieper.A.V. Boldur, Istoria Basarabiei, Editura V. Frunza, p 111-119 The Bolohoveni disappeared from chronicles after their defeat in 1257 by Daniel of Galicia's troops. In the early 13th century, the Brodniks, a possible Slavic-Vlach vassal state of Halych, were present, alongside the Vlachs, in much of the region's territory (towards 1216, the Brodniks are mentioned as in service of Suzdal). It became a formal part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 15th century. The Crimean Khanate conquered the southern part, which was included in 1504 in the region of Yedisan and was under the control of the Ottoman Empire. The northern part remained under the control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, as part of the historical region of Podolia. The border between the two states was set on a brook known in Moldavian chronicles as Iahurl√Æc (today Iagorl√Æc, in Transnistria).Sava, p.5 Moldavia started from its nucleus in Bukovina and soon reached Prut and by the end of the 14th century the Dnister, which was set as their easternmost border. While there were some Moldavian military incursions beyond the Dniester in the 15th century, the earliest written evidence of Moldavian settlement beyond the Dnister dates from the 16th century: a 1541 letter written by Suleiman the Magnificent to Polish Sigismund II Augustus says that some of his Moldavian subjects plundered Tighina and Akkerman and then retreated and settled in the Polish territory.Nistor, Vechimea..., p. 6-7 Modern era Map showing the presence of Vlachs/Romanians (in light blue) east of the Southern Bug river in the 19th century While the territory beyond the Dniester was never politically part of Moldavia, some areas of today's Transnistria were owned by Moldavian boyars, being given by the Moldavian rulers. The earliest surviving deeds referring to lands beyond the Dniester date from the 16th century.Sava, p.4-6 Moldavian chronicle Grigore Ureche mentions that in 1584, some Moldavian villages from beyond the Dniester in the Polish territory were attacked and plundered by Cossacks.Grigore Ureche Letopise≈£ul ≈£ƒÉr√¢i Moldovei, de c√¢nd s-au descƒÉlecat ≈£ara Many Moldovans were members of Cossacks units, two of them, Ioan PotcoavƒÉ and DƒÉnilƒÉ Apostol, were hetmans of Ukraine. Along with a nomadic Nogai Tatar population, the area was populated by Romanians, Poles, Jews, and Ukrainians. In 1927, Columbia University Professor Charles Upson Clark, wrote that the lower Dniester was \\"an almost purely Romanian stream\\" since 1792.Charles Upson Clark Later research states that the largest group living further east, between the Dniester and the Dnieper river (a much bigger territory than actual Transnistria), in the 18th century was made up of Slavs, primarily Ukrainian peasants along with some Poles, but there was a huge community of Vlachs in that region.Andrew Wilson: \\"The Ukrainians: Engaging the Eastern Diaspora\\" (Westview Press, 1998) Indeed, in the early 18th century, in a letter to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Stefan Batory, the Prince of Transylvania stated that \\"The lands between the Bug and Dniester are populated by a mix of races composed of Lithuanian Poles, Ukrainians, and Romanians\\". Under the Dimitrie Cantemir leadership a colonization of Romanians/Vlachs had started in 1712 even in the Don river, following the one done a century before in the Kiev area Map showing Romanian/Vlach colonists in Ukraine In 1775 Russia began attempting to lure Romanian settlers (mostly from Moldavia, but also from Transylvania, Bukovina and Muntenia) to settle in its territory, after it gained the largely uninhabited territory between the Dnieper and the Bug from the TurksNistor, Vechimea..., p. 14 But the colonization was to a larger scale only after 1792/3, to Transnistria and beyond, when the Russian government declared that the region between the Dnister and the Southern Bug was to become a new principality named \\"New Moldavia\\", under Russian suzerainty.Nistor, Vechimea..., p. 16 According to the results of the census (quoted in Romanian sources) of 1793 49 villages out of 67 between the Dniester and the Bug were Romanian.E.

In 2009 it had a total population of 7,712, with around 3,600 people in the main town. Geography and climate Gory Gopela is a rural commune, located over 500 kilometres from Bamako and about 25 kilometres north of Kayes city in the south-west of Mali. The commune, which covers a total area of 330 km¬≤, is bounded by the municipality of Koussan√© in the north, by Kouloun in the south, and by Bangassi in the east. The commune contains a number of villages of note, which include Koumar√©fara (pop. 1,520), Bougountinti (pop. 1,300), Tichy-Gansoye (pop. 1,115) and the main town of Gory-G√∂pel (Gory Gopela) (pop. 3,605). The smaller village of Dag-Dag (pop. 553) also lies within the commune, though facilities in Dag-Dag are considerably lesser than the larger villages. The climate of Gory Gopela is Sudano-Sahel. Gory Gopela is predominantly dry and hot, and there are three seasons: a rainy season, a warm season and a cold season. Rainfall is very low for much of the year, hindering agriculture; this is worsened by the lack of agricultural land fallow. Soil erosion is a problem in Gory Gopela, where excessive removal of woodland and dry soils prone to soil erosion have contributed to a declining soil fertility. Government Administration of the commune is led by the mayor, deputy mayor, the councilors, a secretary, a director, and a secretary typist. Demographics In 2009 the commune had a population of compared to 5,296 in 1968. The population are primarily Soninke, Khassonk√©, Malinke, and Fula; in ethnicity. The population is young, with 58% of the population aged 0 to 18 as of 2006. The population density is 24 people per square kilometre. Over 800 immigrants are living in the commune, some of them aid workers from countries such as France, United States and Hong Kong but also people from Gabon, Libya and Democratic Republic of the Congo. Economy The main industry in Gory is agriculture; millet, maize, groundnuts, and sorghum are important crops. Some farmers have access to fertilisers and improved seeds, though increasing production and yields is difficult given the commune's climate. The commune has more than 3,600 cattle, with over 660 sheep and 700 goats and donkeys. Fishing is practiced only during the winter. In the town and the larger villages a number of the population are employed as potters, blacksmiths, masons, mechanics etc. Transport and communications are underdeveloped, and people are transported to and from Kayes by the very few who own vehicles. As of 2006 the commune did not have any landline networks. There are wells in all the main villages although drinking water is under construction. The Malian State Water Department, supported by Eau de Paris, has worked educate and train locals to ensure sustainable access to water and sanitation and awareness of hygiene. In 2001, Eau de Paris proposed to integrate into the project the teaching of children about water development, particularly the schooling of girls. In 2002, Eau de Paris in association with the AESN, ARGF and DNH organised the first water lesson in the all of Mali in Gory. Teachers from Paris have worked together with a Malian primary school manager to organise the water lessons and inform children about the design of water projects. The schooling was recognised by the Malian government and in 2004-2005, and an intergovernmental committee in Mali for Water and Education was established to promote water knowledge in other parts of the country. There is one medical facility in the commune in the town of Gory. There is one doctor, three nurses, a midwife, and a pharmacist. Malaria is common in the area. Education Educational changes have been brought about to Gory Gopela by a $950,000 UNESCO-Mali project, funded by the Norwegian government. A literacy project has made considerable development in educating women, most of whom have never been to school, to read and write their language, Khassonk√©. The improving education has also made women in the commune more knowledgeable about their crops and according to the local president of the association, Sindy Kant√©. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve put together a stock of seeds, the only one in the village, and we now grow vegetables over more than two hectares.‚Äù Education has also taught local women dye techniques, how to keep accounts, and how to process local fruit and vegetables, thus having a positive effect on local economic productivity. Female education has also changed the perception of some mothers who might have been opposed to their daughters going to school and neglecting family duties of work. In 1996, before the project started, just over 100 children attended the village‚Äôs only school. Now there are 420, including 150 girls, attending classes every day. Dafa Kamissoko became the first girl in the village to gain a baccalaureate (graduation certificate). Gori Gopela is not the only village where there are educational facilities; there are 35 others in the region which are covered by the project and a similar scheme has been started in the Mopti Region.

Unlike the position on the continent of Europe, in the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Ireland, and later in Great Britain and the United Kingdom, the monarch is the only one capable of awarding titles of nobility. There are currently 34 such marquessates (see List). Peerage of England The first marquess in England was Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford, who was appointed the Marquess of Dublin by King Richard II of England on 1 December 1385. On 13 October 1386, the patent of this marquessate was recalled, and Robert de Vere was raised to the rank of the Duke of Ireland. John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, the second illegitimate son of John of Gaunt, was raised to the second marquessate as the Marquess of Dorset in September 1397. In 1399, he was disgraced, and the king revoked his marquessate. The House of Commons of England later petitioned King Henry IV for his restoration, but the King objected stating \\"the name of marquess is a strange name in this realm\\". From that period the title appears to have been dormant until it was revived by Henry VI in 1442. The only woman to be appointed as a marquess in her own right was Anne Boleyn, who was created Marchioness of Pembroke in preparation for her marriage to Henry VIII. The investiture ceremony was held at Windsor Castle on 1 September 1532. The Marquess of Winchester (created in 1551) is the oldest surviving English or British marquessate, and as a result the holder of the title is considered the \\"Premier Marquess of England\\". Since Marquessates in England created after 1707 became Marquessates of Great Britain and, from 1801, of the United Kingdom, he is now the only English Marquess with no higher rank. All other Marquesses in the Peerage of England are also Dukes and use their title of Marquess as a subsidiary title.Debrett's Peerage of Ireland The first marquesses () in the Peerage of Ireland were Randal MacDonnell, 1st Marquess of Antrim (1645) and Ulick Burke, 1st Marquess of Clanricarde (1646), both titles created during the Irish Confederate Wars. (The above-mentioned Robert de Vere was created Marquess of Dublin and Duke of Ireland, but both of these were titles in the Peerage of England, not Ireland.) The Marquess of Waterford (created 1791) is the oldest surviving Irish marquessate, currently held by Henry Beresford, 9th Marquess of Waterford. Peerage of the United Kingdom The title Marquess was always higher than that of an Earl. In the late 19th and the 20th century many Viceroys of India were appointed as marquesses after their term of office. (It is indicative of the importance of the Indian Empire in British national life that retiring Viceroys were offered marquessates while retiring prime ministers were offered only earldoms). Some of the German relations of King George V were made marquesses in the Peerage of the United Kingdom after renouncing their German princely titles in 1917. Prince Louis of Battenberg, the princely head of the Battenberg family, became the first Marquess of Milford Haven. The last marquess created by the British crown was the Marquess of Willingdon in 1936. The creation of new hereditary titles is today confined almost exclusively to members of the royal family, but the creation of new marquessates appears to have ceased entirely. When new Royal Dukes are created (such as the Duke of Cambridge in 2011), the preferred next- highest subsidiary title appears to be that of an earldom. No explanation for this apparent policy of omitting marquessates has been forthcoming. Forms of address An English or British marquess is formally styled \\"The Most Honourable The Marquess of [X]\\" and less formally styled \\"Lord [X]', and his wife \\"Lady [X]\\". As with dukes, all sons of a marquess have the courtesy style of \\"the Lord Forename [Surname]\\" and all daughters have the courtesy style of \\"the Lady Forename [Surname]\\". The style for the eldest son, however, is often trumped by a subsidiary title of his father, such as earl or viscount, which is used instead. Especially for signing documents, the signature being only the name of the title, [X]). This form of signature is true for all peers, including peers by courtesy. For example, The Marquess of Salisbury would sign his name merely \\"Salisbury\\". A marquess by courtesy, however (who would always be the heir to a dukedom, since the courtesy title of an heir must always be at least one rank below that of the peer), does not enjoy the style of \\"Most Honourable\\", but is merely Marquess of [X], without the definite article. The genuine marquess as a peer, however, is always \\"The Most Honourable The Marquess of [X]\\", to differentiate a marquess by courtesy (i.e., the heir to a dukedom) from a marquess in his own right. The spelling of the title in a few older Scottish cases is \\"Marquis\\", particularly when the title was created prior to the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. Coronet A British marquess is entitled to a coronet bearing four strawberry leaves (three visible) and four silver balls (or pearls) around the rim (two visible). The actual coronet is worn mostly on certain ceremonial occasions, but a marquess can bear his coronet of rank on his coat of arms above the shield.

St. Paul's Church is one of the original thirty parishes created in 1692 by an Act of the General Assembly declaring the Church of England as the established religion of the Province of Maryland. The Georgian-styled building, completed in 1713, is the second-oldest Episcopal church on the Eastern Shore of Maryland (after Trinity Church in Church Creek, built in 1675). History St. Paul's Church, 1936 St. Paul's interior, 1936 St. Paul's Parish was laid out according to an Act of the General Assembly in 1692. The parish vestry, consisting of Thomas Smith, Charles Tilden, William Frisby, Michael Miller, Hans Hanson, and Simon Wilmer, convened for the first time on January 30, 1693 and set out parameters for the construction of the first parish church. The church was built by Daniel Norris at a cost of twenty-one thousand pounds of tobacco and completed by 1696. In 1711, upon the appointment of Rev. Alexander Williamson as Rector of St. Paul's Parish, the vestry made a contract with James Harris to construct a new brick church for the parish, to be \\"40 feet long in the clear and 20 feet wide in the clear, to be 16 feet from the ground, 5 windows, 2 doors and cases, the brick wall to be 2 1/2 bricks thick to the water table and 2 bricks thick from thence upward, a circle to be at the east end for the communion.\\" The cost for the new church was seventy thousand pounds of tobacco and construction took two years to complete. On April 6, 1713, James Harris delivered the new St. Paul's Church to the parish vestry. Over the next two years, the interior of the building was plastered and fitted with thirty-four pews, a pulpit, reading desk, and the aisles were laid in brick of herringbone bond. The Vestry House, once a common feature of parishes in the Mid-Atlantic, was constructed in 1766. Only two of these structures survive in Maryland today, the other located at St. George's Church in Perryman, Maryland. Opened in 1713, St. Paul's is currently the oldest continuously used Episcopal church building in Maryland. It measures with a semicircular apse on the east gable where musicians would have sat. The floor was not raised as it is today, nor was there an altar. People sat in ‚Äúbox pews‚Äù on chairs and faced the pulpit in the middle of the north wall. The main door was on the south wall. Among the notable rectors who served the parish in the 18th century was Rev. James Sterling who served from 1740-63. An Irish-born clergyman, Sterling was a poet, playwright, socialite, and entrepreneur who also served as the customs collector for Chestertown during his time in Kent County. Rev. William Smith, rector of Emmanuel Church in Chestertown, became rector of St. Paul's Parish in 1779. A founder of Washington College, Rev. Smith embraced the independence movement in the American colonies and presided over the convention of 1780 at which the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland was organized. This action kept St. Paul's Church open through the period of disestablishment following the Revolutionary War. After the American Revolutionary War, St. Paul's Parish entered a period of stagnation and decline. Half a century later in 1840, only thirteen families were recorded on the parish rolls. However, under the effective leadership of several rectors in the mid-19th century, the parish was revived and improvements were made to the church. In 1841, a vestry was added and the interior refitted with new pews. The sanctuary was also aligned to support worship focused on the sacrament in accordance with the growing Oxford Movement. Upon the completion of these projects, St. Paul's Church was consecrated on November 26, 1843 by the Right Reverend William Rollinson Whittingham, Bishop of the Diocese of Maryland. During the American Civil War, a triptych stained-glass window was installed in the apse above the altar employing the colors and symbols that were later incorporated into the Maryland State Flag as a symbol of unity among the divided sympathies of the parish. St. Paul's Church continued to prosper throughout the late-19th century. Among the rectors to serve the parish during this time was Rev. Sewell S. Hepburn, whose tenure begin in 1874 and concluded in 1881. He was the grandfather of actress Katharine Hepburn. Another prolific pastor of the parish in the late-19th century was Rev. Christopher Denroche who arrived at St. Paul's from Canada in 1892 and remained with the parish until his death in 1906. Rev. Denroche contributed to the documenting of the history of the parish in his book, A Souvenir History of the Parish of St. Paul's, Kent County Maryland, published in 1893 for the parish's bicentennial. He also conducted research which led to the erection of a monument for the Battle of Caulk's Field, fought on August 30, 1814, Kent County's only scene of action from the War of 1812. More enhancements were made to St. Paul's Church including the addition of a cast iron chandelier in 1882, a marble altar in 1890, and stained glass windows throughout the nave in 1912. During the 20th century, St. Paul's Parish continued to develop the campus surrounding the historic church. A new parish hall and rectory were added in 1948, designed by Baltimore architect Bryden Hyde, a descendant of the parish's second rector, Rev. Stephen Bordley. In 1967, the vestry was enlarged and further improvements were made to the church. St. Paul's Church was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The parish celebrated its tercentenary in 1992 with a year-long festival which included a visit from Canon John Sausmarez of Canterbury Cathedral.

In 1785 the Pauline Order was abolished, causing Brezovaƒçki to become a common priest. His disputes with clergy and the bishop Maksimilijan Vrhovac had often forced him to relocate, changing parishes (Vara≈ædin, Kri≈æevci, Rakovac, Zagreb, Krapina, Po≈æega, Zagreb).
