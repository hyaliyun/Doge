It is the sixth episode of the show's sixth season and aired on November 1, 2009. Plot Bree is starting to fall in love with Karl so she decides to end the affair. Karl gives Bree his grandmother's brooch because he found the perfect woman and tells Bree he loves her. That night, Bree and Orson go over to Susan's for dinner and she reminds Orson she hates public displays of affection. Susan sees the brooch on Bree and tells her it belonged to her but she lost it 11 years ago during the divorce. When Karl shows up to drop Julie off, Susan shows him the brooch and when Orson asks her where Bree got it, she lies and says she bought it at an antique shop. After finding out Karl yelled at Susan for losing the brooch, Bree gives it back to Susan. The next day, Bree confronts Karl about the brooch and reminds him they are done. Karl proposes to Bree and tells her he is a different person now and that she should think it over. Bree manages to get Susan to talk about the positive things about Karl and gives the brooch back to Bree. Bree tells Karl that she wants to marry the new Karl and that he should focus on getting her a divorce. She informs him that the new Karl needs to show up soon because if she is going to marry him, he needs to prove he is worth the consequences. The next morning, Orson visits the antique shop and learns that Bree lied about where she got the brooch as the shop only sells furniture. Gaby and Carlos are at the Fairview Elementary Thanksgiving play watching Juanita. Gaby tells Carlos that Juanita is not a good actress so she picks out a kid they can pretend is their own. When Juanita has trouble pronouncing \\"persecution\\", she gets frustrated and uses a four-letter swear word. Later, Gaby and Carlos are meeting with the principal and she informs them that as punishment Juanita will have to write a letter of apology to the other classmates and family members who heard the swear word, will not be able to participate in the final two performances of the Thanksgiving pageant, and will be on cafeteria cleaning duty for the next two weeks. Gaby thinks it is going overboard and the Principal says they have a zero tolerance policy for profanity. The principal questions Gaby's parenting skills so she pulls Juanita out of school and swears at the principal. Later, Carlos informs Gaby that she will have to home school Juanita and Gaby reluctantly agrees. Carlos tells Gaby that Juanita blames her for getting her pulled out of school. Gaby tells Juanita that she was only trying to defend her but learns that Juanita thinks of her as a bad mother. Early in the morning, Tom arrives home with two drunk college guys because they could not go home to their parents in that condition. Lynette gets upset because Tom went to a bar instead of studying at the library. Lynette reminds Tom that he is not going back to college just to have a second childhood and is there for school only. Gaby tells Lynette she has been getting bigger and wants to help her lose the weight by going for a run every morning. Lynette finds out Tom is at a party and when she goes to find him, the two guys that Tom brought home inform her that Tom is only doing stuff for them because they gave him the answers to the midterm as they have connections with the math department. Tom reveals to Lynette that he is failing the class and that is why he cheated on the midterm. Lynette tells him that he is setting a bad example and he reminds Lynette she is doing the same thing by lying to Gaby and Carlos about the pregnancy. He tells her that in order to survive they need to break the rules and warns Lynette that she is not better than him. Katherine visits Susan to apologize for her behavior and wants things to go back to normal. After Katherine suggests Susan and Mike invite her over for a barbecue, Susan tells her that because of everything that happened a barbecue will not happen. Katherine gets upset and informs Susan that she will have to sue Susan for reckless endangerment. Afraid of being sued, she agrees to invite Katherine over for brunch. Katherine goes over to Angie's to let her know the plan is working but she sees Angie looking at a picture of her mother who she says died. That night, Katherine calls Mike claiming to have a leak in her master bathroom but tells her he will stop by the next day. When he tells Susan it was Katherine, she tells him to get over there right away. Susan goes with Mike which catches Katherine by surprise. Katherine lies and has Mike fix the garbage disposal instead. Curious, Susan goes into Katherine's bedroom and sees rose petals scattered around the room and lit candles. Katherine catches her and Susan accuses her of trying to seduce Mike but she informs Susan that she does this every night. Knowing it is a lie, Susan starts to call Mike since he used to spend the night so Katherine starts frantically blowing out all the candles and flushing the rose petals. They get into a fight and end up falling into the bathtub with Susan holding Katherine under the water. Katherine overhears Angie talking to her mother on a pre-paid cellphone but she lies and says it is her mother-in-law. Later, Angie informs Susan that Katherine cannot be trusted and is dangerous. When Angie asks Susan if she knew where Katherine was the night of Julie's attack, Susan wonders why she would hurt Julie. Angie tells her that she just married Mike and puts the idea that since it was dark and a woman came out of the house, Katherine did not know it was Julie but thought it was Susan.

The band was formed by Sir Howard Morrison and included Gerry Merito, Wi Wharekura and Noel Kingi.Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand Howard Morrison was born in Rotorua in 1935, in a rugby-playing family. He died in Rotorua 24 September 2009. In 1955, while working as a surveyor's chainman, he started putting together vocal groups to entertain at rugby club socials in Rotorua. In 1956 he toured Australia as a member of the Aotearoa Concert Party. On his return, he heard guitarist Gerry Merito and put together a group with Gerry and two others, Wi Wharekura and Noel Kingi, and named the group Howard Morrison Quartet. In 1958 they became part of Benny Levin's touring 'Pop Jamboree.' A recording they made of \\"Hoki Mai/ Po Karekare Ana\\" sold well, and in 1959 their parody of \\"The Battle Of New Orleans,\\" recorded as \\"The Battle Of The Waikato\\", became one of their biggest hits. In 1960 they were so popular their managers released 13 singles, 3 EP's and 2 LP's. Another parody of Lonnie Donegan's, \\"My Old Man's A Dustman\\" was rewritten by Gerry Merito as \\"My Old Man's An All Black.\\" This was highly topical because of the huge controversy over Maoris not being allowed to tour South Africa with that year's All Blacks. Moving into 1962, two of their singles were more parodies, with Ray Stevens' \\"Ahab The Arab\\" becoming \\"Mori The Hori\\" and Pat Boone's \\"Speedy Gonzales\\" becoming \\"George The Wilder Colonial Boy\\", celebrating the exploits of escaped convict George Wilder. Due to the constant touring and absence from families, the quartet disbanded in 1965 but have occasionally re-united in various incarnations over the subsequent years.

The case was heard and the opinion written by Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke, and concerned Fletcher Gyles, a bookseller who had published a copy of Matthew Hale's Pleas of the Crown. Soon after the initial publication, the publishers Wilcox and Nutt hired a writer named Barrow to abridge the book, and repackaged it as Modern Crown Law. Gyles sued for a stay on the book's publishing, claiming his rights under the Statute of Anne had been infringed. The main issues in the case were whether or not abridgements of a work inherently constituted copyright infringement, or whether they could qualify as a separate, new work. Lord Hartwicke ruled that abridgements fell under two categories: \\"true abridgements\\" and \\"coloured shortenings\\". True abridgements presented a true effort on the part of the editor, and by this effort, constituted a new work which did not infringe upon the copyright of the original. Leaving it to literary and legal experts to decide, Hartwicke ruled that Modern Crown Law was not a true abridgement, but merely a duplication intending to circumvent the law. The case set a legal precedent which has shaped copyright law to the present day. It established the common law doctrine of fair abridgement, which was cited in other cases, ultimately building up to the idea of fair use. The opinion also recognised the author's right to a work through the nature of the labour it took to produce it, shifting copyright away from publishing rights and towards the idea of serving the greater good by encouraging the production of new, useful works. Facts Fletcher Gyles, an English bookseller, had previously published a book entitled Matthew Hale's Pleas of the Crown, for which he had purchased the exclusive publishing rights. Around the same time, publishers Wilcox and Nutt paid a writer named Barrow to abridge the book, circulating it under the title Modern Crown Law. Gyles alleged that Modern Crown Law was a near verbatim copy of his publication, with only minor alterations, including the translation of Latin and French passages into English and cutting old, obsolete laws.Atkyns (1740), 142. Seeking to protect his printing rights, Gyles sued both Wilcox and Nutt, along with Barrow, for a stay on the publication.Loyola Law Review (1994), 928. Arguments The case involved whether Wilcox, Barrow, and Nutt had violated Gyles' publishing rights as defined under the Statute of Anne, particularly the section stating that an author, or purchaser of an author's copyrights as Gyles was, \\"shall have the sole Liberty of Printing and Reprinting such Book and Books for the Term of four-teen years.\\"House of Commons (1710), 1. Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke presided over and decided the case. Browning, Gyles' attorney, cited a case which had also appeared before Hardwicke, that of Read v Hodges. In that case, a publisher attempted to circumvent the rights of the author of Czar Peter the Great by including all three volumes in one and cutting several pages.Atkyns (1740), 143. Hardwicke rejected the argument, however, declaring that the former case had been decided merely on a motion, and that he had given his decision and statements without the thought he would have given a normal hearing.Parker (1853), 456. Hardwicke further took contention with the Attorney General for England and Wales' assertion that the Statute of Anne provided a publishing monopoly, instead interpreting the act as one meant to promote public education and the public good.Barnardiston (1741), 368. As Hardwicke had decided to interpret the Statute of Anne as for the public good, the main question of the case became which \\"any such book or books\\" the act referred to and protected. The defendants argued that his abridgement must be considered separate from the original work published by Gyles. The defendant's lawyers furthered pushed the court to try the case as if the abridgement had been recorded in the Stationers' Register, an action that would have given Wilcox and Nutt the right to publish their book, and the lawsuit brought against a second, unique book. Therefore, the only question before the court was whether the second book differentiated sufficiently from the first.Barnardiston (1741), 369. Further, the attorneys for the defendants argued that the book was not a direct transcription, but that several chapters had been omitted, while other, original sections had been added to the Wilcox and Nutt publication.Deazley (2004), 82. They further pointed to the fact that the Gyles' publication consisted of 275 sheets, whereas the abridgement contained only 35 sheets.Scrutton (1896), 130. Judgment Lord Hardwicke, the jurist who presided over the case. The opinion, written by Hardwicke, found that a true abridgement of a published book may be considered an entirely separate, new work, as the abridgement showed the labour, originality, education, and judgement of the editor.Curtis (2005), 265.Henley (1821), 281.MacGillivray (1902), 25. This new book did not run the risk of infringing the rights of the author or bookseller who owned the publishing rights. However, Lord Hardwicke drew a distinction between works \\"fairly made\\" and those \\"colourably shortened\\". Hardwicke refused to compare the books himself to determine whether Modern Crown Law was indeed a fair abridgement, or to force a judge and jury to sit and hear both books read, instead opting to have two legal experts and a literary master read the books and report the findings to the court.Gresley and Alderson (1847), 455. The parties were allowed to choose these examiners, in a way leaving the case to arbitration.Cairns and McLeod (2002), 148. After a week in which the parties were given a chance to make amends outside of court,Barnardiston (1741), 370. the book in question was ruled a colourable shortening, created only to circumvent the law,Henley (1821), 280. and thus was an infringement of Gyles' printing rights. In his decision, Hartwicke went counter to the prevailing view that the Statute of Anne should be interpreted very strictly, proclaiming, \\"I am quite of a different opinion, and that it ought to receive a liberal construction, for it is far from being a monopoly, as it is intended to secure the property of books in the authors themselves, or the purchasers of the copy, as some recompense for their pains and labour in such works as may be of use to the learned world.\\"Patterson (1968), 162. Consequences The case established the doctrine of fair abridgement, which allowed that abridgements displaying a fair amount of labour on the part of the editor, and that differed from the original published work in a significant way, could not be copyright violations.Curiosities of Copyright Law (1888), 172. This in effect raised the abridger to the level of an author.Carr, Carr, and Schultz (2005), 215.Rose (1995), 51. The decision did not define the exact parameters that would qualify a work as a valid abridgement. This distinction came with a later case involving an abridgement of Hawksworth's Voyages, in a decision written by Lord Chancellor Apsley.Curtis (2005), 267. This concept of fair abridgement eventually evolved through common law, initiated from Gyles v Wilcox,Fisher (1988), 1663. into the current concept of fair use.Deazley (2008). Hardwicke's decision also added the exercise of personal judgement to the list of admissible defences against the charge of copyright infringement, adding to the growing case law establishing that British copyright would be based on labour and not on originality. The opinion advanced the position that copyright law should serve the public interest by promoting the creation of new educational and useful works, rather than focusing on publishing rights. The case played a significant role in the development of English copyright law. The United States federal courts have cited the case as recently as the 1980s.United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (1986).

It is primarily the application of a conversion kit to an existing EMD SD60-type locomotive. This involves replacing the existing 710G3A V16 prime mover with an EPA Tier-II-compliant 710G3B-T2 turbocharged V12, with Electronic fuel injection. Many of the donor SD60's major components and subsystems are recycled and are recertified as equal to new. However, the locomotive's control system is all new. Owners At least 24 Union Pacific SD60Ms have been scheduled to be sent to Electro Motive Diesel for this rebuild and a number have been returned by EMD and are already in revenue service. So far, all converted locomotives have been of the later \\"two window\\" cab type, not the earlier \\"three-window\\" cab type. SD59MX is the Union Pacific designation for this type. BNSF has sent 3 SD45-2 locomotives to be rebuilt as SD32ECOs. Unlike UP's SD59MX, BNSF's SD32ECOs retain the appearance of an SD45-2. So far, 3 have been ordered, and will be numbered 1350-1352. SD59MX The SD59MX is remanufactured from the carbody and major mechanical and electrical subsystems of an EMD SD60M \\"donor\\". The EFI-equipped 710 engine, however, is all new as are the engine and locomotive control systems. Union Pacific is the first Class I railroad to order them. The engine control system is adaptable to both minimum emissions and minimum fuel consumption modes, depending upon their assignment. The EMD SD59M-2, more commonly referred to as the SD59MX, is one of the rarest locomotives in the Union Pacific motive power fleet. SD59M-2s are remanufactured SD60Ms. Spotting features: # Wide-nose, so far only the later two-window wide nose rather than the earlier three-window \\"tri-clops\\" wide nose and none of the traditional EMD SD40-2|40 Series cab SD60s have been converted. # Slightly slanted radiator air intakes. # High-adhesion HT-C trucks, reused from the \\"donor\\" SD60M, rather than the newer \\"radial\\" or \\"bolsterless\\" trucks. Nearly all SD40-2s and SD50s used the same truck. # Safety fuel tank like that found on current SD70Ms. # There was previously an exhaust scrubber on both sides of the middle section of the long hood on one of these locomotives, UP 9900. It has since been removed. Appearance The external appearance of the converted locomotive is sometimes altered by application of a flared radiator section, similar to the SD70M-2 and SD70ACe Tier-II, and similar to late model SD70M and SD70MAC locomotives in appearance. The recently converted locomotives (including UP 9905 and 9906, seen recently at the CSRM; and others up to at least UP 9924) have also had the SD70M-2/SD70ACe-style safety fuel tanks applied. Advertised benefits Advertised benefits include: * EPA Tier-II compliance. * Fuel savings up to 25%. * Lube oil savings up to 50%. * Upgradeable software can be tuned for reduced emissions or improved fuel efficiency. * Microprocessor control offers diagnostics, wheel slip control, and optimal wheel/rail adhesion. * 184-day maintenance cycle instead of 92-day. * 15,000 MWh overhaul cycle. * Reduced maintenance expense due to use of standard 710 prime mover. * Automatic Engine Start Stop system keeps locomotive ready without wasting fuel.

The device was conceived as being a digital notebook, consisting of two 7-inch touchscreens hinged together like a book, and running a custom operating system built primarily around handwriting input and a notebook-like journal for storing notes, images, and clippings from web pages. Reports had indicated that the system was largely developed outside of the normal development channels, and existence of the project was only known by a few key engineers. The project was considered to be a successor of Codex and InkSeine, two earlier Microsoft Research efforts. Microsoft had previously classified the project as an \\"incubation\\", which is further along than a \\"research\\" project but is not yet in the commercial pipeline. In 2010, Microsoft confirmed that the project had ended and that they had no current plans to produce such a device. In October 2019, Microsoft unveiled an upcoming dual-screen tablet known as the Surface Neo, which has been widely-compared to Courier in terms of design and concept. Design The tablet was reported to have two seven- inch screens with a flexible hinge to allow closure like a book. The outside of the hinge would have contained wireless signal and battery strength indicators, and a home button to interact with the system while the booklet was closed. Courier would have relied entirely on touch input and handwriting recognition, as no external keyboard would have been available. Reports indicated that it would have been powered by NVIDIA‚Äôs Tegra 250 processor and would have weighed a little over a pound. A 3-megapixel digital camera with 4x zoom was integrated into the prototype system, and the final model might have contained an inductive charging pad for charging batteries wirelessly. Usage The system's main purpose would have been to function as a personal notebook and day planner to track contacts, tasks, and appointments. Courier would have included applications such as Microsoft Paint and notepad to help users create and organize original content, as well as web and photo browsers, email applications, and possibly an e-reader. Core operating system The core operating system of the Courier was reportedly a specialized version of Microsoft Windows CE, however the Courier would not have allowed installation of native Windows applications onto the system. All Courier applications would have had to have been designed specifically for the Courier's booklet form factor. In addition, some reports had indicated that the Courier would incorporate a front-side video camera for live video conferencing (via Microsoft Messenger) on the left side of the notebook so that users could have edited documents or taken notes on the right side. Infinite Journal The primary interface of the Courier would have been the Infinite Journal, an electronic journal with an unlimited number of pages upon which users could have taken notes, dragged photos, sketched drawings, and stored \\"web clippings.\\" Each page would have been stamped with the current time and location when each page was entered. These concepts are similar to the existing Windows Journal, which has been included in every version of Windows since XP. The mechanism for the location geotagging function might have come through an internal GPS, geolocation through IP connectivity through wireless access points, or through manual entry. Users might also have been able to highlight an infinite number of keywords to tag and index for future searching. The journal (in whole or in part) would have been able to be published online in several formats, including PDF and Microsoft PowerPoint documents. The Infinite Journal concept reportedly originated from a desire to build Microsoft OneNote from scratch with the dual-screen booklet form factor in mind. This idea spawned from the popularity of the Franklin Covey planner products, which utilize the booklet design. Smart Agenda The \\"Smart Agenda\\" would have been a condensed summary of the Infinite Journal, in which hyperlinked content would bring the user to the appropriate pages of the Infinite Journal. The smart agenda would have coordinated daily activities, appointments, and tasks, as well as coordinating email and messaging. Clip, Tuck, and Paste An innovative feature of the Microsoft Courier would have been users' ability to \\"clip\\" content from web sites or emails, to \\"tuck\\" the clipping underneath the physical hinge of the journal, and then to flip the virtual pages until the clipping was pasted into the appropriate page. This differs from a traditional clipboard, in which copied items are not visible while on the clipboard, and are usually manipulated one at a time. Touch The Courier would have featured multi-touch and stylus operation. The stylus would have operated in several different modes, allowing users to easily toggle between writing, painting, and sketching. Additionally, the physical stylus would have been able to access some new editing functions. It would have contained two quick-access buttons: one would have switched between a writing pen and a marker-style input, the other would have served as a quick \\"undo\\" function. Twisting the stylus would have engaged Courier's drawing functionality, and flipping the stylus over (like a pencil) would have caused the stylus to erase content on the virtual page. End of development On April 29, 2010, Microsoft confirmed that they will no longer support this project. The official statement was: On The Official Microsoft Blog, Frank Shaw, the Microsoft vice president who made the statement, referenced the articles published about the cancellation of the project as \\"speculation\\" and re-quoted himself, leaving out the \\"but we have no plans to build such a device at this time\\" part. In October 2017, it was reported that Microsoft was working on a new foldable digital ink device codenamed \\"Andromeda\\", based on the concept of the Courier. In October 2019, Microsoft unveiled an upcoming dual-screen tablet in the Surface family with strong similarities to the Courier concept, known as the Surface Neo. Microsoft emphasized its support of various \\"postures\\" to support different use cases and scenarios, including support for a stylus pen and a Bluetooth keyboard (which can attach to the bottom screen of the device to create a laptop-like experience, using the remainder of the screen as either a special toolbar or a touchpad depending on position). It will run a specific version of Windows 10 designed specifically for it and future devices in its class.

New York Times. The maps produced by the Committee and delivered to the Department of Transportation essentially negated the effect of a 1979 change to the city's Administrative Code that barred tort actions against the city unless the city was notified of the defects more than 15 days prior to the accident. The city paid out hundreds of millions of dollars in civil judgments over the next two decades before a 2003 law shifted liability to adjacent property owners. The Committee ceased producing maps after the new law, and the use of the maps in injuries predating the change was substantially limited by a 2008 decision of New York's highest court. The Code New York City Administrative Code ¬ß 7-201(c)(2), passed in 1979 by the New York City council and codified in 1980, bars personal injury lawsuits against the city arising from sidewalk or roadway defects, unless the city was notified of the defect at least 15 days prior to the injury.Center for New York City Law. 1996, February/March. \\"Current Development: City Torts: Proximate Cause: Broken Street Light not Proximate Cause of Assault\\". 2 City Law 9. The administrative code (as amended in 2006) provides: The survey The organization was created in 1982. The maps were prepared annually and submitted to the city's Department of Transportation. The Transportation department initially refused to accept the maps, but was forced to do so by a court order.Big Apple Pothole & Sidewalk Protection Committee, Inc. v. Ameruso., 110 Misc. 2d 688. The city's appeal was denied without opinion.Big Apple Pothole & Sidewalk Protection Comm. v. Ameruso, 56 N.Y.2d 507. The organization produced an average of 5,000 maps per year, covering all five boroughs and 13,000 miles of sidewalk, and noting more than 700,000 sidewalk hazards. Viewing most of the defects as minor or non- existent, the city began filing the maps away unread, in an attempt to argue in court that the unread maps did not provide \\"meaningful notice\\". A 2002 report by Michael Cardozo, a lawyer for the city's corporation states that \\"Relying on maps that provide hundreds of thousands of squiggles, but no meaningful information about sidewalk defects, plaintiffs have been able to sue the city successfully for even the most trivial sidewalk imperfections.\\" Use in court In some cases, courts held that both the current map and earlier maps could be and were admissible in trial as proof of negligence.Center for New York City Law. 2000, January/February. \\"Current Developments: City Torts\\". 6 City Law 21. In other cases, the city was granted a directed verdict when the plaintiff's claim was based on a defect noted in a prior map but not in the most recent.Katz v. City of New York, 87 N.Y.2d 241. In contrast, in cases where the sidewalk defect was absent from the maps, cases have been dismissed by summary judgment.Mendelsohn v. City of New York, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19769. Any ambiguity arising from the symbols on the map has (until 2008) generally been a question for the jury.Bradley v City of New York, 38 AD3d 581, 832 N.Y.S.2d 257.Reid v City of New York, 36 AD3d 784, 828 N.Y.S.2d 224.Vertsberger v City of New York, 34 AD3d 453, 824 N.Y.S.2d 346.Cassuto v City of New York, 23 AD3d 423, 805 N.Y.S.2d 580.Almadotter v City of New York, 15 AD3d 426, 789 N.Y.S.2d 729.Blas v R.M.H.

There were 2,729 sidewalk injury suits against the city in 2006 (resulting in $55.5 million in recovery), compared to 3,482 in 2003 ($68 million). Recoveries between 1997 and 2006 totaled $600 million. Sidewalk injuries are the most common cause of lawsuits against the city. Since 2003 A 2003 law shifted the liability from the city to the adjacent property owners, substantially decreasing the number of suits filed. The 2003 law applies only to sidewalks; the city remains liable for hazards in streets.Michael Pollack. 2008, January 6. \\"Slips, Falls, and Potholes\\". New York Times. The production of maps ceased after the new 2003 law, but--as of 2009--there are still thousands of cases utilizing the maps from injuries predating the law. A December 18, 2008 ruling by the New York Court of Appeals, D'Onofrio v. City of New York, significantly lessened the liability the city faces as a result of the maps.D'Onofrio v. City of New York, 901 N.E.2d 744. A 5-2 decision against the combined cases of two plaintiffs written by Judge Robert S. Smith found that the photographic evidence conflicted with the map in one case and that the map symbols were too illegible in the other. The ruling held that for the city to be liable, the marking on the map must match the actual conditions (e.g., the city would not be liable for a hole if the map denoted a crack). D'Onofrio substantially decreased the number of cases that would reach a jury: Judge Theodore J. Jones, in his dissent, stated:  Leadership and governance  * Stephan H.

As its main producer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Lain is the only official member, but he brings in vocalists to perform. Lain is known to have multiple different musical projects, including those such as Imagery by Sound, D7VON, 4ikai, and Spillexo.  History  Lain Volta Trzaska was born on 20 June 1983, in Krak√≥w, Poland. He moved to Sweden at the age of 5, where he learned to play the piano and violin at an early age. Despite his early introduction to the world of music, he hadn't garnered an interest for it until much later. His passions at a young age were centered around drawing and writing comics. In 1997, Lain began creating music using FastTracker for computer games he had created. It was around this time that young Trzaska and his friends held competitions to see who could create the \\"coolest\\" sounding song. This was what would wind up driving him further in the direction of a musical career. The combinations of his passions in art and music were what would later result in the creation of \\"she.\\" In 2003, Lain launched his project \\"she,\\" deviating from his game music sound into more band-oriented music, starting with his first official release Emit and Exude in 2004. As well as having a written narrative behind the music, Emit and Exude explored a more ambient and industrial sound while still retaining some elements from his game music including chiptune and game sound elements. Trzaska explained that the goal was to establish his sound and create the feeling of something \\"coming into existence.\\" The protagonist of the story remains the only one created from the music in the album as opposed to the other way around, where \\"Reborn\\" represents her creation, \\"Trains\\" represents an uncertain destination, and the rest of the story is the listener's creation. March 2005 saw the second official release from she, Digital Ambient Designs, which, as implied by the name, was an album released in an electronic ambient style. The narrative established in Emit and Exude was continued, but it's unclear from an objective standpoint what direction the story takes. As with most of Trzaska's releases, it is up to the listener to continue the story. In June 2007, the heavily story-based album days was released by she, and was made available for free. Shortly afterward a prequel continuation to days, Nights, was announced to be in production. Traveling by Night was also released in August. In June 2008, shortly after releasing Coloris, Trzaska was contacted by Japanese music label Pony Canyon for a record deal. Pony Canyon released the Coloris album in physical and digital formats throughout the Asian market but Lain retained his worldwide copyright, excluding Japan. Further production of Nights was also in the works, but fell out of development after struggles with hardware and software, leading to a brief hiatus and rewrite of all the songs in the album. 2008 also saw the release of the Chiptek EP and she's single, 2008. In 2009, Trzaska continued through working through producing Nights as well as a second major album under the Pony Canyon label. Despite his earlier confidence in taking on both projects at the same time, he eventually began feeling the stress of the workload, and put Nights on indefinite hiatus on 3 March. This allowed him to focus heavily on pushing out the album for Pony Canyon, which allowed for the release of the second major she album under Pony Canyon, Orion. This is considered to be the direct sequel to Coloris in regards to the story behind the music. After the release of Orion, Trzaska made a statement that Nights was to be put back into production. In early 2011, after more than a years hiatus, Lain released the Single 'Make Me Real' which was a more slow and ambient vocal piece, similar to his more earlier work from 2004. In May 2012, Trzaska announced that \\"she\\" has been put on indefinite hiatus. He later clarified that only the band has been put on hiatus, not himself as an artist. A few days later, Lain announced that \\"shemusic\\" (that is, his style of music blend [mainly Electro House/Chiptune and Ambient Acoustic] released under his band \\"she\\") was going to split in two. He further announced the new band was to be known as \\"Imagery by Sound\\". \\"she\\" and \\"Imagery by Sound\\" are now the two sides of \\"shemusic\\". While \\"she\\" follows its way on Electro House and Chiptune, \\"Imagery by Sound\\" focuses now on the \\"ambient/acoustic and electro experimental aspect of \\"shemusic\\". Imagery by Sound features the previous albums (Insomnia, days, Digital Ambient Designs) from \\"she\\" as a related musical legacy. The upcoming Nights album will be released under Imagery by Sound. In December 2012, Insomnia became the first EP released under Imagery by Sound, with the single \\"Darkness of my Past\\" coming in late August. Both were briefly released for free that October. In September of the same year, Trzaska also released a new shemusic LP titled Electric Girl, which had been put on the shelf in 2010. In March 2013, his newest side project \\"4ikai\\" was announced, set to explore the more ambient, glitch style of Trzaska's music without relation to she or Imagery by Sound's continuity. Although the name had been established, it wouldn't see an official musical release in 2013. In November 2014, Trzaska announced a new she album to be released during spring 2015, with a single from the album to be released a few weeks before it. This release was pushed back to December 2015, when she's next album, Chiptune Memories, was released. This album and its lyricism reflect heavily on dated concepts and technology, featuring instrumentation generated from Game Boy, Sega Genesis FM Chips, and Nintendo Entertainment Systems. In January 2015, almost two years after Trzaska's announcement of his side project \\"4ikai,\\" the EP Hyperborea had been released, officially establishing a sound to the 4ikai name. The following March, two new singles (\\"Thaw\\" and \\"Winter Dynamics\\") were also released under 4ikai. In October 2016, Trzaska released a new she EP named Abyss. One month later, Trzaska announced a continuation of the story developed in Coloris and Orion would be coming out in the form of a third album. In February 2017, 4ikai saw the release of the 5-track EP Analogica. Trzaska followed up with another musical release that December under she, titled Chroma, which took a different musical direction than previous releases, incorporating elements found in 80's electronic music. However, this was not the aforementioned continuation of Coloris and Orion. In February 2018, Trzaska produced the intro theme for American Twitch streamer Dr DisRespect, appropriately titled The Doctors Intro Theme. In accordance with a precedence set by both Chroma and Dr DisRespect's overall aesthetic, this release also saw a strong 80's influence.  Musical style  While she's music can be labeled as electronica and chiptune, it incorporates elements from ambient and classical music. Using a mixture of old 8-bit computers and modern equipment, she's music is produced in the bitpop style. While she's albums are electronic in nature, they can vary in genres from album to album. For example, she's first release, Emit and Exude, is a blend of industrial-electro with electric guitars; the third release, Pioneer, is a chiptune album that uses a Game Boy as the main instrument, and the first major release, Coloris, is a dance-electronica album. Lain often uses acoustic instruments with synthesizers (this stems from his musical roots in classical piano). An effect Lain often uses is \\"synthetic distortion\\", i.e. making the music sound 'glitchy' or 'laggy' like a damaged mp3 or CD. This creates an impression of the music being damaged. Lain often uses Renoise, a DAW based upon the heritage and development of tracker software, to create his music. He often masters his music using Sound Forge.  Visuals and design  Myspace-era (2005-2008) promotional art for shemusic. The graphics, illustrations and designs surrounding she's releases are directly connected with each album and both the images and music are intended to tell a story. For example, the days album was created as a short story where each song introduces a new chapter. Lain describes that while the sounds, effects, and lyrics give clues to the story of the album, \\"the listener would find himself creating images and events in his head, completing the story\\". A recurring theme in she's art is that some images seem to be damaged or poorly compressed in certain parts. Just like with the music distortion, the images are designed to give the impression that the file is incomplete, broken and not correctly displayed. Lain uses symbolism in his images, often tying the imagery into story elements. Discography Most of She's releases are available for download on the official she Bandcamp. The Electric Girl album was originally planned for a release in 2010, but was later postponed until November 2012. Music from the album days is used as music in the movie 12 Fl oz. she occasionally releases compilations of free songs called \\"she music collections\\" that disappear soon after their release. These collections contain old music, demos, pieces of released albums, alternate versions of songs, and more.

Whereas many organizations focused only on events to solve the illegal street racing problem, Evo looks to solve the problem on and off the track as their representatives go into the environment where the acts take place. Since Evo's inception their efforts have been received as an organization that works towards unifying all the affected parties into a comprehensive unified action plan.http://www.dumbdrum.com/death-street-racing-pt2/ As a result of their local and global efforts Evo has been featured on many media outlets including, Good Morning America, National Public Radio (NPR), ESPN, and CNN.http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=3604944 Their main program is entitled the \\"Evolution Solution\\". The three major stages or goals of the program are: *Stage 1: Create and encourage legal and safe motorsports events *Stage 2: Design, implement, and promote community inclusion programs *Stage 3: Lobby for stricter penalties, effective legislation, and consistent law enforcement techniques The organization offers a large database of topics relating to illegal street racing including; accidents, statistics, legislation, enforcement techniques, photo galleries, and general news. Their research department also runs a range of studies covering topics such as illegal street racing terminology, locations, fatalities, and incidence. In addition to the specific solutions to the illegal street racing problem Evo runs a motorsports event called \\"Beat the Badge\\". The event features an opportunity to race against police officers in their active cruisers, a grudge match, a test and tune, and an afterdark race. The parent company of Evo Street Racers, Street Scene Revolution, also operates another racing event which is focused towards the street scene called the \\"Super Bowl of Street Racing\\".http://www.superbowlofstreetracing.com/ References Category:Auto racing organizations in the United States Category:Drag racing organizations Category:Hazardous motor vehicle activities Category:2003 establishments in the United States ","title":"Evo Street Racers"},{"id":"24452670","text":"This is a list of roads abbreviated N24. * N24 road (Belgium) * N24 road (France) * N24 road (Ireland) * N24 road (Luxembourg) * N24 road (Switzerland) * Nebraska Highway 24, a state highway in the U.S. state of Nebraska See also * List of highways numbered 24 ","title":"List of N24 roads"},{"id":"24452694","text":"William John King (January 4, 1864 ‚Äì July 16, 1936) was the head coach of Hampden‚ÄìSydney College's football team in 1895 and went 1‚Äì1.

Functions In terms of the constitution, the executive authority of a province is entrusted in the Premier. The Premier announces an Executive Council consisting of ten members of the provincial legislature; they are called Members of the Executive Council (MECs). The MECs are basically ministers and the Executive Council a cabinet at the provincial level. The Premier has the authority to appoint and axe MECs at his/her own discretion. The Premier and the Executive Council are responsible for implementing provincial legislation, along with any national legislation allocated to the province. They set provincial policy and manage the departments of the provincial government; their actions are subject to the national constitution. In order for an act of the provincial legislature to become law, the Premier must sign it. If he/she believes that the act is unconstitutional, it can be referred back to the legislature for reconsideration. If the Premier and the legislature cannot agree, the act must be referred to the Constitutional Court for final consideration. The Premier is also ex officio a member of the National Council of Provinces, the upper house of Parliament, as one of the special delegates from the province.Constitution of South Africa List {| |- !class=\\"unsortable\\"|No. !Name !Took office !Party |- bgcolor=#FFCCCC |1  |Inkatha Freedom Party |- bgcolor=#FFCCCC |2  (acting until 19 March) |Inkatha Freedom Party |- bgcolor=#FFCCCC |3  |Inkatha Freedom Party |- bgcolor=#CCFFCC |4  |African National Congress |- bgcolor=#CCFFCC |5  |African National Congress |- bgcolor=#CCFFCC |6  |African National Congress |- bgcolor=#CCFFCC 7  |African National Congress |- bgcolor=#CCFFCC 8  |African National Congress |} Election The election for the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Legislature is held every five years, simultaneously with the election of the National Assembly; the last such election occurred on 8 May 2019. At the first meeting of the provincial legislature after an election, the members choose the Premier from amongst themselves. The provincial legislature can force the Premier to resign by a motion of no confidence. If the Premiership becomes vacant (for whatever reason) the provincial legislature must choose a new Premier to serve out the period until the next election. One person cannot have served more than two five-year terms as Premier; however, when a Premier is chosen to fill a vacancy the time until the next election does not count as a term.

The church was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 24, 1978. History The Methodist presence in Guernsey County was localized around what is today Valley Township even before this township was created. The congregation met in the barns of several members until the needs for a church building became evident in the early 19th century. In 1832, John Robins donated a site on the southern side of SR 146 for a church and cemetery. The resulting frame building was used until 1873. Growth in membership caused the building to become too small,Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 551. and the idea of a new building was discussed. The new site chosen was across the road and construction on the new building began in 1871. The church was finally completed in 1873 in the Romanesque Revival style, reminiscent of the many churches in the New England states. The architect is unknown, but several candidates have been named. The church was remodeled in 1898; worn-out decorations were repaired, and the building was restored to its former glory. The rededication was led by Dr. David H. Moore. After the church moved in 1960 to the city of Cambridge, a community organization, Bethel Community Church, Inc., was formed to protect the building from alteration or destruction, and the East Ohio Annual Conference sold them the building for one dollar. Following this transaction, the church was converted into a community center. Exterior The rectangular red brick structure is located on a shady tree- filled plot. The front facade is three bays wide, with a central projection containing large wooden double doors. Above the doors is a fanlight to allow the morning light to penetrate the building. To either side of the door is a large rectangular stained glass window, designed and shipped from Germany. Above the entrance is a large arched window similar to the lower side windows. The central projection is topped by a bell tower which rests on a dentil cornice. The arched openings of the tower are decorated with wooden fretwork and the original bell rests on its mount; the bell's mechanism still works. The tower is capped by a spire which once housed a lightning rod, but now ends in a ball. The side facade is lined with four large arched windows similar to the front, also from Germany. The windows are each topped with a sandstone arch with a large projecting keystone. The church was heavily vandalized in 2005, leaving a large hole in the triple mason walls, and all of the windows broken, many beyond recognition. The burdens of maintaining the church as well as repairing the damage are more than can be covered by the current caretaker, so much of the damage is still evident.

Background  Borromeo is the daughter of Don Carlo Ferdinando Borromeo, Count of Arona (born in 1935), the son of Vitaliano Borromeo, 2nd Prince of Angera, and his long-time companion, Countess Donna Paola Marzotto (born in 1955). Through her father she is related to Carlo Borromeo (1538‚Äì1584), who became a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, Archbishop of Milan, and a canonized saint. The family currently owns most of the Borromean Islands in the Lago Maggiore, Milan city, and many other estates in the Lombardy and Piedmont countrysides. Borromeo has an older brother, Carlo Ludovico Borromeo, who is married to Marta Ferri. She has three older half-sisters from her father's marriage to German model Marion Sybil Zota: Isabella, married to Count Ugo Brachetti Peretti; Lavinia, married to John Elkann; and Matilde , married to Prince Antonius zu F√ºrstenberg. Borromeo's maternal grandmother was the fashion designer Marta Marzotto (n√©e Vacondio), ex-wife of Count Umberto Marzotto. Her uncle, Count Matteo Marzotto, is the former president and director of the Valentino fashion house at the time the label belonged to the Marzotto Group.  Education  She finished secondary education, in 2004, at Milan's Liceo Classico Giovanni Berchet. Borromeo received a bachelor of laws from Bocconi University, Milan in 2010, under supervision of prof. Lorenzo Cuocolo. She began to work toward a Masters in Journalism from Columbia University Journalism School in the fall semester of 2011, at last receiving the degree in May 2012.  Career  Beatrice was a contributor to Newsweek and the Daily Beast in 2013. Prior to that, and from the newspaper's beginning in 2009, she worked as a full-time reporter for Il Fatto Quotidiano. She continued in that position through the year 2016. She has appeared on many television shows in Italy, beginning with Anno Zero on Rai 2 where she worked for two years, from 2006 to 2008. Every week she interviewed an average three guests on political development and social evils. In 2009, she even hosted a weekly show on the Radio 105 Network. She interviewed Roberto Saviano, the famous author of Gomorrah, for Above magazine's June 2009 issue. She also interviewed American author of LA Confidential James Ellroy and former candidate for Colombia's presidency Ingrid Betancourt both for Il Fatto Quotidiano. For the same newspaper, she interviewed Marcello Dell'Utri, Italian Senator and co-founder of Forza Italia. In the interview, Dell'Utri admitted to have entered politics to get immunity in order to escape his arrest. Her first article for Il Fatto Quotidiano, published on 14 September 2009, was about Vito De Filippo, then- president of the Italian region of Basilicata, allocating European funds for the Miss Italia contest. Borromeo directed Mamma Mafia, a documentary about mafia women: its preview was released by the Newsweek Daily Beast Company on 31 January 2013. That was her sole film in the English language. She has directed several documentaries in the Italian language, ranging from topics as the women of 'Ndrangheta, selfie surgery, and the children of Caivano. Speaking of the children who live in the slums of Caivano, Borromeo said: \\"These children never get to be children. They live in horror and daily terror and that seems to be normal.\\" Borromeo collaborated with Marco Travaglio and Vauro Senesi on the book Italia Annozero (Chiarelettere, 2009). She also wrote the preface for Birgit Hamer's Delitto senza castigo: La Vera Storia di Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia. (Aliberti, 2011). Birgit Hamer is a very old family friend; her mother is dear friends with Borromeo's mother, and Borromeo has admitted to having grown up hearing about the murder of Dirk Hamer from his sisters, including Birgit. Borromeo broke the story of the video confession of Vittorio Emanuele,Borromeo, Beatrice Il video che incastra Savoia, Il Fatto Quotidiano, 24 February 2011; http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2011/02/24/il-video-che-incastra-savoia/93668/ who subsequently sued the newspaper for defamation. In 2015 a court ruled in favour of the newspaper.Beatrice Borromeo, el azote de los Saboya, Hola, 10 March 2015; http://www.hola.com/realeza/casa_monaco/2015031077373/beatrice- borromeo-saboya/ Borromeo then posted on Twitter: \\"Vincere una causa e' sempre piacevole, ma contro Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia la goduria √® doppia!\\" (\\"Winning a case is always nice, but against Victor Emmanuel of Savoy the pleasure is double\\"), which resulted in spat on social media with his son Emanuele Filiberto.  Personal life  Since 2008, Borromeo became increasingly known in the tabloid press as the girlfriend of Pierre Casiraghi, the younger son of Caroline, Princess of Hanover. The couple married in a civil ceremony on Saturday, 25 July 2015 in the gardens of the Prince's Palace of Monaco. The religious ceremony took place on 1 August 2015 on Isola Bella, one of the Borromean Islands on Lake Maggiore, Italy. In November 2015 she was sanctioned Special Envoy for Human Rights for F4D. She considered herself in 2005 \\"atheist and leftist\\". Pierre and Beatrice's first son, Stefano Ercole Carlo Casiraghi, was born on 28 February 2017. Their second son, Francesco Carlo Albert, was born on 21 May 2018.

Plot The criminal brothers El Bedoja and Chiuchi have each their own gang. Together they rob a stagecoach. After they've just got rid of all witnesses by killing the passengers, they are already about to plan the next coup together. This time they want to do the bank of Mallintown. Its safe is considered unbreakable but it does open automatically shortly at certain times. The two gang leaders use the stagecoach as a kind of Trojan Horse to get gang members unrecognised into the town and moreover to have a big chest put into the strongroom. When the time has come for the safe to open, Chiuchi attacks the town as a diversionary tactic and lures the guards away. Then El Bedoja carries out the actual strike with his own gang, taking the now scarcely protected bank by surprise. Here he unites with the other gang members who have arrived with the stagecoach already. El Bedoja and his men get away with a great deal of booty and bring a wounded accomplice to a farm where they coerce a woman into removing a bullet. Meanwhile, a travelling gunman named Hud, who happened to see the massacre in Mallintown, has followed them. He puts down all of El Bedoja's men but El Bedoja himself eludes. On hot pursuit Hud teams up with bounty hunter Rocco. They discover that the criminal siblings hide in an old mine and hire an old miner to close the entrance with dynamite. Yet El Bedoja and Chiuchi are on their guard. Hud wants to keep El Bedoja alive because he needs him as a witness to correct a miscarriage of justice. The bounty hunter on the other hand just wants to get the bounty and for that El Bedoja is worth dead just the same.

Developed by the Small Spacecraft Division at NASA Ames Research Center, the spacecraft was successfully launched as a secondary payload on STP-S26 led by the Space Test Program of the United States Air Force on a Minotaur IV rocket from Kodiak Island, Alaska on November 19, 2010.  Mission overview  The O/OREOS satellite is NASA's first cubesat to demonstrate the capability to have two distinct, completely independent science experiments on an autonomous satellite. One experiment will test how microorganisms survive and adapt to the stresses of space; the other will monitor the stability of organic molecules in space. The overall goal of the O/OREOS mission is to demonstrate the capability to do low-cost science experiments on autonomous nanosatellites in space in support of the 'Astrobiology Small Payloads' program under the Planetary Science Division of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA's Headquarters. NASA's Ames Small Spacecraft Division manages the O/OREOS mission while all operations will be conducted by staff and students from the Robotic Systems Laboratory at Santa Clara University. Scientists will apply the knowledge they gain while investigating the space environment and studying how exposure to space changes organisms to help to answer astrobiology's fundamental questions on the origin, evolution, and distribution of life. The technology developed in this mission enables a new generation of light-weight, low-cost payloads suitable for future secondary payload opportunities ‚Äî\\"piggyback rides\\"‚Äî to the Moon, Mars, and beyond, where they can address evolutionary questions, identify human exploration risks, and study planetary protection concerns.  Spacecraft overview  Continuing Ames' development of triple-cube nanosatellite technology and flight systems, which includes the successful GeneSat-1 and PharmaSat missions, O/OREOS is constructed from off- the-shelf commercial and NASA-designed parts to create a fully self-contained, automated, stable, light-weight space science laboratory with innovative environment and power-control techniques. The spacecraft is equipped with sensors to monitor the levels of internal pressure, temperature, humidity, radiation and acceleration while its communications system regularly transmits data back to Earth for scientific analysis. The organics payload will house 24 samples in four separate micro-environments to mimic space, lunar, Martian and \\"wet\\" planetary conditions. The samples are housed in a rotating carousel and are imaged regularly with UV/VIS spectroscopic instrumentation while being exposed to the space environment. The biological payload is a self-contained pressure vessel which provides life support (air pressure, humidity, growth media, and temperature control) for organisms as they are exposed to the radiation and weightless conditions in space for six months. In addition to the experiments, the satellite is equipped with a passive magnetic attitude control system, solar panels to generate electric power, a UHF amateur band radio beacon which broadcasts real-time telemetry, battery packs, and NASA's first propellant-less mechanism to ensure that once O/OREOS has completed its mission it will de-orbit and burn up as it re-enters Earth's atmosphere.  Primary experiments  The goals of the O/OREOS mission include: *demonstrating key small satellite technologies that can enable future low- cost astrobiology experiment. *deploying a miniature UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer suitable for in-situ astrobiology and other scientific investigations. *testing the capability to establish a variety of experimental reaction conditions to enable the study of astrobiological processes on small satellites. *measuring the chemical evolution of organic molecules in LEO under conditions that can be extrapolated to interstellar and planetary environments.  Space Environment Survivability of Live Organisms  The O/OREOS Space Environment Survivability of Live Organisms (SESLO) experiment will characterize the growth, activity, health and ability of microorganisms to adapt to the stresses of the space environment. The experiment is sealed in a vessel at one atmosphere and contains two types of bacteria commonly found in salt ponds and soil: Halorubrum chaoviatoris, which thrives in the sort of briny water that may exist below the surface of Mars or on Jupiter's moon Europa, and Bacillus subtilis, which holds the record for surviving in space for the longest duration (6 years on a NASA satellite). The bacteria were launched as dried spores and revived at different times during the mission with a nutrient-filled fluid a few days, three months and six months after launch. Once the satellite is in orbit, the bacteria are constantly being exposed to low Earth orbit radiation while floating in micro-gravity. The SESLO experiment measures the microbes' population density. There was an expected change in color as dyed liquid nutrients were consumed and metabolized by the microorganisms. This color change is used to determine the effects of the combined exposure to space radiation and microgravity on organism growth, health, and survival when compared to a ground-based control experiment. Results The SESLO experiment measured the long-term survival, germination, and growth responses, including metabolic activity.  Space Environment Viability of Organics  The O/OREOS Space Environment Viability of Organics (SEVO) experiment will monitor the stability and changes in four classes organic matter as they are exposed to space conditions. Scientists selected the organic samples to represent some building blocks of life and abundant aromatic molecules, they think are distributed throughout the Milky Way galaxy. The controlled environments in the SEVO reaction cells do not accurately represent natural environments; rather, they are used to establish a set of initial conditions for the chemical reactants involved in photochemical experiments. These reactants were chosen because they can be related to fundamental processes believed to occur in planetary surface environments, comets, and the interstellar medium. As such, each of the different cell types was carefully chosen to simulate important aspects of astrobiologically relevant environments. Four classes of organic compounds, namely an amino acid, a quinone, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and a metallo-porphyrin are being studied. The compounds were placed in four different micro-environments that simulate some conditions in interplanetary space, on the Moon, on Mars and in the outer Solar System. The experiment continuously exposes the organic matter to radiation in the form of solar ultraviolet (UV) light, visible light, trapped-particle and cosmic radiation over six months in space. Scientists will determine the stability of the organic matter by studying in-situ the changes in UV, visible and near- infrared light absorption through daily measurements. The survival rate of these molecules will help determine whether some of Earth's biochemistry might have been performed in space and later delivered by meteorites. The data may also help in deciding which molecules are good biomarkers that can signal the existence of past or present life on another world.SEVO (Space Environment Viability of Organics) Preliminary Results from Orbit. (July 13, 2012). Results Spectra from the PAH thin film in a water-vapor-containing microenvironment indicate measurable change due to solar irradiation in orbit, while three other nominally water-free microenvironments show no appreciable change. The quinone anthrarufin showed high photostability and no significant spectroscopically measurable change in any of the four microenvironments during the same period.  Amateur satellite tracking  O/OREOS is equipped with an amateur radio beacon which operates at 437.305 MHz. HAM radio operators can decode the satellite's AX.25 packets and submit them to NASA via the beacon processing website. Mission status In the fall of 2011, nearly 100,000 beacon packets have been submitted by amateurs in 20 countries. About 6 MB of data have been downlinked and processed by the Santa Clara University operation team through S-band (WiFi) bidirectional radio. In addition to the science results from both payloads, these data include measurements of the radiation dose, rotation data, temperature, and health status of the spacecraft. Multiple commands were uplinked successfully to tune operational parameters. All three biological experiments using the SESLO payload are complete; they were executed on December 3, 2010, February 18 and May 19, 2011. From the SEVO experiment, the project observed nominal spectrometer function, and so far 24 sets of 24 UV-visible spectra have been recorded and downlinked, amounting to nearly 600 spectra from 4 organic sample types embedded in 4 microenvironments.

The tax begins at properties valued at $1 Million, the rate fluctuates from 10%-16%, depending on the value of the property. Proponents of ending the tax claim it is an unfair double tax on property that has been handed down from generation to generation, citing instances where families had to break up long distinguished businesses to pay the tax. Marie Bowers, president of Oregon Women for Agriculture and chief petitioner stated \\"ending Oregon's death tax is about ... sustaining the legacy and land my great-great grandpa started farming over a century ago that is my family's livelihood.\\" The Tax Fairness of Oregon has criticized this legislature. The chair of TFO Jody Wiser, countered claims that it is a double tax by explaining capital gains on the property are not taxed until the asset has been transferred. In a statement to the Capital Press, Wiser said \\"When people say it has already been taxed and it is being taxed twice, that is mostly a dishonest claim.\\" Business Energy Tax Credit Program The group has also brought awareness to the Business Energy Tax Credit Program, which guarantees 15% of lottery dollars to fund conservation organizations.

He was Distinguished Professor Emeritus at Bowling Green State University (BGSU) in Bowling Green, Ohio. He founded the first (and only) academic Department of Popular Culture at BGSU in 1972, and is the founding editor of the Journal of Popular Culture, the Journal of American Culture, and the Popular Press (a university-based press that published hundreds of books on popular culture). He also founded the Library for Popular Culture Studies (BPCL) at BGSU (which today bears his name), the Popular Culture Association, and the American Culture Association. His particular area of specialization was American popular literature, and he was an authority on Herman Melville, Mark Twain, the popular culture surrounding Abraham Lincoln and the American Civil War, and the influence of Shakespeare on American popular music. Early life Ray Browne was born in Millport, Alabama on January 15, 1922, the youngest of four children. His father, Garfield Browne, was a bank manager and later bank president of various small-town banks in the south. Browne's mother was Anne Nola Browne (n√©e Trull). The family moved on numerous occasions during Browne's early life as his father sought new opportunities in banking. Browne lived for short periods of time in Arkansas and Florida, and for longer periods in Epes, Alabama and, off and on, in Millport, Alabama. The family finally settled in Millport, where Browne graduated from high school. Browne's father lost his bank, his job, and his life savings in the stock market crash of 1929, and he grew up in poverty during the Great Depression. College and World War II Browne attended the University of Alabama due to the encouragement of a high school teacher, Elbert Coleman, and the financial support of his sister Joan. Following graduation, he immediately entered the U.S. Army and served in an artillery corps in the European theater in World War II. His unit entered Europe at Marseille and was part of the allied thrust that drove the Germans back into Germany. His corps was in Germany at the war‚Äôs end. Following the war, Browne was one of thousands of GIs who stayed in Europe for a year. He studied Shakespeare and early Greek philosophy at the University of Birmingham and literature at the University of Nottingham in England. Early academic life Browne returned to the United States and entered the master's program at Columbia University, graduating with a degree in Victorian literature. From there he took a faculty position in English at the University of Nebraska, where he was influenced by recently retired folklorist Louise Pound. Following two years of teaching, he entered the Ph.D. program in English at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1950. His two mentors at UCLA were the famed Americanist Leon Howard and well-known folklorist Wayland Hand. Browne's dissertation was on the topic of Alabama folksongs. His dissertation was later turned into a book entitled The Alabama Folk Lyric: A Study in the Origins and Media of Dissemination (1979). He received his Ph.D. in 1956. Upon graduation from UCLA, Browne took a job as an assistant professor at the University of Maryland. He served on the faculty for four years before moving to Purdue University in Lafayette, Indiana in 1960. His years at Purdue were distinguished by significant professional advancement. He published numerous books in the area of American culture and literature that would lay the foundation for his later works, including Critical Approaches to American Literature: Roger Williams to Herman Melville (1965, with Martin Light), New Voices in American Studies (1966, with Donald Winkleman and Allen Hayman), and Frontiers of American Culture (1967, with Richard Crowder, Virgil Lokke, and William Stafford). His years at Purdue were also marked by a growing conviction that English departments were not teaching a wide enough spectrum of literature. In particular, Browne believed that popular literature was unduly ignored (and denigrated) by traditional academics. In 1967, Browne moved to the Department of English at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, where he saw an opportunity to begin teaching courses in popular culture and American culture on a wide scale. Primary academic life In his early years at B.G.S.U., Browne founded the Journal of Popular Culture (JPC) in 1967 and the Center for the Study of Popular Culture in 1968. JPC was the first peer-reviewed journal for scholarly work in the area of popular culture. His early efforts in the Department of English led in 1973 to the establishment of a separate Department of Popular Culture which began by offering an M.A. program, followed by the establishment of the undergraduate major a year later. This department was the first formal attempt to promote serious scholarly inquiry into what most people do with most of their free time. The Department of Popular Culture quickly grew and continues to flourish at B.G.S.U. today. Browne was named a Distinguished University Professor at BGSU in 1977 and taught there until his retirement in 1992. In 1970, Browne founded the Popular Press to publish books on popular culture and the popular arts. His wife Pat soon became the manager of the press and was the driving force through its growth as the premier publishing outlet for academic books on popular culture until her retirement in 2002. At that point the Popular Press was acquired by the University of Wisconsin Press. In 1969, Browne founded and began to develop the Popular Culture Library at B.G.S.U. This library now holds 190,000 catalogued books and many hundreds of thousands of additional materials (e.g., comic books, fanzines, photos, games, postcards, posters). It is one of the most important collections of popular culture artifacts in the world. The library is now named the Ray and Pat Browne Popular Culture Library. In 1970, Browne founded the Popular Culture Association as an organization to promote the study of popular culture. In 1979, he founded the American Culture Association to promote specifically the study of American culture, and the same year was founding editor of the Journal of American Culture. In 1971, Browne organized the first national conference of the Popular Culture Association. This conference showcased the broad conceptual thinking and foundational ideas that would lead to the widespread teaching of popular culture at American and international universities. The conference grew quickly in size and participation, and for many years has featured the presentation of more than 2000 academic papers at each conference. The 2009 conference in New Orleans marked the 39th annual conference. In 1979, Browne helped organize the first national conference of the American Culture Association. This conference is held in conjunction with the Popular Culture Association Conference and marked its 30th anniversary with the 2009 conference. Browne had numerous colleagues with whom he worked in developing the academic study of popular culture, including Russel B. Nye of Michigan State University, Marshall Fishwick of Virginia Tech, Carl Bode of the University of Maryland, John Cawelti of the University of Chicago, Michael Marsden of Bowling Green State University (now Academic Vice President at St. Norbert College), Daniel Walden of Penn State University, and Peter Rollins of Oklahoma State University. Works Ray Browne's works through the years laid the conceptual foundations for the study of popular culture. Among his key foundational works are his essay \\"Popular Culture: Notes Toward a Definition\\", which first appeared in the book Popular Culture and Curricula (1972, edited by Ray Browne and Ronald Ambrosetti), and books such as Popular Culture and the Expanding Consciousness (1973), Challenges in American Culture (1970, with Larry Landrum and W.K. Bottorff), The Popular Culture Explosion (1972, with David Madden), Heroes of Popular Culture (1972, with Marshall Fishwick and Michael Marsden), Icons of Popular Culture (1970, with Marshall Fishwick), Icons of America (1978, with Marshall Fishwick), Rituals and Ceremonies in Popular Culture (1980), Objects of Special Devotion: Fetishism in Popular Culture (1982), Against Academia (Popular Press, 1989; a semi-autobiographical book), Dominant Symbols in Popular Culture (1990, with Marshall Fishwick and Kevin O. Browne), Continuities in Popular Culture: The Present in the Past & the Past in the Present and Future (1993, with Ronald Ambrosetti), Popular Culture Studies Across the Curriculum (2005), Profiles of Popular Culture: A Reader (2005), and Mission Underway: The History of the Popular Culture Association/American Culture Association and the Popular Culture Movement 1967‚Äì2001 (2002). Other books of note by Ray Browne include Melville's Drive to Humanism (1971), Popular Beliefs and Practices from Alabama (1958), Dimensions of Detective Fiction (1976, with Larry Landrum and Pat Browne), A Night With the Hants & Other Alabama Folk Experiences (1976), The Many Tongues of Literacy (1992), Ordinary Reactions to Extraordinary Events (2001, with Arthur Neal), The Detective as Historian: History and Art in Historical Crime Fiction (2000, with Lawrence Kreiser), and The Guide to United States Popular Culture (2001, with Pat Browne), among many others. Browne also published hundreds of essays and articles in academic journals and published hundreds of book reviews, most notably in the Journal of American Culture. International conferences and travel As a means of promoting the academic study of popular culture internationally, Ray and Pat Browne organized numerous conferences in the United Kingdom from 1978 until 2001. These included a 1978 conference at Chichester, a 1980 conference at Winchester, 1993 at York, 1995 at Oxford, 1997 at York, 1999 at Cambridge, and 2001 at Cambridge. In addition to their international conferences, Ray and Pat made two round-the-world trips on behalf of the U.S. State Department to promote the study of American popular culture. Their travels led them to the Soviet Union, India, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand. The term \\"popular culture\\" Ray Browne was credited with coining the term \\"popular culture\\" in 1967; however, he did not originate this term.Although the Oxford English Dictionary lists the first use as 1854, it appears in an address by Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi in 1818: In 1973, Browne created the first academic program dedicated to studying popular culture at Bowling Green University. Browne created this program because he wanted to know the effects of society on culture and the effects of culture on society. Browne stressed to scholars that it was important to learn about the irrelevant changes in peoples' lives. However, many scholars criticized Browne for trying to belittle their teachings when he created the \\"popular culture department\\". Browne's work inspired other universities to offer classes that explore popular culture. Publicity Browne's work in popular culture was recognized not only in academia, but also by news organizations. Through the years he appeared twice on the CBS Evening News, twice on the Phil Donahue Show, twice on the Geraldo Rivera Show, and on BBC News, and was quoted in hundreds of magazines and newspapers including Newsweek, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Chicago Tribune, People, and many others. Personal life and death Browne married Olwyn Carmen Orde in 1952. They had three children: Glenn (born 1956), Kevin (born 1958), and Rowan (born 1961). Olwyn and Rowan were killed in an automobile accident in 1964. Browne was re-married in 1965 to Alice Maxine (Pat) Matthews (born 1932). They had a daughter, Alicia (born 1967). Pat helped Browne develop the popular culture movement through her management of the Popular Press and her role as a principal organizer of the Popular Culture Association and American Culture Association conferences and the international popular culture conferences from the 1970s until her retirement in 2002. She also edited the scholarly journal Clues: A Journal of Detection for many years. Ray and Pat together edited the compendium volume The Guide to United States Popular Culture (Popular Press, 2001). Ray and Pat Browne lived in retirement in Bowling Green, Ohio where Browne continued to write and serve as book review editor for the Journal of American Culture until his death. Browne died in his home in Bowling Green, Ohio on October 22, 2009.

Plot At St. Mary's College, a boarding school for girls located just outside Boston, Massachusetts, a lonely, gaunt, unattractive student, named Kathy (Milijana Zirojevic), becomes the center of a cruel practical joke perpetrated by a gang of students and the hunky, but sadistic gym teacher, Fred Vernon (Riccardo Acerbi). Kathy is tricked into going on a date with Mr. Vernon, but when she over eagerly makes her move onto him in his parked car in the woods, the students appear in their cars to taunt her. Running away from several carloads of her tormentors, Kathy runs onto a busy street where she immediately gets hit by an oncoming car and is admitted to the local hospital in a coma. Kathy's strange mother, Mary, continues to gloom around the school in her capacity as a cleaner. Some time later, a new girl named Eva Gordon (Lara Naszinski), arrives at the school where she is shown around by the stern headmistress Miss Jones, and given Kathy's old room. Eva becomes acquainted with several of the perpetrators of the stunt. It is soon revealed (to the viewers only) that Eva is Kathy. Eva has somehow been possessed by the spirit of the comatose Kathy who begins using supernatural powers of telekinesis and magic to exact revenge against all those involved in the prank that put her in a coma. The first victim is Mr. Vernon, who asks Eva on a date. That night while waiting for Eva to show up at the gym for their secret rendezvous, the narcissist Mr. Vernon is attacked and strangled by his own reflection when it jumps out of a mirror. The following morning, the police detective on the scene (director Lucio Fulci) concludes that Mr. Vernon died of a heart attack. The following night, Virginia Williams (Kathi Wise), one of the students involved in the prank against Kathy, is attacked in her bed and suffocated to death by an onslaught of snails that appear and then disappear. Again the police do not have any explanation for the mysterious death. Meanwhile, the neurologist in charge of Kathy's case, Dr. Robert Anderson (Jared Martin), notices that Kathy's vital signs increase in step with each of the mysterious deaths at the school. But he cannot make a connection to it. The next morning, Dr. Anderson is called to the school to examine Eva when she has a violent breathing fit during a class. During that same time, Kathy's respirator temporally breaks down which leads to Eva's respiratory attack, but nobody makes any connection to it. Afterward, the strange Eva comes on strong to Dr. Anderson, leading him to ask her on a date where afterward she seduces him. During a field trip to a local art gallery, Grace, another one of Kathy's tormentors, returns to the gallery when it closes to search for a valuable piece of jewelry that she left behind on the day visit. A marble statue comes to life and falls down on her, crushing her to death. Dr. Anderson starts to become more apprehensive about the intense Eva. One evening, he suffers a horrible nightmare where she kills him after sex. He's relieved when Eva's mother arrives at the school to take her home for some rest. Eva begins to write obsessive love notes to him, but he brushes them off. Soon, Anderson becomes involved with another girl, named Jenny Clark (Ulli Reinthaler), the only student who shows any remorse for the prank gone wrong against Kathy. Eva runs away from home and returns to the school after dark. Eva sets her eyes on Kim (Sophie D'Aulan), one of Kathy's cruelest tormentors. As Kim is preparing to meet her boyfriend, Tom, for a date, Eva makes Kim see horrific visions of Tom being decapitated at every turn. Kim suffers an anxiety attack and in attempting to flee from the gory visions, plummets out of a third-floor window to her death. Tom arrives seconds later, looks out an open window, and sees Kim lying dead on the pavement below. Tom is decapitated when Eva commands the window blind to fall down on his neck. Eva quietly leaves the building while Kathy's mother, Mary, watches from a distance. At the hospital, Jenny arrives for a late-night date with Dr. Anderson, when she gets lost in the gloomily lit building, thanks to Eva using Kathy's magic skills of mind bending. Jenny ends up in the morgue where she encounters Eva. The possessed girl grabs a scalpel and threatens to kill Jenny for taking away her man, but Anderson arrives in time to intercept the slash of the scalpel but gets badly slashed on his forearm. As Eva rises the scalpel to stab them both, she suddenly freezes, gasps for a few seconds, and falls to the floor dead. Upstairs in Kathy's hospital room, her mother has pulled out all her intravenous drips, removed the respirator and turned off the life support systems. Appalled at the supernatural malice of her comatose daughter, Mary has somehow figured out of Kathy's connection to Eva and has decided to put her daughter to rest. Kathy's soul rises out of her body as a bright blue light, floats out a nearby window, and disappears into the night sky.

Fulci acknowledged the influence of Carrie when making the film, declaring it \\"one of my best films of recent years\\" and that it was \\"a sort of Carrie in which there are two characters\\" Lara Naszinski was cast as Eva in the film after Ettore Spanuolo's production company contacted her. Aenigma was shot on location in Sarajevo. Some sources state that the film had location work done in Massachusetts, but the lead actors insisted that everything was shot in Sarajevo. For the Italian film journal \\"Nocturno\\", cinematographer Luigi Ciccarese stated that Fulci was a maestro, who sometimes did things that at first did not seem to make sense - until one saw the results. Ciccarese further remembered that it was Fulci who came up with all the gimmicks and effects, and that he himself would have never thought of shooting a scene with the snails. Release Aenigma was released in Italy on 15 August 1988. Reception From contemporary reviews, Philip Nutman and Mario Cortini wrote in Gorezone that Aenigma lacked an original premise while \\"Fulci enlivens the mundane proceedings with a handful of ultragory scenes, include a naked girl violated by an army of slugs and snails.\\" From retrospective reviews, Donald C Willis wrote in his book Horror and Science Fiction Film IV, that the film as an \\"episodic horror-fantasy variation on Carrie by way of Patrick and The Medusa Touch\\" and that the \\"heavy-handed intro\\" makes the film get \\"off to a bad start\\". In his biography on Fulci, Troy Howarth noted that Aenigma was an uneven film specifically noting poor cinematography by Luigi Ciccarese, which he felt was derivative of Argento's Phenomena. In 1999, Italian film critic Marco Giusti wrote that Fulci himself saw Aenigma as a transitional film. Giusti remembers that the fans expected Fulci's return to the gore of the early 1980s, but that the film was not wholly successful since it was too similar to many others with its frightened girls and college slashings.

Mark started his playing career in 1963 with the United States Navy Band in Washington D.C. and later played lead trumpet with the band's jazz ensemble, The Commodores, from 1967 to 1970. In 1973 Mark joined the trumpet section of Maynard Ferguson's rock-influenced big band and was promoted to lead trumpet within a few months. Mark was visible within the band by his distinctive afro hairstyle and black trumpet. Despite constant personnel changes, Mark remained a fixture with the band until he was fired in 1982, although he maintained a cordial relationship with Ferguson until Ferguson's death in 2006. Following his departure from the Ferguson band in 1982, Mark began leading a big band of his own in Orlando, recording the album Here's Stan Mark on the Progressive Records label. The band backed numerous singers and appeared on tour as the Nelson Riddle Orchestra and the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra. Mark taught and performed in clinics in high schools and Universities around the world. In early 1993 Stan began touring the United States as lead trumpet player with the Glenn Miller Orchestra. Mark also played lead trumpet with the Sorta Dixie Jazz Band/Gold Coast Orchestra from 1993 to 1996. While in Las Vegas, Mark led a Swing Band, the Sin City SuitZ. In 2002, Mark relocated from Las Vegas to the Rogue Valley of Southern Oregon, leading both a big band and a smaller group called the Rogue Valley SuitZ. Mark largely retired from the music business in 2005, although he did perform as a soloist and ensemble member at Maynard Ferguson's memorial service in St. Louis, MO on September 20, 2006.

The impeachment was related to a struggle between President Umaru Yar'Adua and Plateau State Governor, Jonah Jang over a sectarian crisis in Jos, the Plateau State capital. Emmanuel Go‚Äôar was elected to the Plateau State Assembly in 2007 as the People's Democratic Party (PDP) candidate and made Speaker of the House. In November 2007, his election was nullified on the basis that the ballots omitted the logo of the rival Democratic People's Party (DPP), but he retained his seat during the subsequent appeal process. In March 2008, the Plateau State House of Assembly gave governor Jonah Jang the power to appoint caretaker committee chairmen for local councils. The governor planned to swear in Peoples Democratic Party candidates for the council positions. The Conference of Nigeria Political Parties took a protest letter to Emmanuel Go‚Äôar as Speaker of the Assembly. The police sealed the premises of the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) because of its plans to demonstrate against the decision. In October 2008, Emmanuel Go'ar read a letter from governor Jonah Jang asking the House of Assembly to dissolve the caretaker local government committees, to be followed by elections. In December 2008, following riots during the council elections in which over 300 people died, the house of Assembly passed a resolution signed by Emmanuel Go‚Äôar that called for tolerance between Christians and Muslims in the state and praised the Federal and the Plateau State governments for their prompt intervention in forestalling the spread of the crisis. In January 2009, after 26 suspected mercenaries arrested in Plateau State were transferred to the Force Criminal Investigation Department, Abuja, Emmanuel Go'ar said the house was setting up the committee to conduct an investigation into the crisis and to correct defects in the local electoral laws, if any. Go'ar was impeached in February 2009 after 17 of the 24 members of the Assembly signed a petition alleging that he was incompetent, although he remained a member of the Assembly. After his impeachment, Go'ar was replaced as speaker by Istifanus Caleb Mwansat. In April 2009, the appellate court dismissed Go'ar's appeal against the November 2007 ruling that nullified his election. However, he won the re-run election in June 2009. As a strong supporter of Governor Jonah Jang, Go'ar's reelection meant that a faction in the Plateau State assembly considering impeaching the governor lacked the necessary 2/3 majority.

This program was CMT's first original comedy series and was nominated for two Gemini Awards. The program starred Phyllis Ellis as Helena Delaney, a fortyish network executive for a struggling country music television station run by her former lover. The series provides a tongue-in-cheek look at the music industry, as Helena strives to improve network ratings and prove herself as the new boss. Her attempts generally result in humiliation, and witty, but subtle, remarks from the network staff. The staff is an ensemble cast of characters, including Joel Stewart, Helena's work-nemesis, comedic foil, and eventual love-interest, who is a genuine music lover, and views Helena as a sell-out; Rusty Katz (Jordan McClosky), and Calvin Bates (Paul Snepsts), the sarcastic on-air personalities. Ellis Dukes (George Komorowski) is Helena's boss and former lover who is now dating Amber (series writer Adriana Maggs), his much younger assistant. Mick McCafferty (series director Steve Cochrane) is a talent agent whose views on status and corporate-climbing mirror Helena's and lead to a mutual attraction. Mick represents Tommy Mountain, an up-and-coming Iraqi singer. The show is a spin-off of the CMT's TV series The Wilkinsons, in which Ellis also appeared as the character of Helena. Many real life musicians made cameo appearances on the show. The satirical style of the show, and its ensemble cast has drawn online comparisons to The Office . The show was executive produced and created by Steve Cochrane, who directed the majority of episodes and Adriana Maggs, who is credited as the writer on all ten episodes.

Roxcy Bolton with Eleanor Roosevelt after Roosevelts address at the Democratic National Convention in 1956. Personal life Bolton was born on June 3, 1926, in Duck Hill, MS, a small town of several hundred. At a young age, she had ambitions to be a Member of Congress. When she was 10, she witnessed the lynching of two black men, which was also witnessed by her whole town. Growing up Bolton was a member of the Daughters of the Confederacy. Bolton graduated from high school and moved to Miami. She married William Charles Hart, a Coast Guardsman at the time. They had a son, Randall, who died in 2000. They divorced after five years together. When first settling in Miami, Bolton worked an office job and joined the Young Democrats. In 1960, she married Commander David Bolton, USN, who later acted as president of Men for ERA. For a time, they lived in Japan and South Carolina, but by 1964 they had settled in Coral Gables, FL. They had three children together, Bonnie Dee Bolton, David Bolton Jr., and Baron \\"Buddy\\" Bolton. Bolton was a dedicated Democrat for all of her adult life. Career in activism Bolton dedicated her life to activism. While she preferred civil conversation, when it failed she was willing to be confrontational. Bolton became civically active in the 1950s. She was greatly influenced by Eleanor Roosevelt after hearing her address to the Democratic National Convention of 1956. In 1966, Bolton helped form Florida's National Organization for Women, serving as charter president of the Miami Chapter and National Vice President in 1969. Also in 1969, she successfully challenged the practice that many store restaurants had of keeping a separate \\"men only\\" section. In 1972, she founded Women in Distress, a shelter for battered and homeless women. In the same year, she led six women to take over the office of the University of Miami president to demand promotion of more women to department-head positions, pay equality, and more. Also in 1972, she encouraged President Nixon to issue a proclamation honoring Women's Equality Day, which he did. His proclamation was presented to her in recognition of her encouragement. Bolton was an active supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment and persuaded Senator Birch Bayh to introduce the Amendment to Congress. Bolton led the effort to create the Women‚Äôs Park in Miami, which opened in 1992 as the first outdoor space in America honoring past and present women leaders. Bolton suffered a stroke in 1998 that slowed down her activism. In 1994, Bolton donated her personal papers and photos to the State Archives of Florida. A collection of her artifacts are also owned by the Museum of Florida History. Her Coral Gables home was dedicated as a Florida Heritage Site in 1999. In 2014, the National Women's History Project celebrated Bolton as a National Women's History Month Honoree. Bolton is also credited with the opening of the influential and political Tiger Bay Club to women. In another pioneering effort, Bolton initiated the Rehabilitation Program for Young Prostitutes in the Miami-Dade County. The program offered educational opportunities to incarcerated prostitutes and attempted to keep the women off the streets and out of drugs. Bolton also persuaded National Airlines to grant maternity leave to pregnant flight attendants rather than firing them. In her career as an activist, she fought for a variety of issues including: anti-rape, renaming hurricanes, equal pay, public breastfeeding, access to military academies for women, ending sexist advertising, maternity leave, ending segregation, and better refugee treatment.  Anti-rape activism  In 1971, Bolton lead the nation's first \\"march against rape.\\" She gathered 100 businesswomen, political leaders, activists, housewives and a few men and led them through downtown Miami to the courthouse. In 1974, she founded the nation's first Rape Treatment Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, later renamed the Roxcy Bolton Rape Treatment Center in 1993. The center served as the prototype for many centers that followed its establishment. That same year she organized Florida's first Crime Watch meeting to help stem crime against women. She was also instrumental in bringing several rape cases to the attention of the public, despite police concerns. She elevated the prevention and treatment of rape into priorities for law enforcement and health professionals. She was inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame in 1984 for \\"forcing police and prosecutors to make rape crime a priority\\".\\"Honoring Dr. Jeana Brunson\\". The United States House of Representatives. February 10, 2009. Retrieved September 23, 2009.  Hurricane renaming  She challenged N.O.A.A (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) to change the names of hurricanes to include the names of men. Government forecasters had adopted the old naval tradition in 1953. Twenty-six years after its adaptation and ten years after presenting her issue, weathermen finally eliminated the practice with the second hurricane of 1979 being named Bob.  Controversy  In 1976, Bolton left NOW due to their creation of a lesbian caucus. She held to the idea that the organization and its members held \\"responsibilities to family and children.\\" Death Bolton died on the morning of May 17, 2017 at Doctor's Hospital in Coral Gables, Florida at the age of 90.

On February 19, 2009, SIC ventured off in its first ever large-scale European tour starting with Norway where the band played six gigs, supported by Norwegian metal act Goddamn. The tour continued On April 2 with the band providing live support for Danish act Hatesphere on their \\"Alive and Dressed To The Nines Tour 2009\\"TheMusicHotWire.com - \\"SIC Continues European Tour\\" which counted twenty six shows throughout Germany,BloodChamber.de - Live Report (29.04.2009)Metal.de - Live Report (29.04.2009)ThrashAndRiot.com - Live Report (14.04.2009) Austria, Denmark , The Netherlands,MetalRage.com - Live Report (02.05.2009) Slovenia, Slovakia , Switzerland and the Czech Republic.

After the entire tour was over, the band returned to the Faroe Islands in early June 2009 to perform at several local summer festivals, such as the prestigious G! Festival and Vi√∞ M√∫rin.  2010‚Äìpresent: \\"Fighters They Bleed\\"  In late December 2009, Magnus Hansen departed from SIC in order to take some time off to sort out personal matters. Later SIC announced that the temporary replacement of Magnus Hansen would be Dennis Buhl (Evil Masquerade, ex Hatesphere). On August 21 the band released its second album, tentatively titled, \\"Fighters They Bleed\\" Which is also the title for one of their new songs. The album was mixed and mastered at Antfarm Studios, in √Örhus, Denmark, by Tue Madsen. Tue has also been working with metal bands such as Dark Tranquillity and Hatesphere.

Released in October 2004, the work is the result of a ten-year collaboration between the Newberry Library and the Chicago Historical Society. It exists in both a hardcover print edition and an online format, known as the Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago. The print edition is 1117 pages and includes 1400 entries, 2000 biographical sketches, 250 significant business enterprise descriptions, and hundreds of maps. Initially, the internet edition included 1766 entries, 1000 more images and sources. The concept was fueled by other regional encyclopedias that had met with commercial success in 1980s and 1990s. Eventually, the vision to create the book found initial financing from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The book was well received and became a bestseller during the 2004 Christmas season following its October 2004 release. The following May the Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago was released. Northwestern University joined the Newberry Library/Chicago Historical Society collaboration to publish the internet edition. The internet edition was the second of its kind for a U.S. city. Details Individual entries were compiled by historians, graduate assistants and authors. Most contributors were professors. About 600 people contributed entries at a rate of $.10/per word. The contributors consulted reliable secondary sources, such as newspapers, to compile historical accounts. The book was edited by James R. Grossman, Ann Durkin Keating, and Janice L. Reiff. At the time, Grossman was the vice president for research and education at the Newberry Library and visiting professor of history at the University of Chicago. Keating was a professor of history at North Central College. Reiff was an associate professor of history at the University of California, Los Angeles. Unlike resource compilation efforts for the cities that inspired this encyclopedia, the work was not bounded by the city limits. Instead, every suburb was provided an entry, as were each of Chicago's 77 official community areas. Entries ranged from 50 to 4000 words long. Eventually, the coverage of the subject matter expanded to include Southwest Michigan and Northwest Indiana. Newberry Library describes the work as \\"one of the most significant historical projects undertaken in the last twenty years\\". History Inspired by encyclopedia compilation efforts of cities such as New York City, Indianapolis and Cleveland, Keating approached the Newberry Library in 1991 to strategize on how to best to study and teach Chicago history. Eventually she and Grossman agreed to prepare a funding request from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). Their initial proposal was declined, but after working with Grossman to refine the specifics of their proposal, the NEH accepted their idea. The book venture was originally announced in 1994 as a project funded by a NEH US$200,000 ($ today) grant. The grant also included a $300,000 challenge grant to be met by Newberry Library for the first three years of work. The original plan was to publish a hardcover book by 2001 and then to follow with what at the time was referred to vaguely as \\"hypermedia\\" in reference to possible internet and CD-ROM auxiliary products. After Grossman and Keating obtained the initial grant, Reiff, a computer technology expert, and encyclopedia veteran Carol J. Summerfield all became part of the team. The editors sought the advice of Chicago-area librarians who were organized into focus groups to determine the proper components for the planned publication. The editors also organized into task forces of experts in dozens of specialized fields. Early on they sought the expertise of University of Chicago cartographer Michael P. Conzen, who helped develop 56 original maps. Conzen is credited as the cartographic editor. By 1997, the text had taken shape and the plan was that the average biographical entry would be 150 words. The longest biographical entries, about 450 words, were written for former Chicago Mayors Harold Washington and Richard J. Daley. Neither Richard M. Daley nor Michael Jordan had entries because only notable deceased persons were included. By 1998, the editors had settled on the table of contents and begun the job of assigning, editing, fact-checking and re-editing the hundreds of entries, some of them as long as 4000 words. By March 2000, 1100 of the targeted 1400 entries were completed. Also, the growth of the internet had clarified the vision of an online version of the print edition. In 2000, the final volume was expected to be 1300 pages set for release in fall 2002. The internet version was expected the following year. By June 2001, nearly 1300 of the entries had been submitted and a third had been edited and reviewed for accuracy. The effort had become a $2.5 million effort and was aspiring towards the success of earlier encyclopedic efforts projecting a fall 2003 publication of a 1.3-million-word 1300-page edition. At this time, the final electronic form available through the Chicago Historical Society had been conceptualized. Public release By 2001, two editions of The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History (1987) had sold 24,000 copies; The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis (1994) had sold 9000 copies and The Encyclopedia of New York City (1995) had sold 70,000 (50,000 in its first year). Hardcover versions of these works had sold for $59.95 and up. The commercial success of these other regional encyclopedias made it clear that there is a market for such products. Several university presses released regional encyclopedic publications in 2004. In April, Rutgers University Press published The Encyclopedia of New Jersey. In September, the University of Nebraska Press published Encyclopedia of the Great Plains. In October, the University of Chicago Press released The Encyclopedia of Chicago. Additionally, Yale University Press was scheduled to publish both Encyclopedia of New England and the second edition of The Encyclopedia of New York City. Using press releases from the Copley News Service, the book was widely publicized throughout the state of Illinois, and it was even reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. When first published in 2004, the book was on the USA Today recommended Christmas gifts list. That year it was at the top of the Chicago area bestseller lists at bookstores during the Christmas holiday season. Major funding for the $65 list price four-color print version of the publication, which cost $1.7 million in the end, was provided by the NEH, the MacArthur Foundation, the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois. Electronic edition At the time of the print release, the online version, known as the Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago, was being developed to include additional features, which relied on hyperlinks, that were not available in the print edition. At the time, it was expected to be released by the Chicago Historical Society in April 2005. On May 11, the Electronic edition, which cost nearly $1 million to create and is continuously available for free to the public, was released. It included hundreds of additional entries (bringing the total to 1766), more than 1000 additional images, video of historic figures and events, and extensive primary source material. The online version includes 1000 more sources than the print edition. The Web site includes many tables and maps that date to the 19th Century. Northwestern University media specialists developed the Web architecture for the electronic version. The electronic edition made Chicago the second major U.S. city (following Cleveland) with an extensive Internet encyclopedia dedicated to its history and its release was covered by newspapers throughout the Midwest. The extra features of the online edition would have required 10,000 pages to produce in print-edition format. Initially, the online edition was a static version, but updates and adjustments were planned. Critical review USA Today' referred to it as a good coffee table book. Chicago Tribune journalist Rick Kogan describes this as a massive undertaking with the natural foibles of the human element in it selections and accuracy, and by nature of its attempt to serve as a historical compilation an immediately dated product due to the dynamic nature of the city. However, he feels it is sure to amaze its audience. A Chicago Sun-Times reviewer describes it as a scholarly product that is \\"easily the most comprehensive reference book on the Chicago region ever published\\". The State Journal-Register, the Springfield, Illinois newspaper, reviewers complain that downstate cities and regions are neglected in the book. A Daily Herald review describes it as a book accurately \\"billed as the city's most definitive historical reference book\\". The Peoria Journal Star notes that although there are complaints about omissions and underserved topics, the online version should quell the demands for further knowledge. The online version was noted for its \\"large number of tables and maps that date to the 19th Century\\" by the Chicago Tribune. Dubuque, Iowa's Telegraph Herald newspaper and Indiana's Post-Tribune referenced an Associated Press press release that described the online version as a compilation assembled \\"with more than Chicagoans in mind\\". The Chicago Tribune described the online version as an extension of \\"the most comprehensive reference book on the Chicago region ever published\\" that is unlimited by physical bounds. Journal of American History along with the website History Matters: The U.S. Survey Course on the Web published a review by University of Southern California professor Philip J. Ethington that spoke glowingly about both versions of the encyclopedia describing it as \\"one of the finest collective works (with 633 listed authors) of North American historical scholarship of our era\\". They praised it for its breadth and coherence. The online version was noted for its meticulous hyperlinking. The online review was cursory in the sense that it did not realize the expansion of the online version. However, the review notes that the online version provides \\"powerful and substantive\\" interactive resources that are not possible in the print edition. The review is especially respectful of the cartographic contributions, which it describes in detail. It dismisses the alphabetical structure of the online version as an unnecessary complication. The review also complains about biographical omissions that necessitate extensive navigation to related articles. The review felt some of the online foibles left open the possibility that the production might get overshadowed by future ventures that leverage the electronic possibilities more fully. The Chronicle of Higher Education reviewed the Encyclopedia along with several of its peers and mentioned early in the review that the advent of online encyclopedias makes the works much easier to correct and update. However, the availability of online encyclopedias diminished the significance of the print editions according to the review because it made gifting them less significant and it reduced sales at libraries. The review also noted that the online approach is becoming so successful that the state of Georgia has produced the online-only New Georgia Encyclopedia, which started as a 300-article venture and has blossomed to a 1300-article work. However, they noted that when the Encyclopedia of Chicago was first released that the local media supported the book; some Chicago disc jockeys read passages from it on air. It enjoyed successful marketing as both a popular gift item and a must-have for local historians. Content The encyclopedia is composed of 1117 pages that feature over 1400 entries by more than 600 contributors. Additionally, it includes 442 maps, more than 400 vintage photographs, over 250 sketches of \\"historically significant business enterprises\\", a dictionary of Chicago-area businesses, a biographical dictionary and a 21-page timeline that traces the history of Chicago from 1630 to 2000. The 1400-entry main alphabetical section of the Encyclopedia covers all Chicago neighborhoods, suburbs, and ethnic groups as well as the major cultural institutions. Topics covered include technology and science, architecture, religions, immigration, transportation, business history, labor, music, health and medicine. It is considered the most geographical diverse city encyclopedia of its kind because it fully encompasses the suburbs in eight of the region's counties. 386 thumbnail maps of neighborhoods and municipalities are complemented by 400 black-and-white photographs plus hundreds of color photographs and thematic maps. There are separate lengthy interpretive essays woven into the alphabetical section on topics such as the built environment, literary images of Chicago, and the city's sports culture. The Encyclopedia includes a 2000-entry comprehensive biographical dictionary and a detailed listing of approximately 250 of the city's historically significant business enterprises. A color insert features a timeline of Chicago history and photo essays exploring nine pivotal years in this history. The photo essays feature the city‚Äôs urban art and artifacts.

Later he was employed by Napoleon, who awarded him the title Baron de l'Empire. It was about this time that van Heeckeren converted to Catholicism. For the Dutch government, Van Heeckeren was successively secretary of the legation at Lisbon (1814), Stockholm (1815‚Äì1817) and Berlin (1817 - 1822).\\"J.D.B.A. baron van Heeckeren tot Enghuizen\\" Parlement & Politiek In 1822 Van Heeckeren was the acting agent for the Dutch in St. Petersburg. From 1823 to May 1837 he was ambassador extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the court in St. Petersburg. From June 1842 to October 1875 he was ambassador extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the court in Vienna. Van Heeckeren was unmarried, but did not want his name to die with him. In St. Petersburg he came to know Georges d'Anth√®s, an officer in the Russian army and the son of a noble landowner in the French Alsace. After several letters and a visit to Georges‚Äôs father, Joseph Conrad d'Anth√®s, Jacob van Heeckeren requested that he be allowed to adopt Georges, giving him his name and the right to inherit his property. The old Baron d'Anth√®s accepted the offer, and, after the agreement of the King of the Netherlands by letters patent dated May 5, 1836, Georges- Charles d'Anth√®s took the name of Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anth√®s. Writers have suggested that the relationship between Jacob and Georges was more than that of adoptive father-son.Add to that brew the suspicions, current then and now, that d'Anthes and his adoptive father were lovers ...

He was also the great-grandfather of Nanos Valaoritis, one of the most distinguished writers of Greece. Biography Aristotelis Valaoritis' bust in his birthplace, Lefkada Bust in the National Garden, Athens He was born in Lefkada in 1824 to a Greek father of Epirotic descent. He completed his school education in Lefkada and Corfu. Afterwards he went to France and Italy to study law. He never worked as a lawyer though, but completely devoted himself to poetry. He spent an important part of his life in the small island of Madouri. At the age of 25 he married the daughter of the Venetian scholar Emilio De Tipaldo, Eloisa. Using simple language he wrote many poems regarding the Greek War of Independence. He was credited as a national poet. Some of his most important works are: Stichourgimata, Mnemosina, Kira Frosini, Athanasios Diakos, O Fotinos, Astrapogiannos. O Fotinos (or Der Helle in German), is a very famous unfinished poem relating the so-called Voukentra revolution of 1357 in Lefkada against the Venetian (Italian) occupation. Valaoritis composed this poem on the privately owned isle of Madouri. Meanwhile, he got into politics. As a member of the Parliament of the United States of the Ionian Islands he fought for the rights of the Ionian islands, such as the union with the Kingdom of Greece. Once the Ionian islands were united with Greece he moved to Athens, as a member of the Greek Parliament. His speeches were heavily influenced by his poetic language, making his rhetorical skills uniquely remarkable. The last years of his life, he developed action towards the integration of Epirus to Greece, a goal not fully achieved until the Balkan Wars. He died in Lefkada in 1879 due to heart failure.

It is from Suri. Overview Khustigiri is famous for the Dargah Sharif which is believed to be a place of learning, getting peace of mind, and becoming free from diseases and mental distress. This sacred place was established by the great Sufi saint Syed Shah Abdullah Kermani about 500 years ago for providing service to mankind, by the order of his spiritual master, Makhdoom Shah Arzani. The serene environment draws the minds of all irrespective of race, caste, creed and religion. The Sufi saint Abdullah Kermani (in short Kermani Baba) had established khankah, Jama Masjid, madrasah, langor khana, atithi shala, nahabat khana, library, charitable dispensary etc. for the service to mankind. In addition to these, the attractions of this place are the big and beautiful tomb of Kermani with double domes, sacred Gangagore, khas mahal, tombs of 14 Kazis, Hazrat Museum, historical tamarind tree, big dias, new minar, beautiful garden and the mazars of the descendants of Kermani. Several functions and ceremonies are held throughout the year. Many centres under this dargah are being opened in various parts of West Bengal. History It is said that a Muslim saint Saiyad Shah Abdullah Kirmani when young left Kirman in Iran his native country and visited a Muslim saint Shah Arzani, who died at Patna during the reign of Shah Jahan in 1630 AD. Shah Arzani directed him to go to Bengal and gave him a toothpick of chambeli wood. He told him to stay at the place where the toothpick became fresh and green. He arrived in Birbum and stayed at Bargaon, where he performed several miracles (karamat) but the toothpick remained unchanged. He then moved on to Khustigiri. There one morning he found the toothpick to have become fresh and green. He planted it and it soon became a large tree. Shah Abdullah is specially renowned for his power over serpents. His dargah is in the hands of his descendants and is visited by numerous pilgrims.O‚ÄôMalley, L.S.S., ICS, Birbhum, Bengal District Gazetteers, p. 132, first published 1910, 1996 reprint, Government of West Bengal Geography Location Khustigiri is located at .

It combines the usual two steps of the construction of printed circuit boards (PCBs) followed by the population process of placing various leaded and non-leaded electronic components into one process. The Occam process Electronic components are first positioned onto an adhesive layer of a temporary or permanent substrate according to the customers needs and design parameters. Then, the pre-tested, burned-in components are held firm in their positions through encapsulating them in insulating material and the entire assembly is then inverted. The adhesive layer is then cut (after removing the temporary substrate if it exists) or drilled out over the component leads mechanically or by laser ablation. These holes are then plated with a conductive, copper connection (vias) from the top of this layer to the leads. If needed, other encapsulation layers of components or vias can be placed on top of each other to make multi- level circuit connections. This construction is then coated with copper where needed to provide traces. Thus, this finished circuit board can now receive a conformal coating to protect against the environment, and then be placed into an assembly housing or be sent to another section for mechanical and/or electrical connections with other PCBs.\\"Robust, Simplified and Solder-Free Assembly Processing of Electronics Products, Verdant Electronics White Paper, Sunnyvale, CA, 2007 The process was named in reference to a quotation from William of Ockham (1288‚Äì1348), who said, \\"It is vanity to do with more that which can be done with less.\\" Main advantages The 2006, European, RoHS regulations prompted the research needed to move from traditional lead-based solder connection processes to a more environmentally friendly approach. Much manufacturing is currently being done with tin-based solder to address this issue. Using tin requires much higher reflow temperatures and can result in rework stages due to electric shorts caused by tin-whiskers (electrically conductive structures formed in this process) and other issues in the manufacturing process which are avoided by the Occam process. PCB‚Äôs themselves are usually created by use of a phenolic resin, itself a corrosive, toxic substance completely removed from the Occam process. Also, the nitric acid or ferric chloride used to etch traces into the boards is also removed from the process. Since the PCB and parts population stages happen in the same process in the same plant, a company would no longer need to wait for delivery of ordered PCB‚Äôs to begin manufacturing. The high temperatures usually seen by PCB‚Äôs inside of a reflow soldering oven are avoided by use of this process. This means that any issue of moisture sensitivity (MSL) in components by outgassing of moisture is completely avoided. This also then removes the storage equipment and processes needed to keep the moisture levels low in more intricate and expensive chips. Main disadvantages Currently though the process is set, it has not yet been implemented. It is defined as a ‚Äúdisruptive technology‚Äù requiring a complete change in current manufacturing processes. Therefore, cost concerns for manufacturers needing new equipment, labour concerns for current PCB manufactures and others will need to be solved or addressed before widespread adoption of this process. Although many toxic chemicals are removed from the traditional process, Occam‚Äôs increased use of encapsulation by epoxy could mean more of that sort of waste. The usual additives in epoxy have been shown to mimic estrogen, possibly resulting in adverse hormonal responses in humans.

An optical axis is a direction rather than a single line: all rays that are parallel to that direction exhibit the same lack of birefringence. Crystals may have a single optic axis, in which case they are uniaxial, or two different optic axes, in which case they are biaxial. Non-crystalline materials generally have no birefringence and thus, no optic axis. A uniaxial crystal (e.g. calcite, quartz) is isotropic within the plane orthogonal to the optic axis of the crystal. Explanation The internal structure of crystals (the specific structure of the crystal lattice, and the specific atoms or molecules of which it is composed) causes the speed of light in the material, and therefore the material's refractive index, to depend on both the light's direction of propagation and its polarization. The dependence on polarization causes birefringence, in which two perpendicular polarizations propagate at different speeds and refract at different angles in the crystal. This causes a ray of light to split into an ordinary ray and an extraordinary ray, with orthogonal polarizations. For light propagating along an optic axis, though, the speed does not depend on the polarization, so there is no birefringence although there can be optical activity (a rotation of the plane of polarization). The refractive index of the ordinary ray is constant for any direction in the crystal. The refractive index of the extraordinary ray varies depending on its direction. Liquid crystal directors The mobile axis of a liquid crystal is called a director. It is the space and time average of the orientation of the long molecular axis within a small volume element of material demonstrating a mesophase.

Its high efficiency is derived from the \\"Z element\\" inside the square that acts as a metamaterial, greatly boosting the radiated signal. The square is 30 millimeters on a side. Metamaterial antennas are a class of antennas which use metamaterials to increase performance of miniaturized (electrically small) antenna systems.Slyusar V. I. 60 Years of Electrically Small Antennas Theory.//Proceedings of the 6-th International Conference on Antenna Theory and Techniques, 17‚Äì21 September 2007, Sevastopol, Ukraine. - Pp. 116 - 118. Their purpose, as with any electromagnetic antenna, is to launch energy into free space. However, this class of antenna incorporates metamaterials, which are materials engineered with novel, often microscopic, structures to produce unusual physical properties. Antenna designs incorporating metamaterials can step-up the antenna's radiated power. Conventional antennas that are very small compared to the wavelength reflect most of the signal back to the source. A metamaterial antenna behaves as if it were much larger than its actual size, because its novel structure stores and re-radiates energy. Established lithography techniques can be used to print metamaterial elements on a PC board. Some content is derived from Public Domain material on the NIST web site. * These novel antennas aid applications such as portable interaction with satellites, wide angle beam steering, emergency communications devices, micro-sensors and portable ground-penetrating radars to search for geophysical features. Some applications for metamaterial antennas are wireless communication, space communications, GPS, satellites, space vehicle navigation and airplanes.  Antennas designs  Antenna designs incorporating metamaterials can step-up the radiated power of an antenna. The newest metamaterial antennas radiate as much as 95 percent of an input radio signal. Standard antennas need to be at least half the size of the signal wavelength to operate efficiently. At 300 MHz, for instance, an antenna would need to be half a meter long. In contrast, experimental metamaterial antennas are as small as one-fiftieth of a wavelength, and could have further decreases in size. Metamaterials are a basis for further miniaturization of microwave antennas, with efficient power and acceptable bandwidth. Antennas employing metamaterials offer the possibility of overcoming restrictive efficiency- bandwidth limitations for conventionally constructed, miniature antennas. Metamaterials permit smaller antenna elements that cover a wider frequency range, thus making better use of available space for space-constrained cases. In these instances, miniature antennas with high gain are significantly relevant because the radiating elements are combined into large antenna arrays. Furthermore, metamaterials' negative refractive index focuses electromagnetic radiation by a flat lens versus being dispersed.  * Metamaterials '2009 ‚Äì Sessions * Proceedings of the Virtual Institute for Artificial Electromagnetic Materials and Metamaterials  The DNG shell  The earliest research in metamaterial antennas was an analytical study of a miniature dipole antenna surrounded with a metamaterial. This material is known variously as a negative index metamaterial (NIM) or double negative metamaterial (DNG) among other names. This configuration analytically and numerically appears to produce an order of magnitude increase in power. At the same time, the reactance appears to offer a corresponding decrease. Furthermore, the DNG shell becomes a natural impedance matching network for this system.  Ground plane applications  Metamaterials employed in the ground planes surrounding antennas offer improved isolation between radio frequency, or microwave channels of (multiple-input multiple-output) (MIMO) antenna arrays.Slyusar V.I. Metamaterials on antenna solutions.// 7th International Conference on Antenna Theory and Techniques ICATT‚Äô09, Lviv, Ukraine, October 6‚Äì9, 2009. - Pp. 19 - 24 Metamaterial, high-impedance groundplanes can also improve radiation efficiency and axial ratio performance of low-profile antennas located close to the ground plane surface. Metamaterials have also been used to increase beam scanning range by using both the forward and backward waves in leaky wave antennas. Various metamaterial antenna systems can be employed to support surveillance sensors, communication links, navigation systems and command and control systems.  Novel configurations  Besides antenna miniaturization, the novel configurations have potential applications ranging from radio frequency devices to optical devices. Other combinations, for other devices in metamaterial antenna subsystems are being researched. Either double negative metamaterial slabs are used exclusively or combinations of double positive (DPS) with DNG slabs, or epsilon-negative (ENG) slabs with mu-negative (MNG) slabs are employed in the subsystems. Antenna subsystems that are currently being researched include cavity resonators, waveguides, scatters and antennas (radiators). Metamaterial antennas were commercially available by 2009.  History  Pendry et al. were able to show that a three-dimensional array of intersecting, thin wires could be used to create negative values of permittivity (or \\"Œµ\\"), and that a periodic array of copper split ring resonators could produce an effective negative magnetic permeability (or \\"Œº\\") In May 2000, a group of researchers, Smith et al. were the first to successfully combine the split-ring resonator (SRR), with thin wire conducting posts and produce a left-handed material that had negative values of Œµ, Œº and refractive index for frequencies in the gigahertz or microwave range. In 2002, a different class of negative refractive index (NRI) metamaterials was introduced that employs periodic reactive loading of a 2-D transmission line as the host medium. This configuration used positive index (DPS) material with negative index material (DNG). It employed a small, planar, negative- refractive-lens interfaced with a positive index, parallel-plate waveguide. This was experimentally verified soon after. Although some SRR inefficiencies were identified, they continued to be employed as of 2009 for research. SRRs have been involved in wide-ranging metamaterial research, including research on metamaterial antennas. A more recent view is that by using SRRs as building blocks, the electromagnetic response and associated flexibility is practical and desirable.  Phase compensation due to negative refraction  DNG can provide phase compensation due to their negative index of refraction. This is accomplished by combining a slab of conventional lossless DPS material with a slab of lossless DNG metamaterial. DPS has a conventional positive index of refraction, while the DNG has a negative refractive index. Both slabs are impedance-matched to the outside region (e.g., free space). The desired monochromatic plane wave is radiated on this configuration. As this wave propagates through the first slab of material a phase difference emerges between the exit and entrance faces. As the wave propagates through the second slab the phase difference is significantly decreased and even compensated for. Therefore, as the wave exits the second slab the total phase difference is equal to zero. With this system a phase-compensated, waveguiding system could be produced. By stacking slabs of this configuration, the phase compensation (beam translation effects) would occur throughout the entire system. Furthermore, by changing the index of any of the DPS-DNG pairs, the speed at which the beam enters the front face, and exits the back face of the entire stack-system changes. In this manner, a volumetric, low loss, time delay transmission line could be realized for a given system. Furthermore, this phase compensation can lead to a set of applications, which are miniaturized, subwavelength, cavity resonators, and waveguides with applications below diffraction limits.  Transmission line dispersion compensation  Because of DNG's dispersive nature as a transmission medium, it could be useful as a dispersion compensation device for time-domain applications. The dispersion produces a variance of the group speed of the signals' wave components, as they propagate in the DNG medium. Hence, stacked DNG metamaterials could be useful for modifying signal propagation along a microstrip transmission line. At the same time, dispersion leads to distortion. However, if the dispersion could be compensated for along the microstrip line, RF or microwave signals propagating along them would significantly decrease distortion. Therefore, components for attenuating distortion become less critical, and could lead to simplification of many systems. Metamaterials can eliminate dispersion along the microstrip by correcting for the frequency dependence of the effective permittivity. The strategy is to design a length of metamaterial-loaded transmission line that can be introduced with the original length of microstrip line to make the paired system dispersionless creating a dispersion-compensating segment of transmission line. This could be accomplished by introducing a metamaterial with a specific localized permittivity and a specific localized magnetic permeability, which then affects the relative permittivity and permeability of the overall microstrip line. It is introduced so that the wave impedance in the metamaterial remains unhanged. The index of refraction in the medium compensates for the dispersion effects associated with the microstrip geometry itself; making the effective refractive index of the pair that of free space. Part of the design strategy is that the effective permittivity and permeability of such a metamaterial should be negative ‚Äì requiring a DNG material.  Innovation  Combining left-handed segments with a conventional (right-handed) transmission line results in advantages over conventional designs. Left-handed transmission lines are essentially a high-pass filter with phase advance. Conversely, right-handed transmission lines are a low-pass filter with phase lag. This configuration is designated composite right/left-handed (CRLH) metamaterial.UCLA Technology. Backfire to Endfire Leaky wave antenna. 2003. The conventional Leaky Wave antenna has had limited commercial success because it lacks complete backfire-to-endfire frequency scanning capability. The CRLH allowed complete backfire-to-endfire frequency scanning, including broadside.  Microwave lens  The metamaterial lens, found in metamaterial antenna systems, is used as an efficient coupler to external radiation, focusing radiation along or from a microstrip transmission line into transmitting and receiving components. Hence, it can be used as an input device. In addition, it can enhance the amplitude of evanescent waves, as well as correct the phase of propagating waves.  Directing radiation  In this instance an SRR uses layers of a metallic mesh of thin wires ‚Äì with wires in the three directions of space and slices of foam. This material's permittivity above the plasma frequency can be positive and less than one. This means that the refractive index is just above zero. The relevant parameter is often the contrast between the permittivities rather than the overall permittivity value at desired frequencies. This occurs because the equivalent (effective) permittivity has a behavior governed by a plasma frequency in the microwave domain. This low optical index material then is a good candidate for extremely convergent microlenses. Methods that have been developed theoretically using dielectric photonic crystals applied in the microwave domain to realize a directive emitter using metallic grids. In this instance, arrayed wires in a cubic, crystal lattice structure can be analyzed as an array of aerials (antenna array). As a lattice structure it has a lattice constant. The lattice constant or lattice parameter refers to the constant distance between unit cells in a crystal lattice. The earlier discovery of plasmons created the view that metal at plasmon frequency fp is a composite material. The effect of plasmons on any metal sample is to create properties in the metal such that it can behave as a dielectric, independent of the wave vector of the EM excitation (radiation) field. Furthermore, a minute-fractionally small amount of plasmon energy is absorbed into the system denoted as Œ≥. For aluminium fp = 15 eV, and Œ≥ = 0.1 eV. Perhaps the most important result of the interaction of metal and the plasma frequency is that permittivity is negative below the plasma frequency, all the way to the minute value of Œ≥. These facts ultimately result in the arrayed wire structure as being effectively a homogeneous medium. This metamaterial allows for control of the direction of emission of an electromagnetic radiation source located inside the material in order to collect all the energy in a small angular domain around the normal. By using a slab of a metamaterial, diverging electromagnetic waves are focused into a narrow cone. Dimensions are small in comparison to the wavelength and thus the slab behaves as a homogeneous material with a low plasma frequency.  Transmission line models   Conventional transmission lines  schematic electronic symbol for a transmission line. Schematic representation of the elementary components of a transmission line. A transmission line is the material medium or structure that forms all or part of a path from one place to another for directing the transmission of energy, such as electromagnetic waves or electric power transmission. Types of transmission line include wires, coaxial cables, dielectric slabs, striplines, optical fibers, electric power lines and waveguides.Federal Standard 1037C A microstrip is a type of transmission line that can be fabricated using printed circuit board technology and is used to convey microwave-frequency signals. It consists of a conducting strip separated from a ground plane by a dielectric layer known as the substrate. Microwave components such as antennas, couplers, filters and power dividers can be formed from a microstrip. From the simplified schematics to the right it can be seen that total impedance, conductance, reactance (capacitance and inductance) and the transmission medium (transmission line) can be represented by single components that give the overall value. With transmission line media it is important to match the load impedance ZL to the characteristic impedance Z0 as closely as possible, because it is usually desirable that the load absorbs as much power as possible. : R is the resistance per unit length, : L is the inductance per unit length, : G is the conductance of the dielectric per unit length, : C is the capacitance per unit length, : j is the imaginary unit, and : \\\\omega is the angular frequency.  Lumped circuit elements  Often, because of the goal that moves physical metamaterial inclusions (or cells) to smaller sizes, discussion and implementation of lumped LC circuits or distributed LC networks are often examined. Lumped circuit elements are actually microscopic elements that effectively approximate their larger component counterparts. For example, circuit capacitance and inductance can be created with split rings, which are on the scale of nanometers at optical frequencies. The distributed LC model is related to the lumped LC model, however the distributed-element model is more accurate but more complex than the lumped-element model.  Metamaterial ‚Äì loaded transmission-line configurations  Some noted metamaterial antennas employ negative-refractive-index transmission-line metamaterials (NRI-TLM). These include lenses that can overcome the diffraction limit, narrowband and broadband phase-shifting lines, small antennas, low-profile antennas, antenna feed networks, novel power architectures, and high-directivity couplers. Loading a planar metamaterial network of TLs with series capacitors and shunt inductors produces higher performance. This results in a large operating bandwidth while the refractive index is negative. Because superlenses can overcome the diffraction limit, this allows for a more efficient coupling to external radiation and enables a broader frequency band. For example, the superlens can be applied to the TLM architecture. In conventional lenses, imaging is limited by the diffraction limit. With superlenses the details of the near field images are not lost. Growing evanescent waves are supported in the metamaterial (n < 1), which restores the decaying evanescent waves from the source. This results in a diffraction-limited resolution of Œª/6, after some small losses. This compares with Œª/2, the normal diffraction limit for conventional lenses. By combining right-handed (RHM) with left-handed materials (LHM) as a composite material (CRLH) construction, both a backward to forward scanning capability is obtained. Metamaterials were first used for antenna technology around 2005. This type of antenna used the established capability of SNGs to couple with external radiation. Resonant coupling allowed for a wavelength larger than the antenna. At microwave frequencies this allowed for a smaller antenna. A metamaterial-loaded transmission line has significant advantages over conventional or standard delay transmission lines. It is more compact in size, it can achieve positive or negative phase shift while occupying the same short physical length and it exhibits a linear, flatter phase response with frequency, leading to shorter group delays. It can work in lower frequency because of high series distributed-capacitors and has smaller plane dimensions than its equivalent coplanar structure.  Negative refractive index metamaterials supporting 2-D waves  In 2002, rather than using SRR-wire configuration, or other 3-D media, researchers looked at planar configurations that supported backward wave propagation, thus demonstrating negative refractive index and focusing as a consequence. It has long been known that transmission lines periodically loaded with capacitive and inductive elements in a high-pass configuration support certain types of backward waves. In addition, planar transmission lines are a natural match for 2-D wave propagation. With lumped circuit elements they retain a compact configuration and can still support the lower RF range. With this in mind, high pass and cutoff, periodically loaded, two-dimensional LC transmission line networks were proposed. The LC networks can be designed to support backward waves, without bulky SRR/wire structure. This was the first such proposal which veered away from bulk media for a negative refractive effect. A notable property of this type of network is that there is no reliance on resonance, Instead the ability to support backward waves defines negative refraction. The principles behind focusing are derived from Veselago and Pendry. Combining a conventional, flat, (planar) DPS slab, M-1, with a left- handed medium, M-2, a propagating electromagnetic wave with a wave vector k1 in M-1, results in a refracted wave with a wave vector k2 in M-2. Since, M-2 supports backward wave propagation k2 is refracted to the opposite side of the normal, while the Poynting vector of M-2 is anti-parallel with k2. Under such conditions, power is refracted through an effectively negative angle, which implies an effectively negative index of refraction. Electromagnetic waves from a point source located inside a conventional DPS can be focused inside an LHM using a planar interface of the two media. These conditions can be modeled by exciting a single node inside the DPS and observing the magnitude and phase of the voltages to ground at all points in the LHM. A focusing effect should manifest itself as a ‚Äúspot‚Äù distribution of voltage at a predictable location in the LHM. Negative refraction and focusing can be accomplished without employing resonances or directly synthesizing the permittivity and permeability. In addition, this media can be practically fabricated by appropriately loading a host transmission line medium. Furthermore, the resulting planar topology permits LHM structures to be readily integrated with conventional planar microwave circuits and devices. When transverse electromagnetic propagation occurs with a transmission line medium, the analogy for permittivity and permeability is Œµ = L, and Œº = C. This analogy was developed with positive values for these parameters. The next logic step was realizing that negative values could be achieved. In order to synthesize a left-handed medium (Œµ < 0 and Œº < 0) the series reactance and shunt susceptibility should become negative, because the material parameters are directly proportional to these circuit quantities. A transmission line that has lumped circuit elements that synthesize a left-handed medium is referred to as a \\"dual transmission line\\" as compared to \\"conventional transmission line\\". The dual transmission line structure can be implemented in practice by loading a host transmission line with lumped series capacitors (C) and shunt inductors (L). In this periodic structure, the loading is strong such that the lumped elements dominate the propagation characteristics.  Left-handed behavior in LC loaded transmission lines  Using SRRs at RF frequencies, as with wireless devices, requires the resonators to be scaled to larger dimensions. This worked against making the devices more compact. In contrast, LC network configurations could be scaled to both microwave and RF frequencies. LC-loaded transmission lines enabled a new class of metamaterials to produce a negative refractive index. Relying on LC networks to emulate electrical permittivity and magnetic permeability resulted in a substantial increase in operating bandwidths. Moreover, their unit cells are connected through a transmission-line network and may be equipped with lumped circuit elements, which permit them to be compact at frequencies where an SRR cannot be compact. The flexibility gained through the use of either discrete or printed elements enables planar metamaterials to be scalable from the megahertz to the tens of gigahertz range. In addition, replacing capacitors with varactors allowed the material properties to be dynamically tuned. The proposed media are planar and inherently support two-dimensional (2-D) wave propagation, making them well-suited for RF/microwave device and circuit applications.  Growing evanescent waves in negative-refractive-index transmission-line media  The periodic 2-D LC loaded transmission-line (TL) was shown to exhibit NRI properties over a broad frequency range. This network will be referred to as a dual TL structure since it is of a high-pass configuration, as opposed to the low-pass representation of a conventional TL structure. Dual TL structures have been used to experimentally demonstrate backward-wave radiation and focusing at microwave frequencies. As a negative refractive index medium, a dual TL structure is not simply a phase compensator. It can enhance the amplitude of evanescent waves, as well as correct the phase of propagating waves. Evanescent waves actually grow within the dual TL structure.  Backward wave antenna using an NRI loaded transmission line  Grbic et al. used one-dimensional LC loaded transmission line network, which supports fast backward-wave propagation to demonstrate characteristics analogous to \\"reversed Cherenkov radiation\\". Their proposed backward-wave radiating structure was inspired by negative refractive index LC materials. The simulated E-plane pattern at 15 GHz showed radiation towards the backfire direction in the far-field pattern, clearly indicating the excitation of a backward wave. Since the transverse dimension of the array is electrically short, the structure is backed by a long metallic trough. The trough acts as a waveguide below cut-off and recovers the back radiation, resulting in unidirectional far-field patterns.  Planar NIMs with periodic loaded transmission lines  Planar media can be implemented with an effective negative refractive index. The underlying concept is based on appropriately loading a printed network of transmission lines periodically with inductors and capacitors. This technique results in effective permittivity and permeability material parameters that are both inherently and simultaneously negative, obviating the need to employ separate means. The proposed media possess other desirable features including very wide bandwidth over which the refractive index remains negative, the ability to guide 2-D TM waves, scalability from RF to millimeter-wave frequencies and low transmission losses, as well as the potential for tunability by inserting varactors and/or switches in the unit cell. The concept has been verified with circuit and full-wave simulations. A prototype focusing device has been tested experimentally. The experimental results demonstrated focusing of an incident cylindrical wave within an octave bandwidth and over an electrically short area; suggestive of near-field focusing. RF/microwave devices can be implemented based on these proposed media for applications in wireless communications, surveillance and radars.  Larger transmission lines  According to some researchers SRR/wire-configured metamaterials are bulky 3-D constructions that are difficult to adapt for RF/microwave device and circuit applications. These structures can achieve a negative index of refraction only within a narrow bandwidth. When applied to wireless devices at RF frequencies the split ring-resonators have to be scaled to larger dimensions, which, in turn forces a larger device size. The proposed structures go beyond the wire/SRR composites in that they do not rely on SRRs to synthesize the material parameters, thus leading to dramatically increased operating bandwidths. Moreover, their unit cells are connected through a transmission- line network and they may, therefore, be equipped with lumped elements, which permit them to be compact at frequencies where the SRR cannot be compact. The flexibility gained through the use of either discrete or printed elements enables planar metamaterials to be scalable from the megahertz to the tens of gigahertz range. In addition, by utilizing varactors instead of capacitors, the effective material properties can be dynamically tuned. Furthermore, the proposed media are planar and inherently support two-dimensional (2-D) wave propagation. Therefore, these new metamaterials are well suited for RF/microwave device and circuit applications. In the long-wavelength regime, the permittivity and permeability of conventional materials can be artificially synthesized using periodic LC networks arranged in a low-pass configuration. In the dual (high-pass) configuration, these equivalent material parameters assume simultaneously negative values, and may therefore be used to synthesize a negative refractive index.  Configurations  Antenna theory is based on classical electromagnetic theory as described by Maxwell's equations. Physically, an antenna is an arrangement of one or more conductors, usually called elements. An alternating current is created in the elements by applying a voltage at the antenna terminals, causing the elements to radiate an electromagnetic field. In reception, the reverse occurs: an electromagnetic field from another source induces an alternating current in the elements and a corresponding voltage at the antenna's terminals. Some receiving antennas (such as parabolic and horn types) incorporate shaped reflective surfaces to collect EM waves from free space and direct or focus them onto the actual conductive elements. An antenna creates sufficiently strong electromagnetic fields at large distances. Reciprocally, it is sensitive to the electromagnetic fields impressed upon it externally. The actual coupling between a transmitting and receiving antenna is so small that amplifier circuits are required at both the transmitting and receiving stations. Antennas are usually created by modifying ordinary circuitry into transmission line configurations. The required antenna for any given application is dependent on the bandwidth employed, and range (power) requirements. In the microwave to millimeter-wave range ‚Äì wavelengths from a few meters to millimeters ‚Äì the following antennas are usually employed: Dipole antennas, short antennas, parabolic and other reflector antennas, horn antennas, periscope antennas, helical antennas, spiral antennas, surface-wave and leaky wave antennas. Leaky wave antennas include dielectric and dielectric loaded antennas, and the variety of microstrip antennas.  Radiation properties with SRRs  The SRR was introduced by Pendry in 1999, and is one of the most common elements of metamaterials. As a nonmagnetic conducting unit, it comprises an array of units that yield an enhanced negative effective magnetic permeability, when the frequency of the incident electromagnetic field is close to the SRR resonance frequency. The resonant frequency of the SRR depends on its shape and physical design. In addition, resonance can occur at wavelengths much larger than its size. For the further shape optimization of the elements it is expedient to use genetic and other optimization algorithms. In multi-frequency designs one may apply fractal designs such as those of Sierpensky, Koch or other fractals instead of SRRs.  Double negative metamaterials  Through the application of double negative metamaterials (DNG), the power radiated by electrically small dipole antennas can be notably increased. This could be accomplished by surrounding an antenna with a shell of double negative (DNG) material. When the electric dipole is embedded in a homogeneous DNG medium, the antenna acts inductively rather than capacitively, as it would in free space without the interaction of the DNG material. In addition, the dipole-DNG shell combination increases the real power radiated by more than an order of magnitude over a free space antenna. A notable decrease in the reactance of the dipole antenna corresponds to the increase in radiated power. The reactive power indicates that the DNG shell acts as a natural matching network for the dipole. The DNG material matches the intrinsic reactance of this antenna system to free space, hence the impedance of DNG material matches free space. It provides a natural matching circuit to the antenna.  Single negative SRR and monopole composite  The addition of an SRR-DNG metamaterial increased the radiated power by more than an order of magnitude over a comparable free space antenna. Electrically small antennas, high directivity and tunable operational frequency are produced with negative magnetic permeability. When combining a right-handed material (RHM) with a Veselago-left-handed material (LHM) other novel properties are obtained. A single negative material resonator, obtained with an SRR, can produce an electrically small antenna when operating at microwave frequencies, as follows: The configuration of an SRR assessed was two concentric annular rings with relative opposite gaps in the inner and outer ring. Its geometrical parameters were R = 3.6 mm, r = 2.5 mm, w = 0.2 mm, t = 0.9 mm. R and r are used in annular parameters, w is the spacing between the rings and t = the width of the outer ring. The material had a thickness of 1.6 mm. Permittivity was 3.85 at 4 GHz. The SRR was fabricated with an etching technique onto a 30 Œºm thick copper substrate. The SRR was excited by using a monopole antenna. The monopole antenna was composed of a coaxial cable, ground plane and radiating components. The ground plane material was aluminium. The operation frequency of the antenna was 3.52 GHz, which was determined by considering the geometrical parameters of SRR. An 8.32 mm length of wire was placed above the ground plane, connected to the antenna, which was one quarter of the operation wavelength. The antenna worked with a feed wavelength of 3.28 mm and feed frequency of 7.8 GHz. The SRR's resonant frequency was smaller than the monopole operation frequency. The monopole-SRR antenna operated efficiently at (Œª/10) using the SRR-wire configuration. It demonstrated good coupling efficiency and sufficient radiation efficiency. Its operation was comparable to a conventional antenna at Œª/2, which is a conventional antenna size for efficient coupling and radiation. Therefore, the monopole-SRR antenna becomes an acceptable electrically small antenna at the SRR's resonance frequency. When the SRR is made part of this configuration, characteristics such as the antenna's radiation pattern are entirely changed in comparison to a conventional monopole antenna. With modifications to the SRR structure the antenna size could reach (Œª/40). Coupling 2, 3, and 4 SRRs side by side slightly shifts radiation patterns.  Patch antennas  In 2005 a patch antenna with a metamaterial cover was proposed that enhanced directivity. According to the numerical results, the antenna showed significant improvement in directivity, compared to conventional patch antennae. This was cited in 2007 for an efficient design of directive patch antennas in mobile communications using metamaterials. This design was based on the left-handed material (LHM) transmission line model, with the circuit elements L and C of the LHM equivalent circuit model. This study developed formulae to determine the L and C values of the LHM equivalent circuit model for desirable characteristics of directive patch antennas. Design examples derived from actual frequency bands in mobile communications were performed, which illustrates the efficiency of this approach.  Flat lens horn antenna  This configuration uses a flat aperture constructed of zero-index metamaterial. This has advantages over ordinary (conventional) curved lenses, which results in a much improved directivity. These investigations have provided capabilities for the miniaturization of microwave source and non- source devices, circuits, antennas and the improvement of electromagnetic performance. Metamaterials surface antenna technology Metamaterials surface antenna technology (M-SAT) is an invention that uses metamaterials to direct and maintain a consistent broadband radio frequency beam locked on to a satellite whether the platform is in motion or stationary. Gimbals and motors are replaced by arrays of metamaterials in a planar configuration. Also, with this new technology phase shifters are not required as with phased array equipment. The desired affect is accomplished by varying the pattern of activated metamaterial elements as needed. The technology is a practical application of metamaterial cloaking theory. The antenna is approximately the size of a laptop computer. Research and applications of metamaterial based antennas. Related components are also researched.Metamaterial-Engineered Antennas.

The pair would be a DNG metamaterial (layer), paired with a DPS, ENG or MNG layer. Wave propagation behavior and properties may occur that would otherwise not happen if only DNG layers are paired together. At the interface between two media, the concept of the continuity of the tangential electric and magnetic field components can be applied. If either the permeability or permittivity of two media has opposite signs then the normal components of the tangential field, on both sides of the interface, will be discontinuous at the boundary. This implies a concentrated resonant phenomenon at the interface. This appears to be similar to the current and voltage distributions at the junction between an inductor and capacitor, at the resonance of an L-C circuit. This \\"interface resonance\\" is essentially independent of the total thickness of the paired layers, because it occurs along the discontinuity between two such conjugate materials.  Parallel-plate waveguiding structures  The geometry consists of two parallel plates as perfect conductors (PEC), an idealized structure, filled by two stacked planar slabs of homogeneous and isotropic materials with their respective constitutive parameters Œµ1, Œµ2, u1, u2. Each slab has thickness = d, slab 1 = d1, and slab 2 = d2. Choosing which combination of parameters to employ involves pairing DPS and DNG or ENG and MNG materials. As mentioned previously, this is one pair of oppositely-signed constitutive parameters, combined.  Thin subwavelength cavity resonators  Phase compensation The real component values for negative permittivity and permeability results in real component values for negative refraction n. In a lossless medium, all that would exist are real values. This concept can be used to map out phase compensation when a conventional lossless material, DPS, is matched with a lossless NIM (DNG). In phase compensation, the DPS of thickness d1 has Œµ > 0 and ¬µ > 0. Conversely, the NIM of thickness d2 has Œµ < 0 and ¬µ < 0\\\\. Assume that the intrinsic impedance of the DPS dielectric material (d1) is the same as that of the outside region and responding to a normally incident planar wave. The wave travels through the medium without any reflection because the DPS impedance and the outside impedance are equal. However, the plane wave at the end of DPS slab is out of phase with the plane wave at the beginning of the material. The plane wave then enters the lossless NIM (d2). At certain frequencies Œµ < 0 and ¬µ < 0 and n < 0\\\\. Like the DPS, the NIM has intrinsic impedance that is equal to the outside, and, therefore, is also lossless. The direction of power flow (i.e., the Poynting vector) in the first slab should be the same as that in the second one, because the power of the incident wave enters the first slab (without any reflection at the first interface), traverses the first slab, exits the second interface, enters the second slab and traverses it, and finally leaves the second slab. However, as stated earlier, the direction of power is anti-parallel to the direction of phase velocity. Therefore, the wave vector k2 is in the opposite direction of k1. Furthermore, whatever phase difference is developed by traversing the first slab can be decreased and even cancelled by traversing the second slab. If the ratio of the two thicknesses is d1 / d 2 = n2 / n1, then the total phase difference between the front and back faces is zero. This demonstrates how the NIM slab at chosen frequencies acts as a phase compensator. It is important to note that this phase compensation process is only on the ratio of d1 / d 2 rather than the thickness of d1 \\\\+ d1. Therefore, d1 \\\\+ d1 can be any value, as long as this ratio satisfies the above condition. Finally, even though this two-layer structure is present, the wave traversing this structure would not experience the phase difference. Following this, the next step is the subwavelength cavity resonator. Compact subwavelength 1-D cavity resonators using metamaterials The phase compensator described above can be used to conceptualize the possibility of designing a compact 1-D cavity resonator. The above two-layer structure is applied as two perfect reflectors, or in other words, two perfect conducting plates. Conceptually, what is constrained in the resonator is d1 / d2, not d1 \\\\+ d2. Therefore, in principle, one can have a thin subwavelength cavity resonator for a given frequency, if at this frequency the second layer acts a metamaterial with negative permittivity and permeability and the ratio correlates to the correct values. The cavity can conceptually be thin while still resonant, as long as the ratio of thicknesses is satisfied. This can, in principle, provide possibility for subwavelength, thin, compact cavity resonators.  Miniature cavity resonator utilizing FSS  Frequency selective surface (FSS) based metamaterials utilize equivalent LC circuitry configurations. Using FSS in a cavity allows for miniaturization, decrease of the resonant frequency, lowers the cut-off frequency and smooth transition from a fast-wave to a slow-wave in a waveguide configuration.  Composite metamaterial based cavities  As an LHM application four different cavities operating in the microwave regime were fabricated and experimentally observed and described.  Metamaterial ground plane   Leaky mode propagation with metamaterial ground plane  A magnetic dipole was placed on metamaterial (slab) ground plane. The metamaterials have either constituent parameters that are both negative, or negative permittivity or negative permeability. The dispersion and radiation properties of leaky waves supported by these metamaterial slabs, respectively, were investigated.  Patented systems  Microstrip line (400) for a phased array metamaterial antenna system. 401 represents unit-cell circuits composed periodically along the microstrip. 402 series capacitors. 403 are T-junctions between capacitors, which connect (404) spiral inductor delay lines to 401. 404 are also connected to ground vias 405. Multiple systems have patents. Phased array systems and antennas for use in such systems are well known in areas such as telecommunications and radar applications. In general phased array systems work by coherently reassembling signals over the entire array by using circuit elements to compensate for relative phase differences and time delays.  Phased array antenna  Patented in 2004, one phased array antenna system is useful in automotive radar applications. By using NIMs as a biconcave lens to focus microwaves, the antenna's sidelobes are reduced in size. This equates to a reduction in radiated energy loss, and a relatively wider useful bandwidth. The system is an efficient, dynamically-ranged phased array radar system. In addition, signal amplitude is increased across the microstrip transmission lines by suspending them above the ground plane at a predetermined distance. In other words, they are not in contact with a solid substrate. Dielectric signal loss is reduced significantly, reducing signal attenuation. This system was designed to boost the performance of the Monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC), among other benefits. A transmission line is created with photolithography. A metamaterial lens, consisting of a thin wire array focuses the transmitted or received signals between the line and the emitter / receiver elements. U.S. patent US6958729B1 The lens also functions as an input device and consists of a number of periodic unit-cells disposed along the line. The lens consists of multiple lines of the same make up; a plurality of periodic unit-cells. The periodic unit-cells are constructed of a plurality of electrical components; capacitors and inductors as components of multiple distributed-element circuits. The metamaterial incorporates a conducting transmission element, a substrate comprising at least a first ground plane for grounding the transmission element, a plurality of unit-cell circuits composed periodically along the transmission element and at least one via for electrically connecting the transmission element to at least the first ground plane. It also includes a means for suspending this transmission element a predetermined distance from the substrate in a way such that the transmission element is located at a second predetermined distance from the ground plane.  ENG and MNG waveguides and scattering devices  This structure was designed for use in waveguiding or scattering of waves. It employs two adjacent layers. The first layer is an epsilon-negative (ENG) material or a mu-negative (MNG) material. The second layer is either a double-positive (DPS) material or a double- negative (DNG) material. Alternatively, the second layer can be an ENG material when the first layer is an MNG material or the reverse.Engheta, Nader; Al√π, Andrea \\"Waveguides and scattering devices incorporating epsilon- negative and/or mu-negative slabs\\" publication date May 15, 2007  Reducing interference  A keyless entry system key fob Metamaterials can reduce interference across multiple devices with smaller and simpler shielding.

Similarly to HTML Frames, XFrames can be made useful through its power to create a content frame that is scrollable while other frames - such as sidebar menus, the header and footer remain in place on the page. XFrames will be particularly useful to web developers who will be able to modify a single document and have that modification appear on all pages that contain the document within a frame. The main advantage of this next generation of frames is that it overcomes several of the major usability problems existing in the traditional framing system. Although still in the working draft stages, XFrames will be replacing traditional HTML Frames. Differences from HTML Frames Traditional HTML frames that were introduced with HTML 4.0 were useful for their ability to combine several distinct Web pages into a single webpage view. However, several problems arose from the implementation and as such, frames have been removed from the W3C XHTML 1.1 standard. XFrames will likely address some of the following problems existent in HTML frames: * a Web browser's back button failing to work intuitively * the failure to bookmark or favorite specific documents on the Web page easily as well as the inability to send an individual a reference to a specific document or collection * getting trapped in a frameset * the production of different results at times when a Web page containing frames is reloaded * the \\"Page Up\\" and \\"Page Down\\" keys being difficult to use due to the pointer focus being on another frame within the page * security vulnerabilities caused by the fact that a user has no way of knowing the original source of each framed document * Since frames are not supported by all agents, and the necessary content is not popularly implemented, agents that do not support frames (such as search engines) fail to render pages correctly and at the same time prevent any search engine optimization. XFrames overcomes the bookmarking problem by encoding the population of the frames into the URI, thus making it possible to bookmark/add a favorite of a page successfully. XFrames Implementation Similar to other markup languages, XFrames will support a number of elements and respective attributes. The following is a simple demonstration for the proposed implementation of a frames webpage: The element acts as the containing element of the collection of frames. This collection is what is being referred to as the 'frameset' of a webpage.

The Marpo Podrang on the west contains an assembly hall with two protector chapels, a chapel dedicated to the eight Medicine Buddhas and reliquaries of Nomun Qan III and IV.Dorje (1999), p. 95. History The Four Royal Colleges The Four Royal Colleges or Ling Shi were Tengye Ling, and Kunde Ling to the south and east of Chokpori () are both within the old, but now destroyed, Lingkor, the pilgrim path wound its way for around Lhasa. The others were Drib Tsemchok Ling which has now disappeared but was located west of the Lhasa bridge, on the southern bank of the Kyi Chu or Tsangpo River, and Tsomon Ling itself. The four Ling were built with Chinese patronage by the Dalai Lamas' Regents. The Gelugpa Lama-Regent who ruled during the minority of the Dalai Lama was normally picked from among the abbots of these colleges.Das (1902), p. 173. The most important of the Four Royal Colleges was Tengye Ling, the seat of the Demo Qutuqtus, who were the dominant regents in the 18th and 19th centuries when a series of Dalai Lamas were assassinated before they reached their majority and took power.Dowman (1988), p. 61. Some people suspect the regents of assassinating the young Dalai Lamas, but others feel it was more likely that, \\"if foul play indeed was involved,\\" it was the work of members of the lay aristocracy.Mullin (2001), p. 344. Tengye Ling was suppressed in 1901. Apparently it supported Chao Erh-feng when he invaded Lhasa. In 1912 it was attacked and destroyed because of its anti-government policies. After this the Demo Qutuqtu moved to Tsomon Ling.Dowman (1988), p. 61. Two of the Nomun Qan Qutuqtus, whose residence was at Tsomon Ling, served as regents during the time of the Dalai Lama VIII (1777‚Äì1784) and during the time of the Dalai Lamas X and XI (1819 until 1844 when the Nomun Qan was exiled to China.Dorje (1999), p. 95.

Fisher ( or -1905) was an architect best known for his work during the rebuilding of the American city of Seattle after it was devastated by fire in 1889. He began his career as a carpenter and migrated from Massachusetts to the Pacific Northwest, where he practiced architecture from 1886 to 1891. After his reputation was damaged by personal scandal in Seattle, he relocated to Los Angeles in 1893 where he only had modest success as an architect before returning to carpentry, passing away in 1905. His commercial building designs played a major role in reshaping Seattle architecture in the late 19th century and many still survive as part of the Pioneer Square Historic District. Life Pioneer Building, shortly after its completion in 1890. Fisher claimed he was born in Scotland in 1840 and immigrated to Massachusetts at age 17 where he received an architectural apprenticeship in Worcester though this and his claims of living in Butte, Montana have yet to be substantiated by research. In the 1870s he moved west to Minnesota, where he first appeared in the 1874 Minneapolis City Directory as a cabinet maker, the following year as a sash maker for R.P. Russell & Co., and the year after as a moulder for Smith, Parker & Co. He continued his journey west, arriving in Denver, Colorado around 1880 where after first working as a foreman for a sash & door factory, began trading as an architect as well as a carpenter and builder with partner J.H. Corrin until his departure from that city in 1885. He arrived in the Pacific Northwest in early 1886 where he established an architectural office in Victoria, British Columbia. Business in the booming city was brisk and within a year he had multiple substantial business buildings and homes to his credit and began receiving commissions further afield in Vancouver, British Columbia and Port Townsend, Washington. Around this time he received his first major commissions in Seattle including the first Korn Block (1888, Destroyed) and 1st Regiment Army Hall (1888, Demolished), giving him a foothold in the competitive architectural scene there. Seeing the great potential and growth happening in Seattle, Fisher left Victoria and established a permanent Seattle office where he began receiving large projects immediately including the Austin A. Bell Building, the Gilmore & Kirman Building and Henry Yesler's Pioneer Building. By early 1889 Fisher employed 4 architects at his James Street office and was so busy that small-scale commissions were turned away. While the first few months of 1889 were some of Fisher's busiest, he and every other hopeful architect in the city would be given a clean slate when the Great Seattle fire of June 6, 1889 wiped out the majority of the business district. Many of Fisher's recent commissions were either outside of the burnt district or were only in the excavation stages at the time of the fire and despite common belief, many of his most famous buildings would have been built whether Seattle burned or not. Regardless, new commissions in the wake of the fire were numerous to the degree that several pre-fire commissions were halted or left un-built due to the glut of new construction. He is still considered the most prolific of the architects involved in rebuilding the city for designing almost half of the major downtown buildings between 1889 and 1891. Due to financial problems and a variety of legal claims laid against him, he left his career as an architect by 1891 to run a hotel that he had previously designed and built. In 1893, a former mistress brought a civil suit against Fisher. Although he was acquitted, the scandal ruined his reputation. He had the contents of his Seattle home and office auctioned off and permanently removed to Los Angeles where he formed a new partnership with Carroll H. Brown. In Los Angeles he struggled to re-establish the career success he had enjoyed in Seattle, which had less to do with his reputation and more as a result of the Panic of 1893 which halted building projects across the nation. After a major commission for the Van Nuys Building in downtown Los Angeles fell through, his partnership with Brown was dissolved and he all but retired from architecture. He returned to his first profession, carpentry, last appearing in the Los Angeles city Directory in 1902. He passed away in 1905 in relative obscurity. His final resting place is unknown. Work Fisher's early commercial designs were of Victorian and Italianate influence and were typified by exposed brick with corbelling, selective exterior plastering and massive Aedicular window surrounds. Romanesque elements heavily utilizing decorative terra cotta began to make their way into his designs by 1888 and would play a major role in his later work, such as the now demolished Burke block (1889-91), whose many elaborate terra cotta elements were incorporated into the public plaza surrounding the Henry M. Jackson Federal Building (1975). On June 6, 1889, a fire destroyed most of Seattle's business district. The buildings were primarily constructed of wood so the large-scale rebuilding campaign focused on new \\"fireproof\\" buildings constructed of brick, stone and iron. Fisher designed many of the new buildings and some can still be seen in what is now the Pioneer Square neighborhood. Fisher favored the Richardsonian Romanesque style which led to a unity of appearance in the district. He also tended to divide the facades of his buildings into a grid, a style influenced by Victorian architecture. His best-known work is the Pioneer Building in Seattle. Designed and first proposed in 1888, It was completed in 1892 for Henry Yesler and it served as a \\"prestige office address\\" throughout the decade. It won an award from the American Institute of Architects for \\"being the finest building West of Chicago\\".

Vatican City pursued a policy of neutrality during World War II, under the leadership of Pope Pius XII. Although the city of Rome was occupied by Germany from 1943 and the Allies from 1944, Vatican City itself was not occupied. The Vatican organised extensive humanitarian aid throughout the duration of the conflict. Background The Vatican City came into existence in 1929, a decade before the start of World War II The Lateran Treaty of 1929 with Italy recognized the sovereignty of Vatican City. It declared Vatican City a neutral country in international relations, and required the Pope to abstain from mediation unless requested by all parties. In 1939, the city state was recognized by thirty-eight nations, with a diplomatic corps of thirteen full ambassadors and twenty-five ministers.Morley, 1980, page 8 Foreign relations Pre-war mediation attempts As early as April 1939, Pius XII announced a plan for peace, hoping to mediate a negotiation between the major European powers on the brink of war.Chadwick, 1988, p. 61 The first leader contacted was Benito Mussolini, via Pius XII's usual go-between, Jesuit Father Tacchi Venturi.Chadwick, 1988, p. 62 With Mussolini's approval, the next day Cardinal Secretary of State Luigi Maglione contacted the nuncios in Paris (Valerio Valeri), Warsaw (Filippo Cortesi), and Berlin (Cesare Orsenigo) and the Apostolic Delegate in London (William Godfrey). The proposed Vatican meeting accomplished very little of substance: if there was any coherent position espoused by the Vatican among its various communications, it was that of appeasement.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 62-74 In particular, the Pope attempted to get Poland to accept the secession of the Free City of Danzig to Nazi Germany, a position Polish ambassador Kazimierz Pap√©e (the former High Commissioner of Danzig) and the Polish government could not accept.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 75-76 Polish ambassador to the Vatican, Kazimierz Pap√©e, was critical of Pius XII's pre-war mediation efforts. In his 24 August 1939 Radio Message, just a week before war, Pius warned: \\"The danger is imminent, but there is still time. Nothing is lost with peace; all can be lost with war!\\"Vatican Archive - Homily of Benedict XVI, 9 October 2008 British historian Owen Chadwick drew four themes from the Vatican mediation attempts:Chadwick, 1988, pp. 77-78 a particular closeness to Mussolini, to the point of sending correspondence of his drafting, from the period May‚ÄìAugust 1939; British and Polish disinterest in Vatican proposals, which were suspected of being pro-Italian and pro- German, respectively; major European powers viewed the Pope as \\"no minor pawn upon their chessboard\\"; and, above all, Pius XII wanted to ensure compromise between the Western powers to prevent Russian territorial gains. With Poland overrun, but France and the Low Countries yet to be attacked, Pius continued to hope for a negotiated peace to prevent the spread of the conflict. The similarly minded US President Franklin D. Roosevelt re-established American diplomatic relations with the Vatican after a seventy-year hiatus and dispatched Myron C. Taylor as his personal representative. Despite the early collapse of peace hopes, the Taylor mission continued at the Vatican.Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum - The Vatican Files Public statements Despite intense behind the scenes actions, Pius XII was resolved not to issue any public pronouncement that took sides in the conflict; this first manifested itself in a refusal to explicitly condemn the German invasion of Poland.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 79-81 Early on, Pius XII believed that the \\"rapid destruction of Poland meant the end of the war\\".Chadwick, 1988, p. 82 Outbreak of war Summi Pontificatus (\\"On the Limitations of the Authority of the State\\"), issued 20 October 1939, was the first papal encyclical issued by Pope Pius XII, and established some of the themes of his papacy.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica - Reflections on the Holocaust According to Chadwick, Summi Pontificatus exemplified both \\"the hesitancy and the care\\" of the pontiff.Chadwick, 1988, p. 83 During the drafting of the letter, the Second World War commenced with the Nazi/Soviet invasion of Catholic Poland. Though couched in diplomatic language, Pius endorses Catholic resistance, and states his disapproval of the war, racism, anti-semitism, the Nazi/Soviet invasion of Poland and the persecutions of the Church.SUMMI PONTIFICATUS - Section 106 With Italy not yet an ally of Adolf Hitler in the war, Italians were called upon to remain faithful to the Church. Pius avoided naming the belligerent allies Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin as the evildoers, establishing the \\"impartial\\" public tone that was to be a hallmark of his pontificate: \\"A full statement of the doctrinal stand to be taken in face of the errors of today, if necessary, can be put off to another time unless there is disturbance by calamitous external events; for the moment We limit Ourselves to some fundamental observations.\\"SUMMI PONTIFICATUS - Section 28 Resistance The Pope wrote of \\"anti-Christian movements\\" bringing forth a crop \\"poignant disasters\\" and called for love, mercy, and compassion against the \\"deluge of discord\\". Following themes addressed in Non abbiamo bisogno (1931); Mit brennender Sorge (1937) and Divini redemptoris (1937), Pius wrote of a need to bring back to the Church those who were following \\"a false standard... misled by error, passion, temptation and prejudice, [who] have strayed away from faith in the true God\\".SUMMI PONTIFICATUS - Section 6 & 7 He wrote of \\"Christians unfortunately more in name than in fact\\" having shown \\"cowardice\\" in the face of persecution by these creeds, and he endorsed resistance: Invasion of Poland Pius wrote of a persecuted Church108\\\\. \\"In the midst of this world which today presents such a sharp contrast to \\"The Peace of Christ in the Reign of Christ,\\" the Church and her faithful are in times and in years of trial such as have rarely been known in her history of struggle and suffering\\". and a time requiring \\"charity\\" for victims who had a \\"right\\" to compassion. Against the invasion of Poland and killing of civilians he wrote: thumb|right|200pxA monument to Fr. Maximilian Kolbe, among the estimated 3,000 members (18%) of the Polish clergy who were killed by the Nazis; of these, 1,992 died in concentration camps.Craughwell, Thomas J., [http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=472 The Gentile Holocaust] Catholic Culture, Accessed July 18, 2008 In Poland, the Nazis murdered over 2,500 monks and priests and even more were imprisoned.Chadwick, Owen pp. 254‚Äì255. Opposition to racism and anti- Semitism In a further rejection of Nazi ideology, Pius reiterated Catholic opposition to racism and anti-Semitism: 1940 meeting with Ribbentrop When in 1940, the Nazi Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop led the only senior Nazi delegation permitted an audience with Pius XII and asked why the Pope had sided with the Allies, Pius replied with a list of recent Nazi atrocities and religious persecutions committed against Christians and Jews, in Germany and in Poland, leading the New York Times to headline its report \\"Jews Rights Defended\\" and write of the \\"burning words he spoke to Herr Ribbentrop about religious persecution\\". 1942 Christmas message In 1942, Pius XII delivered a Christmas message over Vatican Radio, which voiced concern for the victims of the Nazis' genocidal policies.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica : World War Two - German-occupied Europe From May 1942, the Nazis had commenced their industrialized slaughter of the Jews of Europe ‚Äì the Final Solution. Gypsies and others were also marked for extermination. The Pope addressed the racial persecutions in the following terms: The New York Times called Pius \\"a lonely voice crying out of the silence of a continent.\\" The speech was made in the context of the near total domination of Europe by the armies of Nazi Germany, although the war had turned in favour of the Allies on all fronts. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Pius refused to say more \\"fearing that public papal denunciations might provoke the Hitler regime to brutalize further those subject to Nazi terror ‚Äì as it had when Dutch bishops publicly protested earlier in the year ‚Äì while jeopardizing the future of the church\\".http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-236597 Contacts to the German military opposition In the winter of 1939/40, the Bavarian lawyer and reserve 'Abwehr' officer Josef M√ºller, acting as an emissary for the early German military opposition against Hitler then centered around General Franz Halder, the chief of staff of the German army, contacted Monsignore Ludwig Kaas, the exiled leader of the German Catholic Zentrum party, in Rome, hoping to use the Pope as an intermediary to contact the British.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 86-87 Kaas put M√ºller in contact with Father Robert Leiber, who personally asked the Pope to relay the information about the German resistance to the British.Chadwick, 1988, p. 87 After more than a day of \\"quiet reflection\\", Pius XII agreed to pass the information along to the British. However he refused to pass the information along to the French or even to his own Secretariat of State.Chadwick, 1988, p. 88 The Pope's Private Secretary, Robert Leiber, met with M√ºller, who visited Rome in 1939 and 1940.Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933-1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.161 & 294 The Vatican considered M√ºller to be a representative of Colonel-General Beck and agreed to offer the machinery for mediation.Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933-1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.160William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; p648-9 Oster, Wilhelm Canaris and Hans von Dohn√°nyi, backed by Beck, told M√ºller to ask Pius to ascertain whether the British would enter negotiations with the German opposition which wanted to overthrow Hitler. The British agreed to negotiate, provided the Vatican could vouch for the opposition's representative. Pius, communicating with British envoy D'Arcy Osborne, channelled communications back and forth in secrecy. The Vatican agreed to send a letter outlining the bases for peace with Britain, and the participation of the Pope was used to try to persuade senior German Generals Halder and Brauchitsch to act against Hitler.John Toland; Hitler; Wordsworth Editions; 1997 Edn; p.760 Negotiations were tense, with a Western offensive expected, and on the basis that substantive negotiations could only follow the replacement of the Hitler regime. Hoffmann wrote that, when the Venlo Incident stalled the talks, the British agreed to resume discussions primarily because of the \\"efforts of the Pope and the respect in which he was held. Chamberlain and Halifax set great store by the Pope's readiness to mediate.\\" Pius, without offering endorsement, advised Osbourne on 11 January 1940 that the German opposition had said that a German offensive was planned for February, but that this could be averted if the German generals could be assured of peace with Britain, and not on punitive terms. If this could be assured, then they were willing to move to replace Hitler. The Pope admitted to \\"discomfort\\" at his role as mediator, but advised that the Germans involved were not Nazis. The British government had doubts as to the capacity of the conspirators. On 7 February, the Pope updated Osbourne that the opposition wanted to replace the Nazi regime with a democratic federation, but hoped to retain Austria and the Sudetenland. The British government was non-committal, and said that while the federal model was of interest, the promises and sources of the opposition were too vague. Nevertheless, the resistance were encouraged by the talks, and Muller told Leiber that a coup would occur in February. Pius appeared to continue to hope for a coup in Germany into March 1940.Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933-1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.160-163 Chadwick wrote that Pius XII met with D'Arcy Osborne, telling him that he knew the names of the involved German generals but did not wish to share them.Chadwick, 1988, p. 90 Pius XII insisted to Osborne that he was merely passing on a message and that \\"he did not wish in the slightest degree to endorse it or to recommend it\\". When Osborne pressed the Pope on the vagueness of his message, Osborne reported that Pius XII replied \\"perhaps, after all, it was not worth proceeding with the matter and he would therefore ask me to return his communication to me as not having been made\\". The Pope further declined Osborne's request to guarantee the good faith of the generals, or whether they could accomplish their goal. In a second meeting, Pius XII flashed a typed, four-page letter in German in front of Osborne, but declined to let him read it or have a copy.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 91-96 After the German attack on Denmark and Norway, the British refused any further contacts with emissaries of the German military opposition, fearing another Venlo incident. The opposition largely dissolved after the German conquest of France in summer 1940 because Halder no longer dared to stand up against an apparently successful Hitler. It only regained momentum in 1944 when a new generation of younger officers decided to conspire against the ruthless Nazi regime. Leiber remained the point of contact at the Vatican for communications from Colonel-General Ludwig Beck in the lead up to the 1944 July Plot. Mid-war In late 1942, senior Italian officials first approached the Vatican with peace feelers.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 246-47 In the eyes of the Vatican, \\"the neutrality of the Vatican, achieved at such cost, was paying a dividend at last\\".Chadwick, 1988, p. 248 When Mussolini sent his son-in-law, Count Ciano, as ambassador to the Vatican in 1943, the Germans and others speculated about the possibility of Ciano negotiating a separate peace.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 248-49 The British for their part doubted any such intentions and wanted nothing to do with Ciano.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 249-50 Military history The Vatican maintained a small force of troops known as the Swiss Guard. During World War II the Vatican's Swiss guards obtained additional submachine guns and gas masks to supplement the existing Vatican arsenal in the event of an attack.Robert Royal, 2006, \\" The Pope's Army\\" Extraterritorial status With the German occupation of Rome in 1943, after the fall of Mussolini, came rumors of a plot to kidnap the Pope; modern scholars are still at odds over the authenticity of such allegations.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 275-76 The Vatican City itself was never occupied; in fact, the chief concern within the Vatican was the potential for lawlessness in the period between the German and Allied occupation, not the potential for German occupation. However the Vatican Police Force in conjunction with the Swiss Guard maintained order.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 290-91 Bombing of Rome One of Pius XII's main diplomatic priorities was to prevent the bombing of Rome; so sensitive was the pontiff that he protested even the British air dropping of pamphlets over Rome, claiming that the few landing within the city-state violated the Vatican's neutrality.Chadwick, 1988, p. 222 Before the American entry into the war, there was little impetus for such a bombing, as the British saw little strategic value in it.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 222-32 After the American entry, the US opposed such a bombing, fearful of offending Catholic members of its military forces, while the British then supported it.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 232-36 Pius XII similarly advocated for the declaration of Rome as an \\"open city\\", but this occurred only on 14 August 1943, after Rome had already been bombed twice.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 236-44 Although the Italians consulted the Vatican on the wording of the open city declaration, the impetus for the change had little to do with the Vatican.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 244-45 Vatican City was bombed twice during the war. Prisoners of war After the Italian surrender, Allied prisoners guarded by Italians were released, and many headed for Vatican City.Chadwick, 1988, p. 291 The Vatican feared such an event would compromise its neutrality and gave strict instructions to the Swiss Guard to prevent any such person from entering the city state; a system of identity cards was instituted to prevent non-Vatican personnel from entering St. Peter's.Chadwick, 1988, p. 292 Some Vatican officials, however, did act independently to assist such persons; the most famous example is Hugh O'Flaherty, whose exploits were made famous in the film The Scarlet and the Black.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 293-99 Financial activity Bernardino Nogara, the chief Vatican financier during the war Media Osservatore Romano The Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's newspaper, published in Italian, was the only newspaper in Italy not censored by the Italian government.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 104-07 Despite its relatively moderate content, the paper was lionized by the British and French press and vilified by the Italian Fascist press.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 111-12 By 20 May 1940, the paper ceased publishing any articles about the war not authored by the \\"official Italian war communique\\", per an agreement with the Italian government.Chadwick, 1988, p. 113 By August 1940 its weather reports were also eliminated when the Italian government protested that they might aid British aircraft.Chadwick, 1988, p. 114 Vatican Radio Vatican Radio was in a similar situation; for example, it ceased news about prisoners-of-war, which the Italian government worried would hint at the location of ships.Chadwick, 1988, p. 142 It also ceased reporting on the weather, for the same reason. After Cardinal August Hlond issued a fiery, Polish-language message to Poland over the radio (which could scarcely be picked up in Poland), \\"nothing like this broadcast was ever allowed to happen again\\".Chadwick, 1988, p. 143 After German complaints, the radio ceased any discussion of the situation in Poland, and later ceased discussing the situation of the church in Germany.Chadwick, 1988, p. 145 Pius XII spoke over the radio on several occasions, most notably during his 1942 Christmas address in which he voiced concern at the murder of \\"hundreds of thousands\\" of \\"faultless\\" people on the basis of no more than their \\"race or nationality\\". The Holocaust In his 1939 Summi Pontificatus first papal encyclical, Pius XII expressed dismay at the invasion of Poland; reiterated Catholic teaching against racism and antisemitism; and endorsed resistance against those opposed to the ethical principles of the \\"Revelation on Sinai\\" and the Sermon on the Mount. Pius protested the deportations of Slovakian Jews to the Bratislava government from 1942. In 1943 he protested that \\"The Holy See would fail in its Divine Mandate if it did not deplore these measures, which gravely damage man in his natural right, mainly for the reason that these people belong to a certain race.\\" In June 1942 Pius personally protested against the mass deportations of Jews from France, ordering the papal nuncio to protest to Marshal Philippe P√©tain against \\"the inhuman arrests and deportations of Jews\\".Dalin, 2005, p. 74 In his 1942 Christmas address, Pius voiced concern at the murder of \\"hundreds of thousands\\" of \\"faultless\\" people because of their \\"nationality or race\\". Following the Nazi occupation of Italy, the Pope ordered Rome's Catholic institutions to open themselves to the Jews, sheltering 4,715 of the 5,715 listed for deportation by the Nazis in 150 Catholic institutions. In the Vatican itself, 477 Jews were sheltered . As German round-ups continued in Northern Italy, the Pope opened his summer residence, Castel Gandolfo, to take in thousands of Jews, and authorized institutions across the north to do the same. From 1943, Pius instructed his Bulgarian representative to take \\"all necessary steps\\" to support Bulgarian Jews facing deportation, and his Turkish nuncio, Angelo Roncalli (later Pope John XXIII) arranged for the transfer of thousands of children out of Bulgaria to Palestine. Roncalli also advised the Pope of Jewish concentration camps in Romanian-occupied Transnistria. The Pope protested to the Romanian government and authorized for funds to be sent to the camps. In 1944 Pius appealed directly to the Hungarian government to halt the deportation of the Jews of Hungary and his nuncio, Angelo Rotta, led a citywide rescue scheme in Budapest.http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20684.pdf Upon his death, Pius was praised emphatically by Israel and world leaders for his wartime leadership. But his insistence on Vatican neutrality and failure to explicitly name the Nazis as the evildoers of the conflict became the foundation for later criticisms.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Roman Catholicism - the period of the world wars. Hugh O'Flaherty: the Vatican Pimpernel From his Vatican office, and in co-operation with Pius XII,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/09/hitlers-Pope-pius-xii- holocaust Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty, an Irishman, operated an escape operation for Jews and Allied escapees. In 2012, the Irish Independent newspaper credited him with having saved more than 6,500 people during the war.Vatican's 'Scarlet Pimpernel' honoured; Majella O'Sullivan Irish Independent; 12 November 2012 From 1943, he began to offer shelter to allied servicemen seeking sanctuary in the Vatican. Using fake documents and a clandestine communications network, O'Flaherty defied the Gestapo's war criminal commander of Rome, Herbert Kappler, and evaded capture through the German occupation of Rome. O'Flaherty's '\\"Rome Escape Line\\" hid British and American soldiers and Jews in safe houses around the city. Kappler had a white line drawn around the boundary of the Vatican and offered a bounty on O'Flaherty's head. O'Flaherty forgave Kappler after the war and became a regular visitor to his prison cell ‚Äì eventually presiding at his conversion to Catholicism. O'Flaherty's story was dramatized in the 1983 film The Scarlet and the Black and Ireland honors his work with the Hugh O‚ÄôFlaherty International Humanitarian Award.The priest who converted his enemy; by Stephen Walker, Catholic Herald; 13 April 2011. Church organization Cesare Orsenigo (left, with Hitler and Ribbentrop), nuncio to Germany, also served as de facto nuncio to Poland. Occupying powers often requested that Pius XII reorganize conquered Catholic dioceses. Although such reorganization was generally refused, the decision of Pius XII to appoint German apostolic administrators to occupied Poland was \\"one of his most controversial decisions\\".Blet, 1999, p. 72 These actions were the primary justification of the Polish Provisional Government for declaring the Concordat of 1925 null and void in 1945, an act that had tremendous consequences for post-war Polish-Vatican relations. There was no Apostolic Nuncio to Poland between 1947 and 1989, during the years of communist Poland. Immediate postwar aftermath The Allies liberated Rome on 4‚Äì5 June 1944.Chadwick, 1988, p. 301 During the liberation, many Catholic Allied troops visited the Vatican for Mass and to hear the Pope speak, including some who drove tanks into St. Peter's Square.The Roman Miracle: A Look Back at 70 Years Ago Today by Carol Glatz Catholic News Service The Pope was the greatest celebrity on the Italian peninsula during this period, and ‚Äì given the tarnishment of the King of Italy with fascism ‚Äì there was even talk of extending the temporal power of the papacy. The Pope granted audiences with Allied soldiers and leaders, which were prominently photographed.Chadwick, 1988, p. 302 Pius XII had refrained from creating cardinals during the war. By the end of World War II there were several prominent vacancies, including Cardinal Secretary of State, Camerlengo, Chancellor, and Prefect for the Congregation for the Religious.Chadwick, 1988, p. 304 Pius XII created 32 cardinals in early 1946, having announced his intentions to do so in his preceding Christmas message.

His work is principally semi-abstract Scottish landscapes which are created based upon his experience as a hill walker. Even though he is registered blind Salmon has climbed more than one hundred of Scotland's Munros, many of which have been captured in his artworks. Education and experience Keith Salmon was born in Essex and moved to Wales in the late 1960s. He studied for his BA in art at what is now Shrewsbury College of Arts & Technology and Falmouth School of Art between 1979 and 1983. He originally trained and worked as a sculptor, constructing pieces from steel, wood and cement fondu. On completion of his studies he moved to Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the north east of England where he set up his first studio. In 1989, Salmon moved back to Wales and set up a new studio. Around this time his sight deteriorated very quickly and within a few years he had to stop exhibiting work. He then decided to make the most of the time he still had sight and put his efforts into drawing and painting, finding new methods using just the very limited sight he now had left. In 1998, he moved to Irvine, Ayrshire, in Scotland and, though registered blind, had enough confidence in the new paintings and drawings he created to once again start exhibiting them. During this time his work has developed in two different styles: organised scribbles that form his drawings, and the bolder, broad marks in oil or acrylic paintings. Most of his works are based on his experiences while out walking in the Scottish Highlands. Over the last few years he has combined the scribbled pastel line with the painted acrylic marks, stating that he is \\"trying to capture a little of how I experience these wonderful wild places\\".Depicting the Scottish landscape in art Keith's art was chosen by Microsoft to participate in what the artist called \\"The Oregon Project\\" , an art and sound project which used both a traditional art installation as well as a sound installation, and which was first shown at the 50th celebration of 9e2, originally created by Robert Rauschenberg and then taken to Edinburgh, Scotland. At present Salmon keeps a studio space at Courtyard Studios in IrvineCourtyard Studios and is regularly exhibiting his work again. Awards In 2009, Salmon won the Jolomo AwardJolomo Award for Scottish landscape paintingScottish Landscape Painting award and was interviewed by The Scotsman,Salmon interview one of Scotland's top broadsheet newspapers.

The family originated with boyars from Veliky Novgorod and hails from the clan of Ratsha, a court servant (tiun) to Prince Vsevolod II of Kiev. Later it split in two branches: the Russian and Nordic. The Russian Aminovs were a lineage of the Kuritsyn boyar family, who, in turn, were offspring of the Novgorodian Kamensky clan. The Russian branch is thought to be extinct. The Nordic branch family members live in Sweden and in Finland, and its genealogy branches are represented in Sweden's and Finland's Houses of Nobility. Aminoffs were introduced to Swedish House of Nobility in 1650 with the number of 446, and to Finnish House of Nobility in 1836 with the number of 36.

Nikita Ivanovich Aminov took part in the siege of Kazan in 1552, where he was killed in action. The Russian branch died out in the 18th century.  Von Aminoff  The great-grandson of Nikita Aminov, Fyodor Grigoryevich Aminov (circa 1560-March 28, 1628Von Aminoff//geni.com), was the voivode at Ivangorod. In 1611, he surrendered the town to the Swedes and switched to their side. He moved to the Swedish territory with his immediate family. Soon he was appointed the governor of the Swedish Gdov. In 1618 he was ennobled under the Swedish Crown. Feodor Aminev's mother was Princess Helena Ivanova Golitsin, daughter of Great Novgorod's Governor, Prince Ivan Jurivich Golitsin. Aminoff's is a traditional military family but in 1900s and 2000s they have been involved more in business and industry and as public servants.

Fran√ßois Valentijn (17 April 1666 ‚Äì 6 August 1727) was a Dutch minister, naturalist and author whose Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indi√´n (\\"Old and New East-India\\") describes the history of the Dutch East India Company and the countries of the Far East. Fran√ßois Valentijn was born in 1666 in Dordrecht, Holland, where he lived most his life; however, he is known for his activities in the tropics, notably in Ambon, in the Maluku Archipelago. Valentijn read theology and philosophy at the University of Leiden and the University of Utrecht before leaving for a career as a preacher in the Indies. In total, Valentijn lived in the East Indies 16 years. Valentijn was first employed by the V.O.C. (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie) at the age of 19 as minister to the East Indies, where he became a friend of the German naturalist Georg Eberhard Rumpf (Rumphius). He returned and lived in Holland for about ten years before returning to the Indies in 1705 where he was to serve as army chaplain on an expedition in eastern Java. He finally returned to Dordrecht where he found time to write his Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indi√´n (1724‚Äì26) a massive work of five parts published in eight volumes and containing over one thousand engraved illustrations and some of the most accurate maps of the Indies of the time. He died in The Hague, Netherlands, in 1727. Valentijn probably had access to the V.O.C.'s archive of maps and geographic trade secrets, which they had always guarded jealously. Johannes van Keulen II (d. 1755) became Hydrographer to the V.O.C. at the time Valentijn's Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indi√´n was published. It was in the younger van Keulen's time that many of the VOC charts were first published, one signal of the decline of Dutch dominance in the spice trade. One uncommon grace afforded Valentijn was that he lived to see his work published; the VOC (Dutch East India Company) strictly enforced a policy prohibiting former employees from publishing anything about the region or their colonial administration. And while, as Thomas Su√°rez notes, by the mid-18th century the Dutch no longer feared sharing geographic secrets, E. M. Beekman notes how \\"the execution of this policy was erratic and based on personal motives\\". While Valentijn's maps and diagrams were prized possessions, his scholarship, judging by 21st-century standards was unscrupulous. Valentijn's use of the products of other scientists' and writers' intellectual labour, passing it off as his own, reveals a penchant for self-aggrandisement. Beekman nevertheless cites him as an important figure and, given his writing style, diction and aptitude for narrative, one of the greatest Dutch prose writers of the time.

Gedney (born April 4, 1915 in Orchards, Washington; died November 14, 1999 in Ann Arbor, Michigan) was an American linguist and Southeast Asian language specialist. Gedney did extensive work relating to Tai historical linguistics. Life Gedney was born in Orchards, Washington, and spent his childhood there. He was the son of John Marshall Gedney and Viola Gedney (nee Woster), the descendants of English immigrants. Gedney's father died of pneumonia in 1918, when Gedney was three years old. In 1935, Gedney graduated magna cum laude from Whitman College. After graduation, Gedney lived in Leavenworth, Washington and worked as a high school English teacher. During the summers, he occupied himself seriously with linguistics. After the outbreak of the Second World War, he was drafted into the army in August 1942 and assigned to the Army Language Unit in New York City, where he began to work with the Thai language. During this period in New York he also began doctoral studies in Sanskrit at Yale University as a student of Franklin Edgerton. He completed his PhD in 1947, with the dissertation Indic Loanwords in Spoken Thai. He then moved to Thailand, where he studied Thai language and literature, working with some of the most important scholars of the country. He met Choy Manachip, a native of Ayutthaya Province, there in Thailand, and they wed in 1953. Mrs. Gedney was one of the native speakers of Thai consulted for the Thai grammars written by Richard B. Noss (1954, expanded 1964). Gedney was professor of linguistics at the University of Ceylon 1959-60, then in 1960 took a position teaching linguistics and Thai at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he was in the English department until a department of linguistics was formed there in 1963. In his early years at Michigan, he helped develop the first Thai language training program for the Peace Corps. Gedney taught at the University of Michigan until his retirement in 1980, and served as chair of the linguistics department from 1972-75\\\\. During his career, Gedney was active in the Linguistic Society of America, the American Oriental Society, the Siam Society, the Association for Asian Studies and Southeast Asian Linguistics Society. In 1981, he served as vice president of the American Oriental Society, and in 1982 as president. During his years of study Gedney began collecting Thai literature, ultimately building a 14,000 volume collection, which he donated in 1975 to the University of Michigan. Gedney specialized throughout his career on documenting the Tai‚ÄìKadai languages. He sought in particular many in the less spoken languages of this family in Southeast Asia and southern China in order to capture the characteristics of these languages. He was known for the accuracy of his notes on the tonal and phonological characteristics of these languages, and developed important word lists and representations for the study and comparisons of their tone. In all Gedney worked on over 22 languages, including Saek, Lue, and Yay, often creating the first dictionaries of those languages. His findings have been published in an eight-volume series with the Center for South and South East Asian Studies at the University of Michigan, edited by Thomas John Hudak, one of Gedney's students. By focusing on data and his extensive knowledge of the Tai‚ÄìKadai languages, Gedney established himself as a leader in the comparative-historical study of Tai languages and dialects. But his influence went far beyond linguistics. Researchers from other disciplines including history, political science, art history and anthropology sought his advice. William J.

He flew a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a in \\"Mick\\" Mannock's flight of 85 Squadron, and gained his first two victories there, destroying a Fokker D.VII each on 24 July and 22 August 1918.

He teamed with fellow ace Elliott White Springs and two other pilots for his next win, and then independently destroyed two more D.VIIs‚Äîone each on 26 September and 3 October 1918. Ralston was finally awarded a Distinguished Service Cross in 1921. Honors and awards Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) The Distinguished Service Cross is presented to Orville Alfred Ralston, First Lieutenant (Air Service), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in action over Bourlon Wood, September 26, 1918. Having engine trouble, Lieutenant Ralston signaled his flight commander, left his formation, and started for the lines. Shortly afterwards his engine picked up and he decided to rejoin his formation. He found three of them engaged with seven Fokker biplanes over Bourlon Wood. Seeing that one of our machines was hard pressed and in distress, Lieutenant Ralston instantly went to its assistance and drove one Fokker down into the clouds below. He followed directly behind the enemy machine and, as they came out of the clouds at a height of 3,000 feet, opened fire again on this Fokker at 15 yards range. The enemy machine made one complete spiral and crashed northeast of Bourion Wood. Four more Fokkers now attacked Lieutenant Ralston, but he managed to get back in the clouds and return safely to our lines, as did the rest of his flight.

By 1936 Carpenter's Bluff had a population of seventy-five and four businesses. Ten years later the population had increased to 120, and the town still had four businesses.Hart, 2009. Carpenter's Bluff Bridge Completed in the late summer of 1910 as a railroad bridge for the Missouri, Oklahoma & Gulf Railroad (MO&G;) line, this landmark structure was part of a line through Grayson County to connect with other railways in order to secure better freight rates for their shipments from the Oklahoma coal mines.Miller, 2009. The bridge was designed to withstand major floods such as the one in 1908 that had destroyed several area bridges. Its design also included a wagon shelf, an extra lane to serve travelers on foot and horseback, as well as horse-drawn vehicles, all of whom had to pay a toll for its use.Miller, 2009. In 1921, ownership passed to the Kansas, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad (KO&G;), which maintained the line until 1965, when the company ceased operations in Texas due to declining rail traffic.Miller, 2009. The Texas and Pacific Railway maintained the bridge for a brief time and then deeded it to the counties of Grayson and Bryan. County commissioners agreed to convert the structure for vehicular traffic, and upon completion of that work, the bridge was opened as a free public thoroughfare.Miller, 2009.

The character was created by the Welsh author Gwynedd Rae and first appeared in the book Mostly Mary in 1930. The last original book, Mary Plain's Whodunnit, was published in 1965. The books were reissued as paperbacks in the 1970s, and new editions of Mostly Mary and All Mary were published in the 1990s. In 2017, further editions of four of the books were issued by Egmont. Characters and story Mary Plain and her bear family feature in the stories, but the main characters are Mary and her human friend, the Owl Man. (The name refers to his spectacles.) He is kind and indulgent to Mary. He often takes her on outings. Mary and her friends can speak, but although anthropomorphic in that respect and in other aspects of their behaviour, the author is careful to point out that she is not a teddy bear. Similarly, although Mary learns to write (in rebuses) she does not wear clothes. Mary and her family live in the Bear Pits at Bern, in Switzerland. Mary's behaviour is much like that of a small child, with the Owl Man acting as a surrogate parent, guiding her through life and helping her out of trouble. Style The books are written in chapter form, with illustrations throughout and on the cover (front cover on original editions, front and back on paperback editions). The cover illustrations were updated in the 1970s and the references in some books were updated to change the currency to decimal coinage and to feature a Blue Peter presenter John Noakes instead of the older Uncle Mac from Children's Hour. Illustrators The original illustrator for Mostly Mary and All Mary was Harry Rountree. From the third book onward, and in subsequent editions of the first two books, the illustrations were by Irene Williamson. New illustrations by Janina Ede were commissioned for the Knight Books reprints in the late 1960s and 1970s; the Egmont Press editions have illustrations by Clara Vulliamy.

The main provisions of the regulation were that bananas sold as unripened, green bananas should be green and unripened, firm and intact, fit for human consumption, not \\"affected by rotting\\", clean, free of pests and damage from pests, free from deformation or abnormal curvature, free from bruising, free of any foreign smell or taste. The minimum size (with tolerances and exceptions) is a length of 14 cm and a thickness (grade) of 2.7 cm. It specifies minimum standards for specific quality classifications of bananas (Extra, Class I, Class II). Only Extra class bananas have to comply fully with the shape specifications. Class II bananas, for instance are permitted to have \\"defects of shape\\"; Class I bananas are permitted only \\"slight defects of shape\\". This is not true, however, of the size specifications; sale of bananas below the minimum size is almost always prohibited (with exceptions only for bananas from a few regions where bananas are traditionally smaller). Applicability The regulation took effect on 1 January 1995. It applied directly, in its entirety, in all member states of the European Union. It was repealed by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1333/2011 of 19 December 2011 laying down marketing standards for bananas, rules on the verification of compliance with those marketing standards and requirements for notifications in the banana sector with effect as of 9 January 2012. Bent bananas This regulation requires that bananas as a minimum standard must not have \\"abnormal curvature\\",http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1994R2257:20060217:EN:PDF although no definition or guidance was given about the degree of curvature that would be regarded as \\"abnormal\\". This led to various stories about an EU ban on curved bananas. This has been frequently repeated by pro-Europeans and Euro-sceptics alike; the former tending to regard it as an apocryphal or misleading Euromyth and the latter regarding it as an example of needless European bureaucracy. On 29 July 2008, the European Commission held a preliminary vote concerning the repeal of certain regulations related to the quality of specific fruit and vegetables that included provisions related to size and shape. According to the Commission's press release, \\"In this era of high prices and growing demand, it makes no sense to throw these products away or destroy them.\\" The Agriculture Commissioner stated, \\"This is a concrete example of our drive to cut red tape and I will continue to push until it goes through. [...] It shouldn't be the EU's job to regulate these things. It is far better to leave it to market operators.\\" Regulation 1221/2008 took effect as of 1 July 2009. Though neither the press release cited above nor Regulation 1221/2008 made any mention of bananas or Regulation 2257/94, some reports of the changes treated them as including the banana quality standards regulation and contained explicit or apparent references to this regulation, using expressions such as \\"the infamous 'straight banana' ruling\\". Some sources have claimed this to be an admission that the original regulations did indeed ban \\"bent bananas\\".

He was the brother of the satirist Alexandros Soutsos and cousin of writer and diplomat Alexandros Rizos Rangavis. Soutsos is known to be one of the pioneers of romanticism in Greek poetry and prose as well as a visionary behind the new Olympic Games who inspired Evangelis Zappas to sponsor their revival.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/557030/Panayotis- SoutsosYoung (1996) p. 14 Life View of the Phanarion quarter, the historical centre of the Greek community of Constantinople in Ottoman times, ca. 1900 The Soutzos family was an important family of Phanariotes in Constantinople, many members of which were men of letters:Mackridge (2009) p. 182 his maternal uncle was Iakovos Pizos Neroulos, while his sister, Aikaterini Soutsou, was a poet. He was homeschooled by many important intellectuals of that time, and from 1818 till 1820, he and his brother studied in the School of Chios by educators such as Neophytos Vamvas and Constantinos Vardalachos. In 1820, due to the passing of their father, Konstantinos Soutsos, the two brothers moved to TransylvaniaYoung (2002) p. 140 where they stayed for a short while with their uncle. In April of the same year they departed to Paris with a recommendation letter of their uncle in order to meet Adamantios Korais. After moving again to Italy two years later, they both finally moved to Greece in 1825. Following his arrival in Greece, he settled down in Nafplio in 1833, at the time the capital of the newly formed Greek State. There he started a political career and began writing his first poems. In 1830, he was appointed secretary of the senate by Ioannis Kapodistrias. However, he soon objected to his practices and lost his position. He was enthusiastic about the coming of King Otto and supported the work of the regency in his newspaper Helios (·º≠ŒªŒπŒøœÇ; Greek for Sun)Young (2002) p. 141 until the enactment of the heterogeneous law in 1843, under which citizens born in occupied territories no longer had the right of employment in the public sector. His political ideas turned into staunch conservatism ever since, something that also became evident through his use of an at times even atticizing language. His life was later marked by several misfortunes. His first wife, Florentia Kopanitsa, died in 1841 at the age of 25 and his second one, Smaragda Soutsou, in 1845. His third wife, Marina Logotheti, left him in 1861. During the same period his brother Alexandros was dealing with many prosecutions due to his anti-governmental sentiments. Soutsos died in 1868 after chronic health problems and with most of his wealth gone. Work Panagiotis Soutsos, along with his brother, was the originator of romanticism in poetry and prose of the First Athenian SchoolMackridge (2009) p. 167 with his poem The Wayfarer (·Ωâ ·ΩâŒ¥ŒøŒπœÄœåœÅŒøœÇ) in 1831 and his novel Leander (·Ωâ ŒõŒ≠Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ) in 1834. The Wayfarer is a dialogic poem with a dramatic form but no scenic intention. The story revolves around the love between two young people, the Wayfarer and Rallou, which is presented in accordance with romantic motifs; a love that is met with various obstacles and which, ultimately unfulfilled, brings both protagonists to death. Central to the poem are themes of distraction, religion, and heartbreak. Soutsos kept editing the poem throughout his life, and every edition (1842, 1851, 1864) contained an increasingly archaic form of Greek, whereas his first edition was written in plain Katharevousa. Overall, Soutsos' poems are dominated by the lyric and elegiac tone, with the main subjects being religion, love and freedom, and all influenced by French Romanticism. Konstantinos Asopios Leander, the first novel of the freed Greek State, is an epistolary novel with heavy influence from Ugo Foscolo's The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis and Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther. His second novel, Charitine, or The Beauty of the Christian Faith, according to its subtitle \\"Antidote for the nonsense of Ernest Renan against the deity of Jesus Christ\\" (·ºÄŒΩœÑŒØŒ¥ŒøœÑŒøŒΩ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÑ·øÜœÇ Œ∏ŒµœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒøœÇ œÑŒø·ø¶ ·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒø·ø¶ ŒªŒ∑œÅŒ∑ŒºŒ¨œÑœâŒΩ œÑŒø·ø¶ ·ºòœÅŒΩŒ≠œÉœÑŒøœÖ Œ°ŒµŒΩŒ¨œáŒøœÖ) has as its goal to refute the ideas of Ernest Renan. Other noteworthy stories of his were anonymously published in his newspaper. Memoirs of a Parrot (·ºàœÄŒøŒºŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒøŒΩŒµœçŒºŒ±œÑŒ± ·ºëŒΩ·Ω∏œÇ œàŒπœÑœÑŒ±Œ∫Œø·ø¶) follows the narrative of a talking animal commenting on and criticizing the behavior of humans, and Œ§œÅŒπœÉœáŒπŒªŒπœåœÄŒ∑œáŒøœÇ is a science fiction story. In 1853, Soutsos' opinions on language were laid out in his essay New School of the Written Word, or Resurrection of the Ancient Greek Language Understood by All (ŒùŒ≠Œ± Œ£œáŒøŒª·Ω¥ œÑŒø·ø° Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒøŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÖ ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÖ ·º¢ ·ºàŒΩŒ¨œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπœÇ œÑ·øÜœÇ ·ºÄœÅœáŒ±ŒØŒ±œÇ ·ºëŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫·øÜœÇ Œ≥ŒªœéœÉœÉŒ∑œÇ ·ºêŒΩŒΩŒøŒøœÖŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑œÇ ·ΩëœÄ·Ω∏ œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ), in which he objects to Korais' \\"middle way\\" in language reform in favour of fully reviving Ancient Greek, since in his eyes that was the language understood by most Greeks. He goes on to dismiss Demotic Greek as a language ridden with dialects and not always intelligible. Soutsos' linguistic positions were in response to a larger topic of discussion popular in mid-19th century Greece, the Greek language question. His written proposal drew an immediate counter-attack from academic Konstantinos Asopios, notably in his essay The Soutseia, or Mr Panagiotis Soutsos scrutinized as a Grammarian, Philologist, Schoolmaster, Metrician and Poet (Œ§·Ω∞ Œ£ŒøœçœÑœÉŒµŒπŒ±, ·º§œÑŒøŒπ ·Ωâ Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒπœéœÑŒ∑œÇ Œ£Œø·ø¶œÑœÉŒøœÇ ·ºêŒΩ Œ≥œÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫Œø·øñœÇ, ·ºêŒΩ œÜŒπŒªŒøŒªœåŒ≥Œø·øñœÇ, ·ºêŒΩ œÉœáŒøŒªŒ¨œÅœáŒ±·øñœÇ, ·ºêŒΩ ŒºŒµœÑœÅŒπŒ∫Œø·øñœÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêŒΩ œÄŒøŒπŒ∑œÑŒ±·øñœÇ ·ºêŒæŒµœÑŒ±Œ∂œåŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ). After pointing out errors and solecisms in Soutsos' own language, Asopios went on to defend Korais' \\"simplifying\\" approach on language, albeit with the addition of his own selection of archaisms. Their feud sparked a small war of pamphlets from other pedants competing to expose grammatical inconsistencies, errors and phrases literally translated from French in the works of their rivals, with proposals for implementing their own sets of rules. Olympic revival movement Soutsos admired the ancient Greek tradition and often wandered in the ancient ruins. In 1833 he published the poem Dialogue of the Dead, in which the ghost of Plato surveys his tattered land in dismay, wonders if he is really looking at Greece and addresses:Young (2004) p. 141 This work was the first reference for the revival of the ancient Olympic Games, as part of the revival of the ancient Greek tradition.Golden (2009) p. 128 Later, in 1835, he put his thoughts into action by writing to the Greek minister of interior, Ioannis Kolettis suggesting that 25 March, the anniversary of the outbreak of the Greek war of independence, should be declared a national holiday.Golden (2009) p. 129 Soutsos proposed that in this anniversary festivities should be held including a revival of the ancient Olympics. The idea of marking 25 March as national holiday was approved, but the Olympic revival plans appear to have been stalemated that time. Finally, in early 1856, a wealthy merchant of the Greek diaspora in Romania, Evangelis Zappas, inspired by this revival effort was determined to found the Olympics and suggested to the Greek government to sponsor the entire project of the Olympic revival, providing also cash prizes for the victors. In 13 July 1856, Panagiotis Soutsos wrote and published an article titled \\"Evangelis Zappas\\" in his own newspaper, making Zappas' proposal widely known to the public and triggering a series of events.Young (1996) p. 15 On 15 November 1859, 25 years after he conceived the idea, the first modern revival of the athletic Olympic Games took place in Athens. Moreover, on 18 October 1859, when his Olympic dream became reality, he published an account of the Games' events paying tribute to its sponsor, Evangelis Zappas.Matthews (2005) p. 51 Bibliography Newspapers * Helios (·º≠ŒªŒπŒøœÇ, 1833) Poetry * Poems (Œ†ŒøŒπŒÆœÉŒµŒπœÇ, 1831) * The Guitar (·º© ŒöŒπŒ∏Œ¨œÅŒ±, 1835) Prose * Memoirs of a Parrot (·ºàœÄŒøŒºŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒøŒΩŒµœçŒºŒ±œÑŒ± ·ºëŒΩ·Ω∏œÇ œàŒπœÑœÑŒ±Œ∫Œø·ø¶, 1833) * ·Ωâ Œ§œÅŒπœÉœáŒπŒªŒπœåœÄŒ∑œáŒøœÇ, 1833 * Leander (·Ωâ ŒõŒ≠Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ, 1834) * Charitine, or The Beauty of the Christian Faith (·º© ŒßŒ±œÅŒπœÑŒØŒΩŒ∑ ·º¢ Œ§·Ω∏ Œ∫Œ¨ŒªŒªŒøœÇ œÑ·øÜœÇ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ±ŒΩŒπŒ∫·øÜœÇ Œ∏œÅŒ∑œÉŒ∫ŒµŒØŒ±œÇ, 1864) Plays * The Messiah (·Ωâ ŒúŒµœÉœÉŒØŒ±œÇ, 1839) * Euthymius Blachabas (·Ωâ Œï·ΩêŒ∏œçŒºŒπŒøœÇ ŒíŒªŒ±œáŒ¨Œ≤Œ±œÇ, 1839) * The Stranger (·Ωâ ·ºåŒ≥ŒΩœâœÉœÑŒøœÇ, 1842) * Karaiskakis (·Ωâ ŒöŒ±œÅŒ±œäœÉŒ∫Œ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ, 1842) Essays * New School of the Written Word, or Resurrection of the Ancient Greek Language Understood by All (ŒùŒ≠Œ± Œ£œáŒøŒª·Ω¥ œÑŒø·ø° Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒøŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÖ ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÖ ·º¢ ·ºàŒΩŒ¨œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπœÇ œÑ·øÜœÇ ·ºÄœÅœáŒ±ŒØŒ±œÇ ·ºëŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫·øÜœÇ Œ≥ŒªœéœÉœÉŒ∑œÇ ·ºêŒΩŒΩŒøŒøœÖŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑œÇ ·ΩëœÄ·Ω∏ œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ, 1853) References Sources   Category:Founders of the modern Olympic Games Category:1806 births Category:1868 deaths Category:Modern Greek poets Category:First Athenian School Category:Romantic poets Panagiotis Category:People from Istanbul Category:19th-century Greek poets ","title":"Panagiotis Soutsos"},{"id":"24455202","text":"The Bathurst Mining Camp is a mining district in northeast New Brunswick, Canada, centred in the Nepisiguit River valley, and near to Bathurst. The camp hosts 45 known volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits typical of the Appalachian Mountains. Some of the ore is smelted at the Belledune facility of Xstrata. Although the primary commodity is zinc, the massive-sulphide ore body produces lead, zinc, copper, silver, gold, bismuth, antimony and cadmium. History Loring Bailey, the professor of geology at UNB in 1864, wrote that: The Bathurst Mining Camp was the location of an iron mine, for a time ending early in the 20th century. The Northern New Brunswick and Seaboard (NNB&S;) railroad was built from the Intercolonial Railway line near Bathurst approximately 17 miles up the Nepisiguit River to service the mines, but had a short history, terminating in 1918 when it officially ceased operation due to the closure of the iron mine in 1913. The railroad passed into the hands of the provincial government, who were the guarantors of the bonds financing the NNB&S.; By 1959 the provincial government had all of the remaining rails lifted. A massive sulphide orebody was discovered in 1953. In 1963 the 14 mile line to Brunswick Mines from Nepisiguit Junction was rebuilt by Canadian National Railways to serve the then-projected zinc mine resulting from the 1953 discovery.traingeek.ca: \\"Nepisiguit Junction\\" Zinc production at Brunswick Mine began in 1964. On 9 March 1987, a derailment occurred at Nepisiguit Junction when a runaway CN train journeyed from Brunswick Mines to just short of the wye. There was a mixup in communications and the engineer ended up with more cars on his train than he thought, and the brakes on the engine alone were unable to hold the train on the grade in the Brunswick Mines yard. After a harrowing journey at speeds up to 70 mph the engines derailed on the sharp curve into the wye at Nepisiguit Junction. Both units and most of the 30-car train derailed, but the engineer was not seriously injured. The zinc mine operated continuously since 1964 until April 2013, surviving economic ups and downs and four major changes in ownership to produce approximately 150 million tonnes of ore at grades of 8.46% Zn, 3.33% Pb, 0.37% Cu, and 99 g/t Ag.canadianminingjournal.com: \\"CLOSURE: Brunswick mine closes on a high note\\", 30 Apr 2013 Geology The Geology of the Bathurst Mining Camp (BMC) is a base metal copper, lead and zinc mainly volcanogenic hosted mineral rich area of north central New Brunswick. BMC geology is diverse having experienced considerable tectonic activity from the Ordovician to the Jurassic periods. Geological activity accumulated sulfide minerals into local vent complex sea floor basalts, creating VHMS volcanogenic hosted massive sulfide and SEDEX sedimentary exhalative deposit depositional environments, which were all later accreted and folded onto the margin of the continental crust which formed the Appalachian Mountains during numerous mountain building events. Additionally the east coast was a highly active regional geological zone experiencing volcanism similar to the Yellowstone along the edge of the Appalachian Mountains of New Brunswick and Maine. The BMC land area is the grave yards of both the Iapetus and Rheic ocean basins which were subducted under the thicker continental crust and down into the mantle. The region is mainly known for VHMS and SEDEX environments while it also hosts epithermal, mesothermal and a number of other mineral deposit forming environments. VHMS and SEDEX environments are the primary mineral hosting dynamics producing base and precious metals. Gold and silver are generally low grade associated with zinc and lead rich areas. The gold and silver are present as invisible disseminations within other minerals. The BMC country rock is also highly intruded by magma plumes. One such plume is on Mount Edward, part of the Notre Dame Mountains, which was exposed by glacial erosion.

Cir. 2002), was a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. It affirmed that public use or commercialization of an invention more than one year prior to the filing date will cost the inventor his patent rights (see also ). The inventor in this case was Allan M. Konrad, a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory employee who devised and implemented a method for accessing and searching data objects stored on a remote computer (U.S. patents 5,544,320; 5,696,901; 5,974,444). Netscape moved to invalidate Konrad's patents in U.S. district court immediately after Konrad filed a patent infringement suit against Netscape customers. The district court concluded that Konrad's patents were invalid because they did not meet the public-use and on-sale bar eligibility criteria of . In particular, the district court found that Konrad (1) placed his invention in the public domain by demonstrating it to others without a confidentiality agreement and (2) tried to sell it to other legal entities, both more than one year before he filed for the patent. The appeals court, upon review, affirmed the district court decision for the same reasons.  Background  Alan M. Konrad owns U.S patents 5,544,320; 5,696,901; 5,974,444; all concerning a system for accessing and searching a database residing on a remote computer. On February 8, 2000, Konrad filed a patent infringement suit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against thirty-nine customers of Netscape Communications Corp., including Microsoft Corp. and America Online, Inc. Netscape, acting in the interest of its customer relationships, asked the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to invalidate Konrad's patents via a declaratory judgment. Netscape argued that Konrad's system was in public use and on-sale before Jan. 8, 1992‚Äîexactly one year before he filed the first patent for this invention. According to , a patent is valid unless \\"the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States\\". Netscape prevailed in its argument; the district court judged the patent to be invalid on June 18, 2001. Konrad then appealed the decision to the U.S Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  Facts  Konrad began his employment at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in 1977. On September 8, 1990, Konrad tested a method for searching a database residing on a remote computer. Shortly thereafter, Konrad disclosed his invention to LBNL's patent office (October 1990), but filed for the first of his three patents only on January 8, 1993, thus establishing a January 8, 1992 (i.e., one year prior) bar date for public use and sale under . In the time between the first successful test and bar date, Konrad demonstrated his invention to University of California computing personnel without having them execute a confidentiality agreement, and offered to adapt his invention for use at the University Research Association Superconducting Super Collider Laboratory and Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in exchange for money.  Issues  In his appeal, Konrad argued that the district court was wrong to conclude that his patents were invalid. In particular, he argued that he did not publicly use or attempt to sell his patents before the critical date, as required by . By the legal precedent set in Petrolite Corp. v. Baker Hugher, Inc., an invention has been publicly used if it was used by \\"a person other than the inventor who is under no limitation, restriction or obligation of secrecy to the inventor\\". By legal precedent set in Group One, Ltd. v. Hallmark Cards, Inc., an invention has been offered for sale if \\"it rises to the level of a commercial offer for sale, one which the other party could make into a binding contract by simple acceptance.\\" Furthermore, the sale must be between two separate legal entities per In re Caveney.  Public use   Konrad's argument  Konrad admitted demonstrating his invention before the critical date without explicitly communicating to his audience that it was confidential. Regardless, Konrad argued that this demonstration does not meet the public use criteria for three reasons. First, he argued that because LBNL and the demonstration audience were both funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, the invention disclosure he made to the LBNL patent office before the demonstration allowed for an implicit expectation of confidentiality. Second, he argued that the demonstration was an experiment and thus cannot be considered public use under legal precedent established in Baxter v. Cobe. Finally, he argued that he did not disclose every limitation of his invention.  Court's decision  The appeals court rejected all three of Konrad's arguments. First, the court noted that even though Konrad disclosed his invention to LBNL, a common funding source is not sufficient to carry an expectation of confidentiality. In particular, the contract between LBNL and the U.S. Department of Energy requires that LBNL \\"provides for the protection of government property\\", \\"safeguard restricted data\\" and to \\"provide written disclosures\\", but says nothing about the confidentiality of U.S. Department of Energy funded projects. Second, the court concluded that Konrad's demonstration cannot be considered an experiment because he provided \\"no objective evidence to support experimental use.\\" Namely, Konrad failed to \\"maintain records of testing\\" and, in some cases, was not in full control of his invention‚Äîhe let people try it out without monitoring them. In fact, the court used Konrad's own testimony that the purpose of the demonstration \\"was to convince the people that...there was a viable project\\" to conclude that his intent was to gain endorsements rather than experimentation. Finally, the court concluded that, even though Konrad may not have revealed every limitation, the difference between what was revealed and the actual invention would have been obvious to a person with reasonable technical skills. This, the court claimed, was supported by the legal precedent of Lough v. Brunswick Corp. Here the court leveraged Konrad's own testimony that the starter client used in the actual invention \\"is very similar to, if not the same as, software program icons created to quickly initiate a program\\", and hence can be easily derived from the demonstration, which featured initialization via a terminal.  On-sale bar   Konrad's argument  Konrad admitted offering to adapt his invention for use at the University Research Association Superconducting Super Collider Laborator and Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in return for compensation. However, Konrad argued that this was not a sale because those labs, just like his employer LBNL, were funded by the Department of Energy and hence are the same legal entity. Then by precedent established in In re Caveney, he argued, the offer is not a sale, but a mere \\"accounting instrument used to track the transfer of research funds between two Department of Energy laboratories.\\"  Court's decision  The appeals court rejected Konrad's argument. Legal precedent requires that in the case where seller and buyer are funded by the same entity, the existence of a sale depends on whether the funding agency can prohibit public disclosure. In this case, however, the court concluded that the Department of Energy doesn't exercise enough control over the labs to prevent them from leaking the invention to the public: \\"All indications are that the DoE funded specific projects at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the Superconducting Super Collider Laboratory, and Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, but never exercised such control over them, as to render all part of the same entity.\\"  Impact   Separate entities  The application of the on-sale bar requires that the buyer and seller be \\"separate entities\\". However, prior to this case, what constitutes separate entities was considered by courts to be very vague.The Commercial Offer Prong of the On-Sale Bar, After Pfaff. IP Litigator. September 2002 In fact, courts had traditionally used a \\"totality of circumstances\\" test (one in which all the facts are examined) to determine whether buyer and seller are indeed separate entities. A major impact of this case was that it clarified what it means to be separate entities. In particular, the Netscape appeals court formulated a test to determine whether buyer and seller are in fact two separate entities as follows: > Where, as in this case, both parties to an alleged commercial offer for sale > receive research funds from the same entity, it may be more difficult to > determine whether the inventor is attempting to commercialize his invention. > Accordingly, in such cases whether there is a bar depends on whether the > seller so controls the purchaser that the invention remains out of the > public's hands. Despite the clarification, the test still requires a fact-based analysis of the degree to which one entity \\"controls\\" the other.

It was developed to address the attribute-independence problem of the popular naive Bayes classifier. It frequently develops substantially more accurate classifiers than naive Bayes at the cost of a modest increase in the amount of computation.Webb, G. I., J. Boughton, and Z. Wang (2005). \\"Not So Naive Bayes: Aggregating One-Dependence Estimators\\". Machine Learning, 58(1), 5‚Äì24.  The AODE classifier  AODE seeks to estimate the probability of each class y given a specified set of features x1, ... xn, P(y x1, ... xn). To do so it uses the formula :\\\\hat{P}(y\\\\mid x_1, \\\\ldots x_n)=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i:1\\\\leq i\\\\leq n \\\\wedge F(x_i)\\\\geq m} \\\\hat{P}(y,x_i)\\\\prod_{j=1}^n\\\\hat{P}(x_j\\\\mid y,x_i)}{\\\\sum_{y^\\\\prime\\\\in Y}\\\\sum_{i:1\\\\leq i\\\\leq n \\\\wedge F(x_i)\\\\geq m} \\\\hat{P}(y^\\\\prime,x_i)\\\\prod_{j=1}^n\\\\hat{P}(x_j\\\\mid y^\\\\prime,x_i)} where \\\\hat{P}(\\\\cdot) denotes an estimate of P(\\\\cdot), F(\\\\cdot) is the frequency with which the argument appears in the sample data and m is a user specified minimum frequency with which a term must appear in order to be used in the outer summation. In recent practice m is usually set at 1.  Derivation of the AODE classifier  We seek to estimate P(y x1, ... xn). By the definition of conditional probability :P(y\\\\mid x_1, \\\\ldots x_n)=\\\\frac{P(y, x_1, \\\\ldots x_n)}{P(x_1, \\\\ldots x_n)}. For any 1\\\\leq i\\\\leq n, :P(y, x_1, \\\\ldots x_n)=P(y, x_i)P(x_1, \\\\ldots x_n\\\\mid y, x_i). Under an assumption that x1, ... xn are independent given y and xi, it follows that :P(y, x_1, \\\\ldots x_n)=P(y, x_i)\\\\prod_{j=1}^n P(x_j\\\\mid y, x_i). This formula defines a special form of One Dependence Estimator (ODE), a variant of the naive Bayes classifier that makes the above independence assumption that is weaker (and hence potentially less harmful) than the naive Bayes' independence assumption. In consequence, each ODE should create a less biased estimator than naive Bayes. However, because the base probability estimates are each conditioned by two variables rather than one, they are formed from less data (the training examples that satisfy both variables) and hence are likely to have more variance. AODE reduces this variance by averaging the estimates of all such ODEs.  Features of the AODE classifier  Like naive Bayes, AODE does not perform model selection and does not use tuneable parameters. As a result, it has low variance. It supports incremental learning whereby the classifier can be updated efficiently with information from new examples as they become available. It predicts class probabilities rather than simply predicting a single class, allowing the user to determine the confidence with which each classification can be made. Its probabilistic model can directly handle situations where some data are missing. AODE has computational complexity O(ln^2) at training time and O(kn^2) at classification time, where n is the number of features, l is the number of training examples and k is the number of classes. This makes it infeasible for application to high-dimensional data. However, within that limitation, it is linear with respect to the number of training examples and hence can efficiently process large numbers of training examples. Implementations The free Weka machine learning suite includes an implementation of AODE.

In 1994, the cartoon was ranked in 23rd place of The 50 Greatest Cartoons. It is essentially a retelling of the Aesop fable, \\"The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse\\". Plot The film opens with a stereotypical hillbilly version of Little Red Riding Hood (voiced by Colleen Collins), telling the audience that she's taking \\"nourishment\\" (as she holds up a clich√© moonshine bottle) to her grandma, who lives on a country farm. At the farmhouse, a wolf (voiced by Pinto Colvig) reveals himself to the audience, but confesses that he doesn't want to eat Red. He's actually in love with her and wishes to kiss her. After a comical chase around the farmhouse, the wolf catches Red, and both prepare to kiss each other when a telegram arrives for the wolf from his city cousin (voiced by Daws Butler impersonating Ronald Colman), inviting him to meet the city's equivalent of his Red (the same version seen in Red Hot Riding Hood). Upon seeing her photograph, the country wolf immediately falls in love with her and departs for the city. Unlike his cousin, the city wolf is rich and more suave and sophisticated. The city wolf takes his cousin to the club where the city's Red performs her dance routine (this scene was borrowed from Swing Shift Cinderella). The country wolf whistles and leers throughout the performance, becoming completely aroused by Red. However, before he can rush onto the stage to join her, his city cousin stops him (by grabbing his suspenders, placing a hammer in it, then letting go so it would snap back and knock him out), and takes him back to the country, feeling that city life is too much for him. Upon their arrival at the farmhouse, they find the country's Red waiting for them. Upon seeing country-Red, the city wolf, surprisingly, becomes wildly attracted to her, and runs to her, but is stopped his country cousin the same way the city cousin had stopped him earlier. Seeing an opportunity to see the city's Red again, the country wolf promptly decides to take his city cousin back home, claiming that he feels the country life is too much for him, and drives off back to the city.

It is located at East 47th Street and South Michigan Avenue, just one block east of the former Chicago Housing Authority's Robert Taylor Homes site. In total, the building is made up of 421 apartments, a large landscaped courtyard, and retail space at street level. It was originally built as non-governmental subsidized housing and is considered to be among the earliest mixed-use housing developments. History The building was constructed in 1929 by philanthropist Julius Rosenwald, then president of Sears, Roebuck & Company. The housing project was modeled after the Dunbar Apartments built by John D. Rockefeller, Jr., in 1926 in Harlem, New York City. In 1981, Michigan Boulevard Garden Apartments received National Register of Historic Places designation. The last residents moved out in 2000, after mismanagement and lack of upkeep made the site uninhabitable. In 2010, filming for the 2011 film Transformers: Dark of the Moon was done on site. In the movie, the apartments doubled as part of the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine. In 2015, a complete renovation of the building and courtyard, which had been added to the National Register of Historic Places, began. The intention was to create a mixture of senior citizen apartments and affordable housing for families.Work set to start on $109-million rehab of Rosenwald apartments , Sam Cholke, DNAInfo, January 7, 2015 The rebuilding and landscaping was completed in 2016, and the site reopened to the public as Rosenwald Courts.

The book is intended to showcase the company's history, containing 450 pictures of Apple products released from 1998 to 2015. Designed by Apple in California received praise for its showcase of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' work and the book's physical design, while it took criticism for being considered a \\"vanity project\\" and the fact that many of its pictures were already publicized. Synopsis The book contains 450 photographs of new and old Apple products taken by Andrew Zuckerman, showcased on stark white backgrounds. They cover 20 years of the company's product design, from the iMac G3 released in 1998 to the Apple Pencil released in 2015, although not all products during that timeframe are included. In addition to its photographs, the book also discusses the materials used in Apple products and techniques used by the company's design team. The book was dedicated to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and contains an introduction written by Apple chief design officer Jonathan Ive. Ive described the book as an \\"archive\\". Apple stated that the book is printed on \\"specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink\\", and that it was linen-bound, hardcover, and developed \\"over an eight-year period\\". Release The book was announced by Apple Inc. on November 15, 2016. It was published in two sizes, a \\"small\\" version measuring 10.2 inches by 12.75 inches (260x324mm) for $199 (¬£169), and a \\"large\\" version measuring 13 inches by 16.25 inches (330x413mm) for $299 (¬£249), sold by Apple online and in some of its retail Apple Store locations. The book was discontinued by Apple in August 2019, selling out worldwide by September of the same year. Reception Rene Ritchie of iMore gave a positive review, noting that the book \\"collects and catalogs the products willed into the world by Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, and the team they assembled in Cupertino\\" and that it \\"is one of the most finely crafted books [he has] ever owned\\". Brian Fagioli of BetaNews commented that the book's high price \\"sets the value and desirability at a high level\\" and that it is \\"intended to be a collectible piece of art\\". Kif Leswing of Business Insider gave a negative review, describing the book as \\"Ive's vanity project\\" and stating that many of its photos have been released by Apple before. Leswing felt the book itself was large in size and \\"not that special\\" for its price, compared to art books, and that he could spend the book's price \\"on way more fun things ‚Äî like Snapchat's Spectacles, or a discounted Apple Watch\\". James Vincent of The Verge said that the book's release \\"show[s] a certain amount of self-interest, navel-gazing, and even arrogance from Apple\\" and that he would \\"be interested to see if the company can justify releasing another such book 20 years from now\\".

Family and education Son of Henry John and Kate, Atwell was born in 1920 and attended Wilson School, Reading. He was further educated at Leeds University, gaining a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1941, before training for the ministry at the College of the Resurrection (Mirfield). He later gained the degrees of Bachelor of Divinity (BD, 1947), Master of Theology (MTh, 1958), and Master of Arts (MA, 1972), all from the University of London; and married Muriel Isobel Hesson in 1982. Early ministry in England He was ordained a deacon at Michaelmas (19 September) 1943 and a priest the following Michaelmas (24 September 1944), both times by Kenneth Kirk, Bishop of Oxford, at Christ Church. He served his title (curacy) at St George's, Wolverton, Buckinghamshire (1943‚Äì1945) and a second curacy at Wigan, Lancashire (1945‚Äì1951). South Africa Attwell migrated to South Africa in 1951 to become sub-warden of St Paul's College, Grahamstown, a theological college of the Church of the Province of South Africa. The next year, he was appointed as Dean of Kimberley (Rector of St Cyprian's Cathedral, Kimberley and senior priest of the Diocese of Kimberley and Kuruman) and installed at the cathedral on 28 June 1953. At his appointment, at age 32, he was the youngest cathedral dean in any Anglican church. This was a period of anguish in South Africa as Apartheid legislation was passed into law and implemented. In 1956 John Boys, Bishop of Kimberley and Kuruman, appointed a commission to investigate the probable effects of the Group Areas Act in Kimberley ‚Äì which was resulting in forced removals as different ‚Äòrace groups‚Äô were separated (not infrequently splitting families) and directed to live in designated suburbs or townships. In 1959 the Diocesan Magazine, Highway, stated with respect to the Group Areas Act that: ‚ÄúWe in the Anglican Church declare the act to be evil and to be opposed at every point.‚ÄùHighway 19(15), Oct 1959:9 During Attwell‚Äôs term as Dean of Kimberley decisive steps were taken towards completing the building of the Cathedral (begun in 1907). In 1954 materials were ordered for the building of the cathedral tower but it was not before August 1959 ‚Äî just when Attwell announced his resignation ‚Äî that work was actually started and the foundation stone laid by his predecessor as dean, Francis SmithFoundation Stone, Memorial Tower, St Cyprian‚Äôs Cathedral Return to England Afterwards he returned to England to become Rector at St Michael's, Workington, Cumberland (1960‚Äì1972); he was also made an honorary canon of Carlisle Cathedral in 1964, and served as rural dean of Cockermouth and Workington (1966‚Äì1970). His widow, Muriel, later gave his considerable theological library, containing some 4000 books, to St Michael‚Äôs. He moved in 1972 to become a canon residentiary of the cathedral until 1978, when he became, simultaneously: Archdeacon of Westmorland and Furness; Vicar of St John's, Windermere, Westmorland; the first Director of the diocesan training institute; and an honorary canon of the cathedral again. He sat on the national Church Assembly/General Synod as a Proctor in Convocation (1965‚Äì1982) and served David Halsey, Bishop of Carlisle as an examining chaplain (1972‚Äì1983). Isle of Man Attwell was appointed to the episcopacy in 1983 when he was appointed as Bishop of Sodor and Man (and ex officio a member of Tynwald and Dean of Peel). He was consecrated a bishop by John Habgood, Bishop of Durham, at York Minster on 14 September 1983. At his installation on Man, he pledged himself to serve the island and ‚Äúto seek to appreciate all that was important in the Manx way of life and to the Manx nation, and would try to master the Manx language.‚Äù Welcome to Attwell, cited in Edge & Pearce (below) In their study of ‚ÄúThe work of a religious representative in a democratic legislature,‚Äù Edge and Pearce remark that the interventions of Attwell, like those of his predecessor Eric Gordon, ‚Äúinitially sought to explicitly identify philosophical foundations for legislative activity‚Äù but that though he had been complimented for his attendance in the legislature, his contributions, compared with those of other bishops, had been ‚Äúrelatively low key.‚Äù He was concerned with issues of morality ‚Äì in particular ‚Äúthe importance of the conventional family‚Äù in relation to Civil Registration and Matrimonial legislation, but also with regard to education as ‚Äúcharacter development rather than simply vocational training‚Äù, and in relation to the rising tide of illegal drugs. He also engaged with continuing debates on Sunday trading. He was interested in and contributed to debates concerning culture, including the Manx Museum and archaeological matters.

It was launched on 23 September 2009 atop a PSLV-C14 satellite launch vehicle from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh in India, and became the first Turkish university satellite to orbit the Earth. It was expected to have a minimum of six-month life term, but it is still functioning for over two years. It is a picosatellite with side lengths of and a mass of . The overall objectives are to provide a hands-on project environment for the students at the ITU under faculty guidance. The mission goals are to capture imagery of the CMOS payload, and to study the behavior of the passive stabilisation system of the CubeSat. Spacecraft The spacecraft structure was purchased from Pumpkin Inc. of San Francisco, California, consisting of aluminium 6061 and 5052 material (CubeSat Kit by Pumpkin Inc.). There are three identical side faces and one face with access ports. The spacecraft stabilisation concept is discussed under Payload. Electrical power subsystem The electrical power subsystem consists of face-mounted solar panels, a regulator board and associated batteries. The system is able to charge itself (maximum power point tracking) and provide a regulated 3.3 V and 5 V bus service. Design of a deployable antenna system for a CubeSat, after investigating of various alternatives. The pin mechanism selected includes bases to attach the antennas and pins to wrap them around. The pins and bases are attached to the solar panels with small screws. The cables are routed to a connector outside for connection to the antennas. On-board computer The FM430 flight module of Pumpkin Inc. is being used. The FM430 is a compact solution for harsh environment systems. It has an SD (Secure Digital) card interface, one Universal Serial Bus (USB) port and external power supply connector. Also an interface to MHX series radio modems from Microhard Systems is available on the flight module. The FM430 is equipped with an MSP430F1611 microcontroller, a 16 bit 8 MHz low power microcontroller from Texas Instruments. It has many peripherals such as I2C (Inter-Integrated Communication), SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface), UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) buses, and also supports DMA (Direct Memory Access). It has a flash memory of 55 kB and 10 kB of RAM. The microcontroller unit consumes 100 mW of power at most. RF communications The primary on- board communication system is the MHX-425 transceiver from Microhard Systems. This frequency hopping spread spectrum radio, which works in the UHF band has adjustable hopping patterns, a high sensitivity (-115 dBm), and output power of up to 1 W (437.325 MHz, GFSK modulation), the data rate is 19.2 kbit/s. The transceiver interfaces directly to the on-board computer, it has a mass of about 80 gram. In addition, ITUpSat-1 features a beacon for easy identification and continuous reporting of critical telemetry. Unlike the other transceiver, it always be on during the orbit, and be transmitting identification and simple telemetry in CW (e.g. Morse code) every two minutes. This means anyone with the knowledge of the orbital parameters (in particular the amateur radio community) can easily pick up the satellite's signal. The beacon has a 100 mW RF output capacity. Launch ITUpSat-1 was launched on 23 September 2009 as a secondary payload atop a PSLV launcher of ISRO (launch provider: Antrix Corporation). The SPL (Single Picosatellite Launcher) system of Astrofein (Astro und Feinwerktechnik Adlershof GmbH, Berlin, Germany) is being used to deploy the four CubeSats. The launch service interface for all CubeSats is provided by ISIS (Innovative Solutions In Space BV) from Delft, Netherlands. The launch site is the SDSC‚ÄêSHAR (Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota) on the east coast of India. The primary payload on the flight was Oceansat-2 of ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) with a launch mass of 960 kg. Further secondary payloads on this flight were: * BeeSat-1 (Berlin Experimental Educational Satellite), a CubeSat of the TUB (Technical University of Berlin), Berlin, Germany * UWE-2 (University of W√ºrzburg Experimentalsatellit-2), W√ºrzburg, Germany * SwissCube, a CubeSat of √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland * Rubin-9.1 and Rubin-9.2 nanosatellites of OHB-System, Bremen, Germany. Orbit Sun- synchronous near circular orbit at altitude of , inclination is 98.28¬∞, orbital period 98.50 minutes, the local equatorial crossing time is at 12:00 hours. Payloads Sensor complement The CubeSat features two payloads. The first one is a sensor suite with an IMU and a magnetometer, and the second one is a low-resolution CMOS imager. The two payloads share a microcontroller and are physically on the same PCB representing the uppermost circuit of the electronics stack of the satellite. Payload #1 This subsystem represents the attitude sensing and passive stability hardware. It consists of three gyros, a three-axis accelerometer both from Analog Devices in addition to a three-axis magnetometer (Honeywell), and an Alnico magnet. The magnetometer will help to counter the inherent bias and drifts of inertial sensors and provide measurement updates for a filtered and corrected solution of the attitude. The analog-digital conversion of all the sensor outputs is done by a PIC microprocessor which also has the task of grouping the measurements into a packet and sending them over the I¬≤C bus to the on-board computer for downlink transmission. Payload #2 Payload #2 is a low-resolution CMOS camera with a detector array of 640 x 480 pixels (COTS imager based on the OV7620 image sensor). The objective is to take snapshot imagery. An interface board is designed to integrate camera with the MSP430F1611 microcontroller. The camera can be operated in VGA/QVGA (Video Graphics Array/Quarter Video Graphics Array) modes, transfer images in 8/16 bit modes and can be controlled over the I¬≤C bus. Ground segment A ground station was built at the ITU for the operations (monitoring and control services) of ITUpSat-1. The MHX modem (Microhard Systems) is also installed in the ground station for communication with the satellite's nominal communication system.

Research Neitz's research lab, which is run jointly with his spouse Maureen Neitz, works on the biology of vision disorders, particularly related to color-blindness. Their work on treating color-blindness in monkeys received some attention in the popular science press. In this work, they gave gene therapy to two red-green color-blind squirrel monkeys, combined with training. After five months, the monkeys began to be able to distinguish red and green. There is some potential that a similar treatment may be eventually developed for humans. Neitz and coauthors have also proposed that gene therapies of this type might in the more distant future be able to give tetrachromatic vision to humans with normal vision.

Pey is a fourteen-year-old boy who repeatedly commits crimes of throwing rocks at oncoming cars before looting them. One day, he throws a rock at the car of his own father, mistaking him for a normal driver. His father dies immediately. To avoid being found, Pey's mother has her son ordained at a remote temple in a southern forest. At the temple, Pey witnesses an annual ceremony of feeding the ghost being punished for its sinful deeds. On that night, Pey feels hungry and goes out of his monastic cell to find something to eat, although the precepts prohibit monks from eating at night. Pey walks to the place where the ceremony was held and eats the offerings dedicated to the ghost. But he is caught by his preceptor and is brought back to his cell. The next morning, the monks inspect the area where Pey entered last night and see that the nibung tree where the ghost's offerings were placed was broken. A senior monk says this is an omen indicating the time for the departure of the existing ghost and the coming of a new ghost. After days at the temple, Pey cannot bear the strict precepts any longer. Moreover, after consuming the ghost's offerings, he feels like he has been followed by the ghost. Pey then decides to leave the monkhood. The aged abbot begs him to stay, hoping that the religion could clean his mind a little bit more. But Pey flings the abbot down to the floor and continues to walk out of the forest. He is stopped by his preceptor. The preceptor leads him to a cave where Buddha images are installed and instructs him to stay there and meditate in order to calm himself down and realise the wrong he has done. That night, Pey again decides to leave the monkhood due to unrest within his mind after he recalls his wrongful deeds. While he is walking out of the forest, he feels like something is following him. He then throws rocks at it but the rocks come back to him and hit him at his face that he becomes severely disfigured. Pey attempts to call his mother for help but she only hears a high pitched cry like that of a punished ghost according to traditional belief. Tearfully repenting his crimes, Pey transforms into the new ghost. Ward \\"Ward\\" (‡∏´‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏á‡∏£‡∏ß‡∏°; \\"Shared Room\\") was directed by Visute Poolvoralaks. Arthit is a playful teenager who crashes his bike and fractures both his legs, requiring him to spend the night in a hospital. He is moved from the emergency room into a shared room, where he meets an old shaman in a coma who has been waiting for almost a month for his family to decide to pull the plug on his life support. The plug is scheduled to be pulled the next day, as the last group of his students and family members need to travel from the north to see him. As the night progresses, Arthit begins to see strange things, such as a tray of food left for the old man suddenly disappearing. He unsuccessfully requests an aged nurse who is responsible for the room to move him to another room. Seeing Arthit refuses to remain there, the nurse forcibly puts him to sleep through injection of hypnotic. As the night draws to an end, Arthit is suddenly awakened by the old man walking on his chest and reciting certain spells. The old man then attacks him and vomits blood into his mouth, thereby rendering him unconscious. The next morning, a young nurse comes to check on Arthit and discharges him from the hospital. As Arthit is leaving on a wheelchair pushed forwards by the old man's family, the old man's students, amongst whom are the aged nurse and some other hospital staff members, bow to Arthit. This means the old man has successfully transferred his soul to a new body, Arthit's body, with the help of the hospital staff. Backpackers \\"Backpacker\\" was directed by Songyos Sugmakanan. Backpackers begins with two Japanese travelers (a boy and a girl) hitchhiking through the Thai countryside with no luck. No one will pick them up until the Japanese boy waves a thousand baht note at a truck passing by which stops to pick them up. The truck is driven by a rough man who immediately extorts them for more money and a young man named Joi who refers to the older as 'boss' and asks him not to pick up the passengers. However, the travelers realise that something is wrong when the driver repeatedly gets phone calls that sets him shouting down \\"don't make trouble!\\" and when there is a continuous loud banging from the back of the truck. The driver eventually drives the wrong way and holds the travelers hostage at gunpoint while he and Joi check the truck. They open up the cargo and is surprised when they see the truck filled with dead bodies as flashbacks reveal that the two men are father and son who work as drug runner; they transport people who swallowed buns of drugs and tried to keep them alive, but eventually fail. The Japanese boy gains the upper hand by getting the gun, but the dead bodies return to life and kill him, after which the two men and the Japanese girl run for their lives as the zombies chase them, though the truck eventually crashes down and the zombies kill the driver. Joi and the Japanese girl wake up at evening and find that the bodies have become motionless again. Joi checks his father and finds him dead with his stomach cut open, while the Japanese girl sees a corpse of a boy return to life, seemingly innocent. The Japanese girl shoots Joi dead when he tries to unsuccessfully convince her to abandon the boy due to a language barrier. She and the boy drive a stray car (which crashed the truck earlier) away. Arriving at a market, the Japanese girl tries to shoot the boy while he sleeps, but he suddenly wakes up and kills her before running towards the market maniacally. Salvage \\"Salvage\\" (‡∏£‡∏ñ‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏™‡∏≠‡∏á; \\"Second Hand Car\\") was directed by Parkpoom Wongpoom. Nuch is a car dealer with a difference. She makes her comfortable living by rebuilding severely damaged cars, many from fatal accidents, and sells them to the unsuspecting with a sweet smile and a hand shake. But little do these unsuspecting bargain hunters know that beneath the new upholstery and shiny repainted exteriors are cars with horrific pasts. One night after closing the car garage, Nuch discovers her son, Toey, is missing. She tries to look for her son in her compound and is spooked by the ghosts of accident victims, including a mutilated vendor, a boy stuck in a car wheel, and a woman with her belly cut open, revealing her dangling intestines. Nuch gets locked in a car and witnesses how a victim got burnt to death in the car during an accident. Eventually she manages to escape to find that all of the refurbished cars have returned to their original destroyed state. Nuch tries to drive away with her own car, but the engine sounds weird and suddenly dies. She steps out and finds her son's shoe in front of the car. Bracing herself for the worst, Nuch opens the bonnet of the car. There, she finds her little boy, incinerated by the engine of the car. The part ends with Nuch crying motionlessly to her body-squashed dead little son. In the End \\"In the End\\" (‡∏Ñ‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏≠‡∏á; \\"Crew\\") was directed by Banjong Pisanthanakun. Ter, Puak, Shin and Aey are the movie crew of an upcoming ghost/horror movie Alone 2, starring Marsha as the lead character and Kate, who is sick, as the ghost. They are shooting the last scene where the ghost appears crawling out of a dark hallway, but Kate collapses. Aey takes Kate to a hospital, at which the doctor later tells Aey that \\"the patient has died\\". Thinking that Kate would be unable to join the filming, the crew discuss a possible ending change. But Kate appears in the set shortly and seems alive enough, prompting the change to be reversed. Kate asks Shin to take her to the toilet at the same time when Aey phones him, telling him that Kate has died. Shocked, he passes Kate to Marsha and tells Ter and Puak about Kate's death. The rest of the studio (except Marsha) overhear their conversation through the microphone and hastily leave the set. Having no choice, the three and an oblivious Marsha decide to shoot the final scene to appease Kate's wish to complete the film. However, the power gets off and a ghostly Kate pursues Ter, Puak and Shin who drive off the set, leaving a confused Marsha behind. The trio see Aey standing alone on the road and pick him up. When they see the remnant of his car crashed into another car, they initially think that Aey had died and his ghost is haunting them. Aey tells them that he is still alive and he managed to leave his car with minor injuries before the other car hit him. Kate suddenly appears, much to their shock. However, she tells them that she is not a ghost; she secretly left the hospital to join the crew and the doctor whom Aey met is the twin of another doctor. One of the twin doctors is in charge of Kate, the other was in charge of another dead patient and informed Aey of the patient's death because he mistook Aey for the deceased's relative. As they wave for a car to bring Kate back to the hospital, a car driven by a sleepy Marsha crashes all of them off. * Note: The characters of Ter, Puak, Shin, and Aey also starred in the short story \\"The Man In The Middle\\" from 4bia, the film's predecessor.

Life and career Ivan Rikard Mendel Kraus was born in 1880 in Osijek, Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Austria-Hungary, the son of Bettina and Johann Kraus.Ancestors of Ivan Simon Cary Elwes His father was the owner of a construction business in Osijek, and was responsible for erecting a number of buildings in his hometown, among which was the first steam-powered flour mill. When Ivan was a young boy his parents changed the family name to Ivanoviƒá and converted to Catholicism, along with many other Jews at the time. After completing his early studies his parents sent him to Vienna where he became a Doctor of Law. In 1905 he became one of the founders of the Croatian National Progressive Party (, NNS). In the 1908 Croatian parliamentary election, Ivanoviƒá was elected a member of the Croatian Parliament for the city of Osijek. In July 1912, he married Milica Popoviƒá, the youngest sister of Dr Du≈°an Popoviƒá, a leading Serb in Croatian political life. He was also elected in the 1913 Croatian parliamentary election.

Ivanoviƒá was stripped of his civil rights and sent to a forced labor camp. After being released, he fled to Italy where he died in Genoa in 1949 aged 68. He and Milica Popovic had three children together, Ivan, Da≈°ka and Vladimir. He had a third son named Dimitar with his second wife Jelka Muaƒçeviƒá.

Nasibova currently works in Azerbaijan as a journalist for ‚ÄúTuran‚Äù, an independent information bureau. She also works as a correspondent with Radio Free Europe, and is the leader of the human rights organization 'Democracy and NGO's Development Resource Center' in Nakhchivan. Nasibova continues to advocate for freedom of speech and has emerged as one of its strongest participants. Through her reporting, she has exposed police corruption, and human rights violations amidst the persistent persecution of the Azerbaijani authorities. Fight for Civil Rights in Azerbaijan The region of Azerbaijan has a wealth of natural resources (oil reserves) which interest large and politically powerful nations, but this interest has done little to curb the corruption within the native government. Azerbaijan, as a result, lacks the freedom of democratic governments, and suffers from a legal system which is stacked against the proletariat. Azerbaijan was supposed to cease some of its undemocratic behavior when it became a member of the Council of Europe in 2001, but they have not yet met the conditions and continue to kidnap and imprison people for political reasons. The Azerbaijan government has led Europe in the number of imprisoned journalists, and the Committee to Protect Journalists(CPJ) registered nine imprisoned journalists in 2007 and five in 2008. One of these, Novruzali Mammadov, died in prison in August 2011. Husband‚Äôs Arrest In 2007 Nasibova‚Äôs husband Ilgar was arrested after criticizing the government in a letter, which exposed his treatment by police while reporting a protest at a local market. Ilgar‚Äôs intention in writing the letter was to elucidate the unfair treatment he and the protestors received, but he ended up being charged with slandering the very same officers. On December 6 he was sentenced to 90 days in prison, for insulting a public official, after being told on December 4 that the charges had been dropped.

In standard synthetic biology, artificial gene networks are introduced into cells, inputs (e.g. chemicals, light) are applied to those networks, and the networks perform logical operations on them and output the result of the operation as the activity of an enzyme or as the amount of green fluorescent protein. Using this approach, synthetic biologists have demonstrated the ability of their gene networks to perform Boolean computation, to hold a memory, and to generate pulses and oscillation. Synthetic morphology extends this idea by adding output modules that alter the shape or social behaviour of cells in response to the state of the artificial gene network. For example, instead of just making a fluorescent protein, a gene network may switch on an adhesion molecule so that cells stick to each other, or activate a motility system so that cells move. It has been argued that the formation of properly-shaped tissues by mammalian cells involves mainly a set of about ten basic cellular events (cell proliferation, cell death, cell adhesion, differential adhesion, cell de-adhesion, cell fusion, cell locomotion, chemotaxis, haptotaxis, cell wedging).Davies JA (2008) Synthetic morphology: prospects for engineered, self-constructing anatomies. J Anat. 2008 Jun;212(6):707-19. Broadly similar lists exist for tissues of plants, fungi etc. In principle, therefore, a fairly small set of output modules might allow biotechnologists to 'program' cells to produce artificially-designed arrangements, shapes and eventually 'tissues'. The term synthetic morphology was introduced to the peer reviewed scientific literature in 2008 and is now becoming more widely used both in peer-reviewed literature Tanaka H, Yi TM (2009) Synthetic morphology using alternative inputs.

The film was produced with a budget of US$25 million and filmed between January 2009 and April 2009 at locations in Yunnan, China. According to Chan, the film was stuck in development hell for over 20 years. Little Big Soldier takes place during the Warring States period of China, and tells the story of three men and a horse. An old foot soldier (Chan) and a young high-ranking general from a rival state (Wang) become the only survivors of a ruthless battle. The soldier decides to capture the general and bring him back to his own state in hopes for a reward in return. Plot On 1 December 2009, a press conference was held for the film, along with Chan's announcement of a new teaser trailer posted on the film's official Sina website. Twitch also released a plot synopsis of the film: Cast Newcomer Lin Peng was chosen as the film's lead actress. * Jackie Chan as Big Soldier * Leehom Wang as Little General * Yu Rongguang as Deputy General Yu * Ken Lo as Guard Yong * Lin Peng as Singer * Steve Yoo as Prince Wen * Xu Dongmei as Lou Fan Yan * Song Jin as Lou Fan Wei * Du Yuming as Guard Wu * Yuen Woo-ping as Liang official * Wu Yue as Beggar Production Little Big Soldier was a joint production of China's Polybona Films and Hong Kong's JCE Movies Limited, a company set up by Jackie Chan in 2003. The film is notable for having been in production for over 20 years. Chan had wanted to perform in and write a comedic film that took place in a historical background since the 1980s, when Hong Kong action cinema was rising in prominence. Casting Chan originally had Daniel Wu in mind to play the part of the young general, but Chan disregarded that thought after realising that he had already filmed two movies earlier with Wu. Joan Lin, Chan's wife, suggested their son Jaycee Chan, but Chan was highly against it. Lin later suggested Leehom Wang, whom Chan agreed to immediately.  Video game  At a conference in Beijing on 20 November 2009, Jackie Chan announced, along with Universal Culture Limited and EURO WEBSOFT, that an MMO is being released to promote the film.

History Interwar period It was formed either in December 1924 or at the beginning of 1927 in the Moscow Military District,Slaughterhouse says December 1926 gaining the title of the \\"1st Moscow Proletariat Red Banner Rifle Division\\". Pavel Batov was a battalion and then regiment commander in the division in the late 1920s. In August 1939 it raised cadres for the 115th and 126th Rifle Divisions. In the mid 1930s the 1st Division was also the first to use modern headgear and weapons for the rising Red Army. World War II It was re-raised from its single remaining regiment in September 1939 (second formation), and by January 1940 was re-formed as the 1st Moscow Motor Rifle Division. Training was complete 7 June 1940, and 1st Moscow Motor Rifle Division took part in Soviet occupation of the Baltic states since 15 June 1940, advancing from base in Polotsk and forward positions at Widze to Panevƒó≈æys 16 June 1940.

During that period, heavy personnel flow left few if any of the initial combatants. *By 5 August 1941, remnants of the 1st Moscow Motor Rifle Division were wiped out after being encircled again in Smolensk region, in unclear circumstances. =After annihilation near Smolensk= 5 August 1941, the 1st Moscow Motor Rifle Division was re-formed anew within 20th army, 18 August 1941 renamed \\"1st armoured division\\" and on September 21, 1941, it was renamed the \\"1st Guards Moscow Motor Rifle Division\\".Keith E. Bonn (ed.), Slaughterhouse, Aberjona Press, 2005, p.358 The division was renamed (again) as the \\"1st Guards Rifle Division\\", in January 1943.This was the second formation of 1st Guards Rifle Division. This should not be confused with the first formation of the 1st Guards Rifle Division, formed from the 100th Rifle Division, which was later reorganized as the 1st Guards Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union). *30 August 1941, the 1st armoured division was participating in the Yelnya Offensive, forcing back 28th J√§ger Division. Due heavy losses, the division was stopped advancing 10 September 1941 and was withdrawn to behind of Vop River. *18 September 1941, the 1st armoured division was withdrawn to Mozhaysk for replenishment and subordinated directly to Stavka. *30 September 1941, the 1st Guards Moscow Motor Rifle Division was assigned to 40th army and sent to Sumy region.

The division remained in Naro-Fominsk area until end of November 1941. *29 January 1942, the division liberated the village of Myatlevo in cooperation with the 415th Rifle Division during the winter counteroffensive in front of Moscow.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow 1941-1942, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 8 *In 1942, the 1st Guards Moscow Motor Rifle Division was participating in Battle of Rzhev. *In July 1943, the 1st Guards Rifle Division was participating in Operation Kutuzov, in October 1943 - in Bryansk offensive, and in December 1943 - in Haradok offensive. *In January‚ÄìJuly 1944, the 1st Guards Rifle Division was advancing in Vitebsk - Minsk direction with heavy fighting, and was awarded 'Minsk' honorific 13 July 1944. *In November 1944, the division invaded East Prussia in Gusev area, and finally stormed K√∂nigsberg in April 1945. *21-26 April 1945, the 1st Guards Rifle Division ended the war by storming Baltiysk as part of 11th Guards Army of the 3rd Belorussian Front. Post war The division was for all of the post-war period stationed in Kaliningrad. It formed part of the 11th Guards Army. It became the 1st Guards Moscow MRD (again) in 1957. Of the regiments of the war period, the 171st Guards was eliminated, but instead in March 1959 came the 12th Guards Motorised Rifle Regiment. Virtually all of the time the division was truncated.Michael Holm, 1st Guards Motorised Rifle Division, 2015. For much of the 1990s the 1st Guards MRD was reduced to a strength of only 4,400 men, but in 2002 was reduced in size again to the 7th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, and, circa 2009-10, was reduced yet again, this time renamed as the 7th Independent \\"Proletarian Moscow-Minsk\\" Guards Motorized Rifle Regiment of the Baltic Fleet ().

It is well camouflaged from predators Species of the genus Phyllodesmium are carnivorous and feed on octocorals (for example in the family Xeniidae). This is a unique feature within the Aeolidida. Some of these nudibranchs contain endosymbiotic zooxanthellae, which are in effect single-celled plants. Zooxanthellae are one kind of dinoflagellate protists and they live only within other organisms, most notably in corals. The nudibranchs in this genus obtain zooxanthellae from their food, the soft corals. As they previously did within the corals, the zooxanthellae provide the nudibranch with a supply of food in the form of the products of photosynthesis. The nudibranchs are able to avoid digesting these protists, and sequester them in their tissues instead. This process is somewhat reminiscent of the relationship between the Sacoglossan sea slugs and the living chloroplasts that they are able to sequester. Both these nudibranchs and the sacoglossans have been referred to as \\"solar-powered sea slugs\\".Rudman, W.B., 1998 (October 11) Solar-powered sea slugs. [In] Sea Slug Forum. Australian Museum, Sydney. Many other species of nudibranchs are brilliantly colored in order to warn away would-be predators, that is, they have aposematic coloring. This is because they contain in their tissues many examples of an organ called the cnidosacAeolid cnidosac . Sea Slug Forum, accessed 26 September 2009. which contains undischarged cnidocytes (also known as nematocysts). These are stinging cells that the nudibranchs obtain from the tissues of the cnidarians they eat. Thus the very brightly colored nudibranchs are quite unpalatable for predators. Some nudibranchs, such as Glaucus atlanticus, are even capable of stinging humans very painfully. The nudibranchs in this genus, however, use an opposite tactic. They do not have cnidosacs, and thus they would in reality be palatable to eat for various predators, however they are almost all extremely well camouflaged, so that they resemble almost perfectly the soft coral on which they live and feed, not only in color but also in form. The shape and form of the cerata of the nudibranch in each individual species resembles very closely the tentacles of the species of soft coral polyp on which that species feeds. This excellent camouflage also makes these nudibranchs difficult for humans to notice, and it is likely that a number of species in this genus have not yet been discovered, described and named scientifically. Another tactic these nudibranchs use to protect themselves is that when threatened by a predator, they can drop one or more of their cerata. These organs will wiggle for some time after being cast off, hopefully distracting a predator away from the animal itself.Phyllodesmium magnum Rudman, 1991 .

However, there is one exception: Phyllodesmium karenae evolved in the symbiotic clade and subsequently lost its zooxanthellae.

The structure of the lofts and the columns carrying them show already clear classical influence. In typical classical manner the ceiling was originally completely flat, until in 1898 the central section was changed to barrel vault. Due to the loft columns connecting to the flat ceiling only the central section could be changed to barrel vault, disturbing the classical appearance of the hall, giving the impression of a three-nave structure. There are heads of cherubim by Clara Westhoff and floral ornaments by Paula Becker at the pendentives and the columns, connecting to the ceiling. After in 1900 Westhoff and Becker, both then members of the artists' colony in Worpswede and still students, had rung the church bells for fun, which was generally understood as a fire alarm, they were fined. They could not pay and were allowed to perform instead by way of offering these decorative elements to the church. The church tower with its spire in baroque forms had been added at the northeastern end of the actual church building only in 1798. Zion's Church is located on the Weyerberg hill, and with its tower it is a landmark, often used as subject of paintings by the artists.

Ships with toxic and radioactive waste were sunk off the Italian coast. In addition, vessels were allegedly sent to Somalia and other developing countries with toxic waste, including radioactive waste cargoes, which were either sunk with the ship or buried on land. The introduction of more rigorous environmental legislation in the 1980s made illegal waste dumping a lucrative business for organized crime groups in Italy.Mafia accused of sinking ship full of radioactive waste off Italy, by Nick Squires, The Telegraph, September 16, 2009 The phenomenon of widespread environmental crime perpetrated by criminal syndicates like the Camorra and 'Ndrangheta has given rise to the term \\"ecomafia\\". A 1995 parliamentary waste commission report spoke of the \\"possible existence of national and international trafficking in radioactive waste, managed by business and criminal lobbies, which are believed to operate also with the approval of institutional subjects belonging to countries and governments of the European Union and outside the EU.\\" Its conclusions noted \\"interferences and threats\\" against investigators, and were critical of ENEA, Italy's state energy research agency, and their management of nuclear waste. Waste dumping off Italian coast The 'Ndrangheta, an Italian mafia-type syndicate, has been accused by pentito Francesco Fonti, a former member of 'Ndrangheta, of sinking at least 30 ships loaded with toxic waste, much of it radioactive. In 2005, Fonti revealed the conspiracy in the news magazine L'espresso. His statements led to widespread investigations into the radioactive waste disposal rackets, involving Giorgio Comerio and his disposal company, the Odm (Oceanic Disposal Management). Parla un boss: Cos√¨ lo Stato pagava la 'ndrangheta per smaltire i rifiuti tossici, by Riccardo Bocca, L‚ÄôEspresso, August 5, 2005 Legambiente, an Italian NGO for the protection of the environment, provided the public prosecutor‚Äôs office with all the data collected by Legambiente since 1994 concerning the disappearance of at least 40 ships in Mediterranean waters. Dal plutonio alle polveri di marmo il \\"cimitero\\" delle navi radioattive, La Repubblica, September 14, 2009 Over two decades, Italian prosecutors have looked into more than 30 suspicious deep-water sinkings. They suspect that Italian and foreign industrialists have acted in league with the 'Ndrangheta, and possibly government agencies, to use the Mediterranean as a dumping ground. Vessels that sank in fair weather had suspicious cargo, sent no mayday or the crew vanished.Italian police close in on 'toxic' shipwreck, The Financial Times, October 21 2009 According to Fonti, a manager of ENEA paid the clan to get rid of 600 drums of toxic and radioactive waste from Italy, Switzerland, France, Germany, and the US, with Somalia as the destination, where the waste was buried after buying off local politicians. Former employees of ENEA are suspected of paying the criminals to take waste off their hands in the 1980s and 1990s. Shipments to Somalia continued into the 1990s, while the 'Ndrangheta clan also blew up shiploads of waste, including radioactive hospital waste, and sending them to the sea bed off the Calabrian coast.From cocaine to plutonium: mafia clan accused of trafficking nuclear waste, The Guardian, October 9, 2007 Fonti personally sank three ships and identified a wreck located 28 kilometres off the coast of Cetraro, in Calabria, by environmental workers as MV Cunsky and says he sank it himself in 1992, complete with 120 barrels of toxic and radioactive waste. He said 'Ndrangheta received ¬£100,000 for the job.Mafia sank boat with radioactive waste: official , AFP, September 14, 2009Shipwreck may hold radioactive waste sunk by mafia off Italian coast, by John Hooper, The Guardian, September 16, 2009 Fonti had been put on the job by his boss Sebastiano Romeo of the 'Ndrangheta clan from San Luca in collaboration with Giuseppe Giorgi. Another 'Ndrangheta boss involved was Natale Iamonte who sank ships near Melito di Porto Salvo. Complotto sotto il mare, by Riccardo Bocca, L‚ÄôEspresso, September 17, 2009 However, the vessel they surveyed off Cetraro in deep waters off the coast of Calabria turned out to be a passenger steamship sunk by a German submarine in 1917. Consequently, one of the prosecutors questioned the reliability of Fonti on the alleged sinkings, although his collaboration with the authorities since 1994 had resulted in high-profile arrests of 'Ndrangheta members involved in drug trafficking.'Toxic' shipwreck turns out to be red herring, Financial Times, October 30, 2009 Alleged delivery of toxic waste to Somalia Both Fonti and environmental group Legambiente claimed vessels were sent to Somalia and other developing countries such as Kenya and Zaire with toxic cargoes, which were either sunk with the ship or buried on land. Legambiente alleges that local rebel groups were given weapons in exchange for receiving the waste ships. Fonti claims that Italian TV journalist Ilaria Alpi and her cameraman Miran Hrovatin were murdered in 1994 in Somalia because they had seen toxic waste arrive in Bosaso, Somalia. According to Fonti, Christian Democrat politicians, including former prime minister Ciriaco De Mita, had been involved in illegal disposal operations, using the secret service SISMI to cover up their connection. De Mita denied the allegations. Fonti also claimed that Socialist politicians Gianni De Michelis and Bettino Craxi intervened to ensure that Italian peacekeeping troops in Somalia turned a blind eye to the transports.Establishment hit by fresh accusations in toxic waste scandal, by Phillip Willan, The Herald, September 20, 2009 The huge waves which battered northern Somalia after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami were initially believed to have stirred up illegally dumped toxic and nuclear waste.

He first entered film as a member of the Australian Army History Unit where he filmed Australian troops in Rabaul and East Timor.Geoff Mayer, 'Lee Robinson Obituary', Screening the Past After the war he was going to work for the ABC as a scriptwriter when he received an offer to join the Australian Information Service film unit (later Film Australia) where he directed a film on Albert Namatjira called Namatjira the Painter (1946). Robinson made several films in the Northern Territory such as Outback Patrol, The Pearlers and Crocodile Hunters as well as a short film with actors in a studio called Double Trouble (1951).Lee Robinson biography at Murdoch University The high quality and Australian subject matter of these films led them to be released theatrically as support for main features. Robinson was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in the 1985 Australia Day Honours for \\"service to the Australian film and television industry\\". Association with Chips Rafferty Robinson had known actor Chips Rafferty from writing radio serials for him. Together with George Heath they formed a company called Platypus Productions with the goal of producing Australian films that Robinson would direct and Rafferty could appear in. The Australian Government put a ¬£10,000 limit on any non-essential Australian company, forcing them to make their first film The Phantom Stockman (1953) for that amount. The movie was a success, launching the career of Robinson discovery Victoria Shaw and Robinson found out that modestly made films with good advertising made their money back.Reade, Eric History and Heartburn: The Saga of Australian Film 1896‚Äì1978 1981 Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press p145 He also felt that a film with an unconventional setting should have a conventional story line. Rafferty and Robinson then formed a new company, Southern International Productions, and made the popular King of the Coral Sea (1954), which marked the feature film debut of Rod Taylor. This was followed by Walk Into Paradise (1956), an Australian/French international co-production which American showman Joseph E.

Robinson had been advised that a children's show would sell well globally.http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/skippy/skippy.htm Robinson was inspired by Flipper, changing the dolphin into a kangaroo.http://www.independentweekly.com.au/news/national/national/general/skippy- australias-first-ambassador/1619955.aspx The series was filmed in colour before Australia had colour television. Robinson directed a feature film of the series called The Intruders (1969) or Skippy and the Intruders. Throughout the 1970s he concentrated on television production. In the early 1980s he returned to feature films, producing two films based on the activities of Z Special Unit during World War II. Personal life Robinson married Gwenyth in 1940 and they remained together until her death in 1968.

With the privatisation of the Icelandic banks being advantageous for investors, there was a large supply of cheap loan capital on the international market. A clause in the agreement with the European Economic Area stipulated the free flow of capital to and from Iceland. The so-called outvasion entailed Icelandic financiers (sometimes styled √∫tr√°sarv√≠kingar, 'outvasion vikings') to purchase many foreign businesses, particularly in the retail sector. The British retailers Debenhams, Woolworths, Hamleys, and others came into full or part-Icelandic possession, in addition to the Danish companies Magasin du Nord and Royal Unibrew. Novator Partners acquired telecoms and other assets around Europe, including ƒåesk√© Radiokomunikace, Elisa, Saunalahti, Bulgarian Telecommunications Company, P4 Sp√≥≈Çka z o.o., Netia, and Forthnet. Terminology The English term outvasion was coined by the Icelandic media as a calque on the Icelandic term √∫tr√°s. √öt means 'out'; r√°s, in this context, means 'a rush, race, sprint, expansion'; and √∫tr√°s correspondingly means outward rush. It was used to describe the Icelandic bankers as brave Vikings raiding the world via acquiring businesses. Investigations In 2005 a group of Danish journalists found that Thor Bj√∂rg√≥lfsson, his father Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Gu√∞mundsson and friend Magn√∫s √ûorsteinsson all have background in Russia, where they ran beverage businesses in the 1990s before moving to Iceland. They provided details about their activities in Russia. Icelandic links to Russia were also highlighted by The Guardian newspaper article \\"Next-generation Viking invasion - They've got the cash to buy big UK groups like M&S.; But where does it come from?\\" in 2005. Furthermore, investigations have identified six British Virgin Islands-based shareholders behind Icelandic banks and companies such as Glitnir, Landsbanki (and its Internet brand Icesave), Kaupthing, Baugur Group and Exista: Starbook International Limited, Waverton Group Limited, Birefield Holdings Limited, Shapburg Limited, Quenon Investments Limited, and Liftwood Investments Limited. All six are registered in P.O. Box 3186 Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands. Documents available on Luxembourg authorities' website and discovered by Danish journalists show that Shapburg Limited and Quenon Investment Limited owned a stake in Luxembourg-based Alrosa Finance, a subsidiary of Russian state-owned diamond company ALROSA. Shapburg Limited also owned a stake in Luxembourg-based Alfa Finance Holdings, a subsidiary of Alfa-Bank of Russia. Outcomes The Icelandic outvasion period ended in October 2008 with the downfall and default of the three leading Icelandic banks, Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir, totalling $85bn of debt, that led directly to the collapse of the national currency, the government and much of the economy. In September 2010, Geir Haarde, the former prime minister, became the first Icelandic minister to be indicted for misconduct in office. He was convicted for not holding cabinet meetings when things turned critical, but has been found not guilty of negligence over the 2008 financial crisis. On December 12th 2013, Hrei√∞ar M√°r Sigur√∞sson, former CEO of Kaupthing Bank, was sentenced to five and a half years in prison for his part in a market manipulation case involving Sheikh Mohammed Bin Khalifa Bin Hamad al-Thani's purchase of a 5.1% share in Kaupthing Bank weeks before the bank collapsed in October 2008. This was, at the time, the heaviest sentence for financial fraud in Iceland's history. Three other executives were also sentenced to jail. The verdict was appealed later, but the Supreme court upheld the previous verdict on February 12th 2015. Thor Bj√∂rg√≥lfsson, the former owner of Landsbanki, lost most of his wealth, but personally owned up to his debt and managed to settle up with creditors. By the autumn of 2014, he regained his previous status, primarily because of the Actavis acquisition by Watson Pharmaceuticals.

Early life Sutton was born in Australia in 1937, growing up in Newcastle on the New South Wales Central Coast. The daughter of schoolteacher Charles Goffet (1909‚Äì1991), who taught French at Newcastle Boys High School from 1942 to 1978, her sister is former NSW Federal Labor politician and Minister, Jeannette McHugh. Sutton was educated at Newcastle Girls' High School, where she was School Captain and took equal first place for French in her Leaving Certificate in 1953. Although gaining a matriculation scholarship in French to study at the University of Sydney, Sutton later discontinued her Bachelor of Arts at the university and later studied at the Universities of Newcastle (Newcastle Teachers College), New England and Macquarie completing a Master of Arts with Honours (MA Hons.) and a Diploma of Education (DipEd), becoming a teacher. She taught French, German and English at Raymond Terrace High School and Newcastle Girls'. Moving to Sydney in 1965, Sutton became a Teacher of English and Modern Languages at The Forest High School, Davidson High School and Killarney Heights High School from 1965‚Äì1986. She married, which was later dissolved, and had 3 sons. Local Government career In 1980 Sutton stood for election as a Labor Party candidate in D Riding of Warringah Shire Council and on 20 September 1980 became only the fourth female councillor elected to Warringah. She served on the council until it was dismissed in December 1985 by the Wran Government following supposed discrepancies in council planning decisions. However, following a successful legal challenge against the government by the NSW Fraud Ombudsman, it was subsequently found that there was no evidence of corruption to support the dismissal, and that \\"the elected councillors were denied natural justice and were both unfairly and unlawfully dismissed\\". Sutton was one of the few councillors that supported the dismissal however, but nevertheless noted in her first council meeting back after the dismissal: \\"Even though I went against you in the election, I will certainly support you. [Joking] There is certainly a balance of brains and talent with one woman and 11 men ... In this case the men won - not the better men, but the men\\". When the council was returned on 14 March 1987 after the local elections, Sutton remained as a councillor but in September 1987 was elected as Deputy Shire President alongside Shire President Ted Jackson. As Deputy Shire President, Sutton unveiled the central fountain sculpture in Warringah Mall, entitled \\"Pacific Family\\" by Victor Cusack, on 23 November 1988 to commemorate the Australian Bicentenary. In 1981 Sutton was appointed by the Minister for Education, Paul Landa, to serve a four-year term on the Council of the Kuring-gal College of Advanced Education. Serving until 1985, Sutton was briefly re-appointed by Minister Terry Metherell to serve on the final Council from 1 August to 31 December 1989, prior to the college's transformation into UTS Ku-ring-gai Campus from 1 January 1990. She became involved in Council Committees, supporting the Forest Community Association, whose work resulted in the establishment in 1985 of the Forest Community Centre/Glen Street Theatre, now one of Sydney's leading artistic venues, and the creation of Garigal National Park, the result of very long negotiations with Dainford Ltd, the then State Government and Warringah Council and Narrabeen Lagoon Committee. Dainford agreed to transfer 800 hectares of privately owned land into public ownership in exchange for approval to build the Austlink Corporate Park thus creating Garigal National Park in 1991. Sutton was elected as Deputy Shire President for a further three terms: 1989‚Äì1990, 1991‚Äì1992 and 1992‚Äì1993. She could not, however, match this success at the state level and failed to gain election as the ALP candidate to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Davidson against Terry Metherell in 1981, and 1984. In 1985 Sutton was expelled from the ALP for voting for a Labor colleague, Brian Green, to be Shire President against instructions from Labor caucus. She stood again as an Independent against Metherell in Davidson at the 1988 election but was again unsuccessful. Although she did not stand as a candidate in 1991 state election, Sutton stood again as an independent at the 1992 by-election, taking place during the midst of a public scandal over the manner of Metherell's departure, with the government's tenuous position in the hands of the voters at the by-election. Premier Nick Greiner himself, who later resigned over the 'Metherell Affair', attempted to label Sutton a \\"Labor stooge\\" and a \\"Terry Metherell in skirts\\", in reference to her former membership of the ALP. Sutton nevertheless stood against fellow councillor and Liberal candidate Andrew Humpherson, taking second place and forcing Humpherson to rely on preferences to be elected in a traditionally very safe seat, with Sutton gaining 29.5 percent of the primary vote and 40.3 percent of the two party preferred vote. Remaining on Council, following the proclamation of former A Riding as Pittwater Council, her D Riding was renamed 'C Ward', and she was elected as deputy mayor from 1994 to 1995 (following the passing of the Local Government Act 1993, Warringah Council dropped 'Shire' and shire presidents became mayors). From 19 September 1995 Sutton was elected as \\"Her Worship the Mayor of Warringah Council\\", becoming the second mayor of Warringah and the first female leader of the council. As mayor she assisted in the establishment of the Austlink Business Park between Forest Way and Mona Vale Road in Belrose, providing hundreds of jobs in Warringah. She remained as mayor until 24 September 1996. Sutton was again elected deputy mayor alongside Darren Jones from 2001 to 2002 before returning as mayor from 26 September 2002 until the Council's dismissal on 23 July 2003. Later career Sutton continued serving the community for the next five years without a council under the administration of Dick Persson. This lasted until the local government elections of 23 September 2008, which saw her elected for another four-year term in C Ward, making Sutton the longest-serving member of the council. On 30 September 2011, Sutton was elected by the council as deputy mayor. On her election, the mayor, Michael Regan, congratulated Sutton \\"who has served the community of Warringah with loyalty and passion for more than 30 years\\". On her election Sutton also made clear that her current term would be her last, announcing her intention not to stand for re-election at the 2012 NSW Local Government Elections. On 29 May 2012, Sutton was tributed in the NSW Parliament by the Member for Davidson, Jonathan O'Dea and the Member for Wakehurst, Brad Hazzard, who nominated her for the Woman of the Year award. On 24 August 2012, at the final council meeting before the elections, Sutton was awarded the title of Emeritus Mayor by the Local Government Associations of NSW in recognition of her service to Warringah Council. Mayor Regan noted her final meeting as a Councillor by saying: \\"Councillor Sutton has only ever missed one council meeting since she joined Council in 1980 ‚Äì this is quite a remarkable testament to her work ethic and commitment to her role as a Councillor. Councillor Sutton will of course be fondly remembered for her epic contribution to this community by our local MPs, former Councillors, staff and the residents ‚Äì she has worked incredibly hard and achieved a great many things. Councillor Sutton has had an impact on us all. She has entertained us with her wit and reminded us of what really matters within this community. I know that while she will no longer be sitting here at this table, she will continue to work tirelessly as she always has to help so many and the community she loves.\\" Notes |- Category:Living people Category:1937 births Category:Australian schoolteachers Category:University of Newcastle (Australia) alumni Category:University of New England (Australia) alumni Category:Macquarie University alumni Category:Deputy mayors of places in Australia Category:Women mayors of places in New South Wales Category:Shire Presidents and Mayors of Warringah Category:Australian Labor Party councillors Category:New South Wales local government politicians Category:Independent politicians in Australia Category:People from Sydney ","title":"Julie Sutton (mayor)"},{"id":"24456273","text":"On August 28, 2009, the Kansas Supreme Court issued a ruling regarding the standing, rights and interests of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS) in Landmark Nat'l Bank v. Kesler, 2009 Kan. LEXIS 834 (Aug 28, 2009). The court held that all indispensable parties must be identified and that the actual lender identified in foreclosure actions to protect each party's rights. The decision also addressed the role MERS plays in clouding the ownership of the promissory note and title to the property. Background In 2004, Boyd Kesler bought a home in Ford County, Kansas with a mortgage from Landmark National Bank and that lien was recorded on the deed with the county. Subsequently, Kesler secured a secondary mortgage for the same property from Millenia Corporation and that loan was later sold to Sovereign Bank. That second lien (and its sale to Sovereign) was recorded on the private MERS system but was never recorded with the county. Kesler later filed bankruptcy and listed the property with only the Sovereign lien. Upon receiving notice of the bankruptcy, Landmark served notice but to Kesler and Millenia but not Sovereign or MERS so the actual secondary lender was never notified. The foreclosure proceeded without Landmark, the primary mortgage lender. Landmark, the appellant, then sued and sought to invoke due process rights which it said were violated when MERS failed to get notice of the fact that their \\"interest\\" was being wiped out via a prior foreclosure it did not receive notice of. The Court said simply that MERS ‚Äî or any nominee\\" didn't have any interest and proves its point by reference to simple statements in the documents and the simplest of laws and interpretation of the role of MERS and the requirements of recordation. The splitting or bifurcation of the promissory note or mortgage note and mortgage or deed of trust creates an immediate and fatal flaw in title.http://www.kscourts.org/Cases-and- Opinions/opinions/supct/2009/20090828/98489.htm Decision The Kansas Supreme Court went on to cite several other case across the nation and stated: \\"When the role of a servicing agent [MERS] acting on behalf of a mortgagee is thrown into the mix, it is no wonder that it is often difficult for unsophisticated borrowers to be certain of the identity of their lenders and mortgagees.\\" In re Schwartz, 366 B.R. 265, 266 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2007) and then cited the Supreme Court of New York (Kings County) that said: \\"[T]he practices of the various MERS members, including both [the original lender] and [the mortgage purchaser], in obscuring from the public the actual ownership of a mortgage, thereby creating the opportunity for substantial abuses and prejudice to mortgagors . . . , should not be permitted to insulate [the mortgage purchaser] from the consequences of its actions in accepting a mortgage from [the original lender] that was already the subject of litigation in which [the original lender] erroneously represented that it had authority to act as mortgagee.\\" Johnson, 2008 WL 4182397, at *4, 873 N.Y.S.2d 234 (2008).

History Department of the Pacific was created January 15, 1861, during the American Civil War. The District of Southern California was established on September 25, 1861. The district was composed of San Luis Obispo County, Tulare County, Santa Barbara County, Los Angeles County, San Bernardino County, and San Diego County. Tulare County at the time was composed of additional territory now belonging to Kern County, to Inyo County, Kings County and a small part of southeastern Fresno County. Santa Barbara County included what is now Ventura County, Los Angeles County included what is now Orange County and parts of Kern and Inyo County. San Bernardino County contained parts of Inyo and Riverside Counties. San Diego County included most of Riverside County, and Imperial County. Its first headquarters was located at Camp Latham, located west of Los Angeles. The headquarters was later moved to Drum Barracks. On July 27, 1865, the Military Division of the Pacific was created under Major General Henry W. Halleck, replacing the Department of the Pacific. The department consisted of the Department of the Columbia and the expanded Department of California absorbing the District of Southern California that now consisted of the States of California and Nevada and the Territory of New Mexico and Territory of Arizona.

Life  He was born at Karlsburg Castle, in Durlach (now part of Karlsruhe) as the son of Friedrich V, Margrave of Baden-Durlach and Barbara of W√ºrttemberg. He studied in Strasbourg and Paris where he particularly enjoyed the science of war. Later he participated in the defense of German territories against the Ottoman invasion of 1663. Frederick later also participated in the Franco-Dutch War. After the end of the Thirty Years' War in 1648 he did not take time out to recover from his war crafts. As early as 1663, the Turks had penetrated deep into Hungary. The imperial army of Emperor Leopold I began to organize a common defense against the Turks and demanded that Baden-Durlach should also provide troops. Frederick VI participated in this war as a Major General. The Emperor granted, even before the war began, to Frederick and his cousin, Margrave William of Baden-Baden, the right to use the style Serene Highness. This title was hereditary until 1803, when Margrave Charles Frederick of the in 1771 re-united margraviate of Baden was raised to Elector after he had greatly expanded his territory during the German Mediatisation. In the battle against the Turks, Frederick's cousin Louis William distinguished himself and earned himself the nickname (\\"Turk Louis\\"). After the Turks were defeated, Frederick participated on the Dutch side in the Franco-Dutch War. In 1676, he began a siege on the fortress of Philippsburg; after he captured the city on 17 September of that year, it was added to the Baden-Durlach territories. He died on 10 or 31 January 1677 at the Karlsburg Castle in Durlach.

The secretary of Aberdeen Trades Council from 1948 to 1969, he made his mark by working for safer working conditions for fishing trawler crew. But his interests and activities were always very wide; he was a member of the Regional Hospital Board, where he kept up a constant pressure for reforms in the interests of patients. He became a member of the General Council of the STUC in 1954, the youngest person elected to that time. Deputy General Secretary in 1969 and the General Secretary in 1975, Milne was also a member of the Communist Party Executive Committee for a period and the Scottish Committee until his death. During his period of office, the STUC was heavily involved in a range of activities of an educational and cultural nature. He spent six years as Chair of SCOTBEC and, with the Glasgow Trades Council, a residential college was established at Treesbank. Jimmy Milne spent 12 years on the board of Govan Shipbuilders and was the longest serving member of the Parole Board when he stepped down, after 15 years membership. Married to Alice, Jimmy Milne was also a great music lover, who consciously spread the STUC's influence widely in education and the arts and received an honorary doctorate from Heriot Watt University for such work. The Scottish National Orchestra performed a specially commissioned overture, \`Sunset Song', by William Sweeney on his retirement in a similar gesture. He died in 1986, only ten days before his official retirement date. Over a thousand people attended his funeral, including the then Shadow Scottish Secretary, Donald Dewar, and many other prominent individuals from all walks of life.

Established in 1978, it has a collection of around 2,000 antique bottles, most made prior to industrialization of the process in 1903. It has moved from its original location, a historic house which it restored, after a legal dispute with its founding organization. In 1996 it received a charter from the state Board of Regents. The museum also exhibits the tools of early bottle making, and hosts demonstrations of the technique. History In 1978 the Federation of Historic Bottle Clubs, an umbrella organization of antique bottle collector groups all over the country, pooled their resources to create the museum. The idea had come from Bernard Puckhaber, a German immigrant and the longtime Ballston Spa village clerk. The village had been an early center for bottle manufacture because of the naturally carbonated mineral water from its nearby springs, which also attracted tourists who bathed in the waters and gave the future village its name. Water from Ballston Spa was shipped all over the world. A factory in nearby Greenfield employed hundreds of workers and glassblowers during its years of peak production during the mid-19th century. The museum's original home was the historic Verbeck House, also in Ballston Spa. The federation bought the house from the descendants of its original owner, and renovated it for use as a museum. Later they moved to the current location. The new location, a three-story storefront in downtown Ballston Spa, allowed the museum to take advantage of its proximity to the only two of Ballston Spa's original springs still flowing. The former Sans Souci hotel, on one of the springs, is across the street, and the Old Iron Springs, which flow year-round, is nearby. A 1901 house nearby has also been used as a demonstration glassworks in the past, complete with an electric furnace, but the museum has had to stop using it because of the high electric bills. It is currently looking for a grant that would allow it to resume using it. Verbeck House, as restored by the museum Six years later, in 1992, the museum left the Verbeck House when a dispute between the museum management and the Federation, which had changed its name to the Federation of Historic Bottle Clubs, ended up in court. The National Bottle Museum Society, which had been formed to operate the museum, insisted it owned the bottles as well. In June a judge ruled that the federation could evict the society from the premises. A year later the society found the present site, and moved in. Later that year a settlement allowed the museum to keep the collection in Ballston Spa. In 2006 the museum was featured in an episode of the Travel Channel's Cash & Treasures. Later that year the village sought another state grant to allow the museum to renovate its third floor into an artists' dormitory. In February 2007 it was named Organization of the Month by the Lower Adirondack Regional Arts Council. In 1986 Jan Rutland, a garage sale enthusiast, visited the museum. She began volunteering after attending one of the museum's seminars. Rutland was eventually appointed the museum's president. Rutland died in 2010, leading to an immediate cutback in museum hours. Facilities and programs The bottle museum is currently housed primarily in the three-story building. Its collection of 2,000 bottles, some on loan from bottle clubs all over the U.S. and Canada, are on the shelves. They were used for holding everything from milk and fruit to bitters and soda. The oldest in the collection are a set of black bottles, made in Europe and said to have been used for rum or gin. The oldest Bottle in the Museum is estimated to have been made between 1710 and 1725. Other exhibits show the tools of bottle making, and a miniature model of a glass oven. The second story has been used as an art gallery, with exhibits of not only original glass art created by local artists, but paintings dealing with everything from local subjects to the Holocaust. Rutland has defended the art gallery, saying \\"we are a history museum and (both) the bottles and this exhibit represents history and art and technology. So it's all worth seeing and preserving.\\" There is also a research library, with an antique pharmaceutical counter, with records dating to 1904. A building near the museum has been equipped with glassblowing facilities for demonstrations and classes. Larry Rutland, the late president's husband, teaches classes in flameworking and lampworking, the art of shaping glass in a flame. Classes in making art glass marbles are also available by appointment. Every year, in June, the museum sponsors a 160-table bottle show and auction at the City Center in nearby Saratoga Springs. It is open to the public, and collectors from all over the U.S. and Canada attend.

Isolation and properties This oxygenated alkaloid was isolated by Wertheim from C. maculatum. It crystallises in colourless leaflets, has a coniine-like odour, can be sublimed, and is strongly basic. It crystallises readily from ether. The salts are crystalline; the aurichloride small rhombs or prisms, mp. 133 ¬∞C; the benzoyl derivative mp. 132 ¬∞C. Constitution On oxidation with chromic acid, conhydrine yields L-piperidyl-2-carboxylic acid. It is converted into L-coniine either by reduction of the iodo-derivative (iodoconiine), C8H16IN, formed by the action of hydriodic acid and phosphorus at 180 ¬∞C or by hydrogenation of the mixture of coniceines produced, when it is dehydrated by phosphorus pentoxide in toluene. File:abg-conhydrine.svg These and other observations indicate that the oxygen atom must occur as a hydroxyl group, in the n-propyl side chain in either the Œ±- or Œ≤-position, since the Œ≥-position would involve the production of piperidyl-2-propionic acid on oxidation. 2-Œ≤-Hydroxypropyl-piperidine suggested by Willst√§tter seemed to be excluded, since neither of the two forms of this product prepared by L√∂ffler and Tschunke resembled conhydrine, and these authors suggested the Œ±-position as probably representing the alkaloid. Support for this view was provided by Hess and coworkers , who showed that DL --N-methylconhydrone is N-methyl-2-piperidyl ethyl ketone, that DL-conhydrine (mp. 69‚Äì70 ¬∞C), produced by a somewhat indirect method, is identical with the product, mp. 69.5‚Äì71.5 ¬∞C, prepared by Engler and Bauer by the reduction with sodium in ethyl alcohol of 2-pyridyl ethyl ketone, and that conhydrine on dehydrogenation over platinum or palladium asbestos gives rise to a mixture of tetrahydropyridyl 2-ethyl ketone and 2-Œ±-hydroxypropyl-pyridine. Sp√§th and Adler have shown that conhydrine can be degraded in two stages by exhaustive methylation to trimethylamine, and a mixture of two products, an oil, C8H14O, bp. 157‚Äì159 ¬∞C@744 mmHg, and a crystalline substance, C8H16O2, mp. 75‚Äì76 ¬∞C. The oil, when heated with water at 170 ¬∞C is converted, by addition of a molecule of water, into the crystalline substance. The latter contains two active hydrogen atoms (Zerewitinoff estimation), and on exposure to hydrogen over Pd/C absorbs enough to saturate one double bond producing a new substance, mp. 94‚Äì96 ¬∞C. On oxidation with permanganate in dilute sulfuric acid, propionaldehyde and succinic acid are produced, whilst the saturated substance, mp. 94‚Äì96 ¬∞C, is oxidised to n-valeric acid. These results indicate that the substance of mp. 75‚Äì76 ¬∞C is ŒµŒ∂-dihydroxy-ŒîŒ±-n-octene, that the oil, C8H14O, is the corresponding oxide, and that the representation of conhydrine as 2-Œ±-hydroxypropyl-pyridine accounts for their production.

The results from this study helped reduce infant mortality and were instrumental in improving maternity services in the UK.

The survey was initially planned as a one- off study to investigate the reasons for the relatively high rate of stillbirths (38.5 stillbirths per 1,000 births) in the UK compared to other developed countries. 98% of women (17,205) who gave birth in England, Scotland and Wales to 17,415 babies during the week of 3‚Äì9 March 1958 completed the survey. Records of birth deaths to 7,618 women and about 5,000 autopsy reports were also collected over the period of March-May 1958. In 1963 the Plowden Committee which was investigating the education of primary children in the UK and the transition to secondary school, commissioned a follow-up report on the children from the NCDS. This follow-up survey was led by Mia Kellmer Pringle and attempts were made to trace all members of this birth generational cohort. The survey took place in 1965 and results were included in the Plowden report Children and their Primary Schools in 1967.

He began in 1987 as oboe soloist in the European Symphonic Orchestra, and since 2001, Fillon has made numerous musical compositions that use the oboe and English horn in jazz and improvisation. Biography Fillon studied classical music and oboe at national academies of Aubervilliers and Versailles and then at l'Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure de Paris. During this period he was the laureate of the San Sebastian chamber music international competition and studied improvisation and composition at the Centre d‚Äôinformations musicales (Jazz and Contemporary music in Paris). From 1987 to 1991, he was oboe soloist in the European Symphonic Orchestra. After 1991, he conducted the Jazzog√®ne Orchestra with which he recorded several CDs and played as a soloist with Antoine Herv√©, Lauren Newton, Claudio Pontiggia and Franck Tortillier. It was his first main jazz experience. He went on tour in many festivals and parisian jazz clubs with this orchestra. In 1996, he created the Coyoakan trio (trio world jazz) and the Alborada sextuor (world music). In 1998 during a tour, Bob Mintzer was charmed by Fillon's oboe tone and encouraged Fillon to develop a systematic work on the oboe and English horn improvisation. In fact, before 1998 Fillon used these instruments mainly in classical and contemporary music. In 2000, Bob Mintzer composed for him a piece called French Suite. During this period, he also met Nguy√™n L√™, Pierre Blanchard, Lauren Newton, Claudio Pontiggia, Yves Torchinsky, Pierre-Marie Bonafos. Since 2001, Fillon's began writing numerous compositions in order to introduce the oboe and English horn's originality in improvisation (selected at the European audition of the Paolo Damiani National Jazz Orchestra, recording of several radio broadcast on France Musiques, creation of Ad Lib Production). In September 2001 he was nominated Jazz teacher at the national academy of Cergy-Pontoise. In early 2002, he recorded his own oboe and English horn composition with Denis Leloup, Pierre Blanchard and Jo√´l Grare. He also recorded with Pierre-St√©phane Michel in the pSM trio, with Jo√´l Grare on drums. From September 2002, Fillon played in Paris with Jo√£o Paulo and Denis Leloup. In 2003, the releasing of Oboa on CD was a success. He was invited by Glenn Ferris to join the \\"Newance quartet\\" with Jeff Boudreaux and Michel B√©nita. In 2004, he created the \\"De L'air quartet\\" with Carole H√©mard, Yves Torchinsky et Xavier Dessandre, and recorded \\"Flea Market\\". He went on tour in Portugal with Jo√£o Paulo. In 2005, after a tour in Germany, Fillon went to the United States. He played with two jazz bassoonists: Paul Hanson and Michael Rabinowitz. In October, he was invited by Xavier Pr√©vost to play on Radio France. In early 2006, he created Priv√© de D√©sert in the frame of the Les Mureaux jazz festival \\"Ca Va Jazzer\\". He recorded a new album (Echoes Of Ellington) on Ellington tunes in order to pay tribute to this great musician and give a new perspective on his works. In 2007, he went on tour in United States with Michael Rabinowitz and the Devil Reeds with a concert in New York. At the same period, he began a residence during two years and a half at L‚ÄôOnde, the cultural place in V√©lizy, France. He created the Oborigins project with Michel Godard, Jo√£o Paulo and Jarrod Cagwin. Finally he went on tour in Germany and recorded at the Deutschland Radio in Cologne with the Oboa trio. In 2008, he created the On The Reed...Again ! quintet with Michael Rabinowitz. In November, he came out the Oborigins album, elected album of the week on FIP (Radio-Jazz).

A member of the SS in Nazi Germany, he served as Managing Director of the Reich Association for Land Management in the Annexed Territories from 1940 to 1945, administering parts of occupied Poland. After the war, he became a West German politician, sitting in the Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein from 1950 to 1953 and serving as Minister of Finance. He entered the Bundestag in 1953 and served as Federal Minister for Special Affairs in the Cabinet of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer from 1953 to 1956. He retired from the Bundestag in 1961. Kraft initially represented the All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights and served as its chairman from 1951 to 1954. In 1956, he became a member of the Christian Democratic Union. Education and profession Waldemar Kraft was born to a Protestant German family in Brzustow, Jarotschin district, in the Province of Posen on the Prussian-Russian border (today Brzost√≥w, Poland). He attended secondary school in pre-1914 Posen, focusing his secondary school studies on agriculture. Between 1915 and 1920 he was a soldier of the Prussian Army and participated in World War I, where he was severely wounded. Afterwards he served as a company commander. After the war he chose to return to the Greater Poland and from 1921 to 1939 he was the director of the Hauptvereins der Deutschen Bauernvereine or Main German Farmers' Associations in Pozna≈Ñ. In 1925 he was also appointed director of the Deutschen Landwirtschaftlichen Zentralverbandes in Polen or Central Association of German Farming in Poland. From 1939 to 1940 he served as the regional President of Agriculture (the Landwirtschaftskammer) in Nazi Posen. From 1940 to 1945 he was Managing Director of the Reichsgesellschaft f√ºr Landbewirtschaftung in den eingegliederten Ostgebieten mbH (‚ÄûReichsland‚Äú) or Reich Association for land management in the annexed territories, in Berlin. Shortly before the war ended this Reich Association, and Kraft, moved to Ratzeburg in Schleswig-Holstein. From 1945 to 1947 he was interned in Schleswig-Holstein and remained unemployed in Ratzeburg to 1950. From 1949 to 1951 he was the spokesperson for the Landsmannschaft Weichsel-Warthe or German Vistula and Warta Association. As such he signed the Charter of the German expellees and later became honorary chairman (an Ehrenvorsitzender). Political affiliation Kraft joined the NSDAP in 1933. On 13 November 1939, immediately following the Nazi invasion of Poland and the incorporation of his region into the Warthegau, he was also appointed an Ehren-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer or Honorary Captain of SS. In 1950 he was among the founders of the Gesamtdeutscher Block/Bund der Heimatvertriebenen und Entrechteten (often abbreviated in texts to \\"GB/BHE\\") or All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights in Schleswig-Holstein. In 1951 he was elected national chairman of the League and Eva Gr√§fin Finck von Finckenstein became his press secretary. In September 1954 she was not reelected into the League administrative board, which led to the resignation of Waldemar Kraft as Chairman.Der Spiegel 19 May 1954 \\"Sch√ºtze Kraft\\" In March 1956 Kraft, Finckenstein and Theodor Oberl√§nder joined the CDU, which led to the decline of influence of the All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights in German politics. MP From 1950 to 1953 Kraft was a member of the state parliament of Schleswig-Holstein, where he represented the electoral district of Lauenburg-west. From 1953 to 1961 he was subsequently elected a member of the West German Bundestag. 1953\\\\. Waldemar Kraft, front row, far right. Part of the West German government under Konrad Adenauer. After the elections in 1953 he retired on 20 October 1953 from the State Government and was appointed on the same day as the Federal Minister without Portfolio under government of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in Bonn. On 16 October 1956 he resigned from the federal government. He died in Bonn in 1977. Evaluation A committed CDU stalwart after World War II and champion of the rights of the Germans expelled from Poland, British historian Richard Grunberger cited him as an example of the permeation or infiltration of SS attitudes and values into mainstream postwar West German society and politics.Richard Grunberger, Hitler's SS (1970), page.114. Opinion revolves around his involvement in the SS, but it is unclear whether Kraft volunteered for the SS-Ehrenf√ºhrer post at his own initiative or to advance his career or whether he was pressured to do so by his immiediate superiors. Both the Minister for Agriculture, Richard Walther Darr√©, and the Gauleiter of Warthegau, Arthur Greiser, were senior and important SS officers and that may have influenced Kraft.

The Royal Navy ordered Blackmores construction three months after the outbreak of the Second World War. A. Stephen & Sons laid down her keel at their Glasgow yard on 10 February 1941, as Admiralty Job Number J1479. The ship was adopted by the civil community of Langport, Somerset after a successful Warship Week campaign. The ship was sold to the Royal Danish Navy and renamed HDMS Esbern Snare. Career Early operations Blackmore began her contractor sea trials in April, and the destroyer joined the Second Destroyer Flotilla. After completing trials and working up for operational service, in May the destroyer was nominated for escort of military convoys during their passage to Freetown. On 1 June Blackmore joined Convoy WS 19P, with the battleship and the destroyer as ocean escort during the convoy's Atlantic passage. On 15 June the destroyer detached from WS 19P upon arrival at Freetown, where she was retained for local escort duties. On 24 June, the destroyer left Freetown with the destroyer to meet with and escort Convoy WS 20 during its Atlantic passage from the Clyde. On 26 June she joined WS 20 on its way to Freetown. In July Blackmore was transferred to the Indian Ocean for convoy defence, detaching from WS 20 on 2 July along with the other ships on arrival to Freetown. On 6 July, Blackmore joined WS 20 as ocean escort, with the battleship the destroyers Brilliant and during the convoy's passage to the Cape of Good Hope. On 17 July, Blackmore detached from ocean escort duties with Malaya and escorted the convoy into Cape Town. On 19 July the destroyer was deployed at Simonstown for convoy defence in the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean. The destroyer remained in duty at Simonstown up until January 1943. In February, the destroyer joined Convoy WS 26 during its passage from Freetown to the Cape. Blackmore then joined as escort for WS 26 as a relief for the destroyer . The destroyer sailed to Durban for convoy defence duties in the Indian Ocean. On 1 March, the destroyer rejoined WS 26 from Durban as escort with the minesweeper and the destroyers and . On 3 March, Blackmore detached from the convoy to join another Convoy DN 21 as escort. After arriving at Durban with DN 21, Blackmore took passage to Simonstown to effect a refit. The destroyer's refit was finished in May, and after completing post refit trials, Blackmore took passage to Freetown to serve for Atlantic convoy defence. The destroyer was then deployed for local escort duties at Freetown, making a passage to Gibraltar on 20 June to escort Convoy WS 31 to Freetown. In July, Blackmore was nominated for transfer to the Mediterranean. The destroyer arrived at Freetown with WS 31 on 4 July and rejoined military convoy WS 31. Blackmore escorted the convoy until 15 July when she returned to Freetown and took passage to the Mediterranean. Mediterranean In August Blackmore joined the 57th Fleet Division based at Malta, and deployed for convoy defence in the central Mediterranean. In September the destroyer joined a naval task force to escort and support the Allied invasion of Italy. On 8 September the destroyer was deployed as an escort of the military convoy TSF1X during passage from Palermo to the Salerno beach head. Upon being released from the invasion of Italy, the destroyer resumed her convoy defence duties with the Division. Between November and December, Blackmore joined the 60th Destroyer Division, also based in Malta but deploying for convoy defence and support duties of military operations in the Adriatic sea. From January to May 1944, Blackmore continued in her convoy escort duties. On 16 January she carried out a bombardment of Durazzo in Albania with the destroyer . During June Blackmore was transferred to the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla, Mediterranean Fleet, taking part in an engagement against four German E-Boats in the Adriatic, with the destroyer . One E-Boat was sunk, with ten survivors rescued. In July the destroyer continued in her deployment with the flotilla, this time with the nomination for escort and patrol duties of military convoys during Allied landings in the south of France. This operation was carried under overall US Navy command. In August, Blackmore joined in the escort of Convoy SM 2 from Naples, sailing on 13 August. After being released from the operation, the destroyer resumed her flotilla duties. In September Blackmore was recalled to the United Kingdom for a refit at Sheerness, before being nominated for service with the Eastern Fleet. Service in the East The ship was taken in hand, the refit taking from October to January. Post refit trials were made at Nore Command. In March, Blackmore was deployed briefly for convoy defence, since additional escorts were needed to combat a concerted submarine and E-Boat attack in the Thames estuary. In April the destroyer was prepared for foreign service with the 18th Destroyer Flotilla within the Eastern Fleet. On 28 April Blackmore joined the flotilla at Bombay. In May the destroyer was deployed as a weather ship in the Andamans, during the Allied landings at Rangoon. After these landings, Blackmore was again deployed for convoy defence in support of military operations and patrol in the Indian Ocean. Blackmore continued to be deployed in this theatre until August, sailing from Trincomalee on 4 September as part of the escort task force for aircraft carriers during their passage to the Malacca Straits. On 6 September the destroyer joined military convoy JE1F, in the Malacca Straits, forming part of the escort in Operation Zipper. Postwar Service Blackmore was then deployed at Singapore, and was nominated for return to the United Kingdom where she was to be paid off into the reserve. The destroyer sailed from Trincomalee on 8 October 1945, and on arriving at Plymouth the destroyer was paid off at Devonport where she was laid up in the reserve fleet until 1952. Danish service After being placed on the sales list, Blackmore was transferred on loan to Denmark, on 18 July 1952. After refitting, the destroyer joined the Royal Danish Navy as a frigate, renamed Esbern Snare.Blackman, Raymond V B, Jane's Fighting Ships 1963-4, Sampson Low, Marston & Co.

The Ladbroke Estate was a substantial estate of land owned by the Ladbroke family in Notting Hill, London, England, in the early 19th century that was gradually developed and turned into housing during the middle years of the century, as London expanded. Characterized by terraces of stuccoed brick houses backing onto large private garden squares, much of the original building remains intact today, and now forms the heart of one of London's most expensive and fashionable neighbourhoods. History In the early 19th century the Ladbroke family owned a number of substantial parcels of land in Kensington, then a largely suburban area. All were located north of the Uxbridge Road (now Notting Hill Gate and Holland Park Avenue). Development of the land was begun in 1821, and continued until the 1870s. Around six architects and many more property speculators were involved in developing the final layout of the area.Chapter IX ‚Äî The Ladbroke Estate, British History Online, English Heritage, UK. Retrieved February 7, 2010. In the late 18th century, the estate had been owned by Richard Ladbroke, esquire, of Tadworth Court, Surrey. He died childless, and around 1821 his land passed to his nephew James Weller, who assumed the name Ladbroke in order to be able to inherit. James Weller Ladbroke held the estate until his death in 1847, though the actual development of the land was carried out by a firm of City solicitors, Smith, Bayley (known as Bayley and Janson after 1836), working in conjunction with the architect, landscaper and surveyor Thomas Allason. name=\\"page at British History Online\\">page at British History Online Retrieved February 7, 2010 Under the terms of his uncle's will James Weller Ladbroke could only grant leases of up to twenty-one years' duration. However, he and his advisers managed to obtain power by means of a private Act of Parliament of 1821 to grant ninety-nine-year leases, and it was at this point that development began in earnest. Allason's first task was to prepare a plan for the layout of the main portion of the estate, which was completed by 1823. The 1823 plan marks the genesis of Allason's most enduring idea ‚Äî the creation of large private communal gardens enclosed by terraces and/or crescents of houses. Eventually around fifteen of these communal gardens would be built, such as Arundel Gardens and Ladbroke Gardens, and they continue to contribute to the unique character of Notting Hill to this day. Allason's design was inspired by Nash's work at Regent's Park, and his vision was an ambitious one, consisting of a spectacular estate, focused on a large central circus with radiating streets built around central \\"paddocks\\" or garden squares. However, the financial crisis of 1825 forced his plans to be greatly scaled down, and Allason's original bold vision would never be fulfilled.Denny, p74 A number of different developers were involved in the eventual piecemeal development of the estate, including Robert Cantwell (who was also responsible for the elegant design of Royal Crescent), Joshua Flesher Hanson, Ralph Adams, and John Drew. Many of the more elegant buildings were the work of Thomas Allason, whose work may be seen in Stanley Gardens and Kensington Park Gardens, including St Peter's Notting Hill.Denny, p77 The Hippodrome 1841 map of the Environs of London, showing John Whyte's Hippodrome on the upper left hand side. The building boom of the 1820s did not last, and by the early 1830s new development had ground to a halt. From 1834-1838 no new building leases were granted. However, in 1837 the entrepreneur John Whyte leased of land from the estate and proceeded to enclose \\"the slopes of Notting Hill and the meadows west of Westbourne Grove\\" with a high wooden paling. The result was the Hippodrome, a bold and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to build a race course to rival Epsom and Ascot. Unfortunately, the race course was not a financial success and it closed in 1842.Gray, p252 By this time, conditions for building had once again become favourable, and development resumed, crescents of stuccoed houses being built on Whyte's circular race track. James Weller Ladbroke died in 1847, but building continued until almost all the available land had been developed by the 1870s. The Ladbroke Estate today Arundel Gardens, a part of the former Ladbroke Estate. Many streets in Notting Hill still bear the name of the Ladbroke family, including Ladbroke Grove and Ladbroke Square. Others are named after prominent statesmen of the period: Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne (Lansdowne Crescent, Rise and Road); George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon (Clarendon Cross and Road); and Edward Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley (Stanley Crescent and Gardens). The former Ladbroke Estate is now a conservation area. The Ladbroke Association, a local non-profit group with around 400 members, is dedicated to preserving the original vision of the Ladbroke Estate and maintaining its architectural integrity. Many parts of the 1999 film Notting Hill were set and shot in the former Ladbroke Estate.http://www.movie- locations.com/movies/n/Notting- Hill.phphttp://www.vincenthouselondon.com/15-notting-hill-film-locations- relive- romance/http://www.londongardenstrust.org/guides/guide.php?tour=NottingHillhttps://thewest.com.au/news/wa/notting- hill-love-seat-is-now-wa-treasure-ng- ya-380538https://www.solosophie.com/notting-hill-filming- locations/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/11/25/notting-hill-bookshop- inundated-requests-location-marriage-proposals/ See also * Notting Hill Notes References * The Ladbroke Estate, British History Online.

Recipients are grouped by grades of the Knight's Cross. During World War II, 453 German day and bomber destroyer pilots, 85 night fighter pilots, including 14 crew members, were awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.Obermaier 1989, p. 14. Among them, 130 pilots received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, 34 the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords, and nine won the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves Swords and Diamonds; 58 presentations were made posthumously. Background The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grades were based on four separate enactments. The first enactment, of 1 September 1939 instituted the Iron Cross, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross. Article 2 of the enactment mandated that the award of a higher class be preceded by the award of all preceding classes. As the war progressed, some of the recipients of the Knight's Cross distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment of 28 September 1941 introduced the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. At the end of 1944 the final grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds, based on the enactment of 29 December 1944, became the final variant of the Knight's Cross authorized. Recipients The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht kept separate Knight's Cross lists, one for each of the three military branches, Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air force) and for the Waffen-SS.

H-89, derived from H-8 (N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline- sulfonamide), was initially believed to act specifically as an inhibitor of PKA, being 30 times more potent than H-8 at inhibiting PKA and 10 times less potent at inhibiting protein kinase G. It achieves this through competitive inhibition of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) site on the PKA catalytic subunit. However, subsequent work has suggested a variety of additional effects such as inhibition of other protein kinases (IC50 values of 80, 120, 135, 270, 2600 and 2800 nM for S6K1, MSK1, PKA, ROCKII, PKBŒ± and MAPKAP-K1b respectively), and direct inhibition of various potassium currents. In addition to its use in studying mechanisms of cell signalling, H-89 has also been used experimentally in vivo. H-89 has been shown to increase the threshold and latency of pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures and decrease morphine withdrawal symptoms in mice.

The State of Criminal Justice 2020 (American Bar Association 2020)., Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3645536  Racial disparity  The term racial disparity as it relates to crime can be defined as the proportion of a racial or ethnic group within the criminal justice system exceeding the proportion of such a group within the general population. People of color are more likely to be racially profiled and stopped. Racial disparities in the US criminal justice system worsened after 1980 following various political developments. The Nixon, Reagan and Bush administrations are credited for directing what is known as the War on Drugs. In 1986, the U.S. Congress passed laws that created a 100 to 1 sentencing disparity for the trafficking or possession of crack when compared to penalties for trafficking of powder cocaine, which had been widely criticized as discriminatory against minorities, mostly blacks, who were more likely to use crack than powder cocaine.\\"The Fair Sentencing Act corrects a long-time wrong in cocaine cases\\", The Washington Post, August 3, 2010. Retrieved September 30, 2010. Statistics from 1998 show that there were wide racial disparities in arrests, prosecutions, sentencing and deaths. African-American drug users made up for 35% of drug arrests, 55% of convictions, and 74% of people sent to prison for drug possession crimes.Burton-Rose (ed.), 1998: pp. 246‚Äì247 Nationwide, African-Americans were sent to state prisons for drug offenses 13 times more often than other races, even though they only supposedly comprised 13% of regular drug users.  Causes  Racial disparity in commission of violent crime is commonly attributed to the social status and financial means of minorities. Poverty is one factor correlated with an increase in criminal activity. The correlation between poverty and criminal activity has been shown to be independent of race, with the disproportionate number of minorities in poverty being a major reason for their disproportionately high levels of criminal activity. Research shows that childhood exposure to violence also significantly increases the likelihood of engagement in violent behavior. When studies control for childhood exposure to violence, black and white males in the United States are equally likely to engage in violent behavior. However, according to the Department of justice, black children are four times more likely to be incarcerated in youth facilities than whites.https://eji.org/news/black- children-five-times-more-likely-than-whites-to-be-incarcerated< Among American teens, black-white differences in violence are accounted for by differences in family income and socialization with deviant peers in school.  Discrimination by the criminal justice system in Europe  Research suggests that police practices, such as racial profiling, over-policing in areas populated by minorities and in-group bias may result in disproportionately high numbers of racial minorities among crime suspects in Sweden, Italy, and England and Wales. According to the Racial Disparity Audit conducted by the Prime Minister, in 2017 minorities living in Wales and England were more than 3.5 times more likely to be arrested than whites. Likewise, this same group was far more likely to be the victims of crime with their white counterparts only having 15 percent likelihood. Research also suggests that there may be possible discrimination by the judicial system, which contributes to a higher number of convictions for racial minorities in Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Denmark and France.  Discrimination by the criminal justice system in the United States  Research suggests that police practices, such as racial profiling, over-policing in areas populated by minorities and in-group bias may result in disproportionately high numbers of racial minorities among crime suspects. Research also suggests that there may be possible discrimination by the judicial system, which contributes to a higher number of convictions for racial minorities. A 2012 study found that \\"(i) juries formed from all-white jury pools convict black defendants significantly (16 percentage points) more often than white defendants, and (ii) this gap in conviction rates is entirely eliminated when the jury pool includes at least one black member.\\" Research has found evidence of negative in-group bias, where \\"black (white) juveniles who are randomly assigned to black (white) judges are more likely to get incarcerated (as opposed to being placed on probation), and they receive longer sentences.\\" In-group bias has also been observed when it comes to traffic citations, as black and white cops are more likely to cite out-groups. A 2014 study in the Journal of Political Economy found that 9% of the black-white gap in sentencing could not be accounted for. The elimination of unexplained sentencing disparities would reduce \\"the level of black men in federal prison by 8,000‚Äì11,000 men [out of black male prison population of 95,000] and save $230‚Äì$320 million per year in direct costs.\\" The majority of the unexplained sentencing disparity appears to occur at the point when prosecutors decide to bring charges carrying ‚Äúmandatory minimum‚Äù sentences. A 2018 paper by Alma Cohen and Crystal Yang of Harvard Law School found that \\"Republican-appointed judges give substantially longer prison sentences to black offenders versus observably similar non-black offenders compared to Democratic-appointed judges within the same district court.\\" A 2018 study in the Quarterly Journal of Economics found that bail judges in Miami and Philadelphia were racially biased against black defendants, as white defendants had higher rates of pretrial misconduct than black defendants. A 2018 study in the American Journal of Public Health found that black and Hispanic men were far more likely to be killed by police than white men. A 2019 study by Roland G. Fryer, Jr. found that while there are no racial differences in lethal use of police force, blacks and Hispanics are significantly more likely to experience non-lethal use of force. A 2019 paper by Princeton University political scientists disputed the findings by Fryer, saying that if police had a higher threshold for stopping whites, this might mean that the whites, Hispanics and blacks in Fryer's data are not similar. Reports by the Department of Justice have also found that police officers in Baltimore, Maryland, and Ferguson, Missouri, systemically stop, search (in some cases strip-searching) and harass black residents. A January 2017 report by the DOJ also found that the Chicago Police Department had \\"unconstitutionally engaged in a pattern of excessive and deadly force\\" and that police \\"have no regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color.\\" A 2018 study found that police officers more likely to use lethal force on blacks. A 2019 study in the Journal of Politics found that police officers were more likely to use lethal force on blacks, but that this \\"most likely driven by higher rates of police contact among African Americans rather than racial differences in the circumstances of the interaction and officer bias in the application of lethal force.\\" In criminal sentencing, medium to dark-skinned African Americans are likely to receive sentences 2.6 years longer than those of whites or light-skinned African Americans. When a white victim is involved, those with more \\"black\\" features are likely to receive a much more severe punishment. A 2018 National Bureau of Economic Research experiment found that law students, economics students and practicing lawyers who watched 3D Virtual Reality videos of court trials (where the researchers altered the race of the defendants) showed a racial bias against minorities. According to a 2011 ProPublica analysis, \\"whites are nearly four times as likely as minorities to win a pardon, even when the type of crime and severity of sentence are taken into account.\\" A 2013 report by the American Civil Liberties Union found that blacks were \\"3.73 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession,\\" even though \\"blacks and whites use drugs, including marijuana, at similar rates.\\" A 2014 study on the application of the death penalty in Connecticut over the period 1973‚Äì2007 found \\"that minority defendants who kill white victims are capitally charged at substantially higher rates than minority defendants who kill minorities... There is also strong and statistically significant evidence that minority defendants who kill whites are more likely to end up with capital sentences than comparable cases with white defendants.\\" A 2016 analysis by the New York Times \\"of tens of thousands of disciplinary cases against inmates in 2015, hundreds of pages of internal reports and three years of parole decisions found that racial disparities were embedded in the prison experience in New York.\\" Blacks and Latinos were sent more frequently to solitary and held there for longer durations than whites. The New York Times analysis found that the disparities were the greatest for violations where the prison guards had much discretion, such as disobeying orders, but smaller for violations that required physical evidence, such as possessing contraband. A 2016 report by the Sarasota Herald-Tribune found that Florida judges sentence black defendants to far longer prison sentences than whites with the same background. For the same drug possession crimes, blacks were sentenced to double the time of whites. Blacks were given longer sentences in 60 percent of felony cases, 68 percent of the most serious first-degree crimes, 45 percent of burglary cases and 30 percent of battery cases. For third-degree felonies (the least serious types of felonies in Florida), white judges sentenced blacks to twenty percent more time than whites, whereas black judges gave more balanced sentences. A 2017 report by the Marshall Project found that killings of black men by whites were far more likely to be deemed \\"justifiable\\" than killings by any other combination of races. A 2017 report by the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) found, \\"after controlling for a wide variety of sentencing factors\\" (such as age, education, citizenship, weapon possession and prior criminal history), that \\"black male offenders received sentences on average 19.1 percent longer than similarly situated White male offenders.\\" A 2018 study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that tall young black men are especially likely to receive unjustified attention by law enforcement. The authors furthermore found a \\"causal link between perceptions of height and perceptions of threat for Black men, particularly for perceivers who endorse stereotypes that Black people are more threatening than White people.\\" A 2018 study in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics found that judges gave longer sentences, in particular to black defendants, after their favorite team lost a home game. Analysis of more than 20 million traffic stops in North Carolina showed that blacks were more than twice as likely as whites to be pulled over by police for traffic stops, and that blacks were more likely to be searched following the stop. There were no significant difference in the likelihood that Hispanics would be pulled over, but Hispanics were much more likely to be searched following a traffic stop than whites. When the study controlled for searches in high-crime areas, it still found that police disproportionately targeted black individuals. These racial disparities were particularly pronounced for young men. The study found that whites who were searched were more likely to carry contraband than blacks and Hispanics. A 2018 study in the Journal of Empirical Legal Studies found that law enforcement officers in Texas who could charge shoplifters with two types of crimes (one more serious, one less so) due to a vaguely worded statute were more likely to charge blacks and Hispanics with the more serious crime. A 2019 study, which made use of a dataset of the racial makeup of every U.S. sheriff over a 25-year period, found that \\"ratio of Black‚Äêto‚ÄêWhite arrests is significantly higher under White sheriffs\\" and that the effects appear to be \\"driven by arrests for less‚Äêserious offenses and by targeting Black crime types.\\" A 2019 audit study found that lawyers are less likely to take on clients with black-sounding names than white-sounding names.

It also goes under the names of Martini or Martinssingen and the Low German names of S√ºnnematten or Mattenherrn (today often erroneously corrupted to Matten Matten M√§hren). Martinisingen takes place on 10 November (similar to the Catholic Martinssingen on 11 November) with groups of people carrying their lanterns from house to house and singing traditional songs.  History  Martinisingen is a custom with a mix of several older elements. Traditionally 10 November was the day on which farmhands and ordinary workers were dismissed for the winter. These folk, most of whom had no property, then had to survive the coldest time of the year without any income. However, their children were able to help by going from house to house on this day and begging for food and gifts, especially from the well-to-do farmers and citizens. Originally they collected food that was then actually stored as part of their family's winter stock and could be consumed gradually. Sometimes rather older singers disguised themselves or wore masks (sƒüabellenskoppen) and joined in. Later, the gifts given out increasingly became a symbolic donation and, today, usually consist of sweets and fruit. The traditional gifts, by contrast, include gingerbread men (Stutenkerl), honey cakes (Moppen) and Pfeffern√ºsse (pƒìpern√∂√∂ten) as well as apples. The poor folk begged for gifts by reciting rhyming verses or singing suitable songs and the children carried lanterns (kipkapk√∂√∂gels) that used to be made from a beet. Later small pumpkins were occasionally used as well, but gradually, these were replaced by coloured paper lanterns as are common today. Various home-made instruments were also used such as rattles (Rasseln) and friction drums (Rummelpott). With the outbreak of the Reformation the original motive of begging to supplement winter food supplies became interwoven with religious aspects, particularly those honouring the reformer, Martin Luther, and the festival became the Protestant church's version of the original Catholic tradition.HVV Holtgast / Ost-Friesland - altes Brauchtum - Martini-Singen In 1817, on the occasion of the tricentennial anniversary of the Reformation in 1517, Martinisingen was brought forward to the eve of St. Martin's Day. From then on, only Martin Luther continued to be celebrated as the \\"Friend of light and man of God\\" (Freund des Lichts und Mann Gottes) who \\"knocked the crown off the pope in Rome\\" (der dem Papst in Rom die Krone vom Haupt schlug). For example, St. Martin's Day for Martin of Tours on the 11th was brought forward and combined with Martinisingen on the 10th, the birthday of the Reformer. So, increasingly, the custom of Martinisingen became a celebration of Martin Luther and the motive of begging for food was explained as a tradition of the monastic orders. The traditional songs were given a religious flavour and new ones were written that celebrated the religious significance of the day or honoured Martin Luther.  Present-day customs  Today children go through the suburbs from door to door after the onset of dusk carrying lanterns and singing Martinilieder or St Martin's Eve songs. The light in the lantern is often no longer a candle but electric because, in the November winds, the lanterns often caught fire (hence the verse in the song \\"Lanterns, Lanterns\\" which runs \\"burn up my light, but not my precious lantern\\"). But, as before the lanterns are often home-made from coloured paper. About Matten Matten M√§ren the Hannoversche Wochenblatt weekly paper writes: > There is a hard and fast rule today as there always has been: Whoever gives > nothing, will have a prank played on themHannoversches Wochenblatt, 7 > November 2007, pS. 3 so even in East Frisian-North German areas those who do not give anything can expect to have their doorbells rung later on in the evening or other similar \\"joke\\"; equally those who do not sing, also get nothing. Since the end of the 1990s Martinisingen has had competition from Halloween as a result of shop advertising and American television, as well as the enthusiasm of a few teachers in primary schools and kindergartens, but the new festival, apart from discos, has been criticised and largely rejected, according to the newspaper, the Emder Zeitung.Superintendent Erich Bolinius in the Emder Zeitung,  The best-known Martini song   Lanterns (Laterne)  Ich geh mit meiner Laterne :Start of the chorus: :Ich geh mit meiner Laterne :und meine Laterne mit mir. :Da oben leuchten die Sterne :und unten da leuchten wir. :Verses :1.

The dispute began in 1992 and concluded in 2009. McSharry lives on a farm in Gleniff, near Ben Bulben in North County Sligo. He is married and has family. He is known for wearing an Indiana Jones-type broad-brimmed hat and he refers to himself as \\"the Bull\\", a reference to the character in John B. Keane's play The Field. Fine Gael's spokesperson on Arts, Sports and Tourism Jimmy Deenihan once said of McSharry: ‚ÄúJohn B would have loved to have met you‚Äù. The farmer has often been seen driving around on an all-terrain vehicle to ensure his land is not invaded. The dispute began when McSharry's lands were included in a guidebook distributed to walkers despite him not having authorised this. The route through his lands was taken out of the book; however walkers still wandered onto his lands even when he posted \\"Keep Out\\" notices. The publicity raised by McSharry prompted other farmers to also defend their lands. In 2003, he was convicted of issuing threats to hillwalkers the previous year and, upon refusal to pay a ‚Ç¨300 fine, was sent to prison for two weeks in January the following year. He had even considered going on hunger strike, saying the publicity generated by the case was attracting even more curious people onto his lands and that half a dozen people had even trampled down part of his fence. During an interview on his sentencing he said: ‚ÄúThere is no way farmers can give away land to strangers. We must get our share. There is no free inch or no free land in the country‚Äù. Two hundred farmers, including President of the Irish Farmers' Association John Dillon, protested at his sentencing and gathered outside the gates of Loughan House open prison in County Cavan to welcome him as he was released from his confinement. In an interview with Farm Week on RT√â Radio 1 after his release he said: \\"There is no way in hell I will let walkers through my land for nothing\\". A report sent to Irish Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs √âamon √ì Cu√≠v later in January 2004 suggested the establishment of a national council to deal with land ownership and access rights. Speaking at the annual general meeting of the Irish Cattle and Sheepfarmers' Association in February 2004, McSharry compared the group Keep Ireland Open to the Mafia, saying: \\"These people want a slice of everyone's action for nothing\\". A \\"peace deal\\" was offered in October 2004 as a \\"goodwill gesture\\" where walkers could access lands for one day. The dispute came to an end in September 2009 with Minister √ì Cu√≠v visiting to publicly shake hands with McSharry and launch a new mountain walk at his home in Gleniff. No money exchanged hands. McSharry's story was documented in the RT√â television series L√©argas.

She became the first wife of Sir Edward Seymour, who went on to become the first Duke of Somerset of a new creation, Lord Protector of England and the uncle of King Edward VI, after his sister Jane married King Henry VIII. A 17th-century marginal note to copy of Vincent's Baronage at College of Heralds alleged that she had had an affair with her father-in-law, Sir John Seymour.\\"repudiata, quia pater ejus post nuptias eam congovit\\" However, there is no contemporary evidence to support this. Catherine Fillol may have gone to a local convent, as this seems to be implied by a remark in her father's will. The will was challenged by Sir Edward Seymour in 1531, on the basis that his father-in-law was not of sound mind. In 1535, Sir Edward Seymour married his second wife Anne Stanhope, indicating that Catherine Fillol had probably died no later than early 1535.David Loades, Jane Seymour: Henry VIII's Favourite Wife, Amberley, 2013, p. 28 Catherine Fillol had two sons, John Seymour (buried 19 December 1552), who died unmarried and without issue,The Complete Peerage, vol.XII pI, p.65, note c, & p. 84 and Edward Seymour. Edward Seymour had ten more children by his second wife, including his eventual heir Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford. When he was later created Duke of Somerset, his children by his first marriage were still considered legitimate, but the patent of nobility provides that the dukedom is to descend first to his heirs by Anne, and only in the event of the failure of that line to his heirs by Catherine.Alexander Burgess, Memoir of the life of the Right Reverend George Burgess, D.

When planning began for Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa in 1942, it was decided to attach the 1st Parachute Brigade, part of the 1st Airborne Division, to the Allied forces taking part, as an American airborne unit, the 2nd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment, was also to be used during the invasion. After a short period of training and being brought up to operational strength, mainly with men from the 2nd Parachute Brigade, also part of the 1st Airborne Division, the brigade was deployed to North Africa in November 1942. Units from the 1st Para Brigade dropped near B√¥ne on 12 November, then near Souk el-Arba and B√©ja on 13 November, and at Pont Du Fahs on 29 November, seizing airfields, fighting as infantry after each action and linking up with an Allied armoured force, supporting it until December. Due to the inability of units of the British First Army to link up with the Pont Du Fahs force, the 2nd Parachute Battalion, under Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, was forced to retreat over fifty miles towards the nearest Allied units; it was attacked several times during the retreat, and although it reached Allied lines safely it had taken more than 250 casualties. For the next four months the 1st Para Brigade was used in a ground role, serving under several formations and advancing with Allied ground forces; it suffered heavy casualties on several occasions but also took large numbers of Axis prisoners. The brigade was transferred out of the front in mid-April 1943 and left to rejoin the rest of the 1st Airborne Division to train for Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. Background Formation The German military was one of the pioneers of the use of airborne formations, conducting several successful airborne operations during the Battle of France in 1940, including the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael.Flanagan, p.6 Impressed by the success of German airborne operations, the Allied governments decided to form their own airborne formations.Harclerode, p.197 This decision would eventually lead to the creation of two British airborne divisions, as well as a number of smaller units.Harclerode, p.107 The British airborne establishment began development on 22 June 1940, when the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office in a memorandum to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops. Despite the Prime Minister's desire to have 5,000 airborne troops within a short period, a number of problems were rapidly encountered by the War Office. Very few military gliders existed in Britain in 1940, and these were too light for military purposes, and there was also a shortage of suitable transport aircraft to tow gliders and carry paratroopers. On 10 August, Churchill was informed that although 3,500 volunteers had been selected to train as airborne troops, only 500 could currently begin training because of limitations in equipment and aircraft.Otway, p.21 The War Office stated in a memorandum to the Prime Minister in December 1940 that 500 parachute troops could probably be trained and be ready for operations by the spring of 1941, but this figure was purely arbitrary; the actual number that could be trained and prepared by that period would rely entirely on the creation of a training establishment and the provision of required equipment.Otway, p.23 A training establishment for parachute troops was set up at RAF Ringway, near Manchester, on 21 June 1940 and named the Central Landing Establishment, and the initial 500 volunteers began training for airborne operations. A number of gliders were being designed and constructed by the Royal Air Force, which had also provided a number of Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bombers for conversion into transport aircraft. Organizational plans were also being laid down, with the War Office calling for two parachute brigades to be operational by 1943.Otway, p.28 However, the immediate development of any further airborne formations, as well as the initial 500 volunteers already training, was hampered by three problems. With the threat of invasion in 1940, many War Office officials and senior British Army officers did not believe that sufficient men could be spared from the effort to the rebuild the Army after the Battle of France to create an effective airborne force; many believed that such a force would only have a nuisance raiding value and would not affect the conflict in any useful way. There were also material problems; all three of the armed services were expanding and rebuilding, particularly the Army, and British industry had not yet been organised to a sufficient war footing to support all three services as well as the fledgling airborne force.Otway, p.25 Finally, the airborne forces lacked a single, coherent policy, with no clear idea as to how they should be organised, or whether they should come under the command of the Army or the RAF; inter organizational rivalry between the War Office and the Air Ministry, in charge of the RAF, was a major factor in delaying the further expansion of British airborne forces. Expansion Six man parties of 1st Airborne Division Paratroops marching toward Hotspur gliders of the Glider Pilot Exercise Unit at Netheravon. However, despite these difficulties, by mid 1941 the fledgling airborne establishment was able to form the first British airborne unit. This was No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion, which numbered approximately 350 officers and other ranks, and had been formed by converting and retraining No. 2 Commando.Otway, pp.31‚Äì32 On 10 February 1941 thirty eight men from the battalion conducted the first British airborne operation, Operation Colossus, a raid against an aqueduct in southern Italy; it was hoped that the destruction of the aqueduct would deprive Italian civilian and military installations of their water supply, damage Italian morale and the Italian war effort in North Africa.Saunders, p.19 The raid was a failure, with all but one of the airborne troops being captured by Italian military forces, but it did help provide the British airborne establishment with vital lessons for future operations.Otway, p.65 Shortly after the operation had been conducted, a memorandum was circulated through the War Office by the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Royal Air Force requiring that No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion be expanded into a Parachute Brigade.Otway, p.33Thompson, p.28 In July, after a period of discussion about the problems of creating such a formation, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff authorised the raising of a brigade headquarters, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Parachute Battalions and an air troop of sappers from the Royal Engineers. Given the title of 1st Parachute Brigade, volunteers from infantry units were recruited for the new formation from 31 August.Otway, pp.33‚Äì34 Initially commanded by Brigadier Richard Nelson Gale, who was replaced in mid 1942 by Brigadier Edwin Flavell, the brigade began an extensive training regime, which included conducting trials and tests of new airborne equipment. On 10 October it was joined by 1 Airlanding Brigade, which had been formed from 31 Independent Brigade Group, a formation recently returned from India.Otway, p.37 This was shortly followed, on 29 October, by the formation of Headquarters 1st Airborne Division under the command of Brigadier F.A.M. Browning, who would have under his control 1st Parachute Brigade, 1st Airlanding Brigade, and the glider units currently training with the two brigades.Otway, p.39 Browning was shortly after promoted to the rank of Major General, and he then supervised the newly formed division as it underwent a prolonged of expansion and intensive training, with new brigades being raised and then assigned to the division and even more new equipment being tested.Otway, pp.46‚Äì47 By mid April 1942 the division was able to conduct a small scale airborne exercise for the benefit of the Prime Minister, in which twenty one transport aircraft and nine gliders participated, and by late December the division had been brought up to full strength.Otway, p.51 In mid September, as the division was coming close to reaching full strength, Browning was informed that Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, would take place in November. After being informed that the 2nd Battalion of the American 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment was to take part in the campaign, he argued that a larger airborne force should be utilised during the invasion, as the large distances and comparatively light opposition would provide a number of opportunities for airborne operations.Thompson, p.53 The War Office and Commander in Chief, Home Forces were won over by the argument, and agreed to detach 1st Parachute Brigade from 1st Airborne Division and place it under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would command all Allied troops participating in the invasion.Harclerode, p.209 The Air Ministry was unable to provide transport aircraft or aircrews to operate with the brigade, so the United States Army Air Forces took over this responsibility, providing 60 Group of 51 Wing which flew Douglas C-47 Dakotas. A practice drop was conducted with a unit from the brigade on 9 October, although a lack of American familiarity with British airborne equipment and parachuting technique, as well a lack of British familiarity with the Dakota, led to three men being killed; this meant a delay in training whilst new techniques were developed, which in turn resulted in the majority of the brigade's personnel travelling to North Africa without having conducted a training drop from a Dakota.Otway, p.62Thompson, p.55 After it had been brought to full operational strength, partly by cross posting personnel from the newly formed 2nd Parachute Brigade, and had been provided with sufficient equipment and resources, the brigade departed for North Africa at the beginning of November. Operations B√¥ne Supermarine Spitfire Mark Vs, reinforcement aircraft for North African units, lined up at Bone airfield, Algeria. As an insufficient number of transport aircraft were allocated to the brigade, it was only possible to transport 3rd Parachute Battalion by air, with the battalion's strength consisting of its headquarters staff and 'B' and 'C' companies.Saunders, p.78'A' Company remained with the rest of 1st Parachute Brigade, and would land with the brigade in Algiers on 12 November. The battalion landed at Gibraltar at dawn on 10 November, and its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Pine Coffin, was informed that the battalion was scheduled to conduct an airborne operation the next day.Thompson, p.57 Pine Coffin was briefed by Lt. Gen. Kenneth Anderson, commander of the British First Army, on the mission; it was to take off from the airfield at Maison Blanche and conduct a parachute drop to capture an airfield near the port of B√¥ne, which bordered both Tunisia and Algeria. It was known by Allied intelligence that a battalion of German Fallschirmjaeger were currently stationed at Tunis, and that they were likely to be given the same task; as such, it was vital that the two companies capture the airfield first. Once this had been achieved, it would then hold the airfield until relieved by No. 6 Commando, which would conduct an amphibious landing, capture B√¥ne itself and link up with the battalion.Harclerode, p.227 This was a challenging task for Pine Coffin, as the battalion had arrived in fewer Dakotas than it would need to conduct a parachute drop, and two aircraft had failed to arrive at Gibraltar; however, sufficient aircraft were found and at 04:30 on 11 November they took off from Gibraltar, landing at Maison Blanche at 09:00. However, since the American pilots flying the Dakotas had no experience with night drops and locating drop zones in darkness was extremely difficult, it was decided to delay the mission until dawn on 12 November.Saunders, p.79 The day before the operation, Pine Coffin and his staff began to plan for the mission. The 29 Dakotas that were to transport the battalion would take off from Maison Blanche and follow the coast until they reached the harbour at B√¥ne. The leading Dakota would then turn south east and fly low over the airfield to ascertain its status. If it was unoccupied, the paratroopers would be dropped onto the airfield, but if the Fallschirmjaeger were present then the Dakotas would drop the companies a mile away; there they would form up and launch an attack on the airfield. The planning was completed by 16:30, and at 20:00 the American pilots were briefed on the operation, which was briefly interrupted when a German aircraft flew over the area and dropped a stick of bombs. The aircraft took off at 08:30 the next day and experienced an uneventful flight to the airfield, although two aircraft experienced mechanical problems and ditched into the ocean, causing three casualties.Otway, p.75 The lead Dakota flew over the airfield, and after observing the airfield to be unoccupied, dropped its paratroopers, followed in succession by the remaining transport aircraft. The drop was reasonably accurate, with a few containers and paratroopers being dropped three miles from the airfield. Thirteen men were injured during the drop, primarily when they landed, and one was killed when he accidentally shot himself with his Sten gun. One officer was knocked unconscious during landing and remained so for the next four days, on occasion being heard to murmur \\"I'll have a little more of the turbot, waiter!\\".Saunders, p.80 Unknown to the British force, their drop had been observed by a flight of German Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft, carrying a Fallschirmjaeger battalion; having seen that the airfield was already occupied, the aircraft turned back towards Tunis. When it had secured the airfield, the battalion came under attack from Stuka divebombers, and was initially defenceless. However, once No. 6 Commando had secured B√¥ne, a number of Oerlikon anti aircraft guns were salvaged from sunken vessels in the port's harbour, and these, in combination with a squadron of Spitfires that arrived on the evening of 11 November, were used to fend off future attacks.Messenger, p.183Harclerode, p.228 The battalion held the airfield in conjunction with No. 6 Commando until 15 November, when it withdrew and linked up with 'A' Company and the rest of 1st Parachute Brigade at Maison Blanche. B√©ja and Souk el Arba 1st Parachute Brigade, less 3rd Parachute Battalion, arrived at Algiers on 12 November, with some of its stores arriving slightly later. By the evening, reconnaissance parties had travelled to the airfield at Maison Blanche, with the remainder of the brigade following on the morning of 13 November; it was quartered in Maison Blanche, Maison-Carr√©e and Rouiba. On the same day, the brigade was joined by 2nd Battalion of the American 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment, which was forthwith attached to the brigade; the battalion had arrived in North Africa on 8 November, and been supporting the advance of the United States Fifth Army. The original intentions of Lieutenant General Kenneth Anderson, commander of the British First Army, had been to have the brigade, minus 3rd Parachute Battalion, conduct a parachute drop against the port of Tunis, approximately five hundred miles behind German lines.Thompson, p.56 The brigade had been issued with briefing materials for the operation, which it studied as it sailed to North Africa, but the plan had been abandoned by the time it arrived; Allied intelligence reported that between 7,000 10,000 German troops had recently been airlanded in Tunis, which ensured that an airborne operation out of the question. With this ambitious plan cancelled, on 14 November First Army directed that a single parachute battalion would be dropped the next day near Souk el-Arba and B√©ja; the battalion was to contact French forces at Beja to ascertain whether they would remain neutral, or support the Allies; secure and guard the cross roads and airfield at Soul el Arba; and patrol eastwards to harass German forces. The 2nd Battalion of the 509th PIR would drop at the same time, with the objective of capturing the airfields at Tebessa and Youks el-Bain. 1st Parachute Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James Hill, was selected for the task, to which Hill objected. The battalion had been forced to unload the vessel carrying its supplies and equipment itself, and had also to arrange its own transportation to Maison Blanche as no drivers were provided at Algiers; when it had arrived at Maison Blanche, it had been subjected to several Luftwaffe air raids that targeted the airfield. Hill argued that as a result his men were exhausted, and he did not believe all of the battalion's equipment could be sorted out within twenty four hours; as such he asked for the operation to be postponed for a short period, but this was denied.Thompson, p.58 Panoramic view of B√©ja. Hill faced further problems as he planned for the operation. The American pilots of the Dakota transport aircraft that would transport the battalion were inexperienced and had never conducted a parachute drop before, and there was no time for any training or exercises. There was also no photos of the airfield or the surrounding areas, and only a single, small scale map available for navigation.Otway, p.76Saunders, p.83 To ensure that the aircraft found the drop zone and delivered the battalion accurately, Hill decided that he would sit in the cockpit of the leading Dakota and assist the pilot.Thompson, p.59 Despite the battalion's parachutes only arriving at 16:30 on 14 November, and were packed twelve to a container which meant they had to be removed and individually repacked, the battalion was prepared by 15 November and took off at 07:30. The Dakotas were escorted by four American P-38 Lightning fighters, which engaged and drove off two roving German fighters, but as the Dakotas approached the Tunisian border, they encountered thick clouds and were forced to turn back, landing at Maison Blanche at 11:00. It was decided that the battalion would conduct the operation the next day, which allowed the paratroopers to rest for a night. At the same time, 2nd Battalion of the 509th PIR successfully conducted a drop at Tebessa, capturing its objectives and securing the area; it then passed from the control of 1st Parachute Brigade and remained in the area for some time. 1st Parachute Battalion took off on the morning of 16 November, and encountered excellent weather which allowed the transport aircraft to drop the battalion accurately around the airfield at Souk el Arba. Most of the paratroopers landed successfully, but one man was killed when his rigging line twisted around his neck mid drop, throttling him; one officer broke his leg on landing, and four men were wounded when a Sten gun was accidentally fired. The battalion's second in command, Major Pearson, remained at the airfield with a small detachment which collected airborne equipment and supervised the burial of the casualty.Thompson, p.60 Meanwhile, Lieutenant Colonel Hill led the rest of the battalion, approximately 525 strong, in some commandeered trucks towards the town of B√©ja, an important road and railway centre approximately forty miles from the airfield. The battalion arrived around 18:00 and was welcomed by the local French garrison, 3,000 strong, which Hill managed to persuaded to cooperate with the paratroopers; in order to give the garrison and any German observers the impression that he possessed a larger force than he actually did, Hill arranged for the battalion to march through the town several times, wearing different headgear and holding different equipment each time.Saunders, p.84 A short time after the battalion entered B√©ja, several German aircraft arrived and bombed the town, although they caused little damage and no casualties.Thompson, p.61 The next day, 'S' Company was sent with a detachment of engineers to the village of Sidi N'Sir, about twenty miles away; they were to contact the local French forces, believed to be pro British, and harass German forces.Harclerode, p.232 The detachment found the village and made contact with the French, who allowed them to pass through towards the town of Mateur; by nightfall the force had not reached the town, and decided to encamp for the night.Saunders, pp.84‚Äì85 At dawn a German convoy of armoured cars passed the detachment, and it was decided to set an ambush for the convoy if it returned, with anti-tank mines being laid on the road and a mortar and Bren guns being set up in concealed positions.Saunders, p.85Harclerode, p.282 When the convoy returned at approximately 10:00 the leading vehicle struck a mine and exploded, blocking the road, and the other vehicles were disabled with mortar fire, Gammon bombs and the remaining anti tank mines. A number of Germans were killed and the rest taken prisoner, with two paratroopers being slightly wounded. The detachment returned to B√©ja with prisoners and several slightly damaged armoured cars.Saunders, p.86 After the success of the ambush, Hill sent a second patrol to harass local German forces, but it was withdrawn after it encountered a larger German force that inflicted several British casualties; B√©ja was also bombed by Stuka divebombers, inflicting civilian casualties and destroying a number of houses.Saunders, pp.86‚Äì87 The bridge at Medjez el Bab. On 19 November, Hill visited the commanding officer of the French forces guarding a vital bridge at Medjez el Bab, and warned him that any attempt by German forces to cross the bridge would be opposed by the battalion. Hill attached 'R' Company to the French forces to ensure the bridge was not captured. German forces soon arrived at the bridge, and their commanding officer demanded that they be allowed to take control of the bridge and cross it to attack the British positions. The French rejected the German demands, and in conjunction with 'R' Company repelled subsequent German attacks that lasted several hours.Harclerode, p.233 The battalion was reinforced with the American 175th Field Artillery Battalion and elements of the Derbyshire Yeomanry, but despite fierce resistance the German forces proved to be too strong, and by 04:30 on 20 November the Allied forces had yielded the bridge and the surrounding area to the Germans.Atkinson, pp.181‚Äì182 Two days later, Hill received information that a strong Italian force, which included a number of tanks, was stationed at Gue Hill.Thompson, p.62 Hill decided to attack the force and attempt to disable the tanks, and the following night moved the battalion, less a small guard detachment which remained at B√©ja, to Sidi N'Sir where it linked up with a force of French Senegalese infantry. Hill decided that the battalion's section of 3 inch mortars would cover 'R' and 'S' Companies as they advanced up Gue Hill and attacked the Italian force, while a small force of sappers would mine the road at the rear of the hill to ensure the Italian tanks could not retreat.Harclerode, p.234 The battalion arrived at the hill without incident and began to prepare for the attack; however, just prior to the beginning of the attack there were several loud explosions from the rear of the hill. The anti tank grenades carried by the sappers had accidentally detonated, killing all but two of them.Thompson, p.63 The battalion lost the element of surprise, and Hill immediately ordered the two companies to advance up the hill. The force reached the top of the hill and engaged a mixed force of German and Italian soldiers, who were assisted by three Italian light tanks. Hill drew his revolver, and with his adjutant and a small group of paratroopers advanced on the tanks, firing shots through their observation ports in an attempt to persuade the crews to surrender. The tactic worked on two tanks, but upon reaching the third tank Hill and his men were fired upon by the tanks crew; Hill was shot three times in the chest and his adjutant wounded, and the tank crew swiftly dispatched with small arms fire.Harclerode, pp.234‚Äì235 Hill survived because of prompt medical treatment, and was replaced as commander of the battalion by Major Pearson, who supervised the routing of the rest of the German and Italian soldiers. Two days later the battalion moved from Beja to an area south of Mateur, where it linked up with Allied ground forces and came under the command of an armoured regimental group known as 'Blade Force';Ford, p.15Watson, p.61 the battalion remained in the area in conjunction with 'Blade Force' until it was withdrawn on 11 December.Otway, p.77 Depienne and Oudna On 18 November, 1st Parachute Brigade was ordered by British First Army to prepare 2nd Parachute Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, to drop near the coastal city of Sousse in order to deny the nearby port and airfield to the Axis. There being a limited number of transport aircraft available to the brigade, it was decided that two companies would take off from Maison Blanche at 11:00 on 19 November, with the remainder of the battalion following the next day; the length of the operation was estimated to be ten days.Otway, p.78 However, the operation was delayed for twenty four hours on 18 November, and again on 19 November for a further period; during this period, 3rd Parachute Battalion arrived at Maison Blanche, which was itself subjected to several Axis air raids which inflicted several casualties on the airborne troops and damaged several aircraft. Finally on 27 November the brigade was ordered to prepare 2nd Parachute Battalion for a parachute drop near the town of Pont du Fahs, in order to deny its use to the Axis; it would also raid airfields at Depienne and Oudna in order to destroy any enemy aircraft stationed there. The battalion would then link up with ground forces from the British First Army, who would be advancing towards the battalion's position at the time of the parachute drop.Thompson, p.64 At 23:00 on 27 November the operation was delayed for 48 hours, and on the night of 28 November the brigade was informed that Pont du Fahs had been occupied by advance elements of 78th Infantry Division. Despite this, and difficulties in procuring aerial photographs of the proposed landing zones, the brigade was ordered to have 2nd Battalion drop at the airfield at Depienne; the battalion was to destroy all aircraft stationed there and at the Oudna airfield, spread 'fear and despondency' amongst nearby Axis troops, and then link up with ground forces from British First Army advancing towards Tunis.Otway, p.79Atkinson, p.216 John Dutton Frost, commanding officer of 2nd Parachute Battalion. On the morning of 29 November, the 530 strong battalion boarded 44 transport aircraft and took off, bound for Oudna. Because there had been insufficient time to conduct an aerial reconnaissance of the airfield, Lieutenant Colonel Frost was forced to choose a landing zone for the battalion from his position in the lead aircraft, fortunately locating a clear, open space near the airfield.Harclerode, p.236 The airfield had been abandoned by the Germans, and the landing for the battalion was scattered but unopposed, although it incurred seven casualties during the drop, one of which was fatal.Saunders, p.93 The airfield was secured after the battalion had rallied; a platoon from 'C' Company remained at the airfield to guard the wounded and the discarded parachutes, and at midnight the rest of the battalion moved out towards Oudna. As the battalion advanced the only transport available to it were a few hand drawn mule carts, which made the unit look, in the words of one paratrooper, \\"like a fucking travelling circus rather than a parachute battalion.\\" By 11:00 on 30 November the battalion had reached a position that allowed it to overlook the Oudna airfield, and at 14:30 it began to advance and reached the airfield, only to find that it, too, had been abandoned.Frost, p.82 The battalion was then counter attacked by a number of German tanks supported by fighters and Stuka divebombers. The Germans were repelled, but at dusk Frost pulled the battalion back westwards to a more defensible position, hoping to await the arrival of advance units from British First Army.Harclerode, p.237 These, however, were not to arrive; in a wireless message received at dawn on 1 December, Frost was informed that the Allied drive towards Tunis had been postponed.Saunders, p.95 A short while later a German armoured column was seen advancing from Oudna, and Frost decided to set an ambush to try to destroy it; the leading elements of the column, however, surprised a group of paratroopers filling water bottles at a nearby well, the ambush was sprung too early, inflicting only a single casualty. The battalion was understrength, having taken casualties at Oudna, and was running low on ammunition, but it managed to drive off the column with mortar fire; however, this was only a brief respite. Two armoured cars and a tank was seen to be moving towards the battalion from a different direction, reportedly sporting recognition signals of British First Army; Frost sent a party out to greet the vehicles, only for them to be taken prisoner and it to be revealed that the vehicles were German with captured equipment. The German commander sent one of the captured paratroopers with a message demanding Frost surrender, but he refused to comply; instead he ordered that the radios and mortars were to be destroyed and the battalion would evacuate westwards towards Allied lines, approximately fifty miles away. The battalion managed to withdraw to higher ground, but suffered a number of casualties from the German armour as it did so.Harclerode, pp.237‚Äì238 Now positioned on the high ground, which consisted of a ridge crowned by two small hills, the paratroopers were attacked by tanks and infantry supported by heavy mortar fire.Thompson, p.68 The battalion suffered a number of casualties but was saved by the unexpected intervention of German aircraft; mistaking their troops for the paratroopers, they knocked out several tanks and inflicted heavy casualties.Frost, p.91 The battalion had by now suffered approximately 150 casualties, and as such Frost took the decision for the battalion to retreat westwards again, with the wounded to be left behind and guarded by a small detachment; at nightfall each company would attempt to make its way to the village of Massicault.Harclerode, p.239 On the night of 31 November/1 December, the battalion began its retreat, moving as quickly as possible, but a number of paratroopers became disorientated and were captured by German forces pursuing the battalion. By 2 December Battalion Headquarters, the Support Company and attached sappers, commanded by Frost, had reached an Arab farm, where they linked up with 'A' Company and formed a group about 200 strong; however, a large number of paratroopers were still missing.Harclerode, pp.239‚Äì240 German forces soon located and surrounded Frost and his men and a fierce battle began; because the paratroopers were so low on ammunition Frost realised the farm could not be held, and during the night he led a charge through the weakest part of the German defences. Once they had broken through, Frost used his hunting horn to rally the remaining paratroopers, and they then marched for the Allied held town of Medjez el Bab; after stopping at one last farm for supplies, the group reached the town on 3 December and linked up with American patrols.Thompson, pp.70‚Äì71 Stragglers continued to reach Allied lines over the next few days, aided by units from the 56th Reconnaissance Regiment,Doherty, p.37 but the battalion ultimately suffered sixteen officers and 250 other ranks killed, captured or wounded during the mission.Thompson, p.71 Several historians have commented on the operation. Rick Atkinson has labelled the mission \\"a foolish, wanton mistake\\" let down by inadequate intelligence; and Peter Harclerode makes a similar argument, writing that the mission was \\"a disastrous episode, badly planned and based on faulty intelligence.\\"Harclerode, p.242 For Otway, the mission \\"suffered from a lack of information, and from a lack of adequate arrangements for a link up between the ground forces and too lightly armed and comparatively immobile airborne troops.\\"Otway, p.81 Ground role Reinforcements for 2nd Parachute Battalion arrived from Britain to make good the battalion's losses, and on 11 December it moved to Souk el Khemis, linking up with the rest of the Brigade. As Frost and his men retreated from Oudna, the Brigade had been informed it would be used in an infantry role, and on 11 December it came under the operational control of British V Corps and moved to positions near Beda; when it arrived No. 1 Commando and a French unit, 2e Bataillon 9e Regiment de Tirailleurs Algeriennes, were assigned to its command.Harclerode, pp.242‚Äì243 The brigade took up defensive positions around Beda and deployed patrols around the immediate vicinity, but remained in a static role; on 21 December it was placed under the command of 78th Infantry Division to participate in an attack towards Tunis, but heavy rain caused this operation to be cancelled.Otway, p.82 When it was decided that continuing poor weather made any further assault towards Tunis impractical, Brigadier Flavell asked that the brigade be transferred to the rear so that it could be used in an airborne role. His request was denied, however, as V Corps stated that there were insufficient troops to replace the brigade; as such it remained in its positions, defending the entire Beda area.Otway, p.83 The brigade subsequently became heavily involved in fighting throughout the front it occupied, especially 3rd Parachute Battalion, which launched several attacks on a geographical feature known as 'Green Hill'; during multiple attacks, several companies from the battalion were able to gain the crest of the hill, only to be driven back by enemy counter attacks.Thompson, p.76 On the night of 7 8 January the brigade was relieved from the frontline and transported to Algiers, with the exception of 2nd Parachute Battalion, which remained under the command of 78th Infantry Division because of a lack of troops to replace it. Plans were made to use the brigade in conjunction with US II Corps to cut Axis lines of communications around Sfax and Gabes, but these were never finalised. On 24 January it was transferred back to V Corps and came under the command of 6th Armoured Division, but did not remain there for long; two days later it came under the command of XIX French Corps, located in area around Bou Araba.Otway, pp.83‚Äì84 There it was given command of several French units and stationed between 36th Infantry Brigade and 1st Guards Brigade. On 2 February 1 Parachute Battalion was ordered to mount an attack on the massifs of Djebel Mansour and Djebel Alliliga, supported by a company belonging to the French Foreign Legion. The battalion launched its attack during the night and by the next morning had captured both features against fierce opposition; however, heavy casualties meant that the battalion was forced to retreat from Djebel Alligila and concentrate on Djebel Mansour. There they were cut off from supplies and almost all reinforcements, and counter attacks by 6th Armoured Division failed to reach the battalion. A battalion from the Grenadier Guards was able to capture most of Djebel Alliliga on 4 February, but both battalions came under increasingly heavy attack, and by 11:00 the next day it was decided to withdraw both battalions.Otway, p.84Thompson, p.78 Soldier of the 2nd Parachute Battalion examines a memorial to the 1st Parachute Brigade in the Tamara Valley, 14 October 1943. On 8 February 2 Parachute Battalion was transferred back to 1st Parachute Brigade, and the entire formation came under the command of 6th Armoured Division and then British Y Division, an ad hoc division which relieved 6th Armoured Division in the middle of February. The brigade remained in static positions for the rest of February, repelling several minor enemy attacks and then a major offensive which took place on 26 February, during which it inflicted some 400 casualties and took 200 prisoners at a cost of 18 killed and 54 wounded paratroopers.Otway, pp.84‚Äì85 On 3 March the brigade was relieved by 26 US Regimental Combat Team and marched to new positions located astride the road that ran between Tamara and Sedjenane. The brigade then held those positions against several attacks that took place between 8 9 March, taking almost 200 prisoners. On 10 March Brigadier Flavell was given command of all forces in the brigade's sector including 139th Brigade and No. 1 Commando and the entire force repelled several more attacks. On the night of 17 March, however, the entire force was compelled to retreat several miles to new positions after a particularly strong attack broke through the positions held by 139th Brigade and several French battalions. These new positions were held against several more enemy attacks, and secured by 19 March.Otway, pp.85‚Äì86 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions were placed in reserve on 20 March on the request of Brigadier Flavell, who argued that the brigade as a whole was exhausted and required rest. However, 3rd Parachute Battalion was ordered back to the front on 21 March and tasked with attacking a feature known as 'The Pimple' after a previous attack had failed with heavy casualties. It launched an attack on the feature that night, but was forced to withdraw by dawn the next day after exhausting its ammunition and taking numerous casualties. Because 'The Pimple' was regarded as a vital position from which a general Allied offensive could be launched, however, the brigade was ordered to attack it again. 1st Parachute Battalion did so on the night of 23 March and successfully seized it after several hours of fighting.Otway, pp.86‚Äì87 On 27 March, the entire brigade participated in a general Allied offensive aimed at taking control of the area around Tamera. 1st and 2nd Parachute Battalions launched an attack at 23:00 the same day, taking numerous prisoners and securing their objectives and then repulsed a German counterattack, albeit with heavy losses. Further heavy and often confusing fighting continued, with several companies of 3rd Parachute Battalion having to be attached to 2nd Parachute Battalion to reinforce it. 1st Parachute Battalion also seized its own objectives, and by the end of 29 March the brigade had secured all of its objectives and taken 770 German and Italian troops as prisoners.Otway, p.87 On 31 March the brigade then took up positions covering the left flank of 46th Division, and for the next two weeks it remained in the area, conducting numerous patrols but encountering little opposition. On 15 March the brigade was relieved by 39 US Regimental Combat Team and moved to the rear. It then travelled to Algiers on 18 April and remained there; Brigadier Flavell left for England to take up a new command, and was replaced by Brigadier Gerald Lathbury. Shortly afterwards the brigade rejoined 1st Airborne Division and began training for the airborne landings that would take place during Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily.Otway, pp.87‚Äì88 Aftermath During its time in North Africa, the 1st Parachute Brigade had captured more than 3,500 enemies as prisoners of war (POWs) and suffered well over 1,700 casualties. To take Lieutenant Colonel John Frost's 2nd Parachute Battalion as an example, it had entered North Africa with a strength of 24 officers and 588 other ranks, absorbed some 230 replacements in January 1943, and left in April with 14 officers and 346 other ranks, an overall casualty percentage of eighty percent. In the 1st Parachute Battalion, only four officers had remained with the battalion throughout the entire Tunisian Campaign without being killed or sufficiently wounded to be sent to the rear.Thompson, p.91 The brigade had also been given the title of 'Rote Teufel' or 'Red Devils' by the German troops they had fought; this was a distinct honour as the 1st Airborne Division commander, Major-General Frederick Browning, pointed out in a signal to the brigade, as \\"Such distinctions given by the enemy are seldom won in battle except by the finest fighting troops.\\" This title was later officially confirmed by General Sir Harold Alexander, commanding the 18th Army Group, and applied henceforth to all British airborne troops.Otway, p.88 Lieutenant Colonel Terence Otway, who compiled the official history of the British Army's airborne forces during the Second World War, analysed the brigades' actions throughout the campaign. In terms of the brigades' airborne operations, he stated that the missions conducted by 1st and 2nd Parachute Battalions were \\"severely handicapped\\" by a lack of aerial photography and a shortage of maps, as well as the lack of experience on the part of the American air crews who dropped both battalions at the beginning of their missions, causing highly inaccurate and dispersed drops. He also believed that a \\"lack of an expert in airborne matters at either Allied Forces Headquarters or First Army\\" ensured that the 1st Parachute Brigade was not used as efficiently as they might have been, and that this lack of expertise meant that logistical and planning arrangements before each mission could have been better. He also argued that the brigade suffered from a lack of light anti tank weapons, as well as there being no fourth company in a battalion; the absence of the latter was a \\"serious handicap\\" to each battalion, especially when surrounded by enemy forces. In terms of the brigade's ground role, Otway considered it to have done well in terms of patrolling and night patrols, but was unaccustomed to cooperating with other arms, particularly artillery and armour, because of a lack of training and was forced to learn these skills during combat. It also suffered from a lack of reinforcements, as high physical and mental standards during airborne training led to a small pool of reinforcements that was easily depleted, as well as the absence of its own transport, forcing the brigade to rely on captured enemy vehicles and pack animals. Finally, Otway argued that \\"it was most uneconomical and inefficient to employ a parachute brigade in ground operations\\" unless it was expanded with sufficient transport and extra personnel, as well as possessing a superior officer who understood the specialised role the brigade played and could advise on how to effectively use it.Otway, pp.88‚Äì89 Notes References Bibliography      * Category:Aerial operations and battles of World War II involving the United Kingdom Category:Airborne operations of World War II North Africa Category:Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom) ","title":"British airborne operations in North Africa"},{"id":"24457326","text":"Dmitri Vladimirovich Bayda (; born 5 November 1975) is a former Russian professional football player.

It is home to the Staffordshire Regiment Museum. Now known as Defence Medical Services (Whittington), it is a Tri-Service military unit, home to the Headquarters of the Surgeon General and subordinate medical headquarters in addition to being the location of the Defence College of Health Education and Training. Early history Whittington Heath Golf Club (formerly a grandstand for the racecourse) The barracks were constructed on Whittington Heath. The heath had been the site of the Lichfield races which had moved from Fradley in 1702. During the 18th century they were one of the largest and well attended race meetings in the Midlands and in 1773 a grandstand was erected near the Lichfield-Tamworth Road. However, during the 19th century the popularity of the races dwindled, and military use of the heath grew. The War Office approached the Marquess of Anglesey in 1875 to buy the heath for the building of a barracks. Construction started in 1877 and the formal handing over of the newly built barracks to the military was recorded in 1881. Their creation took place as part of the Cardwell Reforms which encouraged the localisation of British military forces. The barracks were intended to be the depot of the 38th (1st Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot and 80th Regiment of Foot (Staffordshire Volunteers). Under the Childers Reforms these regiments amalgamated to form the South Staffordshire Regiment with its depot at the barracks in 1881. They were also intended to be the depot of the 64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot and the 98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot which under the same reforms amalgamated to form the North Staffordshire Regiment also in 1881. In 1895 the last race meeting was held after the War Office declared it was \\"undesirable to hold a race meeting at the gate of the barracks.\\" The Lichfield races are remembered in the names of pubs in Freeford called the Horse & Jockey and in Lichfield, The Scales which was where jockeys were \\"weighed in\\". The old grandstand became a soldiers home before it was purchased in 1957 by Whittington Heath Golf Course as its clubhouse. Second World War: 10th Replacement Depot During the Second World War the barracks was occupied by the United States Army and in August 1942 was designated as the 10th US Army Replacement Depot. Replacement depots, known by troops as \\"repple depples\\", temporarily housed reserves or replacements for front-line formations, including soldiers who had been discharged from medical care for return to active service. The depot was also used as a military prison. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel James A. Kilian, a native of Highland Park, Illinois, and Major Richard E. Lobuono, the Provost Marshal, the depot became \\"infamous\\" for its regime of brutality and the \\"cruel and unusual punishments of American soldiers imprisoned there.\\" Prisoners were beaten with clubs, forced to carry out vigorous physical exercise for seven hours daily, and given only five minutes to eat meals. When notice was received of official inspections by visiting officers, prisoners thought likely to make complaints or with visible injuries were temporarily removed from the camp. In 1946 a court martial was convened at Grosvenor Square, London, to inquire into allegations that nine guards and two officers had ill-treated prisoners at Whittington. The court martial took ten months to reach its conclusion and grew to include Kilian and Lobuono. Sergeant Judson Smith was sentenced to three years hard labour and a dishonorable discharge and other enlisted men received prison sentences of lesser length. Lieutenant Granville Cubage, accused of ordering the punishments, pleaded that he was following orders from superior officers; he was fined $250 and reprimanded. In September 1946, at a court martial convened at Bad Nauheim, Germany, Lobuono was officially reprimanded and fined $250 (approximately one month's pay), and Kilian was reprimanded and fined $500. Post war The Staffordshire Regiment Museum The barracks, which went on to become the regional centre for infantry training as the Mercian Brigade Depot in 1960, also became home to the Staffordshire Regiment Museum in 1963 and the depot of the Prince of Wales' Division in 1968. The barracks remained the home of the Army Training Regiment, Lichfield, which trained new recruits on their Phase 1 Common Military Training (i.e. becoming soldiers) from the Royal Signals and Royal Engineers, from 2002 until 2008 when Major General Andrew Farquhar CBE, General Officer Commanding the Army's 5th Infantry Division, inspected the recruits and took the salute before the Army Training Regiment's flag was lowered for the last time. In 2007 Whittington Barracks became the Regimental Headquarters of the newly formed Mercian Regiment. In July 2008 the Labour Government set in motion the centralisation of all planning and training of the Defence Medical Services at Whittington Barracks. The relocation of the Headquarters of the Surgeon-General and major components of the Joint Medical Command (JMC) was completed. A new HQ, named Coltman House, has been built and is fully occupied. Alongside the Headquarters of the Surgeon-General, the elements of the JMC now at Whittington comprise the defence medical group and the JMC HQ previously at Fort Blockhouse, Gosport, Hampshire, the Director of Healthcare previously based in Whitehall, the Defence Dental Service previously located at RAF Halton, Buckinghamshire, and the Defence Postgraduate Medical Dean, previously located in Birmingham at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine at Selly Oak Hospital. The single service medical heads, the Army Medical Services, Royal Navy Medical Branch and Royal Air Force Medical Branch. A second phase at the barracks ‚Äì now renamed Defence Medical Services Whittington ‚Äì include new training facilities, a new learning centre, a new lecture theatre, new messes for officers, warrant officers and NCOs ‚Äì and a new junior ranks dining and leisure facility. In 2014 the Duchess of Cornwall visited the site to commemorate the relocation of the Defence Medical Services Training Group from Keogh Barracks to Whittington Barracks. Grade II listed buildings at the barracks are: the keep, the garrison church and the separate World War I war memorials to the North and South Staffordshire Regiments.

It is located between the municipalities of Concordia in Sinaloa and Pueblo Nuevo in Durango, along the Durango‚ÄìMazatl√°n highway, Mexico 40D. The bridge has a total length of , with a central cable- stayed span of . With the road deck at above the valley below, the Baluarte Bridge is the third-highest cable-stayed bridge in the world, the seventh- highest bridge overall and the highest bridge in the Americas. Construction of the bridge began in 2008, it was inaugurated in January 2012 and opened to traffic in late 2013. The bridge forms part of a new highway linking the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of northern Mexico and has reduced the travelling time between Durango and Mazatl√°n from approximately 6 to 2.5 hours. Structure and construction The bridge's four-lane roadway, wide by long, is supported at a height of above the Baluarte riverbed by 12 piers, two of which are also pylons (towers). Each of the two pylons measures at its base, widens in the centre to carry the roadway before tapering upwards to wide at its top; the taller, P5, is high. 76 steel cables pass over saddles in the pylons to form 152 suspenders in a two plane semi-fan layout. The tallest intermediate pier, P9, is high.El Puente Baluarte (includes technical diagrams) It crosses a gorge in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains with a clearance of below the deck, substantially taller than the Eiffel Tower. Its clearance is higher than that of the previous record-holder, France's Millau Viaduct, which has a clearance of . The bridge's central span, long, is also the longest cable-stayed span in North America, longer than that of the John James Audubon Bridge in St. Francisville, Louisiana. Construction on the bridge began on 21 February 2008. The work was carried out by a consortium that included Tradeco Infraestructura, IDINSA, Aceros Corey and VSL M√©xico, which was awarded the contract in May 2007 by the Mexican transport and communications ministry, the SCT, beating two other higher-priced bidders. The cost has risen significantly from the original bid of 1.28 billion pesos (US$118 million); according to an SCT official, this is due, among other things, to the number of structures involved in such a project. The work is being funded by Mexico's National Infrastructure Fund (Fonadin) and the Durango-Mazatl√°n Trust (Fiduma). It is planned that the cost of the bridge will be recovered by concessionary fees from the highway's operator. The choice of a cable-stayed design was made to enable the construction to proceed outward from each of the two main pylons, thus making it unnecessary to build an expensive and time-consuming falsework. By January 2012, the bridge's construction had required the use of 1,500 workers and engineers, of steel and of concrete. of rock were excavated to lay the bridge's foundations. The Baluarte Bridge construction is part of an 18 billion peso (US$1.44 billion) project to build a new highway connecting Durango with Mazatl√°n across some of Mexico's most rugged mountains. The cost of the bridge itself has been put at 2.18 billion pesos (US$158.7 million). It will replace a notoriously dangerous road over the mountains, which are known locally as \\"the Devil's Backbone\\". The old road was built in the 1940s in terrain so difficult that mules had to be used to bring in supplies for the construction workers. It is the only crossing through the mountains for . The new Mazatl√°n‚ÄìDurango highway will include 63 tunnels and 32 bridges, eight of which will be over high. When completed, the new highway is expected to slash the travelling time between Durango and Mazatl√°n from eight hours to two and a half. It is intended to form part of an eventual road link between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Mexico. Around 2,000 vehicles are expected to use the bridge daily. Inauguration and economic and social impact The Baluarte Bridge was inaugurated by President Calder√≥n on 5 January 2012. Officials from Guinness World Records were on hand at the inauguration ceremony to certify the bridge as the world's highest cable-stayed bridge. At the time it was about 86 per cent complete. It was finished in late January 2012, and went operational by 2013. Its official name as the \\"Bicentennial\\" bridge refers to the 2010 bicentenary of the Mexican declaration of independence from Spain at the start of the Mexican War of Independence in 1810. It had been hoped that the bridge would be inaugurated in the second half of 2010 as part of the bicentennial celebrations, but delays pushed the date back. During the ceremony, Calder√≥n hailed the bridge as a way to \\"unite the people of northern Mexico as never before.\\" Officials expressed the hope that it would boost trade and tourism in the area, which is one of the most remote parts of Mexico. The region is seriously affected by poverty and lawlessness which has prompted many locals to take up illegal drug farming, smuggling and even highway robbery on the old Durango‚ÄìMazatl√°n road. Poor communications in the region have made it difficult to police. According to a town administrator in Pueblo Nuevo municipality, the new bridge and road will help to improve security by reducing the region's isolation. Officials have also expressed hopes that it will help to promote economic development. Durango's state government plans to build a new industrial park on a site adjoining the highway, while Sinaloa's governor anticipates a boost in the usage of Mazatl√°n's port from the increase in cross-country traffic. The project is reported to have created 3,500 jobs directly and a further 12,000 indirectly.

The species is endemic to south-eastern Queensland, Australia, in the Burnett, Mary, and Fitzroy River drainages. This species is entirely aquatic, rarely coming ashore and is chiefly herbivorous, feeding on the fruits and buds of riparian vegetation, algae, and large aquatic plants. First proposed as a species by John Goode in the 1960s,Goode J. 1967. Freshwater tortoises of Australia and New Guinea (in the family Chelidae). Melbourne: Landsdowne. 155 pp. it was finally described in 2006. The species is named from the Latin alba = white and gula = throat, which is a reference to the white blotching present on the throats of adult females in the species. The type locality for the species is the Burnett River in south-eastern Queensland, but it is also found in the Mary and Fitzroy River drainages to the north of the Burnett. Some have argued for each of these rivers to represent different species, but DNA, morphological, and morphometric analyses does not support this conclusion.Georges A, Adams M. 1996. Electrophoretic delineation of species boundaries within the short-necked chelid turtles of Australia. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, London 118 :241‚Äì260. Etymology The specific name, albagula, is derived from the Latin adjective alba meaning white and the noun gula for throat, both of which are feminine. Hence, the name means \\"white-throated\\" and refers to the white or cream throat commonly seen in adult females of this species. Description The carapace of this species is broadly oval, but is blunt at the front. In younger animals, it has keeled scutes along the back. The carapace is dark brown to black in color, smooth with no growth annuli and generally lackluster. The plastron is heavily stained in adults, appearing black over the true base color of yellow to cream. The plastron is narrow compared to the carapace. The head is large and robust with a complete head shield that does not approach the ears. The tomial sheath is large, and inside an alveolar ridge is distinct and well formed. The head is typically dark brown to grey above and, in females, is usually blotched with cream to white in the throat region. Biology White-throated snapping turtles are amongst a handful of other turtle and fish species in that they can undertake cloacal respiration, absorbing oxygen from the surrounding environment through their cloaca whilst submerged. Conservation Three major factors affect the survival of this species. The first is nest predation and nest destruction, particularly by introduced species such as foxes that dig up the nests and cattle which trample them.Hamman, M., Schauble, C.S., Limpus, D., Emerick, S.P., and Limpus, C.J. (2007). Management plan for the conservation of Elseya sp. (Burnett River) in the Burnett River Catchment. Environmental Protection Agency. The second is the damming of the rivers in which they occur, with all but one of the rivers in which the species is found now dammed to some degree. This changes the temperatures within the river, affecting reproduction. It also affects the remodeling of sand banks during flood events, eventually leading to unusable nesting sites. The populations are aging, meaning that larger numbers of adults have little recruitment. The last factor is the damage to individuals as they get washed over dam walls to their deaths. A number of actions have been proposed. A head start program is being supported by the Queensland government where eggs are incubated at a hatchery with the young then released and monitored. Also active nest site protection prevents predation and trampling of existing nests. \\"Turtleways\\" have been proposed in the dams to allow turtles to get by these structures without being killed by the fall over the dam wall.

History The town's name derives from its two original settlers, William and John Hammond, a civil engineer and a farmer respectively, who with a Mrs. E.H. Mohun owned the property that became the community, which they received as a Crown Grant in 1862. The term \\"Port\\" was appended to the name in the course of the town becoming the westward terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway during its construction, prior to its extension westward to Burrard Inlet. The brothers Hammond had struck a deal with the CPR, trading land for track right-of-way, station and yards on the condition that their townsite be the location of the first station in Maple Ridge.The Heritage Resources of Maple Ridge (PDF) It was also known as Hammond's Landing', as it served as the steamship and mail port for all CPR shipping from New Westminster and Victoria and the brothers had ambitions of it becoming a major deep-water port. With the railway came Chinese labourers and merchants, some of whom stayed on after railway construction to work on farms or as servants, with their residential area being in the vicinity of 207th St and Maple Crescent, which is also the area of the grove of maple trees from which Maple Ridge's named was derived. Following World War I, part of Hammond became known as \\"Swede Row\\" due to the presence of a community of Swedish millworkers and loggers.The Heritage Resources of Maple Ridge (PDF) From 1910 onwards, Port Hammond was the site of a major sawmill and served as a company town for its employees; this mill in 1946 became controlled by British Columbia Forest Products, then one of the province's largest milling concerns. The CPR Mainline runs through the community, with most of the townsite grid between it and the Fraser River, and therefore outside the main dyke protecting settlement from the Fraser freshet. Graveyard Indian Reserve No. 5, 0.40 ha., on the north side of Hammond and under the aegis of the Katzie First Nation, was bought from the Hammond brothers in order to provide a cemetery for Indians and Chinese, who were excluded from the other graveyard in the area, which was for whites although some Kanakas had been buried there.The Heritage Resources of Maple Ridge (PDF) References Category:Maple Ridge, British Columbia Category:Company towns in Canada Category:Populated places on the Fraser River ","title":"Port Hammond"},{"id":"24457446","text":"Sergei Vladimirovich Kopnin (; born 1 September 1976) is a former Russian professional football player.

In John Florio's 1611 dictionary it is explained that the game of Gilet was \\"like our poste and paire\\", being \\"G√©\\" (spelled J'ai), the word for \\"Pair\\", which is one of the announcements in the French version. French version The name Gilet changed to Brelan in the time of Charles IX (1550‚Äì74), The Gilet of 18th century France was a three-card game of two deals, the first for a fixed stake won by the best pair or triplet, the second vied for in respect of the best-held flush-point. It first appeared in the Acad√©mie Universelle des Jeux in 1718, although its earlier references date of 1610 and 1640. Spanish version The Spanish variant is described by Barnes as \\"Giley\\", who says it was much played at horse fairs, and hence, by association, a gypsy game. It was played by four or more players who were dealt four cards each from a 28-card pack and a showdown was won by the best flush-point. With Ace worth 11, courts, treys, and deuces 10 each, and Seven worth 7, so a four-flush would be worth 37-41 points, a three-flush 27-30, and so on. Not dissimilar is Golfo, a game of Basque origin, declared by Barnes to be the king of gambling games and played also as Goffo in Italy and Gofo in Uruguay. Game The game of Gilet is played by four players, all of whom play for themselves in the long run. A Piquet deck of 32 cards is used, 7 to A. The aces are higher than the king, which is higher than the queen, which is higher than the jack and so on. After examining their cards, each contributes with two counters, worth as much as it is agreed by the players, to a common pot in the middle of the table. The dealer then gives three cards to each of the players, one after the other. Any of the two pots in the middle of the table is entitled for the G√©, or Pair. It is possible for the players to bet on pairs, and that player who has the highest pair draws the money previously deposited in the pot and also the betting from the other players, unless one or more have a tricon, the highest combination of cards, that is, three aces, three kings, three queens and so on. When one of the players win with a pair, the game then conveys to the second pot entitled for the Point or Flow. To have flow is to have three cards of the same suit, etc. It depends not only on the first player to stay on a simple game or bet whatever he wants for the second pot, but also on the second player to raise the bet staked by the first player or to concede the amount bet passing, in case he does not have a good hand. Two aces are worth twenty and a half, one ace and a king, or another card of the same suit which is worth ten, are then worth twenty one and a half. Also two aces and a king, or another card of the same suit which is worth ten, are worth twenty one and half, also the other cards which are worth their value, and which must be of the same suit to add the number of the several cards together. After that, the player bets as much as he wants and those players who hold higher combinations continue the game, that is to say, if they have Flow or not. We say that whoever has more points always wins, because the player with the highest Flow always has more points.

He was a member of the Primera Junta, the first national government of modern Argentina, and the second president in the end of the Junta Grande from August to September 1811.  Biography  Domingo Bartolom√© Francisco Matheu was born on August 4, 1765, in Matar√≥. His parents were Juan Pablo Jos√© Benito Matheu Ros and Antonia Chicola. He studied in the school \\"P√≠as\\" of Matar√≥, and then focused in math and naval studies. He became a pilot, and visited other Spanish territories as La Habana, Philippines and the Canary Islands. He moved to Buenos Aires in 1791 and opposed the trade regulations of the time. He sought both economic and political support among the local society.National..., pp. 303-304 Matheu joined the Regiment of Mi√±ones during the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata. He was appointed lieutenant of the second company, under the command of Juan Larrea. On August 19, 1806, a few days after the liberation of Buenos Aires from British rule, Matheu, Larrea and other neighbours requested authorization to create a new military unit, \\"Urbanos Voluntarios de Catalu√±a\\". Viceroy Santiago de Liniers approved it on September 26. As Larrea got ill, Matheu led this unit during the second British attack in 1807. He retired from the combats in Miserere and waged urban warfare from the buildings of the city. He was awarded by a Real Order in January 1809 for his role in the defense of Buenos Aires.National..., p. 304 The Peninsular War in Spain, along with the capture of the king Ferdinand VII and the fall of the Junta of Seville, escalated political disputes in Buenos Aires that led to the May Revolution. Several criollos thought that the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, appointed by the fallen Junta, did not have legitimacy, and requested an open cabildo to discuss it. Azcu√©naga attended it, and voted for the creation of a Junta with deputies from all the provinces, with the Cabildo ruling in the interregnum. However, the majority agreed with the creation of a junta, but with another junta of people from Buenos ruling in the meantime. The viceroy tried to stay in government as president of the Junta, which was resisted by the criollos. The reasons of Matheu's inclusion in the Junta are unclear, as with all its members. A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists, Alzaguists, the military and the clergy.Luna, p. 39Scenna, pp. 43-47 The May Revolution began the Argentine War of Independence, which was complicated by the lack of weapons in the country. Without enough resources to buy them, the Primera Junta established armories. The first director, Juan Taragona, was soon replaced by Matheu. Working alongside German gunsmiths as Juan Frye and Fernando Lamping, he directed the creation of several muskets and some pieces of artillery. The armory of Buenos Aires, located at the site of the modern Palace of Justice, had only 90 employees, including seven slaves and seven natives. They had limited technical knowledge but managed to build and repair nearly three hundred muskets and a hundred of carbines. Matheu gave financial support to the armory with his own wealth. Eduard Holmberg was appointed director in 1813, replacing Matheu, but Matheu kept working for the armory anyway. He supervised as well the armory of the Tucum√°n Province. He directed later the manufacture of military uniforms.National..., pp. 305-307 After the departure of Cisneros following the May Revolution he was designated vocal of the Primera Junta. The Primera Junta became the Junta Grande afterwards, and Matheu was designated its president when Cornelio Saavedra left it to join the battles in the north. Matheu and Larrea supported the national government with the money they obtained from commerce. He retired from political life in 1817, staying just in commercial activities until his death in 1831.  Legacy  Domingo Matheu led the first armory of Argentina. General Manuel Nicol√°s Savio organized the construction of an arsenal in Rosario, Santa Fe, named after Matheu. The cornerstone was placed on October 3, 1942, and worked for many decades. The place was used as a detention center during the Dirty War in the 1970s.

The variety played is the 15-a-side version, rather than rugby sevens. The national sides which compete are organised by the national branches of the Maccabi World Union, rather than by the national rugby unions of each country, with the exception of Israel. Israel is also exceptional in being the only Maccabiah team for which one does not need to be Jewish to qualify.

In addition, it was felt that not enough of the nations competing at the Maccabiah could field good rugby teams. For example, New Zealand and Ireland are both major rugby playing nations, but do not have a big enough Jewish community to produce a particularly strong Maccabiah XV. In addition, some major rugby playing nations such as the Pacific Islands of Tonga, Samoa, Fiji and Japan, have an even more negligible Jewish population. However, despite this there have often been six or seven sides competing at the Maccabiah Games. Teams tend to be from the major English speaking nations (with the exception of NZ and Ireland), but teams from France, Chile and Uruguay have also competed. The Israel team is unique in being the only full national side at the Maccabiah, and which can contain non-Jewish Israeli players.

This seeming contradiction is overcome when one understands that only around 10% of all people with blindness can see absolutely nothing at all. As such most blind people can in fact perceive some level of light and form, and it is by applying this limited vision that many blind artists create intelligible art. Also, a blind person may once have been fully sighted and yet simply lost part of their vision through injury or illness. Blind artists are able to offer insight into the study of blindness and the ways in which art can be perceived by the blind, in order to better improve art education for the visually impaired. Education Art education was an integral part of many of the earliest institutions for the blind, with the motivation for their curriculum being largely religious.Hayhoe S (2016). Philosophy as Disability & Exclusion: The Development of Theories on Blindness, Touch and the Arts in England, 1688-2010. Charlotte, North Carolina: IAP For instance, industrial art education was introduced into the earliest English and Scottish asylums by their Protestant Christian founders from 1791. This curriculum was believed to provide religious enlightenment, and allow asylum residents to work their way to heaven. What can be referred to as fine art education for students who were blind or visually impaired was first recorded in Vienna by the educationalist Johann Wilhelm Klein. Klein trained people who were blind to carve crucifixes which, he believed, would prevent his students falling prey to what he felt was sexual deviance. However, despite these early forms of art education, there was no widespread fine art education in schools for the blind until the latter years of the twentieth century, and even when it was introduced many felt people who were blind could not draw or paint only sculpt or mold. Subsequently, there were many instances of the exclusion of students who were blind or visually impaired in the early years of the twenty first century,.Hayhoe, S. (2008). Arts, Culture and Blindness. Youngstown, New York: Teneo PressHayhoe, S. (2017). Initial analysis from a grounded methodology study of risk taking and avoidance by students with visual impairments during visual art projects. MuseumEdu, 5, 135-154. (http://museumedulab.ece.uth.gr/main/sites/default/files/%207..pdf) Despite little inclusion of formal art education in schools for the blind, there were courses, tours and exhibitions on the fine arts for people who were blind or visually impaired from the early years of the twentieth century.Hayhoe, S. (2013). The philosophical, political and religious roots of touch exhibitions in 20th century British museums. Disability Studies Quarterly, 33(3). Although, like art education in schools for the blind, these courses were not widespread until the latter years of the twentieth century. However, through the work of individuals such as the Austrian teacher Viktor Lowenfeld, Professor John Kennedy from University of Toronto, Rebecca Maginnis from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Barry Ginley from the Victoria & Albert Museum and organisations such as Art Beyond Sight, BlindArt and Blind with Camera since the latter years of the twentieth century, there has been a significant uptake of fine art education by museums. This education has included well established courses and tours, verbal imaging, audio tours and audio description.https://vocaleyes.co.uk/flipping-descriptions-a-new-phase-of- democratising-audio-description/ Notable examples of museum inclusion can be found at the Metropolitan Museum of Art,https://www.metmuseum.org/events/programs/access/visitors-who-are-blind- or-partially-sighted the Victoria & Albert Museum,https://www.vam.ac.uk/whatson/programmes/event-for-blind-visually- impaired the Wallace Collection,https://www.wallacecollection.org/whats- on/life-drawing-for-blind-and-partially-sighted-visitor s/ and the Museum of Modern Art.https://www.moma.org/visit/accessibility/sight More recently there have been regional and national initiatives to create a Community of Practice for museum professionals, designed to help these professionals share their expertise and experience in the field. An example of such an initiative is the Sensing Culture Community of Practice, founded in 2018,https://www.sensingculture.org.uk/https://blogs.bath.ac.uk/senseculture/,.https://www.museums.cam.ac.uk/blog/2018/07/30/sensing- culture-insights-into-how-to-improve-the-visitor-experience-for-blind- partially-sighted-people/ There are a number of publications that promote or discuss blind education programs, seek to show how art can be constructive for the blind and those with visual impairments, and show the ways in which people who are blind or visually impaired can be taught to create art. Elisabeth Salzhauer Axel‚Äôs book Art beyond sight: a resource guide to art, creativity, and visual impairment covers a variety of different subjects like the meanings of making art, art theory and verbal description. The book gives different suggestions about how the blind can actually go about making art; there is an example of one woman who is not completely blind but severely impaired who, when sculpting something, finds it easier to close her eyes and feel the material and the shape rather than trying to see it with her imperfect vision, much like a completely blind person would. The book emphasizes the importance of touch and feeling when creating art without sight.Elisabeth Salzhauer Axel, Art beyond sight: a resource guide to art, creativity, and visual impairment (American Foundation for the Blind, 2003). The book, Drawing and the Blind: Perceptions to Touch, by John Kennedy, focuses on the ways in which the blind, both young and old, can perceive pictures and 3D objects. According to Kennedy, visually impaired people are able to feel a 3D object and then create a drawing of the object that can be easily recognized by a sighted individual. Kennedy likens the drawings of the average blind-since-birth person to those of a sighted child. He notices that blind children are much more willing to attempt to draw than blind adults who have no prior experience. Kennedy discusses the fact that the blind can perceive a drawing made of raised lines, as well as 3D objects that have shape and form.John M. Kennedy, Drawing & the blind: pictures to touch (Yale University Press, 1993). The book, Arts Culture and Blindness,Hayhoe, S. (2008). Arts, Culture, and Blindness: A Study of Blind Students in the Visual Arts. Amherst, New York: Cambria Press. by Simon Hayhoe, presents a social study of arts students who are visually impaired and blind in situ, their understanding and practice of the visual arts and their reaction to the attitudes of their teachers, past and present. It analyses the topic of the culture of education, the effects of this culture on blindness and the visual arts and introduces an inclusive model of studying blindness and visual arts. In researching the material for Arts, Culture, and Blindness, Simon Hayhoe collaborated with internationally renown charities in the area of blindness, galleries, exhibitions and art, such as Art Education for the Blind, New York and BlindArt, London. The book, Blind Visitor Experiences at Art Museums,Hayhoe, S. (2017). Blind Visitor Experiences at Art Museums. New York: Rowman & Littlefield. by Simon Hayhoe, examines the question, Why would a person who is blind want to visit an art museum, even when he or she cannot touch the exhibits? The book features a study at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and presents case studies of visitors who are blind and visually impaired, teachers at the museum and blind artists, such as Esref Armagan. Through this study, the book examines philosophies of exclusion and access, and argues there is an extra dimension to understanding the visual arts by people who are blind or visually impaired. This dimension can, \\"act as a bridge between the awareness of art works through perception, and an understanding of their contents beyond perceptual knowledge. This bridge between awareness and non-verbal knowledge is described as an ambience that is provided by the environment and context of knowing art works. This ambience is felt in museums, galleries and monuments, and is made possible by the visitor‚Äôs proximity to art works.\\"Hayhoe, S. (2017). Blind Visitor Experiences at Art Museums. New York: Rowman & Littlefield. Blind or visually impaired artists work in a variety of different media, and are by no means limited to only one type of art. The website for the Blind Artist‚Äôs Society contains a page where blind artists can display their work, and some types of work include nature/ landscape painting, physical models, wood carvings, portraits, abstract paintings, watercolor paintings, and drawings. Many are able to create realistic artwork through the use of light/shadows and perspective in their work. Textile Needle Arts such as machine sewing, hand sewing, braided rugs, needle felting, knitting and crochet are other mediums a visually impaired artist may use. Experienced Needle Artists who have recently lost vision can continue to pursue their textile art/craft using a few adaptive blind techniques. Contributions to the study of visual impairments The ways in which the visually impaired are able to create art are giving new insights into the study of sight loss. For example, Ann Roughton is a landscape artist suffering from Macular Degeneration. Her paintings not only include what she can see with her partial vision, but her work also includes the grey haze that she sees in the center in her vision as a result of her Macular Degeneration. In doing so, she is literally painting sight, giving a new perspective on sight loss.Hannah Mcpherson, ‚ÄúCultural geographies in practice: Between landscape and blindness: some paintings of an artist with macular degeneration,‚Äù Cultural Geographies 15, no. 2 (April 2008): 261-269. Organizations There are many organizations around the world that offer assistance to the blind. There are also some that offer assistance and support specifically for blind artists. One example of these organizations in the United States is the Blind Artists Society,Blind Artists Society a support group for visually impaired amateur artists. Founded in 2007, the organization is funded by the Retina Research Foundation Retina Research Foundation INC. and seeks to provide an environment where artists can gather to display and sell their art, communicate with other artists and receive support. The organization also organizes periodic exhibitions of the work of blind artists.

It is also called a regular map. A morphism from an algebraic variety to the affine line is also called a regular function. A regular map whose inverse is also regular is called biregular, and they are isomorphisms in the category of algebraic varieties. Because regular and biregular are very restrictive conditions ‚Äì there are no non-constant regular functions on projective varieties ‚Äì the weaker condition of a rational map and birational maps are frequently used as well.  Definition  If X and Y are closed subvarieties of An and Am (so they are affine varieties), then a regular map ∆í: X‚ÜíY is the restriction of a polynomial map An‚ÜíAm. Explicitly, it has the form :f = (f_1, \\\\dots, f_m) where the f_is are in the coordinate ring of X: :k[X] = k[x_1, \\\\dots, x_n]/I, where I is the ideal defining X (note: two polynomials f and g define the same function on X if and only if f ‚àí g is in I). The image f(X) lies in Y, and hence satisfies the defining equations of Y. That is, a regular map f: X \\\\to Y is the same as the restriction of a polynomial map whose components satisfy the defining equations of Y. More generally, a map ∆í:X‚ÜíY between two varieties is regular at a point x if there is a neighbourhood U of x and a neighbourhood V of ∆í(x) such that ∆í(U) ‚äÇ V and the restricted function ∆í:U‚ÜíV is regular as a function on some affine charts of U and V. Then ∆í is called regular, if it is regular at all points of X. *Note: It is not immediately obvious that the two definitions coincide: if X and Y are affine varieties, then a map ∆í:X‚ÜíY is regular in the first sense if and only if it is so in the second sense.Here is the argument showing the definitions coincide. Clearly, we can assume Y = A1. Then the issue here is whether the \\"regular-ness\\" can be patched together; this answer is yes and that can be seen from the construction of the structure sheaf of an affine variety as described at affine variety#Structure sheaf. Also, it is not immediately clear whether regularity depends on a choice of affine charts (it does not.It is not clear how to prove this, though. If X, Y are quasi-projective, then the proof can be given. The non-quasi-projective case strongly depends on one's definition of an abstract variety) This kind of a consistency issue, however, disappears if one adopts the formal definition. Formally, an (abstract) algebraic variety is defined to be a particular kind of a locally ringed space. When this definition is used, a morphism of varieties is just a morphism of locally ringed spaces. The composition of regular maps is again regular; thus, algebraic varieties form the category of algebraic varieties where the morphisms are the regular maps. Regular maps between affine varieties correspond contravariantly in one-to-one to algebra homomorphisms between the coordinate rings: if ∆í:X‚ÜíY is a morphism of affine varieties, then it defines the algebra homomorphism :f^{\\\\\\\\#}: k[Y] \\\\to k[X], \\\\, g \\\\mapsto g \\\\circ f where k[X], k[Y] are the coordinate rings of X and Y; it is well-defined since g \\\\circ f = g(f_1, \\\\dots, f_m) is a polynomial in elements of k[X]. Conversely, if \\\\phi: k[Y] \\\\to k[X] is an algebra homomorphism, then it induces the morphism :\\\\phi^a: X \\\\to Y given by: writing k[Y] = k[y_1, \\\\dots, y_m]/J, :\\\\phi^a = (\\\\phi(\\\\overline{y_1}), \\\\dots, \\\\phi(\\\\overline{y_m})) where \\\\overline{y}_i are the images of y_i's.The image of \\\\phi^a lies in Y since if g is a polynomial in J, then, a priori thinking \\\\phi^a is a map to the affine space, g \\\\circ \\\\phi^a = g(\\\\phi(\\\\overline{y_1}), \\\\dots, \\\\phi(\\\\overline{y_m})) = \\\\phi(\\\\overline{g}) = 0 since g is in J. Note {\\\\phi^a}^{\\\\\\\\#} = \\\\phi as well as {f^{\\\\\\\\#}}^a = f.Proof: {\\\\phi^a}^{\\\\\\\\#}(g) = g(\\\\phi(\\\\overline{y_1}), \\\\dots, \\\\phi(\\\\overline{y_m})) = \\\\phi(g) since œÜ is an algebra homomorphism. Also, f^{\\\\\\\\#a} = (\\\\overline{y_1} \\\\circ f, \\\\dots, \\\\overline{y_m} \\\\circ f) = f. In particular, f is an isomorphism of affine varieties if and only if f# is an isomorphism of the coordinate rings. For example, if X is a closed subvariety of an affine variety Y and ∆í is the inclusion, then ∆í# is the restriction of regular functions on Y to X. See #Examples below for more examples.  Regular functions  In the particular case that Y equals A1 the regular map ∆í:X‚ÜíA1 is called a regular function, and are algebraic analogs of smooth functions studied in differential geometry. The ring of regular functions (that is the coordinate ring or more abstractly the ring of global sections of the structure sheaf) is a fundamental object in affine algebraic geometry. The only regular function on a projective variety is constant (this can be viewed as an algebraic analogue of Liouville's theorem in complex analysis). A scalar function ∆í:X‚ÜíA1 is regular at a point x if, in some open affine neighborhood of x, it is a rational function that is regular at x; i.e., there are regular functions g, h near x such that f = g/h and h does not vanish at x.Proof: Let A be the coordinate ring of such an affine neighborhood of x. If f = g/h with some g in A and some nonzero h in A, then f is in A[h‚àí1] = k[D(h)]; that is, f is a regular function on D(h). Caution: the condition is for some pair (g, h) not for all pairs (g, h); see #Examples. If X is a quasi-projective variety; i.e., an open subvariety of a projective variety, then the function field k(X) is the same as that of the closure \\\\overline{X} of X and thus a rational function on X is of the form g/h for some homogeneous elements g, h of the same degree in the homogeneous coordinate ring k[\\\\overline{X}] of \\\\overline{X} (cf. Projective variety#Variety structure.) Then a rational function f on X is regular at a point x if and only if there are some homogeneous elements g, h of the same degree in k[\\\\overline{X}] such that f = g/h and h does not vanish at x. This characterization is sometimes taken as the definition of a regular function.  Comparison with a morphism of schemes  If X = Spec A and Y = Spec B are affine schemes, then each ring homomorphism determines a morphism :\\\\phi^a: X \\\\to Y, \\\\, \\\\mathfrak{p} \\\\mapsto \\\\phi^{-1}(\\\\mathfrak{p}) by taking the pre- images of prime ideals. All morphisms between affine schemes are of this type and gluing such morphisms gives a morphism of schemes in general. Now, if X, Y are affine varieties; i.e., A, B are integral domains that are finitely generated algebras over an algebraically closed field k, then, working with only the closed points, the above coincides with the definition given at #Definition. (Proof: If is a morphism, then writing \\\\phi = f^{\\\\\\\\#}, we need to show : \\\\mathfrak{m}_{f(x)} = \\\\phi^{-1}(\\\\mathfrak{m}_x) where \\\\mathfrak{m}_x, \\\\mathfrak{m}_{f(x)} are the maximal ideals corresponding to the points x and f(x); i.e., \\\\mathfrak{m}_x = \\\\\\\\{ g \\\\in k[X] \\\\mid g(x) = 0 \\\\\\\\}. This is immediate.) This fact means that the category of affine varieties can be identified with a full subcategory of affine schemes over k. Since morphisms of varieties are obtained by gluing morphisms of affine varieties in the same way morphisms of schemes are obtained by gluing morphisms of affine schemes, it follows that the category of varieties is a full subcategory of the category of schemes over k. For more details, see .  Examples  *The regular functions on An are exactly the polynomials in n variables and the regular functions on Pn are exactly the constants. *Let X be the affine curve y = x^2. Then ::f: X \\\\to \\\\mathbf{A}^1, \\\\, (x, y) \\\\mapsto x :is a morphism; it is bijective with the inverse g(x) = (x, x^2). Since g is also a morphism, f is an isomorphism of varieties. *Let X be the affine curve y^2 = x^3 + x^2. Then ::f: \\\\mathbf{A}^1 \\\\to X, \\\\, t \\\\mapsto (t^2 - 1, t^3 - t) :is a morphism. It corresponds to the ring homomorphism ::f^{\\\\\\\\#}: k[X] \\\\to k[t], \\\\, g \\\\mapsto g(t^2 - 1, t^3 - t), :which is seen to be injective (since f is surjective). *Continuing the preceding example, let U = A1 ‚àí {1}. Since U is the complement of the hyperplane t = 1, U is affine. The restriction f: U \\\\to X is bijective. But the corresponding ring homomorphism is the inclusion k[X] = k[t^2 - 1, t^3 - t] \\\\hookrightarrow k[t, (t - 1)^{-1}], which is not an isomorphism and so the restriction f |U is not an isomorphism. *Let X be the affine curve x2 \\\\+ y2 = 1 and let ::f(x, y) = {1 - y \\\\over x}. :Then f is a rational function on X. It is regular at (0, 1) despite the expression since, as a rational function on X, f can also be written as f(x, y) = {x \\\\over 1 + y}. *Let . Then X is an algebraic variety since it is an open subset of a variety. If f is a regular function on X, then f is regular on D_{\\\\mathbf{A}^2}(x) = \\\\mathbf{A}^2 - \\\\\\\\{ x = 0 \\\\\\\\} and so is in k[D_{\\\\mathbf{A}^2}(x)] = k[\\\\mathbf{A}^2][x^{-1}] = k[x, x^{-1}, y]. Similarly, it is in k[x, y, y^{-1}]. Thus, we can write: *:f = {g \\\\over x^n} = {h \\\\over y^m} :where g, h are polynomials in k[x, y]. But this implies g is divisible by xn and so f is in fact a polynomial. Hence, the ring of regular functions on X is just k[x, y]. (This also shows that X cannot be affine since if it were, X is determined by its coordinate ring and thus X = A2.) *Suppose \\\\mathbf{P}^1 = \\\\mathbf{A}^1 \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\infty \\\\\\\\} by identifying the points (x : 1) with the points x on A1 and ‚àû = (1 : 0). There is an automorphism œÉ of P1 given by œÉ(x : y) = (y : x); in particular, œÉ exchanges 0 and ‚àû. If f is a rational function on P1, then ::\\\\sigma^{\\\\\\\\#}(f) = f(1/z) :and f is regular at ‚àû if and only if f(1/z) is regular at zero. *Taking the function field k(V) of an irreducible algebraic curve V, the functions F in the function field may all be realised as morphisms from V to the projective line over k. (cf. #Properties) The image will either be a single point, or the whole projective line (this is a consequence of the completeness of projective varieties). That is, unless F is actually constant, we have to attribute to F the value ‚àû at some points of V. *For any algebraic varieties X, Y, the projection *:p: X \\\\times Y \\\\to X, \\\\, (x, y) \\\\mapsto x :is a morphism of varieties. If X and Y are affine, then the corresponding ring homomorphism is ::p^{\\\\\\\\#}: k[X] \\\\to k[X \\\\times Y] = k[X] \\\\otimes_k k[Y], \\\\, f \\\\mapsto f \\\\otimes 1 :where (f \\\\otimes 1)(x, y) = f(p(x, y)) = f(x).  Properties  A morphism between varieties is continuous with respect to Zariski topologies on the source and the target. The image of a morphism of varieties need not be open nor closed (for example, the image of \\\\mathbf{A}^2 \\\\to \\\\mathbf{A}^2, \\\\, (x, y) \\\\mapsto (x, xy) is neither open nor closed). However, one can still say: if f is a morphism between varieties, then the image of f contains an open dense subset of its closure. (cf. constructible set.) A morphism ∆í:X‚ÜíY of algebraic varieties is said to be a dominant if it has dense image. For such an f, if V is a nonempty open affine subset of Y, then there is a nonempty open affine subset U of X such that ∆í(U) ‚äÇ V and then f^{\\\\\\\\#}: k[V] \\\\to k[U] is injective. Thus, the dominant map ∆í induces an injection on the level of function fields: :k(Y) = \\\\varinjlim k[V] \\\\hookrightarrow k(X), \\\\, g \\\\mapsto g \\\\circ f where the limit runs over all nonempty open affine subsets of Y. (More abstractly, this is the induced map from the residue field of the generic point of Y to that of X.) Conversely, every inclusion of fields k(Y) \\\\hookrightarrow k(X) is induced by a dominant rational map from X to Y.Vakil, Foundations of algebraic geometry, Proposition 6.5.7. Hence, the above construction determines a contravariant-equivalence between the category of algebraic varieties over a field k and dominant rational maps between them and the category of finitely generated field extension of k. If X is a smooth complete curve (for example, P1) and if f is a rational map from X to a projective space Pm, then f is a regular map X ‚Üí Pm. In particular, when X is a smooth complete curve, any rational function on X may be viewed as a morphism X ‚Üí P1 and, conversely, such a morphism as a rational function on X. On a normal variety (in particular, a smooth variety), a rational function is regular if and only if it has no poles of codimension one.Proof: it's enough to consider the case when the variety is affine and then use the fact that a Noetherian integrally closed domain is the intersection of all the localizations at height-one prime ideals. This is an algebraic analog of Hartogs' extension theorem. There is also a relative version of this fact; see . A morphism between algebraic varieties that is a homeomorphism between the underlying topological spaces need not be an isomorphism (a counterexample is given by a Frobenius morphism t \\\\mapsto t^p.) On the other hand, if f is bijective birational and the target space of f is a normal variety, then f is biregular. (cf. Zariski's main theorem.) A regular map between complex algebraic varieties is a holomorphic map. (There is actually a slight technical difference: a regular map is a meromorphic map whose singular points are removable, but the distinction is usually ignored in practice.) In particular, a regular map into the complex numbers is just a usual holomorphic function (complex-analytic function).  Morphisms to a projective space  Let :f: X \\\\to \\\\mathbf{P}^m be a morphism from a projective variety to a projective space. Let x be a point of X. Then some i-th homogeneous coordinate of f(x) is nonzero; say, i = 0 for simplicity. Then, by continuity, there is an open affine neighborhood U of x such that :f: U \\\\to \\\\mathbf{P}^m - \\\\\\\\{ y_0 = 0 \\\\\\\\} is a morphism, where yi are the homogeneous coordinates. Note the target space is the affine space Am through the identification (a_0 : \\\\dots : a_m) = (1 : a_1 / a_0 : \\\\dots : a_m / a_0) \\\\sim (a_1 / a_0, \\\\dots, a_m / a_0). Thus, by definition, the restriction f |U is given by :f|_U(x) = (g_1(x), \\\\dots, g_m(x)) where gi's are regular functions on U. Since X is projective, each gi is a fraction of homogeneous elements of the same degree in the homogeneous coordinate ring k[X] of X. We can arrange the fractions so that they all have the same homogeneous denominator say f0. Then we can write gi = fi/f0 for some homogeneous elements fi's in k[X]. Hence, going back to the homogeneous coordinates, :f(x) = (f_0(x) : f_1(x) : \\\\dots : f_m(x)) for all x in U and by continuity for all x in X as long as the fi's do not vanish at x simultaneously. If they vanish simultaneously at a point x of X, then, by the above procedure, one can pick a different set of fi's that do not vanish at x simultaneously (see Note at the end of the section.) In fact, the above description is valid for any quasi-projective variety X, an open subvariety of a projective variety \\\\overline{X}; the difference being that fi's are in the homogeneous coordinate ring of \\\\overline{X}. Note: The above does not say a morphism from a projective variety to a projective space is given by a single set of polynomials (unlike the affine case). For example, let X be the conic y^2 = xz in P2. Then two maps (x : y : z) \\\\mapsto (x : y) and (x : y : z) \\\\mapsto (y : z) agree on the open subset \\\\\\\\{ (x : y : z) \\\\in X \\\\mid x e 0 , z e 0 \\\\\\\\} of X (since (x : y) = (xy : y^2) = (xy: xz) = (y : z)) and so defines a morphism f: X \\\\to \\\\mathbf{P}^1.  Fibers of a morphism  The important fact is: In Mumford's red book, the theorem is proved by means of Noether's normalization lemma. For an algebraic approach where the generic freeness plays a main role and the notion of \\"universally catenary ring\\" is a key in the proof, see Eisenbud, Ch. 14 of \\"Commutative algebra with a view toward algebraic geometry.\\" In fact, the proof there shows that if f is flat, then the dimension equality in 2. of the theorem holds in general (not just generically).  Degree of a finite morphism  Let f: X ‚Üí Y be a finite surjective morphism between algebraic varieties over a field k. Then, by definition, the degree of f is the degree of the finite field extension of the function field k(X) over f*k(Y). By generic freeness, there is some nonempty open subset U in Y such that the restriction of the structure sheaf OX to is free as OYU-module. The degree of f is then also the rank of this free module. If f is √©tale and if X, Y are complete, then for any coherent sheaf F on Y, writing œá for the Euler characteristic, :\\\\chi(f^* F) = \\\\deg(f) \\\\chi (F). (The Riemann‚ÄìHurwitz formula for a ramified covering shows the \\"√©tale\\" here cannot be omitted.) In general, if f is a finite surjective morphism, if X, Y are complete and F a coherent sheaf on Y, then from the Leray spectral sequence \\\\operatorname{H}^p(Y, R^q f_* f^* F) \\\\Rightarrow \\\\operatorname{H}^{p+q}(X, f^* F), one gets: :\\\\chi(f^* F) = \\\\sum_{q=0}^{\\\\infty} (-1)^{q} \\\\chi(R^q f_* f^* F). In particular, if F is a tensor power L^{\\\\otimes n} of a line bundle, then R^q f_*(f^* F) = R^q f_* \\\\mathcal{O}_X \\\\otimes L^{\\\\otimes n} and since the support of R^q f_* \\\\mathcal{O}_X has positive codimension if q is positive, comparing the leading terms, one has: :\\\\operatorname{deg}(f^* L) = \\\\operatorname{deg}(f) \\\\operatorname{deg}(L) (since the generic rank of f_* \\\\mathcal{O}_X is the degree of f.) If f is √©tale and k is algebraically closed, then each geometric fiber f‚àí1(y) consists exactly of deg(f) points.

It is situated in the Colombo fort next to the Old Parliament Building, which is now the Presidential Secretariat. Building With the expansion of the Legislative Council of Ceylon, the need for a new building to house the council and the civil administration of Ceylon was suggested by Sir Henry McCallum. A proposal made by a committee to construct the new building for the Secretariat, Council Chamber and Government offices on reclaimed land at the northern end of Galle Face' was accepted by the Ceylon Government in 1920. The chief architect of the Public Works Department, A. Woodson, was responsible for the design of the building. The initial estimate of Rs 400,000 for the scheme was later revised by the Public Works Advisory Board to Rs 450,000, taking into account the extra expenses involved. The building was opened on January 29, 1930 by Governor Sir Herbert Stanley. The new building was of two parts, the smaller however the more grandeur Council Chamber with a Neo-baroque facade faced the Indian Ocean to the west. The Secretariat, lager however the more simple building compared to the Council Chamber situated to the east of it. The Council Chamber was to house Legislative Council, however it was only for a year as the Legislative Council was replaced by the more powerful State Council of Ceylon in 1931. The Secretariat housed the civil administration of the colony, with the offices of the Colonial Secretary and the Treasurer along with their staff and several government departments. Effectively the two building became the center of the government of the island for the next twenty years till Ceylon gained independence in 1949. For many years after independence the headquarters of the CID of the Police was based here on the fourth floor which gain much ill fame. Following independence, new government ministries and departments were set up to carry out policy formulated by the Cabinet of Ministers. Many key departments were housed here including the Treasury and the Ministry of Finance. Soon many of the government ministries and departments moved out of the building to new buildings due their expansion. By the 1950s the building was known as the General Treasury and by the 1980s the building was completely occupied by the Ministry of Finance and its departments.

It supports general aviation with no commercial airline service scheduled. It was an established airport built prior to World War II. Seized by the Germans in June 1940 during the Battle of France, it was used as a Luftwaffe military airfield during the occupation. Captured by the Allies in late 1944, it was used as an Allied military airfield until the end of the war. History German use during World War II A small grass airport prior to World War II, it was seized by the Germans in late May 1940. After its capture, Vitry-En-Artois was used by the Luftwaffe as combat airfield during the Battle of France. As part of the Blitzkrieg, the Germans assigned the following units to the airfield during the battle, carrying out air attacks on the defending French and British Expeditionary Force: The Luftwaffe, 1933-45Identification codes of units of the Luftwaffe 1939 - 1945 * Jagdgeschwader 54 (JS 54) 28 May-6 June 1940 Messerschmitt Bf 109E * Jagdgeschwader 51 (JS 51) 1‚Äì9 June 1940 Messerschmitt Bf 109E * Lehrgeschwader 1 (LG 1) 14‚Äì25 June 1940 Junkers Ju 88A After the Second Armistice at Compi√®gne on 22 June, the Luftwaffe moved Kampfgeschwader 53 (KG 53) to the airfield on 12 July. KG 53 was a Heinkel He 111 medium bomber unit that participated in the ensuing Battle of Britain, remaining assigned to Vitry until 18 June 1941. Later in 1941, the Germans improved the facility into a permanent Luftwaffe air base by expanding the support area with numerous maintenance shops, hangars, and laying down two 1500m concrete all-weather runways, aligned 03/21 and 09/27 (A possible third runway, aligned 13/31 is visible in aerial photography, only part of the 13 (northwest) end still remains). Numerous taxiways and dispersal aircraft parking areas were also constructed. As Vitry is located in the Pas-de-Calais, it was believed by the Germans that when the Americans and British tried to land in France to open a Second Front, the airfield would have a key role in the defense of France. In 1943, Vitry-En-Artois became a day interceptor airfield which housed fighters to attack the USAAF Eighth Air Force heavy bomber fleets attacking targets in Occupied Europe and Germany.

The IX Engineer Command 850th Engineer Aviation Battalion moved in about 7 September and attempted to perform a rehabilitation of the base so it could be used by Allied aircraft. However the destruction of the airport was so complete that little could be salvaged, and the engineers laid down a 5000' Pierced Steel Planking (PSP) temporary runway over one of the destroyed German concrete runways aligned roughly east‚Äìwest (09/27). Once declared operational on 15 September, the airfield was designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"B-50 Vitry Airfield\\".IX Engineering Command Advanced Landing Grounds Once the PSP runway was laid down, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums was built along with a drinkable water well being drilled and a minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting to replace the destroyed infrastructure of the Luftwaffe base.Johnson, David C.

Postwar In French control after the war, the airport sat abandoned for years. There was much unexploded ordnance at the site which needed to be removed, as well as the wreckage of German and Allied aircraft. All of the buildings at the base were destroyed by the Allied air attacks or demolition, and although some had been repaired by the American combat engineers, most were in ruins. The French Air Force wanted nothing to do with a Nazi airfield on French soil, and as a result, the Air Ministry leased the land, concrete runways, structures and all, out to farmers for agricultural use, sending in unexploded ordnance teams to remove the dangerous munitions. Eventually the facility was cleared of all the rubble and ruins of the German air base. Concrete taxiways, parking ramps and dispersal pads were removed and turned into hardcore aggregate, eventually clearing the land which was leased to farmers for agricultural fields. The current airport was built south of the wartime airfield along the D950. It has no connection to the wartime field. Relics of both wartime runways still exist, and single-lane agricultural roads are the remains of some of the former taxiways. The runways are still littered with bomb craters, now grown in by soil and grass and other vegetation.

On 19 February 1985, a Boeing 727-200 operating the flight crashed into a television antenna on the summit of Mount Oiz in Biscay near Bilbao. All 141 passengers and 7 crew on board died. The crash is the deadliest aviation disaster in both Basque Country and Iberia history.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved was a Boeing 727‚Äì256, powered by three Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A turbofan engines capable of carrying 189 passengers and registered as EC-DDU. The aircraft was named Alhambra de Granada. It entered service on 18 May 1979 and had flown 13,408 hours at the time of the accident.  Flight  Flight 610 departed Madrid‚ÄìBarajas Airport at 08:47 CET and was scheduled to land at Bilbao Airport at 09:35. While on a standard approach into Bilbao at , the crew switched on the altitude alert system whilst flying through overcast and rainy weather. At 09:09 the crew received permission to descend to flight level , and at 09:16 the first officer established contact with the tower of Bilbao airport. Then the controller gave permission to continue the descent: \\"Iberia 610, you can continue descent, for an ILS approach to Bilbao, runway 30, wind is 100 degrees [at] 3 knots, QNH 1025 and transition level 70 []\\". The crew repeated the transmitted information, after which the controller offered them a direct approach. However, the captain refused, choosing a standard approach plan. At 09:22 the crew reported on the VOR passage of Bilbao at an altitude of , reaching the starting point of the landing approach. The crew received permission to descend to an altitude of . This was the last radio transmission from Flight 610. The aircraft reached at 09:25. The minimum height in the region was , but the crew set the altitude on the warning system to . However, after reaching this altitude the plane continued descending. The weather conditions at that time were cloudy with fog, with of visibility. The descent was controlled by the autopilot. The altitude alert went off when the plane reached ; the captain interpreted this to be the approach alert mode alarm and ignored it and continued the descent. At 09:27, after 57 seconds from the moment of descent to a safe altitude and , flying above Mount Oiz (elevation ) in a landing configuration (with flaps extended and landing gear lowered), and at a speed of , the aircraft collided with an TV antenna of the Euskal Telebistarues television tower at , shearing off its left wing. The aircraft then fell from the TV tower and crashed into a forest. All 148 people on board died.  Cause  According to the investigation, the crew distrusted the autopilot during the descent phase, but it is likely that they forgot to turn on the ALT SEL (altitude select) button, accidentally disengaged it, or the system itself malfunctioned. As a result, after reaching their assigned altitude, the autopilot did not support it, which led to a further decline, and the pilots did not control it. When the altitude alert sounded, the crew most probably misinterpreted the alarm. Investigators also discovered that the TV tower installed on the mountain was not marked on the navigation maps available to the crew. Investigators determined the cause of the crash was pilot error due to the flight crew misinterpreting data and flying the aircraft below the safety altitude.

Built originally as a grass airfield by the French Air Force before World War II, Juvincourt was expanded to become one of the main German Luftwaffe airfields in France during the German occupation (1940‚Äì1944), hosting a wide variety of both fighter and bomber aircraft, including German jet fighters and bombers. Seized by the Allies in September 1944 it became a major United States Army Air Forces base for fighter, bomber and transport units for the remainder of the European War (1944‚Äì1945). Today, the airfield is a quiet place, hosting paintball fights and a Robert Bosch GmbH automobile testing centre and track. Extensive wartime relics can be found in the area as well as the former airfield. History French Air Force A French Air Force facility was built at Juvincourt during 1938 and 1939 consisting of a grass airfield with three small grass subfields associated with it: * Amifontaine * Guignicourt * Proviseux It appears that the French Air Force considered Juvincourt an auxiliary airfield and did not station any units or aircraft at the facility. After World War II broke out in September 1939, the Royal Air Force sent 16 Fairey Battles of 76 Wing, 142 Squadron to Proviseux (Berry-au-Bac), between 2‚Äì12 September 1939. The RAF aircraft, however, did not see any combat during the Phony War, and were moved on 12 September to Plivot.Royal Air Force Order of Battle, France, 10 May 1940No. 142 Squadron (RAF): Second World War Luftwaffe use It was captured by the Germans in June 1940 during the Battle of France, and was developed by the Luftwaffe into the largest German military airfield in France during the occupation, having more than 300 aircraft assigned.Der Flugplatz Juvincourt, 1939-1945 Under Luftwaffe control, the airfield was vastly expanded with an aggressive construction program. Three concrete runways aligned 17/35 5300' (1610 m); 09/27, 5280' (1600 m) and 05/23 6500' (1980 m) were laid down to provide all- weather use of the field. An enclosing perimeter taxiway loop connecting the ends of runways was built, connecting the airfield to the support station. A large concrete control tower was erected, and an expansive support base to the southwest was built in a wooded area with permanent, concrete structures. Barracks, workshop buildings, air raid bunkers, earth-covered concrete hangars and a series of taxiways connected the support and maintenance facilities with the airfield. A railroad spur was built, with a right-of-way from the northern main line to haul supplies and equipment, as well as disassembled aircraft and munitions to the airfield. In addition to the airfield and support base, barracks facilities were constructed in the commune of Juvincourt-et-Damary, on the northeast side of the airfield, being dispersed away from the airfield and technical support area.

The mission on 2 August was the first photo-reconnaissance mission undertaken by a jet. Two Ar 234 continued to fly missions from Juvincourt until 26 August. One of the pilots; Erich Sommer, had spotted a member of the French resistance at the airfield with a camera. Soon afterwards the RAF attacked the airfield. The two Ar 234 were undamaged, but on 28 August they left Juvincourt for Belgium. Juvincourt was a frequent target of Allied aircraft during the Strategic Bombing Campaign over Occupied Europe in 1943-1944. Eighth Air Force records show specific heavy B-17 Flying Fortress bomber attacks on the airfield in October 1943 and January 1944.USAFHRA History Search - Juvincourt It was also attacked routinely by Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers. The medium bombers would attack in coordinated raids, usually in the mid-to-late afternoon, with Eighth Air Force heavy bombers returning from attacking their targets in Germany. The attack was timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the Luftwaffe interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also, the P-47 Thunderbolts of Ninth Air Force would be dispatched to perform fighter sweeps over Juvincourt after the Marauder raids, then meet up with the heavy bombers and provide fighter escort back to England. As the P-51 Mustang groups of Eighth Air Force began accompanying the heavy bombers all the way to their German targets by mid-1944, it was routine for them to also attack Juvincourt on their return to England with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.Derived from information in USAAF Film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4)USAFHRA Document 00233753 Allied use A-68 Juvincourt Airfield ALG 1944 The airfield was seized from the Germans by Allied ground forces on 5 September 1944. Before abandoning the station, the Germans conducted demolitions of whatever buildings had not been destroyed by Allied air attacks. Once in American hands, combat engineers of the IX Engineering Command 820th Engineer Aviation Regiment repaired the damaged airfield and declared it operationally ready for combat units on 7 September, only a few days after its capture from German forces, being designated as Juvincourt Airfield (A-68) Although operationally usable, Juvincourt was a wrecked base from the numerous Allied air attacks since late 1942 and what was blown up by the Germans as they withdrew. The Americans made do with the portion of the airfield closest to the town of Juvincourt , repairing the 35/17 NW/SE runway for operational use. Most of the personnel were billeted in old German and French military barracks that could be used in the town, the barracks facilities in the village being much appreciated by aircrews and ground personnel, who were used to living in tents since their departure from airfields in England in June. What was not constructed of reinforced concrete was shattered, although even some of those were destroyed by the 500lb GP bombs of the Marauders and Flying Fortresses. Many buildings of masonry construction had been made useless, their contents consisting of nothing but wreckage.IX Engineering Command Advanced Landing GroundsJohnson, David C.

Combat Squadrons of the Air Force, World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1982 In addition, the Royal Air Force also utilized Juvincourt, units and aircraft are yet to be determined. With the war ended, Juvincourt became largely a transport airfield, being used by the RAF also for repatriation of English, Australian and New Zealand prisoners of war. These transfers were made by Lancasters of No 463 Squadron and No 467 Squadron RAAF, together with No 186 Squadron and No 50 Squadron. (operation Exodus) The airfield was returned to French control on 2 July 1945. Postwar In French control after the war, the base sat abandoned for several years. There was much un-exploded ordnance at the site which needed to be removed, as well as the wreckage of German and American aircraft. Many of the buildings at the base were destroyed by the Allied air attacks, and although some had been repaired by the American combat engineers, most were in ruins. Although it was a prewar French Air Force facility, the Air Force wanted nothing to do with a Nazi airfield on French soil. As a result, the Air Ministry leased the land, concrete runways, structures and all, out to farmers for agricultural use, sending in unexploded ordnance teams to remove the dangerous munitions. In 1950 when as a result of the Cold War threat of the Soviet Union, the airfield at Juvincourt was offered to the United States Air Force by the French Air Ministry as part of their NATO commitment to establish a modern Air Force station at the site. Some construction was performed, pouring an 8000' jet runway (05/23) to the south of the World War II airfield, along with aircraft dispersal areas at each end of the runway. However the construction was never completed due to the high cost of breaking the agricultural leases, and also the high costs of removing the concrete German runways and other facilities. It was cheaper to build an airfield elsewhere and the land was simply sold off to private interests.McAuliffe, Jerome J: U.S. Air Force in France 1950-1967 (2005), Chapter 2, Base Selection and Movement to France, 1950-1954 Current Today Juvincourt Airfield is a quiet place, consisting of mostly agricultural fields. The N44 highway bisects the airfield, crossing over the southwest part running NW/SE. Of the three concrete runways laid down by the Luftwaffe, only the northwest/southeast (17/35) remains at full length and width. although some sections have been removed over the years. Many patched bomb craters are evident on the concrete. A significant amount of the east/west (09/27) runway still exists, also extensively patched, however, the 05/23 runway is almost nonexistent, being almost totally removed for hardcore aggregate. A very small section, however, can be found in the middle of a field connecting two single-track agricultural roads which are the remaining narrow concrete strips of the former runway, the full width of which can be seen in disturbed earth along the road. The enclosing perimeter track taxiway exists also as single-lane concrete farm roads. Connecting taxiways of the airfield exist as well in the same condition. An interesting feature can be found in the middle of the airfield. It is a concrete circle in a ring, that indicates the cardinal points of the compass. It was connected by a taxiway and was used to adjust aircraft navigation equipment. The concrete control tower (coordinates listed above) today is a restaurant, with what appears to be a connecting wartime building as part of the structure located today on the west side of the N44. About 1 km northwest, also along the N44 is a British World War I cemetery which has the graves of many Tommies killed along the Western Front trenches that were close by the area. Nearby the cemetery are concrete bomb shelters dug by the Germans and reinforced, to protect personnel during the frequent Allied air raids. The wooded areas to the southwest of the airfield , adjacent to the N44 is where the German ground support station was built. Many buildings still remain in the woods, in various states of disrepair, almost all constructed of concrete. This area is now on private land and access is prohibited. The woods contain underground bomb shelters; concrete aircraft hangars, ruins of barracks; workshops and other buildings. Photos of these structures can be found here: In aerial photography, the remains of aircraft taxiways and dispersal parking revetments can be seen which connected the technical site to the airfield. The railroad spur right- of-way is still visible in aerial photography, however the tracks have long since been removed. In the commune of Juvincourt-et-Damary, northeast of the airfield, several buildings that appear to be the remains of former military barracks and bomb shelter exist. , , . Some are abandoned, some are in use today by the residents of the commune. To the southeast of the wartime airfield is the 1950s jet aircraft runway and dispersal pads built when Juvincourt was proposed as a NATO airfield. Today it is owned by Robert Bosch GmbH, being used as an automobile testing centre and track. Intense test car activity nowadays. Former airfield structures are still clearly visible and the former operations tower along the main road is used as a restaurant pizzeria. former perimeter road still in place and witnesses the immensity of former German base.

Fieldwork and research interests Magliocco did fieldwork in northwestern Sardinia (Italy) during the 1980s, studying the effect of socio-economic transformation on the traditional festivals of a pastoral highland community. The Two Madonnas and Le due Marie di Bessude were the result of this research. Magliocco's studies of contemporary Neopagans in the San Francisco Bay Area provided the subject material for Witching Culture and Neo-Pagan Sacred Art and Altars. In Cornwall, England, her fieldwork on the Padstow May Day celebration was used to produce Oss Tales. Magliocco is currently working on a project based on traditional healing practices in Italy.author's bio on Amazon.com She has written several journal articles that have had significant impact on modern scholarship about witchcraft and the USA revival of Italian-American Stregheria.See \\"Significant articles\\" in Bibliography Magliocco is an initiate of Gardnerian Wicca.From author's notes in Witching Culture (see Bibliography) From 2012 to 2014, Magliocco made appearances on 17 episodes of the History Channel series, Ancient Aliens, as a commentator speaking about folkloric concepts related to the theme of each episode. She also appeared as a commentator on three episodes of the Scary Tales television series in 2011.

The company is best known for producing news videos covering various city council and school board meetings, as well as Pennsylvania political and governmental events. The raw footage for the videos are recorded by freelance video teams hired by Roxbury. The editing and production is performed at company's office on State Street in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, adjacent to the steps of the Pennsylvania State Capitol. The videos generally appear on the Roxbury News website, YouTube, and other video sharing sites. Impact of new stories One of Roxbury News' famous videos, \\"Papenfuse X-mas Gift List,\\" contains footage of former Harrisburg Authority board member Eric Papenfuse reading a list of mock Christmas gifts for city officials. The contents of the video were reported by the Central Penn Business Journal. The Central Penn Business Journal used footage from another Roxbury video as evidence to question the official story behind the firing of longtime Harrisburg Authority financial adviser Bruce Barnes. The Central Penn Business Journal, relying on the Roxbury News footage, noted that the firing happened shortly after Eric Papenfuse raised questions about a $27,000 bill from Barnes' firm. In another popular video, a Harrisburg School District board member excoriates a critic for making personal attacks on the District Superintendent. In 2008, The Philadelphia Inquirer used Roxbury's footage from the 2006 \\"Bonusgate\\" trials in its coverage of the event. Grand jury subpoena Roxbury News was among the media outlets, including the AP, The Morning Call, The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Philadelphia Daily News, The Citizens' Voice, that were subpoenaed to answer questions about their reports on the a grand jury investigation into political corruption surrounding the Mount Airy Casino Resort. Roxbury said that his company had \\"one or two\\" videos related to the grand jury testimony in question, but wasn't sure how helpful his testimony could be, saying \\"I don't know what they think I could offer them. The information is readily available.\\" In July 2008, James Roxbury testified at a closed hearing before Dauphin County Judge Todd Hoover regarding the case. Roxbury's attorney, Adam Klein, told the Associated Press that his client had \\"cooperated without compromising his rights under either the Constitution or the Shield Law.\\" On July 17, 2008 Judge Hoover quashed all 15 subpoenas, including the one for Roxbury News. Account hack and burglary On January 13, 2008, apparent hackers compromised Roxbury's YouTube account and deleted all but 1 of 160 news videos stored on that site. On the only video not deleted, the hackers left a message saying \\"You should just quit...I've seen better work from an autistic 4th grader with an eye patch on and no hands to even operate the camera, so yeah i guess you can see by now how much your life is a joke.\\" In a video response, Roxbury offered a $1,000 bounty for information leading to the identification of the perpetrators and noted that he was working with YouTube administrators officials and law enforcement officials on the matter. James Roxbury said that \\"We feel this has to be a criminal activity. We know the videos must be getting to somebody,\\" and was able to restore the videos from backup sources. In July 2008, the Roxbury News office was burglarized, with thousands of dollars in audio visual equipment missing, including three 40-inch monitors, and two high-definition Panasonic HDX200 cameras, and other accessories. Because data storage units containing backups of his news videos were not touched, Roxbury did not believe the burglary was politically motivated.

This statistical region in the Sava Hills is the smallest region in the country in terms of both area and population. In early-2010 almost 41,700 people lived on 264 km¬≤, meaning that together with the Central Slovenia Statistical Region it is the most densely populated statistical region. The natural and geographic features of this region create conditions for industrial activities and more than a third of gross value added is still generated by manufacturing, mining, and other industry. In 2013, the region once again recorded the highest negative annual population growth rate (‚àí11.9‚Ä∞), which was mainly a result of migration to other statistical regions. Among all statistical regions in 2013, this region had the highest negative net migration between regions; namely, ‚àí9.5. This region also stands out by age of mothers at childbirth. In 2013 first-time mothers in the region were on average 28.5 years old, whereas first-time mothers in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region were on average 1 year older. In the same year, the number of unemployed persons increased further. The registered unemployment rate was among the highest in the country (16.6%). In comparison with other regions, this is 7 percentage points more than in the region with the lowest registered unemployment rate, Upper Carniola, and almost 1 percentage point less than in the region with the highest unemployment rate, the Mura Statistical Region. According to the labour migration index, this is the most residential statistical region. In 2013, 60% of people in the region worked in their region of residence, and 40% worked in another region.

Overview  The practice requires that a Governor have (or successfully claim) the power to veto individual words in a bill passed by the legislature rather than the bill in toto.

Almost immediately, the United States Army Air Forces IX Engineer Command 830th and 833rd Engineer Aviation battalions along with the 878th Airborne Engineer Aviation Battalion cleared the airport of mines and destroyed Luftwaffe aircraft. A significant amount of battle damage was sustained, requiring repairs that included the laying of a new 5000' asphalt secondary runway. On 15 September, after about two weeks of reconstruction, Villaroche Airport became a USAAF Ninth Air Force combat airfield, designated as \\"A-55\\".Johnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama.IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout Under American control, the Ninth Air Force assigned the 416th Bombardment Group to the airport which flew A-26 Invader and A-20 Havoc attack bombers from the airfield until February 1945. The combat unit then moved east along with the Allied lines and the airport became transport airfield and air service depot, hosting C-47 Skytrains of the 436th Troop Carrier Group and the Air Technical Service Command 462d Air Service Group until the summer of 1945, after end of the war.Maurer, Maurer.

In the late 1940s, as the civil use of Orly Airport in Paris began to expand after its reconstruction from wartime damage, Melun Villaroche was used by the United States Air Force as a pilot proficiency airfield. In 1950-1951 when as a result of the Cold War threat of the Soviet Union, Melun Villaroche Airport was proposed by the United States Air Force to become a NATO transport facility. Plans were made to establish a long-term lease of the facility as a United States military airfield. Plans were designed for a large Military Air Transport Service (MATS) air terminal to support personnel and cargo flights into the Paris area. In addition, a major USAF Hospital for the Paris area was also planned and designed.McAuliffe, Jerome J. (2005). US Air Force in France 1950-1967. San Diego, California: Milspec Press, Chapter 14, Paris-USAF Operations. . In the ongoing negotiations, the site was ultimately rejected. The plans for expanding USAF use of the facility were cancelled in favor of the expansion of the MATS facilities at Orly Air Base, and the hospital was constructed at the new USAF √âvreux-Fauville Air Base instead. The Americans continued to use Melun Villaroche on a limited basis for pilot proficiency flying until √âvreux-Fauville AB opened in 1955 and at that point the airport was returned to full French control. Allied Air Forces Central Europe Communication Squadron RAF was formed here. Current use Today the main users of the airfield are the Fixed-Base Operator, (AFIS); the aero-club-Melun Villaroche \\"Constantine Rozanoff\\", and collectors of vintage aircraft. Business aircraft, in conjunction with area businesses use the airport daily. Safran Aircraft Engines has a large manufacturing plant to the south of the airport along D-57. Safran built the plant over part of the abandoned World War II airfield, where abandoned taxiways can still be seen in open areas. This aerodrome is best known for the numerous tests of aircraft prototypes that have occurred until the early 1980s, especially those of several military aircraft such as the Dassault Mystery; Mirage, and VTOL designs. It was also a test center for Safran. Many World War II relics can be found at the airport, abandoned taxiways with aircraft hardstands are evident with deteriorating concrete. A munitions storage area remains to the east of the north-south runways in a wooded area along with what appear to be old concrete hangar foundations, buildings, and other wartime concrete taxiways.

Facilities The airport resides at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one paved runway designated 09C/27C which measures . It also has two parallel grass runways: 09L/27R measuring and 09R/27L measuring . History  Arm√©e de l'Air use during World War II Coulommiers Airport has its direct origins in 1938 when the French Arm√©e de l'Air established the base. French aviation had been ongoing in the area as far back as early balloon flights by the De Montgolfier brothers in 1783 and various glider and other aeronautical experiments in the 19th Century. The battles of the Marne were fought in the region during World War I, and numerous French and German aircraft were in the area.The Airfield at Coulommiers-Voisins The Arm√©e de l'Air had stationed GC III/6 and GC III/7 at the airfield; GC III/6 was equipped with single-engine Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters and GC III/7 with Bloch MB.220 fighters. With the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, additional squadrons of both French and Royal Air Force aircraft were assigned to Coulommiers, including RAF Supermarine Spitfires; various reconnaissance aircraft, and Dewoitine D.520 (GC I/3).History of Coulommiers Airfield Combat forces from the airfield fought in the Battle of France during May and June 1940, until the final armistice with Germany of 20 June. German use Seized by the Germans in June 1940 during the Battle of France, Coulommiers was used as a Luftwaffe military airfield during the occupation.

The unit lost 265 killed, 121 missing, 63 as POWs and 65 wounded as well as 62 aircraft during the operation.Kampfgeschwader 54 Wikipedia page The unit moved to √âvreux in late July. After KG 54 moved out, the Luftwaffe also expanded the facility with an entirely new dispersal area in a wooded area to the northeast of the French airfield, building numerous dispersal pads and taxiways. * Schnellkampfgeschwader 10 (SKG 10) September‚ÄìOctober 1943 Focke-Wulf Fw 190A * Kampfgeschwader 2 (KG 2) 11 April ‚Äì 10 August 1943 Dornier Do 217E/K/M (Fuselage Code: U5+) In 1943, Coulommiers was brought back online as an operational base, initially with day interceptor fighters (SKG 10) to attack USAAF Eighth Air Force heavy bombers as part of the \\"Defense of the Reich\\" campaign. KG 2 engaged in night bombing attacks over Britain and dropping naval mines in the English Channel and along the British east coast. These attacks drew the attention of the USAAF, and the airfield became the target of frequent attacks by Allied aircraft, being attacked on 14 June 1944 by Eighth Air Force B-17 Flying Fortresses; and by IX Bomber Command B-26 Marauders on 23 June.

The Americans returned full control of the airport to French authorities on 8 August 1945.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . Postwar After the war, the airfield was abandoned for a number of years, but remained in the hands of the French Air Ministry. During the 1950s, plans were made to use Coulommiers as an alternate for Le Bourget Airport. In addition, construction of two circular marguerite systems of aircraft hardstands was made in order to upgrade the airfield to NATO standards for possible military use. In 1960, a decision was made to reopen Orly Airport (then being a USAF base (Orly Air Base)) as a civil commercial airport and plans for the use of Coulommiers were discontinued. Accidents and incidents *On 14 June 1948, SNCASE Languedoc P/7 F-BATG of Air France crashed at Coulommiers. Current In aerial photography the prewar French Air Force base is very evident with large numbers of wartime taxiways and both wartime runways still existing. Although greater than 70 years old, the concrete with expansion joints separating the poured sections are quite evident, but surprisingly well intact. Large numbers of Eighth Air Force bomb craters on both the 09/27 primary and the 04/22 secondary runways are quite evident by the concrete patches applied by the Air Force combat engineers in 1944. Numerous bomb craters are also in the grass areas around the marguerites and the former Luftwaffe dispersal area. In addition, it appears that the American combat engineers resurfaced a significant amount of taxiways and dispersal pads connected to the runways with Prefabricated Hessian Surfacing (PHS) which remains today, in a deteriorated state. The Luftwaffe expansion to the base remains intact, complete with dispersal revetments in the woods, and concrete taxiways. Numerous bomb craters are visible in the open areas around the woods. Numerous wartime airfield buildings surround the airfield and what appears to be the prewar French Air Force barracks and support buildings appear to be in various states of disrepair with overgrown vegetation and very tall trees that once lined the roads in a neat, military manner. A large number of bomb craters appear in the remains, with some buildings being in use, probably as agricultural buildings. The communes of Giremoutiers and Corbeville are attached to this area. The current airport has been overlaid on the remains of the wartime airfield, with the main 09/27 runway 4,600 feet in length being a fresh asphalt overlay on the wartime concrete runway. An asphalt taxiway is also overlaid over a wartime taxiway, with modern hangars and a terminal on the south side of the airfield. Two short grass runways were constructed over the wartime airfield, used for gliders and light aircraft. Modern navigational aids are available and the facility is well maintained.

E. smaragdinum stems grow as tall as 0.4 m, and the linear- lanceolate, often red-spotted leaves grow as long as 8 cm. As with other members of E. subg. Amphiglottium, the peduncle grows from the apex of the stem, and is covered with close, imbricating sheathes. The racemose inflorescence bears only a few small bright green to white flowers at one time. The linear-oblong acute sepals are nearly 1 cm long; the lateral sepals are nearly half as wide as they are long. The petals are nearly liner, pointed at the end, and somewhat shorter than the sepals. The lip has a few red-brown spots and is adnate to the column to its apex. Dodson & Dodson 1989 describes the lip as subreniform; Reichenbach 1861 as cordate.H. G. Reichenbach \\"Orchides\\" item 262 in C. M√ºller, Ed. Walpers Annales Botanices Systematicae VI(1861)386 Berlin. As with other members of E. sect. Schistochila, the lip bears two lateral lobes and an apical lobe; in the case of E. smaragdinum, the apical lobe is divided in two, producing a roughly triangular lip with four points at its end. As with the other members of E. subsect. Integra, the margin of the lip is neither lacerate nor fringed. The lip bears two tooth- like processes on either side of the column, and a central keel. The anther contains four pollinia.  Synonymy  Dodson & Dodson 1989 list three synonyms for E. smaragdinum. Kew, however, accepts E. pachyrachis Ames and E. alfredii Schltr. as separate species.

Established in 2002, the website is free to use and does not use advertising to generate revenue. The cost of running it is instead covered by money from Blue Mountain Arts, as well as the money made from its workbook printouts. History Starfall was founded on August 27, 2002, by Stephen Schutz, his wife Susan Polis Schutz, and their son, Jared Schutz Polis. Starfall arose from Blue Mountain Arts, a publishing house in Boulder, Colorado founded by Stephen Schutz. Starfall received this name because the founders believed that the name \\"evoked wonder and delight\\". Stephen Schutz had trouble reading books when he was nine years old, so he decided to help young readers by creating this website. In 2006, Starfall launched Pumarosa, which helps Spanish speakers learn English. In May 2007, Starfall had 987,000 visitors, which was a 300% increase from the previous year. In 2011, TIME included Starfall on its list of \\"50 Websites That Make the Web Great\\". Four reading levels Starfall has four reading levels to teach children how to read. The levels, in order from the most basic to the most advanced are: \\"learning ABCs\\", \\"early beginning reading\\", \\"intermediate beginning reading\\", and \\"advanced beginning reading\\". The first level teaches preschoolers about the ABCs. At this level, the website provides learners with all the letters of the alphabet in the upper case form and in the lower case form. When the learners see words appear on the screen, they hear the sounds of all the letters that compose a word. In the early beginning level, learners create words through the addition of consonants to different word family. The letters in every word are highlighted while they are read to the learner. In the intermediate beginning reading level, readers can bring the books they will read to life before they read them. The learner can read about eminent artists and magic tricks. In the advanced beginning reading level, children can read a variety of books, including nonfiction books, bird riddles, Chinese fables, and comics.

It is currently collected by the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research. It was originally called the Higher Education Financial and Research Publications Data Collection.Department of Employment, Education and Training (1994) Higher Education Financial and Publications Research Data Collection, Specifications for Preparing Returns, December. Higher Education Funding Act 1988 section 18 outlined the data that must be reported by institutions.http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/hefa1988221/s18.html Purpose The statistics are used by the government to allocate funding under the following schemes: * Institutional Grants Scheme (IGS) * Research Training Scheme (RTS) * Research Infrastructure Block Grants Scheme (RIBG) * Australian Postgraduate Awards * Commercialisation Training Scheme (2007 onwards) * International Postgraduate Research Scholarships Scheme Publications The collection only accepts publications of the following types: * Book (A1) * Book chapter (B1) * Journal article (C1) * Conference publication (E1) Each institution submits four numbers as part of HERDC; one for each of the above types of accepted publication. These numbers are the aggregate of the contribution of the university to each accepted publication. For example, if a book has two authors from different institutions, each institution has a 0.5 contribution to the publication. The score for books, journal articles and conference publications is a simple division by the number of authors. For book chapters, each authors first chapter in a book is scored using the same method as other publication types, however additional chapters by an author are given a decreasing value. Each institution is required to keep evidence of all of the publications it has included in their submission, and the evidence may be audited.

It is also notable for its first use of plastic as a structural material.Flight 8 July 1955 p.44 Only one P.10 was built and it attracted much attention; but it probably never flew. Design and development In the first decade of the 20th century, Boulton and Paul besides their wood construction shops also had plants for iron making, wire fencing and structural steel for buildings. It is not surprising therefore that when they became involved with aircraft production in World War I and then began their own designs they soon looked to the use of steel airframes. The Boulton & Paul P.10 was the first example and only their third design. The P.10 was a single-engined two-seat biplane with an airframe of high tensile steel, zinc treated and varnished against corrosion. It had single bay wings with no stagger or sweep. Both wings had the same span and the same constant chord. Rather like the earlier P.6, the interwing gap was large and equal to the chord, putting the upper wing high above the fuselage. Either side of the centre section were a pair of vee struts to front and rear spars, assisted by another strut from front spar to the engine bulkhead The wings were built around two I section spars, each a box section constructed from rolled strips. The forward spar had four of these strips, the rear two.Flight 1 January 1920 p.11-4 The P.10 was displayed at the Paris Salon d'Aeronautique in 1919 without its fabric covering, the wing construction was in plain view. There were interconnected ailerons on both wings. The P.10 had a small fin, which with its horn balanced rudder formed a teardrop shape. The tail, with unbalanced elevators was strut braced to the fin. The front fuselage was built on four tubular longerons, but from leading edge rearwards it consisted of a set of oval formers with stringers. The greatest novelty of the P.10 was that this part of the fuselage was not only a monocoque structure (still fairly unusual at the time), but a monocoque of steel with a load-bearing plastic skin riveted between the formers and stringers. Specifically, the plastic was Bakelite-Dilecto, a hard, synthetic cellulose-formaldehyde product. The company claimed it was proof against fire, heat, humidity and insects. This was the first use of structural plastic in an airframe and perhaps the last for another sixty years. This construction gave the fuselage a smooth, rounded \\"torpedo-like\\" look, which was enhanced by the close cowling of the 100 hp (75 kW) Cosmos Lucifer radial engine, though its three cylinders projected out a long way for cooling. This engine drove a four bladed wooden propeller, the only wooden part of the airframe. Boulton Paul had made their own propellers during the war. The front cockpit was at the wing leading edge with a rather distant second cockpit under the trailing edge, about 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m) aft. Dual control was fitted. As exhibited in Paris, the P.10 had a tall single axle undercarriage mounted on a pair of vee- struts on either side. These were bungee sprung, though there were plans for oleo dampers. The P.10 was not the first metal British aircraft, for the unlikely looking Seddon Mayfly holds that priority; but it never had a realistic hope of flight. One lesser novelty, which was to become a standard Boulton & Paul feature was the mounting of the Lucifer on a hinge so that it could be swung sideways for servicing without disconnecting pipework etc. The P.10 made a big impact at the 1919 Paris show, with Flight describing it as \\"the machine of the show\\". Nonetheless, after the show the P.10 disappeared from sight. There is no record of it flying, though there seems no reason why it should not have been capable. There are reports of it being damaged when the engine failed. It was not at the Paris show of 1920. Surprisingly, the delicate structures of one wing and the tail unit have survived. These parts were at the Bridewell MuseumBridewell Museum in Boulton & Paul's home town of Norwich, though this museum is closed for refurbishment as of 2009. The wing section is now on display hanging from the ceiling of the International Aviation Academy Norwich at Norwich Airport.

The Vaillancourt name originates from the Northern French regions of Lorraine and Normandy. Ancestors of the family were seated at Gulis, and were important members of the aristocracy of the region.http://www.historicalnames.com/namelistdetail_v.asp?surname=Vaillancourt The origin of the Vaillancourt name can be traced back to the early 13th century in Normandy, France. In 1220, an abbey was built on land belonging to Guillaume D'Abberville on his property at Thum. The abbey was given the name \\"de Villencourt\\" in reference to the court of Count William of Ponthieu, held there from 1105 to 1126 A.D. In 1195, D'Abberville married Alice of France, the daughter of Louis VII, King of France. The new marriage gave his court considerable clout; however D'Abberville died within a year of the founding of the abbey. His heirs would eventually produce two kings of England: Edward I and Edward II. The seat of the abbey was moved in 1662 to Abbeville, the capital of Ponthieu, for greater safety during the French Wars of Religion. The name is Anglicized as Smart. http://www.historicalnames.com/namelistdetail_v.asp?surname=Vaillancourt Robert Vaillancourt of Normandy, France, settled in √éle d'Orl√©ans, Quebec in 1666.

Club career Born in Montegranaro, the Province of Fermo, in the Marche region, he moved his first footsteps with his hometown club until the age of 14, when he was noted by FIFA agent Silvio Pagliari who proposed him to Sampdoria, which successively chose to sign the player and include him in their Giovanissimi Nazionali (under-15) squad for the 2003‚Äì04 season. He was pivotal in the 2007‚Äì08 Sampdoria under-20 double (Campionato Nazionale Primavera and Coppa Italia Primavera). On 11 January 2009, he made his first team debut in a Serie A home league game as a second-half substitute against Palermo, a 2‚Äì0 loss for the Genoese club. Three months later, exactly on April 26, 2009, he made his first start in a 3‚Äì3 draw with Cagliari, with Marilungo scoring two goals, the first ones in his senior career. On 27 August 2009, Marilungo joined Serie B outfit Lecce on a one-year loan spell. On 12 September 2010, he signed a 5-year contract to stay with Sampdoria, but only four months later, he joined Atalanta in a 4¬Ω-year deal for ‚Ç¨4.7 million. Sampdoria relegated at the end of 2010‚Äì11 season, with Atlanta promoted to Serie A at the same time. In 2013 he signed a new contract with Atalanta. On 17 January 2014, Marilungo was signed by Serie B club Cesena. On 28 August 2015 Marilungo left Bergamo again for Lanciano. He left Bergamo again for Empoli on 26 August 2016. In the third successive season, Marilungo joined Spezia on loan on 31 August 2017. On 18 September 2018, he joined Serie C side Ternana on a two-year contract. On 3 October 2020 he moved to Monopoli on loan. International career On 8 September 2009, he made his debut with the Italy U-21 team in a game against Luxembourg. He scored 1 goal in 6 appearances with the U-21 team. Style of play A diminutive, creative, and versatile player, Marilungo started out as an attacking midfielder, although he is capable of playing in several offensive positions, as a main striker, as a second striker, or as a winger, due to his ability to both score and set up goals; he is mainly known for his great pace, technique, powerful striking ability with his right foot, and eye for goal. Once considered a promising young player, in 2010, he was named one of the 100 best young footballers in the world born after 1989 by Don Bal√≥n.

The attacks were timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also the P-51 Mustang fighter-escort groups of Eighth Air Force would drop down on their return to England and attack the base with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.Derived from information in USAAF Film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4) American use It was liberated by Allied ground forces about 6 September 1944 during the Northern France Campaign.

Early life and studies Dudan was born in Vrlika, a small town which was a part of the Kingdom of Dalmatia, an administrative division (kingdom) within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Dudan spent his childhood in Split, where his family had established nobility for centuries and had given the city a mayor (Leonardo Dudan, mayor between 1848 and 1853). His father, Antonio, was one of the richest landowners in Dalmatia. His mother, Caterina Gazzara, belonged to one of the most prominent families of the Italian community in Split. Participation in World War I At the outbreak of World War I, Dudan fled from Austria to Italy. In Italy, he served as acting president of the Italian Pro-Dalmatia and advocated for intervention against the central powers. During that period he published a now famous essay titled \\"The Habsburg Dynasty: Origins, Size and Decay\\" (Rome, 1914), which was imbued with irredentism and opened considerable historical and political debate in that transitional period. When Italy entered the war, Dudan was appointed as a volunteer cavalry officer. He distinguished himself and was decorated with a Cross of War. A Fascist from the movement's beginning in 1919, he worked fervently for the maintenance-costs promises made to Italy in the Treaty of London, and was a member of the Italian delegation at the peace conference in Paris. At the news of the Impresa di Fiume, he left to become a legionnaire under Gabriele d'Annunzio. Italian art history Between 1921 and 1922, Dudan wrote: Twenty Centuries of Civilization: A Ponderous work of Art History in Italian Dalmatia. His work presented a comprehensive overview of the history of Dalmatia in relation to contemporary artistic events. In particular, Dudan deepened the connections between Dalmatian and Italian art. Historians who found this study important have included Adolfo Venturi, Bernard Berenson, Joseph Fiocco, Mario Salmi, and Rodolfo Pallucchini. Politician Dudan is directly linked to his \\"national border\\". He participated in the March on Rome, representing the Italian fascists of Zadar and Dalmatia. As Consul of the Militia, he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in 1921 from Rome, and again in 1924 and 1929 as an at-large delegate. Dudan was a Freemason, probably from his time in Vienna. In 1918, he was the master of the \\"Universe\\" gallery in Rome. During the meeting of the Grand Council of Fascism on 23 February 1923, he was among those who abstained from voting, believing in the incompatibility of Fascism and Masonry. Due to this, he was ejected from the Grand Lodge of Italy. On 1 March 1934, he was appointed a senator of the Kingdom and was sworn in on 4 May that year. In his parliamentary work, he always reminded representatives not to forget Dalmatia. At the outbreak of World War II, Dudan managed to finally achieve his dream: annexation of much of Dalmatia and the creation of the Governorship of Dalmatia. However, in 1944 Dudan was arrested and imprisoned in Padula and remitted to the High Court of Justice for Sanctions against Fascism. His senatorship was revoked on 28 December 1944. Last years and death Dudan spent the last years of his life working for Istrian- Dalmatian exile associations. He died in his house in Rome on 31 March 1957.

An online memorial may be a one-page HTML webpage document giving the name of the deceased and a few words of tribute, an extensive information source, or be part of a social media platform where users can add their own words and photos. History A few individual online memorials started appearing on the Internet in the late 1990s. Many were websites created in response to the death of a person who was in the public eye, rather than for general members of the public. One example of this is the collective memorial website Find a Grave, which at that time was focused on publishing memorial information about famous people. Also during the 1990s, newspapers and funeral homes began contributing obituaries to permanent online databases. Online cemeteries, the first of which was launched in 1995 as the World Wide Cemetery (cemetery.org), also host online memorials. More recently there have been an increasing number of modern online memorial platforms launch. These platforms can provide online memorials and obituaries independently while also acting as a platform that powers the obituaries and tributes sections of major online newspapers. In 1997, Carla Sofka, Professor of Social Work, in her article 'Social support \\"Internetworks,\\" caskets for sale, and more: Thanatology and the information superhighway', recognized the increasing use of this new form of memorialisation. Online memorials for public events, such as the one created by the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, also began to appear, allowing a collective response to events causing widespread grief. In the 2000s, with the development of social media platforms and simplified website creation software, the numbers of individual online memorials has increased rapidly.ft.com \\"Mourners turn to virtual shrines\\". Financial Times (subscription required) Online memorial databases such as Find a Grave have also opened up to allow contributions from individual users. Benefits of online memorials Online memorials allow participation in the grieving process from a distance and at any time of the day or night; in the view of some sociologists, such public displays of grief are important for emotional recovery after bereavement.Mitchel, Lisa M. ‚ÄúDeath and grief on-line: Virtual memorialization and changing concepts of childhood death and parental bereavement on the Internet.‚Äù Health Sociology Review, Volume 21 No. 4 (2012). Page 424. They provide a communications outlet for continued grieving when more formal events have ended. Availability of inexpensive or free online space allows grievers to include extensive content such as stories and discussions. Unlike some other types of memorials,\\"Sacred Waste\\". Death Dying and Disposal 10 Conference Book of Abstracts, 2011. they have little environmental impact. Facebook can give people the opportunity to keep the deceased a part of their lives by posting on their walls during the holidays, birthdays, and other important dates in their lives or the bereaved life. Online memorials also give the bereaved the ability to pull up the deceased page and go through the comments or pictures when they are having a particularly difficult time and want to remember good memories they once shared with the deceased. Continuing bonds and expressing feelings toward the deceased can be considered therapeutic to the bereaved.Bell, J., Bailey, L., & Kennedy, D.

By Marie Becker February 1, 2015 Facebook, for example, provides a process for transforming the profile of a deceased user into a memorial. Family members or friends can report an account to be memorialized upon presentation of proof of death. When the account is memorialized, Facebook removes sensitive information such as contact information and status updates, but still enables friends and family to leave posts on the profile wall in remembrance. However, only confirmed friends can see the memorialized profile or locate it in search.  Fundraising in memory  Online memorials are sometimes used to collect In Memoriam donations to charitable or non-profit organizations, to fund medical research, hospices, or community activities and hobbies in which the deceased participated.

Bardo is equipped with his \\"Kruger Blaster\\", which is the most powerful handgun in the universe. The film also stars Jackie Earle Haley as Bardo's human enemy, Braxton Red. \\"Brick Bardo\\" is a character name used by Albert Pyun in films dating back to his second film, Radioactive Dreams. The film was produced by Full Moon Features, who also worked with Thomerson on the Trancers series. It was followed by a crossover sequel in 1993 called Dollman vs. Demonic Toys, which is also a sequel to Demonic Toys (1992) and Bad Channels (1992). Dollman also had its own comic series published by Eternity Comics, who also made comics for other Full Moon films. Plot On the planet Arturos, a criminal takes hostages at a laundry. The crook is surprised when cop Brick Bardo defiantly enters to do his laundry. Bardo causes the overweight hostages to faint and pin down the criminal when he threatens to shoot through their bodies with his powerful weapon. Although he saves the hostages, Bardo, who was suspended for his violent methods, faces further criticism from the mayor. News segments also air claiming he killed multiple hostages. Bardo is ambushed and kidnapped. After Bardo wakes up on a desert plain, his greatest enemy, Sprug, reveals he intends to kill Bardo with his own blaster, which Bardo used to reduce Sprug to a floating head. Bardo uses a magnetic field to retrieve his blaster and kills Sprug's henchmen. Sprug escapes in his ship, and Bardo follows. Sprug and Bardo pass through an energy band, which shrinks them and sends them to Earth. In The Bronx, New York City, Braxton Red and his gang run their neighborhood and kill any gangsters who intrude. Debi, a young Hispanic single mother, wants the police to do more. When Debi goes home, gangsters who know about her meddling ‚Äì Hector, Wick, and Jackson ‚Äì capture and threaten her. Before they can kill her, Bardo wounds Hector and kills Wick. Hector and Jackson run off, leaving Debi to wonder if she is hallucinating. As she takes Bardo and his ship away, Braxton Red and his right hand man Armbruiser spot Sprug. Sprug says he has a powerful bomb they can use in exchange for helping to repair his ship. Debi introduces Bardo to her excited son, Kevin. At the hideout, Braxton kills Hector in a fit of rage when Jackson says it was his idea to kill Debi. Braxton disbelieves that a doll-sized man could hurt anybody, but he takes Jackson and several other gangsters with him to Debi's place to find the alleged Dollman. Bardo kills all of the gangsters except Braxton, who is seriously injured while fleeing. Sprug recognizes Bardo's handiwork. After Braxton agrees to his demands, Sprug partially heals his injuries. When Sprug insists on taking over the gang, Braxton squashes Sprug. Though still wounded, Braxton resolves to kill Bardo. Bardo overhears a commotion outside the apartment when Debi comes home from work. As Braxton and Armbruiser kidnap Debi, Bardo leaps out of a window and grabs onto their car as it speeds off. Bardo follows the gang to where the spaceships landed, where they plan to ambush him. Bardo uses an underground passage to surprise the gangsters and rescue Debi. A shootout ensues, and Bardo kills most of the gangsters by exploding their vehicles. Debi runs off, and Braxton follows. Feeling disrespected for keeping her alive for years, Braxton is about to shoot Debi, but Bardo distracts him and shoots off one of his arms. Debi stops Bardo from killing Braxton. Braxton uses Sprug's bomb as a last resort murder- suicide, and Debi and Bardo run for cover. Debi, after seeing that Bardo is safe, smiles, and Bardo asks her if size counts.

This is changed to Ginger through editing in the next film, 1993's Dollman vs. Demonic Toys. That crossover sequel uses a lot of archive footage to tell the back story of the various characters. It pits Bardo against four evil toys in a warehouse, who are trying to resurrect their demon master. Bardo even gets himself a girlfriend called Ginger (a similarly shrunken nurse, returning from the movie Bad Channels) and they help a normal sized police officer called Judith Gray to deal with the demonic toys once more, having already dealt with the nasty playthings before, in Demonic Toys.

He is widely credited as the architect of the modern-day syndicated loan market.The New York Public Library Honors James B. Lee, Jr., New York Public Library, June 26, 2008 At the time of his death, Lee was vice chairman of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and a member of the bank's executive committee. He was also Co-Chairman of JPMorgan's investment bank. Early life Lee was born on October 30, 1952 in Manhattan, New York City. He was educated at the Canterbury School. He graduated from Williams College in 1975, where he received a bachelor of arts degree in Economics and Art History. A trustee of Williams College, the college's snack bar and most recent track and field center is named after him. Career Lee joined Chemical Bank in 1975 and worked in a variety of lending businesses until 1980, when he founded and ran Chemical's merchant bank in Australia. In 1982, he returned to the US and started the bank's syndicated leverage finance group, which constituted the origins of the investment banking business at Chemical and later Chase Manhattan Bank. Lee ran the investment bank until the merger with J.P. Morgan & Co. in 2001. Following Chemical's merger with Manufacturers Hanover in 1994, Lee founded the bank's high yield (or junk bond) business, which was the bank's first public securities operation. At the same time, he built the bank's financial sponsor coverage business focused on private equity firms as well as the bank's mergers and acquisitions business. By organizing high yield with loan syndications and private equity coverage, and the newly formed M&A; group, this led to a variety of market innovations which Chase pioneered. Lee also led the team that resulted in Chase acquiring Hambrecht & Quist which gave the bank its first public equity business and first dedicated technology investment banking practice. He remained active in the technology industry. In 2000, Lee was effectively demoted in favor of Geoffrey BoisiSidelined Banker Still Draws a Crowd.

Biography Being a son of a wood sculptor, he began his artistic education at the early age of ten. In 1915, at the age of 18 he moved to Poland to attend the Krak√≥w academy of fine art and in 1918 he moved the Ukraine to study in the Academy of Fine Arts of Kiev. During the Russian Civil War, while pursuing his studies, he contribute to the revolution efforts by painting posters. In 1921, he studied art in Petrograd, and during this period he worked as a decorator in the Meyerhold Theater. He worked for Stanislavski and Vakhtangov, both notorious in the field of theater. In 1925, he left Russia in favor of Paris, and settled down in Montparnasse. As of 1926, he exhibited his works at the Salon des Ind√©pendants, the Salon des Tuileries and other places as well. In 1939, he became a refugee, escaping to Carpentras and later on to Hautes-Alpes. When the war ended he traveled to Italy, before returning to Paris. When he did return to Paris he set down to write his book of anecdotal stories taken from the life of the artists from La Ruche. In the thirties, he painted several portraits, which for expressiveness and iconography (chair, twisting of the face, the use of very bright colors) anticipate the portraits of Francis Bacon. Some art historians have repeatedly talked about a strong link between the painting of Van Gogh, Soutine, Chapiro and Bacon. He opposed the demolition of La Ruche in 1967 and he founded, along with Marc Chagall and Raymond Cogniat, a committee that fought against this move. The committee succeeded in its cause. Chapiro‚Äôs works can be found in museums in the United States (Chicago), Russia (Moscow) and France (Jeu de Paume, Paris). As to his artistic style, it seems that Chapiro was fond of experiments. His many paintings are much different from one another; some are definitely Cubistic in style, some Impressionists and others Fauvists. We cannot say the same thing on his sketching. Throughout his artistic career, Chapiro kept sketching in his unique signature, with a light and talented hand. It is in his realistic sketching, which are somewhat casual, that one can be truly impressed by his talent.

On February 7, 2014, DG's TV advertising business was acquired by Extreme Reach, Inc. and its online advertising business was spun off into the new company Sizmek, Inc.http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/digital-generation-completes- spin-off-sizmek-merger-transaction-with-extreme-reach-nasdaq-szmk-1876873.htm History April 15, 2005--DG Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: DGIT), the leading provider of digital media distribution services to the advertising and broadcast industries, today announced it has acquired the assets of Media DVX, a subsidiary of the Lenfest Media Group (LMG), for $10 million. DG temporarily changed its handle to DG FastChannel when DG Systems and FastChannel Networks merged in 2006. DG Systems initially used POTs to distribute later adding web- based and satellite technology for advertising content distribution thereby all but eliminating the need for reel to reel audio tape and CDs for radio station spot distribution. Later the system replaced the need for videotape distribution for television. DG Systems created a hybrid system that allowed for content delivery through either the satellite distribution system or through the Internet. FastChannel Networks used the Internet for delivery of content. FastChannel Networks created a Web-based interface for developing, managing and delivering advertising content. Using the Web, post houses, advertisers and agencies were able to collaborate, manage and distribute advertising content through an online application. In 2009, DG was ranked fifth on the Fortune Small Business list of the US' 100 Fastest Growing Small Public Companies. It also ranked fifth on the 2009 Fortune Fastest Growing Companies in the World listing. In 2011, DG began buying up digital ad serving technologies in the online space, specifically focused on Rich Media vendors with global reach. Such companies include Mediamind Technologies, EyeWonder and the Unicast platform. In 2011, DG was responsible for the first second- screen ad being served in connection with Channel 4's Million Pound Drop TV game show. The second screen ad format was watched by 20% of the online playing audience according to Dean Donaldson, Global Head of Media Innovation. In August 2013, DG agreed to spin off their online ad tech operations (branded as DG MediaMind and consisting of the merged operations of the former MediaMind, EyeWonder, Unicast, Peer39, and Republic Project) into a new company named Sizmek, Inc. and to sell their remaining operations to Extreme Reach in a deal valued at $485 million. The money was used to pay off all of DG's debt and to fund a $3/share dividend to shareholders. All of DG's cash and working capital was then transferred to Sizmek and Extreme Reach acquired the remaining operations. The deal closed on February 7, 2014. In March 2019, Sizmek has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Network Reach DG soon moved its headquarters to Irving, Texas.

The foreign press however reported that one sailor had been saved by holding on to a beam and floating to Gogland. In all the storm on the night wrecked about 30 ships on the Russian Baltic coast. A board of inquiry investigating the disaster recognized as the most probable cause of the accident the weakening of the ship ties caused by the fact that in 1856 the ship twice been used as transport for the carriage of heavy loads on the gun decks. It also alleged that the ship's hull had not been caulked adequately and the cargo load was too small, and incorrectly arranged. In addition, it was speculated that the gun ports had been left open to provide fresh air for the passengers; this may have contributed to the sinking of the ship as water could have poured in through the open ports when the ship first heeled over.

Interview with Liubov Slivka by Vazyl Moroz, newspaper Galicia (Ukrainian) ), and enjoying a virtual monopoly on education and wealth within western Ukrainian society, the clergy came to form that group's native aristocracy. The clergy adopted Austria's role for them as bringers of culture and education to the Ukrainian countryside. Most Ukrainian social and political movements in Austrian-controlled territory emerged or were highly influenced by the clergy themselves or by their children. This influence was so great that western Ukrainians were accused by their Polish rivals of wanting to create a theocracy in western Ukraine.Himka, John Paul. (1999). Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine. McGill-Queen's University Press: Montreal and Kingston. Pg. 10 The central role played by the Ukrainian clergy or their children in western Ukrainian society would weaken somewhat at the end of the nineteenth century but would continue until the Soviet Union forcibly dissolved the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Ukrainian territories in the mid-twentieth century (the so-called Council of Lviv, 1946). Background and Origins Traditional wooden Ukrainian Catholic Church in Kolochava In 988 East Slavic state of Kyivan Rus was converted to the Eastern form of Christianity at the behest of Volodymyr I of Kyiv. Following the East-West Schism between the Roman and Byzantine Churches, the form of Christianity that Kyivan Rus followed became known (in English) as the Eastern Orthodox Church. The westernmost part of Kyivan Rus formed the independent Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia, which Poland conquered in 1349. Over the following centuries, most of the native landowning nobility adopted the dominant Polish nationality and Roman Catholic religion. Only the poorer nobles, descended from a mixture of poor boyar families, druzhina (free warriors serving the princes), and free peasants, retained their East Slavic identity.Encyclopedia of Ukraine. Entry: Petty Gentry, written by Yaroslav Isaievych Volume 3 (1993). Published by University of Toronto. Many priestly families had origins among those poor nobles. John-Paul Himka. (1988).Galician Villagers and the Ukrainian National Movement in the Nineteenth Century. MacMillan Press in Association with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta, pg.116 and in some particular regions, such as the area between Lviv and the Carpathian mountains, almost all of the priestly families were of poor noble origins.L.

(Ukrainian) Ivano-Frankivsk: Ivano-Frankivsk State Medical University. Such people identified themselves primarily as priests rather than nobles. Thus, the local native society was composed principally of priests and peasants. In an attempt to limit Polish pressure, the Union of Brest (1595/1596) saw the creation of the Uniate Church (later the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church) in the former parts of Kyivan Rus under Polish rule. Like other Eastern Catholic Churches, the Uniate Church maintained the liturgical, theological and devotional traditions, including married priesthood, of the Orthodox Church - despite its new allegiance to Rome. History The centuries of Polish rule were characterized by a steady erosion of the economic and social status of most of the local Galician clergy. Prior to the Habsburg reforms, a very small number of Greek Catholic clergy, often Polonized nobility, were linked to the Basilian order. The Order was independent of the Greek Catholic hierarchy and continued to enjoy certain wealth and privileges which it did not share with the rest of the Church. In striking contrast, the Galician priests who were not of noble origin, although not serfs, were frequently forced to work for the Polish nobles and treated little better than peasants by them, and these priests' sons who did not follow their fathers' vocation were often placed under the same feudal obligations as were hereditary serfs.Jean-Paul Himka. (1986). The Greek Catholic Church and Ukrainian Society in Austrian Galicia. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. Such circumstances fostered a sense of solidarity and closeness between the priests and the peasants. There were cases of Ukrainian priests or their sons participating in or leading armed insurrections against Polish nobility.Martha Bohachevsky-Chomiak. (1988). Feminists despite themselves: women in Ukrainian community life, 1884-1939 . Edmonton, Alberta: Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies press, University of Alberta. pp. 47-49 The situation changed when the region of Galicia was annexed by Austria in 1772. Travelling the lands newly acquired from Poland in 1772, Austrian emperor Joseph II decided that the Greek Catholic clergy would be ideal vehicles for bringing about enlightened reform among the Ukrainian population. With this in mind he undertook major reforms designed to increase the status and educational level of the Ukrainian clergy in order to enable them to play the role he assigned for them. The Greek Catholic Church and its clergy was raised in status in order to make it legally equal in all respects to its Roman Catholic counterpart. The previously independent Basilian Order was subordinated to the Greek Catholic hierarchy. Ukrainian Catholic priests were granted stipends by the Austrian government, liberating them economically from the Polish nobles who were now prevented by the Austrians from interfering with them. Ukrainian priests were also allotted larger tracts of land that further contributed to an improvement in their financial situation. Whereas previously the Ukrainian priests had typically been taught by their fathers, the Austrians opened seminaries specifically for Ukrainian Catholic students in Vienna (1774) and Lviv (1783) that provided subsequent generations of priests with University-level education and a strong exposure to Western culture. The sons of priests who served in the bishop's administration were given the same rights to state offices as had the sons of nobles.Stanislaw Stepien. (2005). Borderland City: Przemysl and the Ruthenian National Awakening in Galicia. In Paul Robert Magocsi (Ed.). Galicia: A Multicultured Land. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pp. 52-67 As a result of the Austrian reforms of the late 18th century, the Ukrainian Catholic priests thus became the first large educated social class within the Ukrainian population in Galicia.Himka, John Paul. (1999). Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine. McGill-Queen's University Press: Montreal and Kingston. Pg. 6. Kost Levytsky, a priest's son, would become the major political figure in western Ukraine in the late 19th and early 20th centuries The Austrian reforms granting education, land, and government salaries set the stage for the clergy's dominant position in western Ukrainian society for several generations. Both significant Ukrainian social movements, that of the Russophiles who sought to unite Ukraine with Russia and of the Ukrainianophiles, who supported Ukrainian independence, were dominated by members of the clergy. The Supreme Ruthenian Council which represented the Ukrainian people in dealing with the Austrian authorities, consisted primarily of clergy and met in the consistory of St. George's Cathedral, the \\"mother church\\" of the Ukrainian Catholic Church. The first non-clerical secular intelligentsia to emerge among western Ukrainians (lawyers, writers, doctors) were typically the children of priests, which served to perpetuate clerical influence among western Ukrainians. Because priests served as the only conduit between the cities and the peasants of the villages, urban Ukrainian intellectuals seeking to reach the peasants were forced by circumstances to work through the priests. They thus tended to be deferential to them and sought to avoid antagonizing the clergy. The situation changed somewhat by the late nineteenth century. The clergy's colossal efforts to educate the peasants resulted in the relative loss of priestly power. New members of the intelligentsia arose from the peasantry, some of whom objected to what they considered to be the priestly patronizing attitudes towards peasants as childlike or drunkards needing to be taught and led. Simultaneously, urban intellectuals no longer had to go through priests in order to spread their ideas among a newly literate peasantry. The Radical movement appeared in Western Ukraine in the 1870s. Its political party, founded in 1890, was explicitly anti-clerical and sought to limit the clergy's influence.Orest Subtelny. (1988). Ukraine: A History. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pg. 328 The Radicals helped to spread discontent against the status quo by criticizing sacramental fees that were considered to be too high for the poor peasants, publicizing disputes over land rights between the Church and the peasantry, and attacking priests' authority on moral matters. Often having to wait until the priests had taught the peasants how to read, the Radicals took over many of the reading clubs that the priests had founded and turned them into sources of anti-clerical agitation. In the words of one church leader speaking about reading clubs, \\"instead of national love they have awakened in our peasant self-love and arrogance.\\"Metropolitan Kuylovski, quoted in Jean- Paul Himka. Priests and Peasants: The Greek Catholic Pastor and the Ukrainian National Movement in Austria, 1867-1900. Canadian Slavonic Papers, XXI, No. 1 Ottawa: Carleton University pg. 10 The Radicals' anti-clerical efforts helped to curb the clergy's power. For example, father M. Sichynsy, who had been elected to the Galician Diet in 1883, lost an election to the Reichsrat in 1889 to a Polish candidate, count Borkowski in part because of conflicts between the priest and local peasants over land usage. While the clergy dominated the ethnic Ukrainian parliamentary delegations in the 1860s and 1870s, of the 28 Ukrainian members of Austria's parliament in 1909-1911 only four were clerics. Despite such changes, the largest and most popular western Ukrainian political party from the late nineteenth until through the mid twentieth century continued to be the Ukrainian National Democratic Party, founded and led by the priest's son Kost Levytsky.Encyclopedia of Ukraine, National Democratic Party, written by Vasyl Mudry Nearly sixty percent of the members of the Ukrainian National Council, the legislative body of the Western Ukrainian People's Republic that ruled western Ukraine from 1918-1919, came from priestly families.Social-Political Portrait of the Ukrainian Leadership of Galicia and Bokovyna during the Reovlutionary Years of 1918-1919 Oleh Pavlyshyn (2000).

Impact on society and culture Russophile leader Scholar Jean-Paul Himka has characterized the Galician clergy as having \\"an Orthodox face, Roman Catholic citizenship and an enlightened Austrian soul.\\" This Austrianism manifested itself not only in loyalty to the Habsburg dynasty but also in following the role ascribed to them by the Austrian emperor as Enlighteners and educators of the Ukrainian community. Priests were heavily involved in spreading literacy in western Ukraine. The first West Ukrainian grammar of the Ukrainian language was published by a priest who also translated Goethe and Schiller into Ukrainian.Hans-Joachim Torke, John-Paul Himka. (1994). German- Ukrainian relations in historical perspective . Edmonton: Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies Press, pp.31-34 Two thirds of the participants of a Congress of scholars called in 1848 to standardize the Ukrainian language and introduce educational reforms were members of the clergy.Orest Subtelny. (1988). Ukraine: A History. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 249-250 Priests actively supported the first Ukrainian newspaper, Zorya Halytska (\\"Galician Star\\"), either reading it aloud to illiterate peasants or having their cantors do so. Between 1842 and 1856 approximately 1,000 parish schools were established in the Lviv eparchy. Of 43 Ukrainian-language books published in Galicia between 1837 and 1850, 40 were written by members of the clergy. In 1831 seminarians were required by the head of the Church to take classes in agronomy because they were expected to introduce modern farming methods to the peasants. Many priests used their lands as \\"model farms,\\" cultivating new varieties of grains or other plants. In one region, for example, priests planted the first apricot orchards. Some priests even taught agricultural methods from the pulpit.Stella Hryniuk. (1991). Peasants with Promise: Ukrainians in southeastern Galicia, 1880-1900. Edmonton, Alberta: Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Alberta. pp. 129-130 Priests also founded temperance societies, reading clubs, and were significant figures in the Ukrainian cooperative movement. As an example of priests' impact in one community, in the village of Lanivtsi in southern Galicia, the local priestly dynasty established the community's credit union, local reading club, and child-care facilities.Stella Hryniuk. (1991). Peasants with Promise: Ukrainians in southeastern Galicia, 1880-1900. Edmonton, Alberta: Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Alberta. pg. 195 The role of the clergy had a profound impact on the Ukrainian national movement. In contrast to the Polish intelligentsia, which largely derived from the lower nobility, the western Ukrainian intelligentsia largely derived from the clergy. Studying in Vienna, Ukrainian seminarians came into contact with the West at the time when Romantic nationalism and the virtues of the \\"People\\" had come to dominate modern thought in central Europe.Paul Robert Magosci. (2002). The roots of Ukrainian nationalism: Galicia as Ukraine's Piedmont . Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pg. 15 The Ukrainian seminarians established contact with Czech students who were undertaking an extensive revival of their national culture and came to imitate their efforts. Most of the leaders of the Ukrainian Women's Union (Soyuz Ukrainok) were the wives and daughters of priests. The historical background of the Galician clergy contributed to a strong hostility and rivalry towards Poles, as well as a fierce sense of loyalty to Austria and the Habsburg dynasty by most Galician clerics. These attitudes were transmitted to their parishioners and thus reflected in Ukrainian society as a whole, earning western Ukrainians the nickname \\"Tyroleans of the East\\" for their loyalty to Austria. In the words of Ukrainian Catholic pilgrims visiting the tombs of the first two Austrian rulers to rule Ukraine, \\"lost deep in thought, we gazed at the coffins of Maria Theresa and her son Joseph, whose names are written in golden letters in our people's history.\\" Daily Life Education Prior to the annexation of Galicia by Austria, Ukrainian priests had typically been taught by their fathers, and their rudimentary education was largely limited to the Liturgy, basic knowledge of the Church Slavonic language, and basic literacy. Following the social and educational reforms that began with Austrian rule in the late 18th century, priests' children (typically, future priests) attended elementary school in a small city not far from the village where their father had a parish, and gymnasium in a larger city.John-Paul Himka. (1988).Galician Villagers and the Ukrainian National Movement in the Nineteenth Century. MacMillan Press in Association with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta pp. 113-115 The Austrians opened seminaries specifically for Ukrainian Catholic students in Vienna (1774) and Lviv (1783). All priests obtained four years of University-level education in one of these seminaries. They were required to study the three languages of Galicia, Ukrainian, Polish, and German, as well as Latin and Church Slavonic. Some priests knew other languages. Priests were expected to continue to educate themselves after being ordained. The university-level education of Galician priests differentiated them from the more modestly educated Orthodox priests of the neighboring Russian Empire, and contributed to the difficulty in the Russian Orthodox Church's attempts to gain converts among western Ukrainians during World War I.Mark Von Hagen. (2007). War in a European borderland: occupations and occupation plans in Galicia. Seattle: University of Washington Press . Family life A Ukrainian Catholic priest, Ihnatiy Tsehelsky, and his bride The vast majority of clergy had families. In 1894 only 3 percent of Galician priests were celibate.David Goa. (1989). The Ukrainian religious experience: tradition and the Canadian cultural context . Edmonton, Alberta: University of Alberta Press. pg. 83 Although seminarians spent the school year studying in the cities of Vienna or Lviv, they spent their summer vacations courting in various Ukrainian villages. Priests married prior to their ordination at about 26 years of age. Their brides were usually the daughters of other priests. After being ordained, the priests typically spent ten to twenty-five years being transferred to different parishes before settling in one place as its pastor.John-Paul Himka. (1988).Galician Villagers and the Ukrainian National Movement in the Nineteenth Century. MacMillan Press in Association with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta pg. 115 The family of the Ukrainian Catholic priest had three sources of income. A modest government salary was sufficient for household expenses and to pay for one son's education. Priests also made money from sizable farms (priests' landholdings were larger than those of peasants and typically varied in size from 12.5 to 50 hectares, compared to 2.8 hectares owned by the average peasant Orest Subtelny. (1988). Ukraine: A History. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pg. 308) and from sacramental fees for burials, weddings, christenings, etc. Due to their level of income the Ukrainian priests were typically the wealthiest Ukrainians in their villages. However, they often felt poor because their living expenses were much higher than those of peasants. Ukrainian priests were expected to educate all of their sons, a financial burden that drove some of them into debt. They were also expected to subscribe to various newspapers, to make charitable contributions, and to dress and eat better than did peasants.John-Paul Himka. (1988).Galician Villagers and the Ukrainian National Movement in the Nineteenth Century. MacMillan Press in Association with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta, pp. 109-110 Priestly income also paid for their daughters' dowries, clothing for the wife to wear in society, buying and repairing carriages, and investments for the farm. Reflecting the clergy's role as community leaders and organizers, family life usually centered not on religion but on political and social questions. According to the memoirs of one priest's son, his own family and that of other priests were \\"honorable\\" but much more concerned about national than religious issues. Conversations centered on economic concerns, village affairs, and politics while in his and other priestly families moral or religious matters were not discussed.Tarnavky, Spohady, cited in Jean-Paul Himka. (1986). The Greek Catholic Church and Ukrainian Society in Austrian Galicia. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press pg. 444 Despite the role of the Ukrainian clergy within the Ukrainian national revival, the clergy's educational and social status resulted in the Polish language being the language of daily use by most clerical families until the end of the 19th century.Orest Subtelny. (1988). Ukraine: A History. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 238-239 Priests' wives were also active in the community. They administered \\"folk medicine\\" in their communities and cultivated and administered herbs, grasses and other plants with supposed medicinal value.Stella Hryniuk. (1991). Peasants with Promise: Ukrainians in southeastern Galicia, 1880-1900. Edmonton, Alberta: Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Alberta. pg. 185 John- Paul Himka described the lives of several priests. Amvrozii de Krushelnytsky (1841‚Äì1903), father of Ukrainian opera singer Solomiya Krushelnytska. The son of a priest of noble origins, he served in a parish that was endowed with 91.5 hectares of arable land, an orchard and beehives. He had six daughters and two sons and found it difficult to meet his financial obligations. He paid for tutors for all of his children but went into debt for many years in order to pay for his daughter Solomiya's conservatory. Krushelnytsky was fluent in several languages and enjoyed foreign literature (Goethe, Schiller, Shakespeare) and Ukrainian literature (Taras Shevchenko and Ivan Franko), and was able to visit his daughter in Milan in 1894 and Vienna in 1895. He encouraged the peasants to educate their children, was a member of Prosvita, and organized a choir in his parish; he also taught the violin.John-Paul Himka. (1988).Galician Villagers and the Ukrainian National Movement in the Nineteenth Century. MacMillan Press in Association with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta, pg. 284 Danylo Taniachkevych (1842‚Äì1906) served in a parish with an endowment of only 8 hectares of arable land. He studied in Lviv, belonged to Prosvita, founded reading societies, and was a deputy in the Austrian parliament for three years. Taniachkevych adopted and cared for the six children of his deceased father-in-law; this drove him into debt and poverty to such an extent that his family often went hungry.John-Paul Himka.

Lambert was also a sportsman of note, and captained the Cambridge University rugby team in the very first Varsity Match. Early life Lambert was born in 1850 in Stockwell, London; the fifth son of Thomas Lambert of Surbiton. He was educated at Rugby School before matriculating to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1868. Lambert was a keen footballer while at Rugby and because of his old school ties was allowed to join the newly formed Cambridge University rugby team. When the first Varsity Game between Cambridge and Oxford Universities was arranged in 1872, the Cambridge captain was E. Winnington Ingram, but because of Tripos work, he was unavailable to travel to Oxford.Marshall (1951), pg 17. Lambert, who played at half back,Marshall (1951), pg 19. was elected in his place and lead his team onto the Parks playing field on 10 February 1872. Cambridge lost by a goal to nil, but reports state that Lambert 'played splendidly, saving Cambridge many times.Marshall (1951), pg 18. While still completing his studies, Lambert was admitted at the Middle Temple in 1870, and was awarded his BA in 1873. On 26 January 1874, he was called to the Bar, and received his MA in 1876. Around this period, Lambert travelled to Asia, and published a short field guide, A Trip to Cashmere and Ladak, which was published in 1877 by Henry S. King of London. He was also a Friend of the Royal Geographical Society and a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London. Political career and later life Before entering a political career, Lambert followed his legal education, becoming a Justice of the Peace in Surrey. His one and only election victory was in 1886, when he stood as a Conservative candidate for Islington East. He retained the seat until the 1892 election. He died 16 October 1918 in Eastbourne.

Its history begins before World War II, when it was originally a grass civil airdrome. During the German occupation of France (1940‚Äì1944), the Luftwaffe developed the airdrome into a major military airfield, basing a variety of planes at the airfield, as well as using it as a maintenance and supply depot. Attacked frequently by Allied Air Forces, the Luftwaffe base was seized by Allied Ground Forces in September 1944 and was used as a Fighter and bomber base by the United States Army Air Forces until the end of the war. Closed after the war, the airfield was rebuilt in the 1950s as a NATO Dispersed Operating Base for United States Air Force units in France to disperse their forces to in case of a war with the Warsaw Pact. The base was home to the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing during the 60's and was abandoned by 1967. History Athies appears to have been an airport prior to World War II, most likely with some hangars, a terminal, control tower and grass runways. German use during World War II Seized by the Germans in June 1940 during the Battle of France, Athies was used as a Luftwaffe military airfield during the occupation. The Germans improved the facility by expanding the support area with numerous maintenance shops, hangars, and laying down two 1600m concrete all-weather runways, aligned 17/35 and 08/26. Numerous taxiways and dispersal aircraft parking areas were also constructed.

The airfield was initially used as a bomber base for night bomber operations by He 111s and Ju 88s, attacking targets in England until late 1943. With Luftwaffe bomber activities ending, Athies became a night interceptor base against Royal Air Force bombers flying over Occupied France on their way to targets in Germany. It appears that SG 4, a Fw 190F/G unit, was brought to Athies from the Eastern Front, where it was a dive-bomber unit. The airfield was attacked on several occasions by Eighth Air Force heavy bombers in 1943 and 1944. American use A-26 Invader of the 416th Bombardment Group at A-69 Laon/Athies Airfield, 1945 During the Liberation of France, the Luftwaffe abandoned the base airfield at the end of August, sending in demolition teams to blow up hangars, buildings, electrical generators, water treatment and other facilities. It was seized by Allied ground forces in early September, and turned over to the United States Army Air Forces. The IX Engineer Command 820th Engineer Aviation Battalion moved in about 7 September and began a quick rehabilitation of the base so it could be used by American aircraft.IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout It was declared operationally ready for combat units on 9 September, a few days after its capture from German forces, being designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"A-69 Laon/Athies Airfield\\". Although operationally usable, Athies was a wrecked base from the Allied air attacks and what was blown up by the Germans as they withdrew. The Americans made do with what could be repaired, and moved in what equipment was necessary to conduct combat operations. Many buildings of masonry construction had been made useless, their contents consisting of nothing but wreckage.IX Engineering Command Advanced Landing GroundsJohnson, David C.

With the war ended, Laon/Athies airfield was closed on 23 May 1945 and turned over to the French Air Ministry. Postwar use In French control after the war, the base sat abandoned for several years. There was much unexploded ordnance at the site which needed to be removed, as well as the wreckage of German and American aircraft. Many of the buildings at the base were destroyed by the war, and although some had been repaired by the American combat engineers, most were in ruins. Also, the French Air Force wanted nothing to do with a Nazi airfield on French soil. As a result, the Air Ministry leased the land, concrete runways, structures and all, out to farmers for agricultural use, sending in unexploded ordnance teams to remove the dangerous munitions. NATO use In 1950 when as a result of the Cold War threat of the Soviet Union, the air base at Laon-Athies was offered to the United States Air Force by the French Air Ministry as part of their NATO commitment to establish a modern Air Force Base at the site. The high cost of breaking the agricultural leases, and also the high costs of removing the concrete German runways and other facilities led to its rejection as a site for a full air base. However NATO faced several problems when attempting to solve the air power survival equation. Planning for a Warsaw Pact first strike survival in both conventional and nuclear wars had to be considered. The main air bases were built on small parcels of land with very limited dispersal space. It was decided to use Laon-Athies as an emergency \\"backup\\" airfield, consisting of a \\"bare bones\\" facility of a runway with minimal facilities intended for use by all NATO air forces to disperse their aircraft in case of war. Beginning about 1954, French demolition companies returned to Laon-Athies and began demolishing the German structures and removing the wreckage of the World War II air base. French Army Explosive demolition teams were brought in to safely remove unexploded ordnance remaining from the war and the site was prepared for construction. A modern all-weather concrete NATO jet runway was laid down aligned 02/20, with taxiways and dispersal areas for three fighter squadrons. The dispersals were designed in a circular marguerite system of hardstands which could be revetted later with earth for added aircraft protection. Typically the margueriete consisted of fifteen to eighteen hardstands, with each hardstand capable of parking one or two aircraft, allowing the planes to be spaced approximately 150 feet (50 m) apart. Each squadron was assigned to a separate hangar/hardstand complex. Other than the occasional touch-and-go landing of NATO (USAF) aircraft, Laon-Athies Air Base was never used. With the French withdrawal from the integrated military component of NATO in 1967, the base was abandoned.McAuliffe, Jerome J (2005): U.S. Air Force in France 1950-1967, Chapter 17, Dispersed Operating Bases Current Laon-Athies Air Base is to the east of the A26 autoroute, near the city of Laon, northeast of the D977 interchange. Today, the former airport and military air base is used for agriculture. The NATO runway, dispersals and taxiways remain in place, and although deteriorated after 40 years of abandonment, they are most likely usable for emergency aircraft landings. All three marguerites and their dispersal pads remain, some removed, but most in reasonable condition. The removal of the wartime base in the early 1950s was very complete. The only remaining features of Athies wartime past are the two German-built concrete runways, still largely intact. Also taxiways built by the Germans remain as single-track agricultural roads. It is suspected that many former wartime buildings and structures are in the wooded area to the southeast of the airfield, including the bomb dump, however that cannot be discerned from aerial photography due to the extensive tree canopy. Several wartime runways can be seen in the wooded area, probably leading to dispersals, revetments and other abandoned concrete structures.

Its stated goal is \\"to promote and protect the interests of the Sikh Diaspora\\", and \\"promote and advocate for\\" human rights. Tejinder Singh Sidhu currently serves as President of the organization. History The World Sikh Organization (WSO) was formed after an international gathering of Sikhs on July 28, 1984 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, NY which included several thousand people from the United States, Canada, Great Britain, and several countries in the far east. The organisation was formed with two branches, WSO-Canada and WSO-America, and headquarters in Ottawa and New York. In January 1985, a bilingual newspaper, the World Sikh News, was launched from Stockton, California in order to \\"project the voice of Sikhs across the world\\" and highlight \\"Sikh participation in America‚Äôs 'social and cultural life'\\". The World Sikh News was a supporter of the WSO but was not officially linked with the organization in any way and operated independently. The WSO has drawn widespread support and is involved in various community issues including the right to wear turbans, right to wear kirpans,Proceedings of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Afternoon session. July 13, 2005. Parliament of Canada. and Gurdwara management. WSO officials are chosen through a mix of elections and nominations and meetings are generally held in gurdwaras. Activities The World Sikh Organization has advocated increased religious freedoms. It helped Baltej Singh Dhillon to fight discrimination and wear a turban in his role as a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. It has also helped Sikhs in Canada in court cases involving the wearing of kirpans. In addition it has supported other groups in asserting their rights, including Orthodox Jewish men wearing the yarmulke, Muslim women wearing the niqab, and a Scottish high school student wearing a kilt to his graduation ceremony. WSO has been involved as an intervener in several prominent human rights cases at both the provincial level and at the Supreme Court of Canada, including Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem [2004] 2 S.C.R. 551 regarding the right of Jewish residents to build succah huts on their condominium balconies and Multani v. Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 256, 2006 SCC 6 in which the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the right of Sikh students to wear kirpans to school. During Justice John Major's Inquiry into the Air India bombing, the WSO applied for and was granted intervener status, and applied for leave to call witnesses who would testify about the role of Indian intelligence agents in the Sikh community in Canada and information the Government of India may have had about the bombing. In its final submissions to the Inquiry, the WSO expressed its disappointment with the proceedings, including suggestions that there was \\"inadequate protection of witnesses\\" from intimidation. Terry Milewski reported in a 2006 documentary for the CBC that a minority within Canada's Sikh community was gaining political influence even while publicly supporting terrorist acts in the struggle for an independent Sikh state. In response, the WSO sued the CBC for \\"defamation, slander and libel\\", alleging that Milewski linked it to terrorism and damaged the reputation of the WSO within the Sikh community. Canadian MP Ujjal Dosanjh and reporter Terry Milewski were also named in the suit for their alleged remarks in the 2007 documentary \\"Samosa Politics\\". The court case did not proceed to trial and in December 2015, the parties agreed to unconditionally end the proceedings. The World Sikh Organization of Canada (WSO) worked with Ammerdeep Singh and the Yellow Cab taxi company to reach a mutually acceptable resolution regarding the company‚Äôs dress code and his style of turban. On July 7th, Mr. Singh‚Äôs ID was frozen due to an alleged violation of Yellow Cab‚Äôs driver dress code. The issue in question was that of Mr. Singh‚Äôs choice of turban style. WSO worked with Yellow Cab to create a formal turban dress code policy for the company‚Äôs Sikh drivers. In October 2011, WSO helped Seneca College student Jaspreet Singh secure the right to freely wear his kirpan on campus, and worked with Seneca College in developing a policy document with respect to the kirpan as well as training materials for faculty, students and security. The Human Rights Law Network (HRLN) and the World Sikh Organization of Canada (WSO) announced the inauguration of the Khalra Centre for Human Rights Defenders in New Delhi during a conference held in collaboration with other human rights groups from across India on November 19th and 20th, 2011. The Centre has been established to serve as a legal resource for human rights defenders who find themselves in danger or who are attacked and also to undertake research into human rights issues. The foundation of the Centre was welcomed by the human rights defenders present and all attendees rose to pay their respects to the memory of S. Khalra. There are WSO chapters in every major Canadian city. WSO works with other interfaith and human rights organizations to promote awareness and education about human rights issues, in addition to providing education about the Sikh faith.

The captain of the flight subsequently died of his injuries on 7 October 2009. The first on scene was Brian Govindsamy, who is a local resident. He allegedly tried to rescue the crew by breaking down the plane door. It is, however, still not certain how many of the crew he managed to save. Flight The flight was a positioning flight (ferry flight) from Durban to Pietermaritzburg, carrying no passengers. The three crew members consisted of captain Allister Freeman, first officer Sonja Bierman, a flight attendant. The aircraft, a BAe Jetstream 41 with registration had only flown 50 hours since its last service. The aircraft had been diverted to Durban from Pietermaritzburg the previous evening due to bad weather. Crash At around 8:00 a.m. local time (06:00 UTC) on 24 September 2009, the flight departed Durban International Airport. Shortly after takeoff, the crew reported loss of engine power and smoke from the rear of the aircraft, and declared an emergency. Witnesses reported the aircraft flying at an unusually low altitude, and that the pilot was attempting to ditch the aircraft in vacant land surrounding Merebank Secondary School approximately from the threshold of Runway 24 at Durban International Airport. The school was closed due to the accident day being Heritage Day, a public holiday. The pilot ditched the aircraft on the sports field of the school, avoiding hitting nearby residential properties; the aircraft broke into three pieces on impact. Rescue Rescue workers arrived on the scene shortly after the crash and cut the three crew members out of the wreckage using hydraulic rescue tools. The captain was airlifted to St. Augustine's Hospital at 11:00 a.m. local time (09:00 UTC) in a critical condition; the critically injured first officer and seriously injured flight attendant were taken to other nearby hospitals. A street cleaner on the school's perimeter was struck by the plane and was taken to hospital. The captain died of his injuries on 7 October 2009. Investigation Investigators from the South African Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) were dispatched to the crash scene; the CAA conducted an on- site investigation to determine the possible cause of the crash. The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were retrieved and used in the investigation. British Aerospace, the manufacturer of the aircraft, dispatched a team of technical experts to assist in the investigation should they have been required by the CAA. On 9 October 2009, the CAA issued a press release requesting the public's assistance in finding a bearing cap from one of the engines. The cap, which possibly separated from the engine during takeoff, could not be found at the crash site or at the airport. On 23 December 2009, the CAA issued the following press release : \\"In the case of the FADN (Merebank) accident the initial cause appears to be that of an engine failure during take-off which finally resulted in an accident when the human factor involvement resulted in the wrong engine being shut down.

It regularly attracts the best non-professional players from around London for its concerts at St John's, Smith Square and other venues in London. Like many non-professional British orchestras it finances its concerts not only through ticket sales, charitable donations and corporate support, but through its playing members who pay subscription fees. History KSO has only had two principal conductors ‚Äî its founder, Leslie Head, and the current conductor, Russell Keable who has been with the orchestra since 1983. Under Leslie Head Head was a 33-year-old freelance horn player and part-time conductor when he first assembled Kensington Symphony Orchestra at Queen Alexandra House, next door to the Royal Albert Hall and across the road from the Royal College of Music in Kensington. Head‚Äôs original concept was that this would be a repertoire orchestra, one that provided conservatoire students with the opportunity to read through pieces they might not otherwise set eyes on before professional auditions. \\"When I was a student we had three hours of orchestra a week, the same amount that the college were doing in 1850‚Äîand look what had happened to music in those 100 years!\\" That first Saturday-morning session in May 1956 was spent tackling works including Brahms‚Äôs First Symphony and Strauss‚Äôs Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks, with some Schumann thrown in. It wasn‚Äôt long before the students decided they wanted to give a concert. A d√©but programme was scheduled for 5 December 1956; but KSO‚Äôs first appearance actually came a couple of weeks earlier, when Head was asked to put on a last-minute performance at Hove Town Hall in support of the Hungarian Relief Fund. The clarinet section for that first concert comprised Alan Hacker and Paul Harvey‚Äîboth familiar names to today‚Äôs clarinettists‚Äîand a young Royal Artillery bandsman called Harrison Birtwistle. In honour of the Hungarian cause, the programme included Bart√≥k‚Äôs Piano Concerto No. 3, written only ten years earlier. Even in that first concert, KSO‚Äôs predilection for the new, the unfamiliar and the downright difficult‚Äîwhat one of Head‚Äôs players would come to refer to as ‚Äòbacks-to-the-wall-again‚Äô music‚Äîwas shaping itself. Powered by Head‚Äôs hard work, and with its few expenses met by a postwar Labour government keen to support anything that might fall under the remit of further education, KSO flourished. Fundamentally, Head still saw it as a repertoire orchestra, something that was to continue for two decades and more. A typical schedule from 1978 has the orchestra rehearsing Brahms and Bart√≥k one week, Bliss and Strauss the next, Elgar the week after. Yet the concerts continued, and grew more and more ambitious. Prokofiev‚Äôs Alexander Nevsky received an early UK performance from KSO at the 1963 St Pancras Festival; several now-standard works including Bernstein‚Äôs Symphonic Dances from West Side Story, Mahler‚Äôs Das Klagende Lied and Puccini‚Äôs Messa di Gloria were introduced to UK audiences by KSO. As the orchestra for Opera Viva, another of Head‚Äôs brainchildren, KSO (in all but name‚Äîthe sponsoring Fulham council insisted they dropped the \\"Kensington\\") performed in well-received exhumations of early Wagner, Verdi and Donizetti operas with distinguished singers including Pauline Tinsley and the young John Tomlinson. Yet the boldest venture was perhaps KSO‚Äôs 1961 UK premiere of the vast, original 1901 version of Schoenberg‚Äôs Gurre-Lieder. The huge forces this required (eight of each woodwind instrument, for a start) put it way beyond the capacity and budget of most groups employing professionals. This, Head thought, was exactly where KSO should be coming in. Not everyone agreed. \\"I wrote to the Arts Council to ask for an extra ¬£100,\\" he remembers. ‚ÄúAnd they answered saying that I shouldn‚Äôt even be attempting a work like this, and that they had told the National Association of Music Societies not to give us anything either.‚Äù The performance went ahead regardless, and was a huge success. Under Russell Keable In the 1983-4 season, Head retired as KSO‚Äôs music director and handed over to Russell Keable. By this time the balance had shifted firmly towards amateur players. Changes in conservatoire curricula during the 1970s had meant that their students no longer needed KSO to bridge the gap. And so, the age range of the orchestra had begun to broaden, as had the geographical spread of its players, who came from all over London and, occasionally, beyond. The 30th anniversary concert in 1986 was celebrated with an all- British programme of Walton, Bax, Stanford and Wilfred Josephs in the Queen Elizabeth Hall. This marked KSO‚Äôs South Bank d√©but. ‚ÄúIt was,‚Äù says Keable, ‚Äúalso a milestone in terms of performance quality.‚Äù At around this time the orchestra began to give concerts in St John's, Smith Square. ‚ÄúIt was a really happy orchestra, and that was absolutely key in its development. If an orchestra is happy socialising it will play better,‚Äù said Keable. Today, St John‚Äôs Smith Square is KSO‚Äôs principal performing home. Around half of its six concerts each year are given there, with visits to the Cadogan Hall and the Queen Elizabeth Hall. The line-up varies very slightly from concert to concert, but the orchestra inspires considerable commitment. The four woodwind principals have around 100 years of service between them. Many are National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain alumni, people who chose not to turn professional as players, and many are employed in the music industry in other capacities. Anniversaries Kensington Symphony Orchestra celebrated its 50th anniversary on 18 October 2006 with a concert at London's Barbican with a programme including Prokofiev's cantata Alexander Nevsky and Rachmaninov's piano concerto no.2 with soloist Nikolai Demidenko. On 15 May 2017 the orchestra marked its 60th anniversary with a concert at the Barbican of the world premiere of Matthew Taylor's 4th symphony and Mahler's Symphony no.2 \\"Resurrection\\". Repertoire and programming New music The orchestra is more involved than ever in promoting new compositions. In 2004 KSO commissioned and premiered Hovercraft by Joby Talbot, which he then incorporated into the ballet Chroma by the Royal Ballet in 2007. Also in 2004, the orchestra together with the BBC Concert Orchestra premiered Errollyn Wallen‚Äôs Spirit Symphony ‚Äì Speed-Dating for Two Orchestras, conducted by Russell Keable and broadcast live on BBC Radio 3. That performance won the BBC 3 Listeners‚Äô Award in 2005. Works by John Woolrich, Peter Maxwell Davies, Robin Holloway and both Colin and David Matthews have also featured in recent years, often in their London or UK premi√®res. For composers, the chance to have their work rehearsed at proper length and performed with enthusiasm can be a welcome change from the professional norm. For the players, breaking new ground brings greater risks but commensurate rewards. \\"An amateur orchestra can be simply there for the indulgence of its members, or it can try to do things that professional orchestras either can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to,\\" says Keable. \\"It can try to make a difference.\\" Other contemporary composers performed in recent years by the orchestra include James McMillan, Anna Clyne, Joan Tower, John Adams, Joseph Phibbs, Brett Dean, Colin Matthews, Judith Weir, Se√°n Doherty, Charlotte Bray, Stephen Montague, Magnus Lindberg, Richard Ayres, HK Gruber and Thomas Ad√®s. Opera and oratorio In 1996, Korngold‚Äôs opera, Die tote Stadt, received its UK premiere, a concert performance by the Kensington Symphony Orchestra conducted by Russell Keable at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, with Ian Caley (Paul) and Christine Teare (Marie/Marietta), thirteen years before the first UK staged performance at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Head‚Äôs longstanding tradition of programming unusual or neglected works by British composers has been maintained‚Äîperhaps most obviously in the premiere recording of Sir Henry Walford Davies‚Äô once-famous cantata Everyman, made with the London Oriana Choir in 2004. That recording was Gramophone Magazine's Editor‚Äôs Choice in February 2005. In 2007, at Cadogan Hall, the Kensington Symphony Orchestra, once again under Russell Keable's baton, accompanied Myleene Klass, Alfie Boe, Natasha Marsh and Natalie Clein for EMI Classics, in a concert celebrating the 10th anniversary of the EMI Music Sound Foundation. Concert performances of Puccini's operas Tosca on 14 May 2012 and La boh√®me on 21 May 2018 took place at St John's Smith Square, the latter with Monica McGhee as Mim√≠, Nico Darmanin as Rodolfo, Hazel McBain as Musetta and Nicholas Morris as Marcello.

According to Encyclopedia Puerto Rico, in 1862, just one year after its start-up, the sugar cane production at the Central Mercedita was so excellent that its owner started buying out neighboring sugar mills, including La Laurel, La Fe, Destierro, Bronce, Mallorquinas, Barrancas, La Teresa, Union, Mattei, Margarita, Cintrona, and rented the Cayo Verde sugar mill. Hacienda Mercedita produced sugar from sugarcane and packaged it at its nearby Snow White Sugar Company on the spacious flatlands complex of Central Mercedita, founded in 1949. The land area increased from the original 300 acres to the area currently (February 2015) bounded in the east by the municipality of Juana Diaz, in the north by barrio Coto Laurel, in the west by hacienda Mercedita proper at what is currently Destileria Serralles, and in the south by the Caribbean Sea. The rum business In 1865, Juan Serrall√©s Colon experimented with rum production at the Hacienda, producing his first casks of rum.First casks of rum He perfected his rum formula and the rum business grew rapidly. By 1890, Hacienda Mercedita produced over of rum-making sugarcane.Rum-making acreage For some time the Serrall√©s operation produced various local rum brands, most of which were short-lived. Inspired by the success of other rum producers in the island, the family decided to launch a refined brand with the intention of exporting it elsewhere. In 1932, the Ron Don Q brand was born and became popular with locals who considered rival Bacardi either harsher in taste or a foreign brand, as it was made in Cuba. In the 1930s, with money pouring in, Juan Serralles built a spacious new home for his family in his estate in Ponce, today called the Serralles Castle. By 1953, the rum business had become highly successful and the Serrall√©s family built a new refinery incorporating modern equipment.New rum refinery By February 21, 1953, as the Hacienda was no longer a mostly residential facility, but had taken on more of an administrative role, its sugar cane corporation, Central Mercedita, Inc., was the center of most activity, purchasing sugarcane from local farmers and milling and processing it into cane sugar. Central Mercedita Inc. and its sister company, Puerto Rican Sugar Refinery, Inc., together engaged in Puerto Rico cane sugar production during this period.Wadelmiro Arroyo, Defendant, Appellant v. United States of America, Appellee. (256 F.2d 549, No. 5261). United States Court of Appeals First Circuit. Heard Feb. 7, 1958; Decided June 25, 1958. In the fall of 1971, these enterprises were doing business as Central Mercedita Co. and as Puerto Rico American Refinery, Inc.Puerto Rico American Refinery Inc. In the 1950s, both the sugar cane and rum business stabilized and the Hacienda ran two parallel operations, one producing, packaging, selling, and distributing cane sugar under the Snow White brand and the other producing, packaging, selling, and distributing rum under the Don Q label. For the rum side of the house, Serralles incorporated a new company, Destiler√≠a Serrall√©s Inc. Life within the Hacienda Originally designed as the residential quarters of its Serrall√©s owner and his family when it was built in 1861, the Hacienda took on a more industrial role in the following years, as the cane sugar business expanded rapidly, turning into the large Central Mercedita cane sugar factory.Residence By the late 1870s, shortly after the abolition of slavery, the owners offered free garden plots both within and outside the Hacienda at the plantation in exchange for dependent resident labor force.La Hacienda Azucarera: Su Crecimiento y Crisis en Puerto Rico (Siglo XIX)‚Äù by Andres Ramos Mattei.1981. pp. 96-97. Life in the Hacienda The Hacienda established a general store where laborers bought goods on credit from the planter. \\"Planters paid wages in tokens that could only be used to buy goods at its grocery and general stores, thus hoping to create a cycle of indebtedness that would bind workers to their estates.\\" The sugarcane plantation virtually became a company town, and eventually had its own rail line, workers' housing, transportation fleet, commissary, and private airport; which was later converted into a public commercial airport known as Ponce's Mercedita Airport. Demise Mercedita, Puerto Rico. In 1973, the government of Puerto Rico created the Corporacion Azucarera de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Sugar Corporation, also known as Sugar Corporation of Puerto Rico) in an attempt to save the sugar industry, which for the previous two decades had been decaying.The Rise and Decline of Puerto Rico's Sugar Industry, by Nydia R. Suarez. Sugar and Sweetener: S&O;/SSS-224 (December 1998) Economic Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture. Page 25.

This season was called \\"...the most amazing sweep of sport achievements ever credited to any single city\\" by the Windsor Daily Star. This sports season featured, among other things, the rise of Joe Louis in the professional boxing world, the Detroit Tigers winning their first World Series, the Detroit Lions winning their first NFL championship, and the Detroit Red Wings winning their first NHL championship. April 18 was designated Champions Day in Michigan by the state Governor Frank Fitzgerald, and then specifically for Detroit by the Detroit City Council.

Ads for the dinner indicated that \\"The banquet will honor all of Detroit's champions, including the Detroit Tigers, Red Wings, Olympics, Joe Louis, Detroit Lions and a score of individual titleholders.\\" The party was held at the Detroit Masonic Temple. Over 600 fans attended the paid event. Manila \\"Bud\\" Shaver, sports editor of the Detroit Times, emceed the event. The celebration was broadcast on the radio station WXYZ-AM in Detroit.

The major three sports teams were well represented at the party. The baseball season had just started and the Tigers were in the middle of a home series with April 18 an off day so many of the Tigers were able to appear. Also attending were a large number of Red Wings who were still in town having just completed their championship drive.

They referred to the events collectively as \\"Champions Week,\\" which overlaps the official holiday on April 18. The events were each held a different day: * April 12 - Chug-a-Lug Pub Run: a run through Detroit stopping at 5 different historic bars. * April 13 - Softball Scrimmage: a \\"friendly game of softball\\" held at what's left of Tiger Stadium, the long time home of the Detroit Tigers. * April 14 - Garden Bowl: a night of bowling and social mixing at the Garden Bowl * April 17 - Detroit Drunken Historical Society and Detroit Trivia Night: including a speech by author Charles Avison * April 19 - Tailgate of Champions in Campus Martius: tailgating prior to the Detroit Tigers baseball game 2015 Detroit Champions again planned and executed Champions Week in 2015.

Walter Ernest O'Neil Yeo (20 October 1890 ‚Äì December 1960) was an English sailor in the First World War, who is thought to have been one of the first people to benefit from advanced plastic surgery, namely a skin flap. Early life Yeo was born in Plymouth, Devon, to Petty Officer Francis Yeo and his wife Rhoda Sarah Yeo (n√©e Jarman). He had two elder sisters, Adelaide and Elsie. Three weeks after his birth, his father was killed aboard while en route to Sierra Leone, after hitting rocks off Cape Vilan, Spain. Three of the 150 people on board survived the shipwreck. His mother was later an alemaker at the Royal William Victualling Yard. Navy Yeo enlisted into the marine navy aged 12, serving as a bugler until 1911. He was promoted to leading seaman in 1912, becoming a petty officer in 1915 and a warrant officer in June 1917. Injuries Yeo was wounded on 31 May 1916, during the Battle of Jutland, while manning the guns aboard the battleship . He sustained terrible facial injuries, including the loss of upper and lower eyelids. There is some uncertainty as to where he was first admitted to hospital, due to the poor documentation. However, he is known to have been admitted to Plymouth Hospital while waiting for a place at Queen Mary's Hospital in Sidcup, Kent, which was granted on 8 August 1917. He was treated by Sir Harold Gillies, the first man to transfer skin from undamaged areas on the body. Gillies' notes on this case indicate that the main disfigurement was severe ectropion as well as waxy scar tissue of the forehead and nose. Gillies opened a specialist ward at Queen Mary's Hospital for the treatment of the facially-wounded. Walter Yeo is thought to have been one of the first patients to be treated with this newly developed technique; a form of skin transplantation called a 'tubed pedicle' flap. Aftermath During the long process of surgery, a 'mask' of skin was transplanted across Yeo's face and eyes, including new eyelids. The operation to replace the skin of the midface and forehead took place in multiple stages. The first stage was the outlining of the graft as well as placement of a stent to contour for the nasal dorsum on 12 November 1917. On post-operative day five, a serious infection was noted as well as complications with the stent requiring surgical intervention. On 30 November, the second stage of the surgery was performed which consisted of excision of the scar tissue of the face and transfer of the graft. Again, post-operative infection was a major complication. Gillies described the flap as \\"floating in pus at one point\\" which required extensive care to salvage most of the tissue. In January 1918, the pedicles were returned to the chest with the surgery deemed a success. Minor revisions were performed in the following months to improve the aesthetics of the graft.Gillies, H. D., & Fry, W. K. (1920). Injuries in the region of the eyes, including burns of the face. Plastic surgery of the face: based on selected cases of war injuries of the face, including burns (). London: H. Frowde. By July 1919, he was found to be fit for active service again and was recorded as having completed courses in September 1919. He underwent a further operation in August 1921, after which his disfigurement was recorded as 'improved, but still severe', and he was recommended for medical discharge, which took place on 15 December 1921. Walter later received further treatment for a corneal ulcer at the Royal Naval Hospital in Plymouth in 1938. Personal and later life Walter married Ada Edwards in 1914, and had two daughters with her: Lilian Evelyn Yeo, born 21 October 1914, and Doreen Y. Yeo, born in 1919. He died in his hometown, Plymouth, where he had spent the majority of his life, in 1960 at the age of seventy.

It is located in the southwest of Mexico City, in the historic neighborhood of San √Ångel in the borough of √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n. It is famous for its international cuisine, variety of dishes, Mexican-colonial architecture and interior decorations, and spacious gardens and fountains. In the old Hacienda Goicoechea, viceroys, their consorts, and the aristocracy would relax and take a break in New Spain's capital. Entrance to San √Ångel Inn  History  The construction of the Hacienda Goicochea (currently San √Ångel Inn) dates back to the 17th century (1692). It was initially built by the Carmelites, for the purpose of becoming a monastery, but official records show that the concession was granted by Carlos III to the Counts of Pinillas and the Marquis of Sierra Nevada.San Angel Inn History The hacienda was acquired by Ram√≥n Goicoechea in 1776, who integrated the property to his own hacienda. This is the origin of the Hacienda‚Äôs name. One of its other proprietors was don Francisco Manuel S√°nchez de Tagle (1782-1847) a poet and a politician, descendant of the Marquis of Altamira. At the end of the Viceroyal reign, he sympathized with the independence movement, and when Mexico became a Republic, he became a Senator. He was an excellent diplomat and kept good relations with the first Spanish ambassador in Mexico, √Ångel Calder√≥n de la Barca y Belgrano and his wife Fanny C√°lderon de la Barca, who wrote \\"Life in Mexico, During a Residence Of Two Years In That Country‚Äù (La Vida en M√©xico, Durante Una Residencia de Dos A√±os en este Pa√≠s) during her stay there.√Ålvaro Obreg√≥n: Ex- Hacienda Goicoechea Another novelist that wrote about the Hacienda Goicoechea was the celebrated poet Jos√© Zorrilla y Moral (Don Juan Tenorio‚Äôs author), who during his stay in Mexico City (1859) wrote in his book Recuerdos de mi Vida about the hacienda‚Äôs beautiful patios and its ‚Äúdozen orange trees that refreshed the atmosphere in a florentine marble fountain.‚Äù The same fountain described by Jos√© Zorrilla y Moral served as a place where Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata‚Äôs horses drank water, while waiting for their masters to finish dividing the country‚Äôs territory into North (Villa) and South (Zapata), during their triumphant arrival to the nation‚Äôs capital with the Conventionalist Army in 1914.Ex-Hacienda Goicoechea Later on, the old Hacienda Goicoechea became a pulque factory of approximately 400 hectares, and around 1906, it was acquired by the San Angel Land Co. that created a housing development called Altavista. The main building or house became a famous hotel and restaurant named San Angel Inn, operated by a French woman called Madame Roux. Many famous characters from that time visited the restaurant, its gardens, and its ballroom. In 1937, the National Institute for History and Arts (INHA) declared the property a Colonial monument. Between 1955 and 1966, the Universidad Iberoamericana gave art and architectural courses in the facility.

The OARnet network (known for a time as Third Frontier Network and later, OSCnet) is a dedicated, statewide, high-speed fiber-optic network that serves Ohio K-12 schools, college and university campuses, academic medical centers, public broadcasting stations and state and local/state government. OARnet is considered one of the most advanced statewide telecommunications networks dedicated to research, education and economic competitiveness in the nation. OARnet is connected in Cleveland and Cincinnati to Internet2, the United States' most advanced nationwide research and education network. OARnet also maintains direct connections to New York's NYSERNet, Michigan's Merit network, and OmniPoP in Chicago. OARnet offices are located on the West Campus of The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, United States. OARnet additionally serves as the delegated registrar for many third-level domains (both generic and locality- based) under .oh.us and some under .in.us and .ky.us.  History  A member- organization of the Ohio Technology Consortium, the technology and information division of the Ohio Board of Regents (now the Ohio Department of Higher Education), OARnet was created by the Ohio General Assembly in 1987 to provide Ohio researchers with network connectivity to the resources of the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC). It was recognized at the time that the network would serve a much broader audience, so when a network name was selected in early 1988, OARnet was chosen to emphasize the many uses of the network. The initial plan (1987) was to make use of a number of existing Bitnet and CCnet (regional DECnet network) connections to get started. Three network (compatible) protocols were used, NJE, DECnet, and TCP/IP. The first OARnet- funded line was installed between Case Western Reserve University and John Carroll University in June 1987. Many subsequent lines at 9.6 kbit/s, 56 kbit/s, and T1 (1.544 Mbit/s) were installed with the aid of an Ohio Department of Administrative Services contract with Litel Corp. Internet (then NSFnet) connections were obtained in the spring of 1988. The non-TCP/IP protocols were soon phased out, and a process of upgrading connections took place regularly. In 1991, it was decided that OARnet would accept commercial business, at appropriate rates, for Internet connection services. Thus OARnet became one of the first Internet service providers (ISPs) in Ohio. After commercial ISPs entered the business extensively, OARnet stopped seeking new commercial accounts. A very large increase in backbone capacity occurred (planning 2000-02, installation 2003-04) when it became possible to lease optical fiber lines themselves (\\"dark fiber\\"). A new network backbone of 1,850 miles was installed at much higher capacity, and the eTech Ohio Commission and the Ohio Department of Education joined in funding and using OARnet. The fiber-optic backbone was launched in November 2004. In 2006, OARnet provided one of the first networks for delivery of live TV via Internet Protocol, known today as IPTV. OARnet served as the backbone for Ohio News Network to transmit Miami Redhawks hockey. The team finished the 2008-2009 season at the Frozen Four with a 4-3 OT loss to Boston University in the championship. It was one of the first live sports transmission delivery over IPTV in the US. Another sharp jump in capacity occurred in 2012, when the State of Ohio funded an upgrade of the OARnet backbone to 100 Gigabits per second. Today, more than 1,500 miles of Ohio‚Äôs network backbone runs at an ultra-fast 100 Gbit/s, which was recognized by ComputerWorld in the Emerging Technology category of their 2013 Computerworld Honors Laureates program. In Nov. 2012, Case Western Reserve University became the first member institution to connect at 100 Gbit/s to the OARnet backbone.

Pevsner describes it as \\"A remarkably early case of acceptance of the classical idiom\\". Linstrum notes that is was built in 'an unusually sophisticated design'. History The house was built for John More (1655‚Äì1702). A coal mine on the estate was equipped in 1740 by John Calley, with an early Newcomen steam engine, only the fourth to be built. Calley, Newcomen's business partner, died at Austhorpe during maintenance work on the engine. The house was occupied by the Pallisers from 1762 to 1769, by John Atkinson in 1722 and by Joseph Fields in 1826 (to at least 1837). The Appleyard family lived in Austhorpe Hall for over 90 years, and moved out in 1936 to a new build in Austhorpe. It was in the possession of Chapman family from 1939 to . It was then sold for ¬£500,000. In 2004 local archaeologists excavated in its grounds and found apparent remains of a prehistoric round barrow and indications of Roman defences on the site.

It grew to six stores by the mid 1970s, before being sold to the operator of Times Square Stores in 1977. History  A Store Grows In Brooklyn  Martin's Fulton Street storefront with updated exterior, February 1947, Gottscho-Schleisner Collection (Library of Congress) The history of Martin's dates back to at least 1903. Digital Metro New York, Martin's Silver Dress Parade Sheet Music (1928) Hyman Zeitz (c. 1860-1930), who emigrated to the United States in 1882, opened a coat and suit department in an existing blouse shop called Martin's at the corner of Fulton and Bridge Street in Brooklyn, New York. He eventually bought out the owner. The business gradually expanded, and in 1924 moved next door into the seven-story Offerman Building. In 1930, Hyman Zeitz died, and his son Fred. J. Zeitz took over as president (a position he held for over 35 years). In 1947, a modernized entrance to the Offerman Building, designed by architect Morris Lapidus, was completed, replacing the \\"gimcracks of the victorian era\\" with modern \\"simplicity.\\"  Suburban Expansion  In the 1950s, Martin's began to expand and open additional locations in the New York suburbs. The first was a Garden City location in Nassau County, at Franklin and Ninth Street, which opened in April 1952. A Babylon store in Suffolk County opened in August 1956, in the Great South Bay Shopping Center, followed by a Huntington location (in the Big H Shopping Center) in August 1962. At and containing a 500-seat community room for civic meetings, the Huntington location was the largest branch store at the time, though still much smaller than the of the Brooklyn store. Martin's Babylon Store exterior, August 1956, Gottscho-Schleisner Collection (Library of Congress) In 1966, Hyman Zeitz' grandson Wilbur Levin took over as president of the chain, though Fred and brother Harry remained active in senior roles. In a profile of the store done that year by The New York Times, Martin's was described as an \\"oasis of calm, even understatement\\" in the \\"hubbub\\" of Fulton Street, located almost directly across the street from Abraham & Straus, and discount stores J.W. Mays and E. J. Korvette also nearby. The business was reported to have annual sales of $25 million, $15 million from the Fulton Street location. In 1968, the Times glowingly described the store: \\"(Fulton) street‚Äôs most prestigious unit, not only does more bridal business than any other store in the United States, but it is today one of the largest family-owned specialty stores in the country,\\" and \\"which many consider a Fifth Avenue outpost because of its emphasis on better price and high quality.\\" In August 1969, Martin's opened its fifth store in the Smith Haven Mall in the more eastern suburbs of Suffolk County, its first interior mall location.(\\"Martin's, a fashion specialty store chain, opened its fifth store yesterday in the new Smith Haven Mall\\")  Decline and Sale  In 1972, president Wilbur Levin left Martin's to move into the banking industry, and another Zeitz grandson, Robert Rosenthal, took the reins. At the time, Levin reported that the stores \\"were doing well\\" and that his career change could be made \\"without disrupting Martin's.\\" Although a sixth location was opened in the new Riverside Square Mall in Hackensack, New Jersey in early 1977,(Riverside Square was the location) profits for the still family-held company had steadily declined during the 1970s. In October 1977, with reported annual sales of $30 million, Martin's was sold for an undisclosed amount of cash to the Seedman Merchandising Group, operator of Times Square Stores. Rosenthal was announced to be continuing as president, but left the next year. In 1979, the Fulton Street store was closed as a result of the \\"long term unprofitability\\" of the location. Obliquely referencing the change in fortunes in the shopping district, it was reported that \\"the Martin's store in Brooklyn, which for many years had catered to the borough's affluent, 'was no longer related to the surrounding shopping area.'\\" (quoting George Seedman) After that pivotal event, within a few years, the remaining Martin's closed or changed names. The Offerman Building in Brooklyn was designated as a New York City Landmark in 2005.

Born of wealthy parents on Nevis, she was orphaned at a fairly young age, and married a doctor, Josiah Nisbet. The couple returned to England, but her new husband died there, and Frances returned to Nevis to live with her uncle, a prominent politician of the island. There she met Horatio Nelson, and married him in 1787. The couple moved to England, and Fanny established a household and cared for her husband's elderly father while he was at sea. She was by all accounts a devoted wife, but in time Horatio met Emma Hamilton while serving in the Mediterranean, and the two embarked in a highly public affair. Fanny became estranged from her husband, who refused all contact with her through to his death at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Despite this, Fanny remained devoted to his memory for the rest of her life. Family and early life Frances was born on the Caribbean island of Nevis in 1758, and was baptised Frances Herbert Woolward in St. George's Church in May 1761.http://www.thepeerage.com/p3129.htm#i31281 (with precise source ref to Burke's peerage) The Woolwards were members of the colonial elite: her mother, Mary Herbert, was one of three sisters of John Richardson Herbert, a descendant of the fourth Earl of Pembroke, and Mary and John's uncle had been President of the Council of Nevis until his death in 1768. Fanny's father, William Woolward, was a senior judge on Nevis, and a partner in the firm of Herbert, Morton and Woolward. The Woolwards lived in comfort, and Fanny herself owned a black slave named Cato. Fanny's mother died while Fanny was still a child, with her father succumbing to tetanus in February 1779, at the age of 53. Fanny inherited most of her father's possessions, but was forced to sell most of them to creditors. She raised a tablet to her parents' memory in the local church, and on 28 June 1779 married the 31-year-old physician Dr Josiah Nisbet. Josiah had connections with the political elite of the island, and was probably fairly wealthy. The couple moved to England and lived briefly in the close at Salisbury Cathedral. Josiah Nisbet became seriously ill shortly after arriving in England and died on 5 October 1781, leaving Fanny with their seventeen-month-old child Josiah, but with no other provision. Fanny raised a plaque in her dead husband's memory at the church in Stratford Sub Castle, near Salisbury, and spent some time in England acting as the guardian of the children of another Nevis planter, John Pinney. Pinney returned to England in 1783 and did not recognise his children, prompting Fanny to exclaim 'Good God! Don't you know them? They are your children!' Pinney's wife was so surprised that she set her headdress alight on a nearby candle. Return to Nevis Fanny and her infant son returned to Nevis and lived with her uncle, John Richardson Herbert, at his house Montpelier. Herbert was by now himself President of the Council of Nevis, and one of the frequent guests to his house was a young naval captain who was stationed off the island, Horatio Nelson. The widowed Fanny was described as being young and pretty, while her availability and position as likely to inherit a substantial portion of her uncle's estate made her an attractive match for Nelson. In addition to this she painted watercolours, embroidered, and spoke excellent French. Nelson's friend Prince William Henry wrote that she seemed \\"pretty and sensible\\", while William Hotham, then serving as a midshipman aboard , recorded that she was \\"pretty, attractive, and a general favourite.\\" Another midshipman reported that though she had \\"some beauty, and a freshness of countenance not common in that climate\\", her intellect was distinctly unremarkable. Miniature of Frances \\"Fanny\\" Nelson, watercolour on paper, painted in 1798 by Daniel Orme, the year of her husband's victory at the Nile Nelson made frequent visits to Nevis after meeting Fanny for the first time, and by June 1785 had decided to ask her to marry him. By August Nelson had proposed, and Fanny had accepted, but there was still the question of obtaining the blessing of the relatives, and of raising money. Fanny's uncle promised them money on his death but could give them little in the short term; Nelson's relations also could not provide material support in the immediate future. By early 1786, Nelson had been moved to Barbados, where he engaged in legal struggles with the prize courts and other distractions, though he wrote often to Fanny on Nevis. He was able to return to Nevis in early 1787 while touring the islands with Prince William Henry, and there he determined to marry Fanny. Marriage ceremony Nelson and Frances were married at the Montpelier Estate on the island of Nevis on 11 March 1787. The marriage was performed by the clerk and rector of the church of Saint John Figtree Parish, William Jones. A number of officers from Nelson's ship were present, as was Nelson's cousin, midshipman Maurice Suckling, while the ship's company sent a gift of a silver watch. Prince William Henry gave the bride away, and signed as a witness. Nelson pronounced himself entirely satisfied with his decision, drawing up a new will that made his new wife the sole beneficiary, and writing to his friend William Locker that he was 'morally certain she will continue to make me a happy man for the rest of my days'. Frances Nelson, 1st Viscountess Nelson, a portrait of the British school, c. 1800 The day after Nelson's marriage to Frances, Nelson's friend and colleague Thomas Pringle wryly remarked that the navy had lost its 'greatest ornament', so expressing his concern that a wife got in the way of a successful naval career. Prince William Henry wrote to Samuel Hood saying 'He is in for it now. I wish him well and happy, and that he may not repent the step he has taken.' Nelson returned to England in July at the completion of his West Indies service, with Frances following later. Settling in England The couple initially visited Horatio's relatives in Norfolk, before finally stopping at his old home in Burnham Thorpe to introduce Fanny to his father, the Reverend Edmund Nelson. The elderly Edmund was initially reluctant to meet his new daughter-in-law, but the two quickly became good friends, and Edmund moved out of the parsonage in late 1790 to give the couple space to establish a home. The couple lived happily together at this stage, though Horatio was frustrated by his failure to obtain employment in the navy, and by the discovery that he and Fanny could not conceive a child of their own. The outbreak of war with France in 1793 finally brought Nelson a ship to command, and he took his stepson Josiah Nisbet with him as a midshipman when he commissioned the 64-gun . Fanny stayed at home and cared for Horatio's ageing father, writing letters to her husband and son. She saw little of her family during the long periods that kept them at sea, and became ever closer with Edmund, taking trips with him to Somerset in the winter. She managed her husband's financial affairs while he was at sea, and kept up relations with the Nelsons in Norfolk. Her husband's achievements were a source of pride, but also worry to her. His actions at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1797 made him a popular hero, but terrified Fanny that he might be killed in some heroic act. She wrote him a letter begging him not to repeat such antics, and to leave them to captains, now that he had been promoted to rear-admiral. Instead he went on further expeditions, leading from the front, and lost most of his right arm at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife later in 1797. Horatio returned to Fanny a broken man, sick and in pain from the stump, and resolved to settle in England with his wife. Displaced by Lady Hamilton Fanny helped treat Horatio's wound, and on his recovering and returning to sea in 1798, she returned to the domestic life. The defeat of the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile brought her husband back into public attention. However, he had by now met Emma, Lady Hamilton, the wife of the British ambassador to Naples, Sir William Hamilton. Fanny and Horatio gradually became estranged as Horatio commenced an extramarital affair with Emma, who came to despise Fanny. In letters to Nelson's relatives, Lady Hamilton referred to Fanny as that 'vile Tom Tit', while Josiah Nisbet was called a 'squinting brat'. Lady Hamilton also declared that Horatio's father Reverend Edmund Nelson had been taken in by 'a very wicked, artful woman', who had conspired to turn him against his son. Meanwhile, Nelson grew increasingly cold and distant toward Fanny, while his trysts with Lady Hamilton became more and more the subject of gossip. As time passed, Nelson began to hate even being in the same room as his wife. Events came to a head around Christmas 1800, when, according to Nelson's solicitor, Fanny issued an ultimatum to her husband. Nelson replied: > I love you sincerely but I cannot forget my obligations to Lady Hamilton or > speak of her otherwise than with affection and admiration. The two never lived together again after this. Heartbroken, Fanny wrote letters begging her husband to end his relationship with Lady Hamilton and return to her. Nelson, however, returned them unopened. Fanny was taken in by Reverend Edmund Nelson, and she spent most of her time with him in Bath, while her husband's open cohabitation with Lady Hamilton scandalised polite society. Reverend Nelson remained especially horrified by the breakdown of his son's marriage, and wrote to Horatio on occasion to rebuke him, both for adultery and abandonment of his wife. After Trafalgar Fanny Nelson fell ill in 1805, the year of her husband's death at Trafalgar, but recovered. From then on she was in indifferent health. She moved to Paris for a time to live with her son, where her eldest grandchild, also named Fanny, recalled her good nature and her devotion to her husband's memory. She would often kiss a miniature of him, once telling the younger Fanny 'When you are older little Fan, you may know what it is to have a broken heart.' Fanny Nelson returned to England and settled at Exmouth. She died at Harley Street on 4 May 1831 and was buried beside her son in the churchyard of St Margaret and St Andrew, Littleham-cum-Exmouth, Devon.

She was the governess of the children of Louis XVI of France. She is known better as Madame de Gu√©m√©n√©, and was Lady of Clisson in her own right. Biography Victoire Armande Jos√®phe de Rohan was the second daughter of Charles de Rohan, Prince of Soubise. The Princes of Soubise were a cadet branch of the House of Rohan. Her mother was Princess Anna Teresa of Savoy, a daughter of Victor Amadeus, Prince of Carignano. Her mother was also a first cousin of Louis XV through an illegitimate line. She had an older half-sister, Charlotte de Rohan, who married in 1753 Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince de Cond√©. As the Princesse de Cond√©, Charlotte was a princesse du sang and far outranked her younger half-sister. As the House of Rohan claimed descent from the medieval Dukes of Brittany, its members were treated at court as princes √©trangers with the style of Highness. Marriage At the age of seventeen, Victoire married her cousin, Henri Louis de Rohan, Duke of Montbazon, who was fifteen at the time. He was a member of the senior branch of Rohan, the Princes of Gu√©m√©n√©. He was a nephew of the Cardinal de Rohan, who was disgraced in the infamous Affair of the Diamond Necklace. Henri Louis eventually became the Grand Chamberlain of France. The couple had five children. Upon the death of his father in 1788, the Duke inherited the title of Prince de Gu√©m√©n√©. Afterwards, Victoire was known at court as Madame de Gu√©m√©n√©. At the death of her father, her spouse became heir to the title Prince de Soubise. She and her family lived lavishly in Paris at the H√¥tel de Rohan-Gu√©m√©n√©, located on the famous Place des Vosges. Courtier In 1775, Marie Louise de Lorraine, Comtesse de Marsan resigned the post of governess to the royal children in favour of Victoire, who was her niece. From 1778 to 1782, Victoire was in charge of the household of Louis XVI's oldest child, Marie Th√©r√®se of France, known at court as Madame Royale. In this role, she was in charge of a staff of over one hundred courtiers and servants. Madame Royale. During her tenure as royal governess, she was in accordance with her position not allowed to leave court except with a written permission from the monarch, a permission she asked only to attend the parties of the Archbishop of Narbonne at Hautefontaine. She became an influential personal friend of Marie Antoinette, and was alleged to have had a bad influence upon her, mainly by introducing her to wasteful and expensive habits such as arranging illegal games with high stakes, particularly Pharaoh, which she introduced in her salon at Versailles, and the new English fashion of horse races, interests which made the Queen acquire huge debts.Joan Haslip (1991). Marie Antoinette. Stockholm: Norstedts F√∂rlag AB. She had a relationship with Augustin Gabriel de Franquetot de Coigny (1740‚Äì1817), the father of one of her charges, Aim√©e de Franquetot de Coigny, Duchesse de Fleury (1769‚Äì1820), muse of the poet Andr√© Ch√©nier. The Prince of Gu√©m√©n√©, meanwhile, had an affair with Victoire's close friend, Th√©r√®se-Lucy de Dillon, Comtesse de Dillon. Because of this, Abbot de Vermond reportedly reproached Marie Antoinette for keeping company with women of ill repute like Dillon and Gu√©m√©n√©.Hardy, B. C. (Blanche Christabel), The Princesse de Lamballe; a biography, 1908, Project Gutenberg In 1776, Emperor Joseph, during his stay in France, chastised his sister Marie Antoinette for attending the salon of the Princess, which he called a gambling den. She was described as intelligent and with an interest in spiritualism: \\"though endowed with considerable intellectual power, spent her time in pursuing the follies of spiritualism\\", and in possession of a large collection of famous jewels, which she seldom wore but regularly lent to others and were therefore frequently seen at formal occasions.Boigne, Louise-El√©onore- Charlotte-Ad√©laide d'Osmond, Memoirs of the Comtesse de Boigne (1781-1814), London, Heinemann, 1907 Later life In 1782, Victoire was forced to resign her post due to a scandal created by her husband's mounting debt of 33 million livres, a debt that eventually, in 1797, led to the sale of the H√¥tel de Rohan-Gu√©men√©. Marie Antoinette did secure a pension for Victoire for her service at court, but the couple was banned, and the friendship between the Queen and Victoire was discontinued. After the bankruptcy, which was viewed as a scandal, the couple was ostracized from society, and Victoire took residence in a palace provided by her father; she was regarded to bear the scandal with dignity. Victoire and her spouse lived to see the French Revolution in 1789, later fleeing to Austria. They eventually settled in Bohemia, living at Sychrov Castle, and it was here that the Rohan family remained for 125 years. Victoire died in Paris in September 1807 at the age of sixty-three.

Campanile, a restaurant owned by Peel and his former wife Nancy Silverton, won a James Beard Foundation Award in 2001. Peel specializes in California cuisine. Career In October 1975, Peel began as an apprentice under Wolfgang Puck at Ma Maison. In 1978, Peel did an estage stint in France at La Tour d'Argent, Potel et Chabot, and Moulin de Mougins. When Michael's opened in 1979 in Santa Monica, he became sous chef, first under Ken Frank and then under Jonathan Waxman. In 1980, Peel moved to Alice Waters' Chez Panisse to make pastries, then assumed the role of chef de cuisine at the original Spago in 1981. In 1989, Peel co-founded Los Angeles‚Äô Campanile restaurant with Nancy Silverton, his wife at that time. \\"The storied restaurant, with its distinctly American approach using top-quality farmers' market ingredients, helped set the tone for Los Angeles dining in the 1990s,\\" wrote Betty Hallock. For more than two decades Peel served as Executive Chef at Campanile, where food critic Jonathan Gold observed that \\"... Peel is still the most exacting grill chef in the country, a master who plays his smoldering logs the way that Pinchas Zukerman does a Stradivarius.\\" Campanile closed in 2012. To provide the breads they needed, Peel and Silverton also co-founded La Brea Bakery, which opened five months before Campanile restaurant launched. La Brea Bakery was sold in 2001 and is now a worldwide company. Peel's Tar Pit, a cocktail lounge, and Point, a deli, also closed in 2012. Peel has authored three cookbooks (two with ex- wife Nancy Silverton). His cookbook, New Classic Family Dinners, written with Martha Rose Shulman was selected as one of the Top Ten Cookbooks of 2009 by Amazon and one of the Top 25 Cookbooks of 2009 by Food & Wine magazine. Though Peel is known for his Mediterranean fare, the book is a collection of his favorite traditional American cuisine recipes. Mark Peel has appeared twice as a contestant on Top Chef Masters and twice as a judge Top Chef in 2009 and 2010, and appeared on several iterations of Hell's Kitchen, Knife Fight, and Kitchen Nightmares. On occasion, he joins programs on the Food Network, Hallmark Network and others to demonstrate food preparations. Chef Peel's most recent venture is Prawn Coastal, a casual broth-based seafood concept located in Grand Central Market in Los Angeles. Prawn Coastal was initially launched as Bomba in 2015, and was re-branded in 2017. The Los Angeles Times said, ‚ÄúFor more than 20 years, Campanile has played an important role in shaping the cuisine of Southern California and beyond, not just through its menu but also through the many graduates of its kitchen.‚Äù Several of his mentees went on to create restaurants of their own. In 2013, Peel was profiled in a New York Times article about the long term effects of being a chef. His long career as a chef has taken a significant physical toll. The article states ‚ÄúThose 41 years in the kitchen have brought him considerable fame: Campanile won the James Beard award as outstanding restaurant in the United States in 2001. They have also brought him carpal tunnel syndrome in both wrists and thoracic outlet syndrome in his shoulders, resulting from repetitive stirring, fine knife movements and heavy lifting.‚Äù  Philanthropy  While at Spago, Peel helped to organize the first three Food & Wine Festival fundraisers for St Vincent's Meals on Wheels and continues to be a consistent supporter of St. Vincent's efforts. During the Writer's Strike in late 2007 to early 2008, Peel created a ‚ÄúWriter‚Äôs Soup Kitchen‚Äù every Wednesday at Campanile to offer discounted meals to his customers who were affected by the strike. Mark Peel's community involvement also includes active fundraising for culinary scholarships, for schools in Los Angeles and for political campaigns. His service to the community has been recognized by the Los Angeles Police Department.  Awards and Honors  Campanile Restaurant and Peel have received numerous awards, including: * The \\"Los Angeles Culinary Master of the Year\\" *2012 Honored by the Los Angeles City Council for contributions to the LA food scene and charitable work. * 2005 California Restaurant Association, Chef of the Year * 2004 International Star Diamond Award for Outstanding Hospitality * 2001 The James Beard Foundation Outstanding Restaurant Award * 1997 DiRoNA, Distinguished Restaurant of North America * 1996 Nation's Restaurant News Fine Dining Award * 1995 Southern California Restaurant Writers, Restaurateur of the Year & Restaurant of the Year * 1990 Food & Wine Magazine, Best New Chefs  Personal life  From 1979 to 1982, Peel was married to the artist Reine River.

The book explores Mencius‚Äô views on the topics of moral and political philosophy, that are often posed as a dialogue to the ideas presented by Confucianism. The interviews and conversations are depicted as being either between Mencius and the various rulers of the Warring States period, or with his students and other contemporaries. The book documents Mencius‚Äô travel across the states, and his philosophical conversations and debates with those he meets on his journey. A number of scholars suggest that the text was not written by Mencius himself, but rather by his disciples. The text is believed to have been written during late-4th century BC. History Mencius‚Äô core ideas on education and human nature were largely shaped during the Warring States period (c. 770‚Äì221 B.C.). The period marks the transition of China‚Äôs system of slavery to that of feudalism, one that expanded the accessibility of culture and education to various sectors of society. It was during this time, that Mencius was able to access, and further developed the philosophical doctrines of Confucius. The creation of the Mencius, serves as a further elaboration on the Confucian school of thought called ‚Äòsubjective idealism‚Äô. Through this work, Mencius developed the theory of natural goodness (xingshan), that confers that all people have an intrinsic cardinal virtues, and that these virtues are developed in the same way that knowledge is cultivated. The Mencius came to be regarded as one of the most important texts that explores the philosophy of Confucianism. Mainly, due to its philosophical dialogue with the Analects of Confucius (Lunyu Ë´ñË™û). Despite this noted importance, the Mencius was not canonized as one of the Chinese Classics until over 1,000 years later during the Song-dynasty.  Interpretations  Various interpretations exist of the Mencius as a philosophical and literary text. Academics E. Bruce and A. Taeko Brooks state that these various interpretations belong to a continuous discourse that represents each new generation of readers. Examples are scholars such as James Legge, who opened the text to Western readers by comparatively exploring the Mencius through a Victorian missionary perspective. The text‚Äôs ability to transcend culture and time is seen by scholars such as Behuniak Jr. as what canonises the Mencius as a world classic. Contents There are seven chapters within the Mencius, each divided into two halves. The book‚Äôs narrative depicts its characters‚Äô extensive dialogues on specific philosophical arguments, alongside Mencius‚Äôs own reflections upon them in the form of short sentences. Most of the chapters that explores Mencius‚Äô moral philosophy, are structured in the form of a conversation between Mencius and other philosophical thinkers. While chapters that offer Mencius‚Äô political advice and counsel are depicted as conversations with various rulers and himself. The book explores Mencius‚Äô most famous idea, in that there exists an intrinsic human nature that is good. His argument that each person possessed an inborn potential of virtue, contrasts with the position of contemporary figure Yang Zhu, who argued that that human nature is motivated by self-interest. Alongside this, the Mencius largely expands on Confucian ideas of political ruling, and benevolent politics.  Moral Philosophy  In the Mencius, debates about morality and human nature are in direct dialogue with Confucian views. The theory of ‚Äònatural goodness‚Äô, where human beings are inherently good, are explored through a concept of ‚Äúsprouts‚Äù. According to Mencius, ‚Äúsprouts‚Äù are unlearned moral habits that are inborn and present at a person‚Äôs birth. These moral habits are related to one‚Äôs ‚Äúfamily affection‚Äù (qin Ë¶™), and like ‚Äúsprouts‚Äù, grow out within the environment of familial activities. There exists four virtues of morality that makes up one‚Äôs ‚Äúsprouts‚Äù (duan Á´Ø): # ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù (ren ‰ªÅ) # ‚Äúappropriateness‚Äù (yi Áæ©) # ‚Äúritual propriety‚Äù (li Á¶Æ) # ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù (zhi Êô∫) The four sprouts are what distinguish humans from other beings. However, there exists a distinction in that they are not what constructs humanity, but rather, something innate in which all humans already have. The Mencius states that these virtues develop in the acculturation of one‚Äôs environment, ‚Äújust as we have four limbs‚Äù (Mencius 2A:6). This environment being family affection, where the ‚Äúfour sprouts‚Äù activates amongst other unmonitored impulses. Mencius also thinks that there exists a common human nature that causes for people to respond the same way to certain ethical situations. One of the most famous arguments for this is presented within the Mencius in the chapter 1A:6, where Mencius successfully predicts an observer‚Äôs immediate reaction to seeing a child about to fall into a well. Mencius argues that all people have a biological or inborn compassion, and goes further to imply that this inborn compassion is also a universal duty. Mencius refers to the idea of a biological sense of compassion as a form of duty in: > ‚Äúour sense of duty pleases the heart just as meat pleases the tastebuds.‚Äù > (Mencius 4A:2) In other words, in doing compassionate things, we not only pleases ourselves biologically but also dutifully.  Political Philosophy  The Mencius expands on the Confucian claims about the necessary practices of a good ruler. This consists of ‚Äúvirtue politics‚Äù (de zheng Âæ∑Êîø), ‚Äúbenevolent politics‚Äù (ren zheng ‰ªÅÊîø), or ‚Äúpolitics that is sensitive to the suffering of others‚Äù (bu ren ren zhi zheng ‰∏çÂøç‰∫∫‰πãÊîø). These terms refers to the ideal way of governing politically, which is that a society must have policies that extends benevolently. These consists of fairness in goods distribution, and mainly policies that protect the most marginal societal members. Confucius, and in extension, Mencius contends that a good ruler must gain the devotion of the people through the exertion of benevolence and goodness. Mencius asserts Confucian ethics as the basis to achieving an ideal state. Within the Mencius, this is expressed in his encounter with King Xuan of Qi, who rules over the Central Kingdom without practicing ‚Äúbenevolent politics‚Äù. In this chapter, Mencius refers to the King‚Äôs action as: > ‚Äúlooking for fish by climbing a tree.‚Äù (yuan mu er qiu yu Á∑£Êú®Ê±ÇÈ≠ö) (Mencius > 2A:4) Other passages within the Mencius addresses benevolent politics more directly: > ‚ÄúAn Emperor cannot keep the Empire within the Four Seas unless he is > benevolent; a feudal lord cannot preserve the altars to the gods of earth > and grain unless he is benevolent; a Minister or a Counsellor cannot > preserve his ancestral temple unless he is benevolent; a junzi or a commoner > cannot preserve his four limbs unless he is benevolent. Now if one dislikes > death yet revel in cruelty, he is just like someone who drinks alcohol > beyond his capacity while he dislikes drunkenness.‚Äù (Mencius 4A:3) Mencius also counsels against the political use of violence and force: > ‚ÄúWhen one uses force to win people‚Äôs allegiance (yi li fu ren ‰ª•ÁêÜÊúç‰∫∫), one > does not win people‚Äôs heart and mind (xin fu ÂøÉÊúç); they submit to your force > because they are not strong enough.‚Äù (Mencius 4A: 7)  Influences on Hermeneutics  Asides from its influences on Neo- Confucianism. The Mencius has also had an effect on the field of literary discourse in China. Mainly, in the advancement of Chinese literary criticism into a direction that resembles the methods of Western intentionalist hermeneutics. These intentionalist concepts of interpretation (termed Mencian literary criticism), are seen as having dominated the methodology of literary criticism and interpretation in China ever since. The Western intentionalist position traditionally judges the meaning of a literary work by the intentions of the author at the moment of its conception. Jane Gearney notes, that there exists various passages within The Mencius that proposes a theory of literary interpretation that resembles this tradition. An example being: > ‚Äú. . . one who explains poetry should not let the form obstruct the phrases > or let the phrases obstruct the drift. One should meet the drift with one‚Äôs > own thoughts‚Äîthat‚Äôs how to obtain it.‚Äù (Mencius 5A:4) In her evaluation of this passage, Gearney notes that the ‚Äúdrift‚Äù being referred to here can be understood as the author‚Äôs intention. In this passage, Mencius poses that when it comes to evaluating a text, its form or structure should not come before the individual phrases. While the individual phrases should not obstruct the authorial intention (the drift) of the work, where the intention is met with the reader‚Äôs own thoughts to form meaning. Mencius also encourages a friendship-based approach to literary criticism: > ‚ÄúThe good scholars of a village befriend other good scholars of the village. > The good scholars of the world befriend other good scholars of the world. If > befriending the good scholars in the world isn‚Äôt enough, they also proceed > to consider the ancients. But how can they recite their poetry and read > their books without knowing what kind of people they are? Therefore, they > consider their age. This is ‚Äúproceeding to befriend‚Äù [the ancients].‚Äù > (Mencius 5B:8) The idea of knowing authors as people, is seen by Gearney as Mencius‚Äô suggestion for the reader to attempt to learn, as best they can, the author‚Äôs intention when they were creating the text. Mencius emphasises knowing the author as a person, to suggest the importance of the setting and temporal context of a literary work in one‚Äôs evaluation of it. Though Mencian literary criticism is seen as having fostered intentionalist hermeneutics in China. Gearney notes that the form of intentionalism within the book differs from the style of traditional Western intentionalist modes of criticism. This difference is mainly to do with Mencius‚Äô emphasis on learning the author‚Äôs contextual settings during the conception of the work, instead of the author‚Äôs own feelings during its‚Äô conception. Hence, the standard by which a work should be analysed does not involve the sentiments of the author at the exact moment of conception (as characterised by E.D Hirsh). But rather, Mencius‚Äô standards posits that one should become acquainted with the author‚Äôs personal, cultural, and political context, before evaluating the literary work.

Proponents of the amendment at ParentalRights.org contend that it will preserve the rights of children, arguing that the question is not one of the child rights versus parents' rights, but whether parents or the government can best decide what is in a child's best interest.\\"ParentalRights.org\\" Accessed September 2010. They contend that Section Three of their proposal will preserve the authority of the State to intercede for children who are abused or neglected, just as it exists today.\\"Parentsrights.us\\" Accessed October, 2010. Rep. Hoekstra has cited Antonin Scalia's dissenting opinion in Troxel v.

Article Six, Section Two of the Constitution incorporates treaties ratified by the Senate into U.S. law, requiring state and federal judges to uphold treaty obligations. Constitutional lawyer Michael Farris, author and chief proponent of the Amendment, expresses concern that ratifying the convention would disrupt state-level family law and shift power from the State to the federal government, leading to interference in the parent-child relationship.ParentsRights.us. FAQs. Farris and allied organizations also cite the theory of customary international law as a threat, claiming that elements of the Convention might become binding on the United States even without ratification.ParentalRights.org. \\"The Threat of Customary International Law.\\" Accessed October 2009. Opposition Tom Head of About.com contends that the proposal contains \\"numerous 'poison pills' that would prevent it from being supported by mainstream civil libertarians,\\" saying that its language is overbroad and would enable abuse and neglect by parents. He describes the amendment as unserious, meant more as a \\"rallying point\\" for \\"ultra- conservative legislators\\" than as a genuine amendment to the Constitution. Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) says that the amendment was crafted in response to the U.N.'s Convention on the Rights of the Child, but that the Convention is not a real threat to parental rights; therefore, an amendment is not necessary.Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) wrote to a constituent on July 22, 2009, \\"Frankly the (amendment) seems unnecessary, as the Convention does not threaten these rights.\\" Mary Landrieu (D-LA) points out that the Convention has not been ratified, and asserts that even if it is ratified, it will not infringe upon existing laws.Sen. Mary Landrieu wrote to a constituent on March 12, 2009, \\"The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child does not infringe upon any laws in the United States.\\" Opposition from homeschooling advocates Larry Kaseman of Home Education magazine argues that the Amendment's focus on rights rather than responsibilities will empower parents to treat their children as property and shelter unfit parents from punishment for neglect and abuse. Kaseman also holds that parental rights exist separately from federal law, and expresses concern that a constitutional amendment would federalize family law, granting the government the power to give, define, limit, regulate, and take away parental rights. He argues that the Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution already protects parental rights.Kaseman, Larry and Susan. \\"Taking Charge.\\", July, 2009.

He is best known for being the only Division I college basketball coach to go undefeated in his first season coaching. His 1923‚Äì24 Tar Heels team finished the season with a 26‚Äì0 record and was retroactively named the national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo- Porretta Power Poll. Background and family He was born Norman Westbrook Shepard, third son of Alexander Hurlbutt Shepard and Mary Augusta Westbrook. Shepard attended the University of North Carolina and after graduating played minor league baseball for a time. Before becoming a head coach, Shepard spent three years abroad in France during World War I in the United States army as an artilleryman. In 1928, he married Edith Ruckert, of Brooklyn, NY, in Peking, China. Norman's family had various ties to athletics at North Carolina. His brother, Bo Shepard, became the head coach for North Carolina after Norman, and two of his other brothers, Caryle Shepard and Alex Shepard, played basketball for North Carolina. Coach of North Carolina Tar Heels Shepard decided to accept the head coaching job for the Tar Heels while planning to attend law school on the side. When Shepard took over, the Tar Heels had been without a head coach for the previous two seasons. Even though the Tar Heels had been without a head coach for the previous seasons, they had managed to win the Southern Conference Tournament at the end of the 1921‚Äì22 season and tied for first in the Southern Conference during the 1922‚Äì23 season. When Shepard took over the team, he inherited a well-rounded Tar Heel squad that included returning senior Cartwright Carmichael, who was the first North Carolina All-American in any sport, and Jack Cobb, who would later be named to the All-American team and would later have his number retired at North Carolina. Shepard's North Carolina team earned the nickname the \\"White Phantoms\\" because of their fast playmaking and defense. The 1923‚Äì24 Tar Heels squad managed to win all 26 games they played that year. Because there was no national post-season tournament, the Tar Heels final game was in the Southern Conference tournament against the University of Alabama Crimson Tide. The Tar Heels managed to win the game 26‚Äì18. The local news reported that hundreds of students at North Carolina \\"waited in the streets in front of telegraph offices and cafes\\" for news about the game and after the victory students \\"went wild\\" and set a bonfire on the athletic field. In 1936, the Helms Athletic Foundation retroactively awarded a national championship to the team since there had been no organization to award national championships at the time. Currently Shepard holds the title of being the only head coach to go undefeated in his first year of coaching. Living abroad After coaching North Carolina for one season, Shepard went to the Far East to work as a sales manager for Liggett and Meyer tobacco company. While abroad, he played for and coached a basketball team in the Far Eastern Olympics. Shepard married his wife while in China and returned to the United States after being abroad for five years. Return to coaching After returning to the United States, Shepard took coaching jobs at Guilford College, Randolph College, Davidson College and finally Harvard University where he coached baseball, basketball and football. He retired from being the head coach in 1968.

Hillcrest was run by the Oregon Youth Authority (OYA), Oregon's juvenile corrections agency. It was closed on September 1, 2017, and all youth, staff, and programs were moved to MacLaren Youth Correctional Facility in Woodburn as part of a major project to consolidate the two facilities. Hillcrest was originally founded as the State Industrial School for Girls, following the 1891 establishment of a boys' reformatory school. It later became co-gender in the 1970s, and served males ages 12‚Äì25 who were violent or in need of substance abuse treatment. The facility had a budgeted capacity of 180 beds. Hillcrest also served as the location for statewide male intake and parole violator intake assessment for youth offenders. Robert S. Farrell High School was located on site. History The facility originally opened as the State Industrial School for Girls in 1914. It was the state's first reform school for girls. A boys' facility was opened 1891, and concern was expressed that there was a need for a similar institution for \\"erring daughters\\". The girls' facility opened in 1913 in the old Polytechnic Building on the grounds of the Oregon School for the Deaf while Hillcrest was being built. The school was renamed Hillcrest School for Girls, and later the Hillcrest School of Oregon. The facility became co-gender in the mid-1970s. Hillcrest became an all-male facility in 2008, when Oak Creek Youth Correctional Facility for female offenders was established in Albany. Oversight For part of its history, Hillcrest was managed by the Oregon State Board of Control. Hillcrest was operated by the Oregon Department of Corrections (DOC) from 1965‚Äì1971. When the Children's Services Division in the Department of Human Resources (now the Oregon Department of Human Services) was created, it took over oversight of the facility from the DOC. In 1995, a bill was introduced in the Oregon State Legislature that would establish an independent department, the Oregon Youth Authority, to administer Oregon's youth correctional facilities. The bill became law that same year and the Oregon Youth Authority became a division of the Oregon Department of Human Resources. In 1996, the Oregon Youth Authority became an independent department of the State of Oregon.

In the early part of the 20th century, it gave its name to a railroad station, a post office, and Public School 128 was known as Van Pelt Manor grammar school.Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898 (The History of New York City) by Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace The house purchased or raised by Aert Teunisse Van Pelt about 1670-1690 stood on modern-day 18th Avenue between 81st and 82nd Streets, east of the old village square and north of the pre-revolutionary Dutch Church of New Utrecht. Van Pelt Manor was an area in New Utrecht one of the Dutch towns in Brooklyn. Van Pelt Manor was originally owned by the descendants of Teunis Laenen van Pelt, an early Dutch settler. Some authors have written that Teunis Van Pelt was a \\"Patroon\\" who was granted manorial rights. Several other tracts of land in New York were designated as \\"manors', such as Pelham Manor and Livingston Manor. However, author Harold D. Eberlein states: \\"there never was a duly and legally constituted Van Pelt Manor and this appellation has no defense whatever on any historic grounds. In 1675, 1678 and 1680 considerable tracts of land were acquired by Teunis Van Pelt, the emigre, and added to what he already had previously. These additional holdings in New Utrecht, mentioned in Governor Dongan's Patent of 1686, may have created the impression that the Van Pelts, who were always a prominent family in the neighbourhood, were paving the way for the erection of their possessions to the legal and administrative status of a manor, but if they cherished any such intention it was never consummated.\\" Eberlein, Harold Donaldson. Manor Houses and Historic Homes of Long Island and Staten Island. Phila: Lippincott, 1928. Eight generations of the Van Pelt family lived at Van Pelt Manor. Some of the more noteworthy were Captain Petrus Van Pelt, who was elected to the New York Provincial Congress in 1776, Teunis Van Pelt Talmage, elected to the New York State Assembly, and John V.B. Van Pelt, the last elected Supervisor (mayor) of New Utrecht before it was annexed by the City of Brooklyn in 1894. Townsend Cortelyou Van Pelt, brother of Supervisor Van Pelt, deeded the Van Pelt Manor House and surrounding grounds to the City of New York for one dollar in 1910. The Manor House was torn down after a fire in 1952, but the grounds, known as Milestone Park, are administered by the New York City Department of Parks as a small recreation area. In the early 1950s the house which was unprotected was used by neighborhood children to play in. The fire was suspected to have started by children whom often built small fires to stay warm while playing in the structure. Sources *Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898. by Edwin G.

The player moves through a map of an enchanted forest, battling monsters using their own summoned monsters through a puzzle-game battle based on PopCap's Bejeweled Twist. In these battles, the player rotates groups of four in a grid of gems to line up three or more jewels of the same color; when enough lines have been created damage is dealt to the enemy. Between battles, a story is told through a series of cutscenes, while the player and the summoned monsters gain experience and power using role-playing elements. The initial idea for the game was inspired by Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords, a 2007 video game which members of both companies were playing at the time. The game was proposed to Square Enix half- jokingly by PopCap's chief creative officer Jason Kapalka during a meeting between the two companies in 2007, and was released on the Xbox Live Arcade and on the Steam platform for Windows PCs by Square Enix on November 18, 2009. Gyromancer received a generally positive reception from reviewers. Critics took issue with perceived limited graphics, some aspects of the music, and a weak and confusing plot. Despite these flaws, in general they found the game to be fun and addictive, and to have a great deal of replay value. Gameplay Example of gameplay during a battle; the player on the left is currently attacking the enemy on the right. Players assume the role of Rivel, an immortal summoner who ventures through the enchanted Aldemona Wood. He has been tasked to track down the rebel group Temperance, led by Quraist Kingsley, who have assassinated a member of the royal family. The forest at times magically seals itself, trapping visitors inside, and is rumored to hold a source of mystical power for which Quraist is searching. The game consists of twelve stages, which are large branching maps that allow the player to move from points represented by stars to adjacent points. Each stage contains its own objectives, from defeating beasts that block the player's way, to solving puzzles before time runs out. Additional stages are available for purchase as downloadable content. There are multiple optional objectives per stage, in addition to a main goal. Many areas of each stage are initially blocked off, and can only be entered by replaying the stage later in the game. While moving through the stages, the player encounters many monsters, and is forced to battle against them using one of their own monsters in a puzzle battle based on Bejeweled Twist. The creatures are \\"variations on fantasy archetypes\\" and include demons, giant spiders, giant frogs, and beasts inspired by Dungeons & Dragons. The player can only bring three creatures into a stage out of all of the ones that they have, and selects one of the three when a battle begins. A grid of different colored gems is displayed, and the player can select blocks of four jewels and rotate them clockwise. If a line of three or more identical gems is formed, the gems disappear, allowing all of the jewels above the now- vacant spaces in the grid to fall down a row to replace them. New gems appear at the top of the screen to fill any holes in the grid. If new lines of gems are formed from this movement, the process repeats. Whenever lines are formed, a gauge is filled slightly for the player; when it is full a special gem appears on the board. When that gem is formed into a line, damage is done to the enemy. The enemy also has a gauge, which is filled every time the player performs a rotation, and damage is dealt directly to the player when it is filled. Later in the game, non-rotatable gems can be found, and the player is punished for rotations that do not lead to a match by having the enemy's gauge fill faster. The amount of damage that the player can take or deliver is dependent on the monster used in battle, and using a beast in battle earns experience points which can increase the power of that summon. Each monster has a corresponding color, and matching gems that are the same color as the player's chosen monster or the enemy makes the player's gauge fill faster or theirs slower. Enemy monsters can change gems on the board to skulls, which cause damage to the player if they are not lined up within a certain number of moves. After being defeated in a battle, enemy monsters are added to the list of creatures that the player chooses from when they start a stage. New monsters can also be found hidden in the stages, along with items that can be used during battles. Development The game was first thought up in 2007 during a meeting between PopCap and Square Enix, which had published several of PopCap's games in Japan. Jason Kapalka, the co-founder and chief creative officer of PopCap, claims that he \\"half-jokingly\\" proposed a game collaboration between the two companies that would combine a role-playing game with Bejeweled-style gameplay, calling it ‚ÄúFinal Fantasy Bejeweled‚Äù. Kapalka was envisioning creating a similar game to Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords, a 2007 video game which members of the development staff of both companies were playing at the time. The idea attracted the attention of Yuichi Murasawa, designer of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, and the game began formal development. To differentiate the game from Puzzle Quest, the gameplay was based around Bejeweled Twist rather than Bejeweled, which Kopalka feels fit the art design of the game more. Other candidates considered were Zuma and Peggle, but they were dropped as the developers felt that they did not fit in with the combat theme. PopCap developed the early prototype for the game, then allowed Square Enix to complete the bulk of the work in designing and creating the game, especially in regards to the RPG aspects. Square Enix and PopCap announced the game on September 24, 2009. It was published by Square Enix on the Xbox Live Arcade and on the Steam platform for Windows PCs on November 18, 2009. A downloadable pack of maps and a pack of items were made available for sale a week after launch on November 23, 2009 for both versions of the game. The game was directed by Murasawa and produced by Yoshinori Kamei. The story was written by Kyoko Kitahara, who had previously worked on Final Fantasy Tactics Advance with Murasawa, and the art direction was led by Yuki Matsuzawa. The soundtrack was created by Tsuyoshi Sekito. Matsuzawa was asked to make the art style that of a \\"dark fantasy\\" and to focus more on making the visuals realistic rather than fantasy-oriented, so that it would appeal more to players outside Japan. Reception Gyromancer received a generally positive reception from reviewers. While many critics noted its similarity to Puzzle Quest, the gameplay was still described as being \\"fun and addictive\\" by Brett Todd of GameSpot, and similar praises were made by Daemon Hattfield of IGN and Eurogamer Oli Welsh. Welsh claimed that it had a great deal of replay value, and praised the \\"surprisingly varied story missions\\". Game Informers Matt Miller disagreed slightly, stating that while the game had some replay value, it was limited by the lack of depth to the RPG elements of the game. Although the paintings of the monsters and game world were rated highly by critics, the art direction itself was criticized. Todd called the graphics \\"murky and grainy\\" and noted the lack of animation in the battles or cutscenes, in which two-dimensional pictures of the characters speaking \\"slide back and forth like cardboard cutouts\\" rather than perform realistic movements. Welsh added that the stage maps were \\"crudely portrayed\\". Hattfield did not share those concerns, but did note say that they felt that the portraits of monsters were reused for different monsters too often. Miller disagreed completely with the other critics, saying that the game \\"looks great\\" and that \\"even the map screen between battles has a polished appearance\\". A reviewer from GameTrailers also enjoyed the aesthetic of the game, saying that despite the \\"still images\\" and \\"simple effects\\", the game made an \\"effort to look and sound the part\\" of a deeper game, which they felt would increase the player's enjoyment. The plot was similarly criticized, with Welsh calling it \\"endearing, largely unpronounceable rubbish\\", while Hattfield termed it \\"not Gyromancers strong point\\" and \\"a bit hard to follow\\". Miller dismissed it as \\"generic\\" and \\"lackluster\\", while the GameTrailers reviewer said that it was \\"somewhat thrown together\\". All the reviews, however, noted that the plot was largely irrelevant to the game next to the gameplay elements. Todd criticized the tutorial system as very inadequate, as well as the \\"beyond cheesy\\" music, a criticism that Hattfield left only to the \\"Japanese videogame metal during boss battles\\", rather than the rest of Sekito's \\"rousing orchestral tunes\\". Overall, however, the reviewers felt that Gyromancer was a fun, casual game.

With numerous additions and modifications throughout their history, they have been considered to be amongst the great fortification systems of the Middle Ages, as they were never breached by a hostile army during this time period. In 1979, the old city of Dubrovnik, which includes a substantial portion of the old walls of Dubrovnik, joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The oldest systems of fortifications around the town were likely wooden palisades. Today's intact city walls, constructed mainly during the 12th‚Äì17th centuries, mostly a double line, have long been a source of pride for Dubrovnik. The walls run an uninterrupted course of approximately in length, encircling most of the old city, and reach a maximum height of about . The bulk of the existing walls and fortifications were constructed during the 14th and 15th centuries, but were continually extended and strengthened up until the 17th century. This complex structure, amongst the largest and most complete in Europe, protected the freedom and safety of the \\"civilised\\" and \\"sophisticated\\" Republic of Ragusa that flourished in peace and prosperity for some five centuries.\\"..., protected the freedom and safety of a \\"civilised\\" and \\"sophisticated\\" republic that flourished in peace and prosperity for five centuries.\\" This sentence refers to the time of the Republic of Ragusa from 1358 to 1808. However, walls protected the city of Dubrovnik, before and after that particular time period. The walls were reinforced by three circular and 14 quadrangular towers, five bastions (bulwarks), two angular fortifications and the large St. John's Fortress. Land walls were additionally reinforced by one larger bastion and nine smaller semicircular ones, like the casemate Fort Bokar, the oldest preserved fort of that kind in Europe. The moat that ran around the outside section of the city walls, which were armed by more than 120 cannons, provided superb city defense capabilities. Former city walls The construction of the first limestone forts around the city began in the Early Middle Ages, towards the end of the 8th century. But, the \\"old chronicles\\" say that some sort of castle reliably existed on the Lave peninsula quite a long time prior to that. It is certain that the early town on Laus Island was also surrounded by defensive walls, probably mainly by wooden palisades. The fact that Dubrovnik managed to survive a fifteen-month-long invasion by the Saracens in the 9th century proves how well the city was fortified. The city first spread towards the uninhabited eastern part of the islet, which explains why the current name for the southeast part of the city, near St. John's Fortress, is called Pustijerna. The name \\"Pustijerna\\" comes from the Latin statement \\"post terra\\", which means \\"outside the town\\". In the 9th and 10th centuries, the defensive wall enclosed the eastern portion of the city. When the sea channel separating the city from mainland was filled with earth in the 11th century, the city merged with the settlement on land, and soon, a single wall was built around the area of the present-day city core. During this same time period, Dubrovnik and the surrounding area were described as a part of the Croatian (Grwasiah) entity, in one of the works by the famous Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi. In his book Nuzhat al-Mushataq fi ikhtiraq al-afaq (English: \\"Joy for those who wish to sail over the world\\") from 1154, he mentioned Dubrovnik as the southernmost city of \\"the country of Croatia and Dalmatia\\". The basic city plan dates from 1292, when the port was rebuilt following a fire. The whole city was entirely enclosed in the 13th century, except for the Dominican monastery, which came under its protection later on, during the 14th century. Modern-day city walls View of the city walls from the South. The present shape of the walls was defined in the 14th century. Land Walls protected with an additional range of slanted supporting walls, as defense against artillery fire. Fortified complex of the Pila Gates. Gate of Ploƒçe on the eastern side of the land walls, serve as the second major entrance to the city. Inner part of Ploƒçe gate Sea Walls are much smaller than the land walls, due to additional protection by the high seaside cliffs. Paskoje Miliƒçeviƒá, got its present-day look in the 15th century. View on Old town from Minƒçeta Tower, the city's most prominent point. The city walls have been preserved to the present day, not only because of the knowledge of the skilled construction workers and the constant care provided by city dwellers that maintained and rebuilt the structures as needed, but also because of the brilliantly reputed diplomacy in Ragusa, which managed on many occasions to avoid dangerous measures taken by enemies against the Republic of Ragusa. The view from the spot where you first come out on top of the walls of Dubrovnik The present shape of the walls was defined in the 14th century after the city gained its full independence from Venetian suzerainty, but the peak of its construction lasted from the beginning of the 15th century until the latter half of the 16th century. Being constructed very solidly, the walls were generally unaffected by a strong earthquake occurring in 1667. The largest stimulus for continued development and emergency repairs and works of the Ragusan fortresses came as a result of the danger of unexpected attack by Turkish military forces, especially after they conquered Constantinople in 1453. The city was also under latent danger of attack by the Venetians. For centuries the people of Dubrovnik were able to preserve their city-republic by skillful maneuvering between East and West. A strategic treaty with Turkey protected Ragusa's liberty and maintained the opportunity for a major trading role between the Ottoman Empire and Europe. The irregular parallelogram surrounding Dubrovnik consists of four strong fortresses at its most significant points. To the north is the strong circular Minƒçeta Tower, and to the east side of the city port is the Revelin Fortress. The western city entrance is protected by the strong and nicely-shaped Fort Bokar, and the strong, freestanding, St. Lawrence Fortress (also known as Lovrijenac), protects the western side of the city from possible land and sea assaults. The large and complex St. John Fortress is located on the southeast side of the city. Land Walls The main wall on the landside is to thick, and, at certain locations, the walls reach up to 25 meters (80 feet) in height. The land walls stretch from Fort Bokar in the west to the detached Revelin Fortress in the east. On the landside, the wall is protected with an additional range of slanted supporting walls as defense against artillery fire, especially against possible Ottoman attacks. Gates The town has four city gates: two that lead to the harbor and two (with drawbridges) that lead to the mainland. During the time period when the Austrian Empire controlled the city, two more gates were opened in the wall. Communication with the outside world on the land side was maintained with the city through two main well-protected city gates, one placed on the western side of the city and the other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding passageway, which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors. =Gate of Pile= The Pile Gates are a well-fortified complex with multiple doors, defended by Fort Bokar and the moat that ran around the outside section of the city walls. At the entrance gate to the Old Town, on the western side of the land walls, there is a stone bridge between two Gothic arches, which were designed by the esteemed architect Paskoje Miliƒçeviƒá in 1471. That bridge connects to another bridge, a wooden drawbridge which can be pulled up. During the republican era, the wooden drawbridge to the Pile Gate was hoisted each night with considerable pomp in a ceremony which delivered the city's keys to the Ragusan rector. Today, it spans a dry moat whose garden offers respite from crowds. Above the bridges, over the arch of town's principal gateway, there is a statue of city patron Saint Blaise (), with a model of the Renaissance city. After passing the Pile Gate's original Gothic inner gateway, it is possible to reach one of a three access points to the city walls. =Gate of Ploƒçe= On the eastern side of the land walls stands the second major entrance to the city, the Gate of Ploƒçe. This gate is protected by the freestanding Revelin Fortress, which are connected by a wooden drawbridge and a twin-spanned stone bridge spanning a protective ditch. The Outer Gate of Ploƒçe was designed and constructed by architect Mihajlo Hranjac in 1628, while the two bridges to the Revelin Fortress were built in the 15th century by Paskoje Miliƒçeviƒá. Miliƒçeviƒá was also designed the Pile Gate bridges, which explains the similarities between the bridges. Over the bridge, just like with the Gate of Pile, there is the statue of Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik. =Gate of Bu≈æa= The Gate of Bu≈æa (meaning \\"hole\\") is located on the northern side of the land walls. This gate is relatively new compared to the other gates, as it was constructed during the early 1900s. Sea Walls The main wall on the sea-facing side of Dubrovnik stretches from Fort Bokar in the west to St. John Fortress in the south, and to the Revelin Fortress on the land-side. These walls are 1.5 to 5 meters (5‚Äì16 feet) thick, depending on their location and its strategic importance. The purpose of these walls were to help defend the city from sea-based attacks, particularly from the Republic of Venice, which was often considered a threat to Dubrovnik's safety. City Harbour One of the oldest sectors of Dubrovnik was constructed around a Late Antique castle by the sea, which stretched landwards a bit more than it does today. It was constructed on the site of the Pre-Romanesque cathedral and the Rector's Palace, thus encircling the city's harbour. The harbour was designed and constructed by engineer Paskoje Miliƒçeviƒá in the late 15th century. Notably, the harbour was noticeably painted on the palm of St. Blaise in a triptych painted by the artist Nikola Bo≈æidareviƒá around 1500. The most prominent portion of the harbour is the three enormous arches (the fourth original arch was walled in) of a large arsenal built in the late 12th century and enlarged in the latter part 15th century. The harbour is also the oldest shipyard within the city and is still in use today. Porporela was built in 1873, next to St. John Fortress. The Kase jetty (Ka≈°e Breakwater) was built in 1485, according to the design of Paskoje Miliƒçeviƒá, in order to defend the harbour and protect it from south-eastern winds and waves. The breakwater thus shortened the harbour's bulky chain stretched in the night from the St. John Fortress to St. Luke's tower. It was constructed of huge stone blocks laid over wooden foundations without binder. Today, the arsenal hosts the City Caf√© and a movie theatre, whereas both the harbour and Porporela have become pleasant promenades and tourist attractions. Gates In the city port area, one of the most significant areas of the maritime trade city, there were two entrances: the Gate of Ponte (port) and the Fishmarket Gate. The entire layout of the Dubrovnik streets, as well as a range of expansions, was intended for fast and effective communication with the forts of the city walls. =Gate of Ponte= Constructed in 1476, the Gate of Ponte is situated westwards from the Great Arsenal. The city wall, built at the same period, leads from the Gate to St. John Fortress. The present-day street of Damjan Juda was formed in the 15th century when the sewage system was completed, and building houses against the western city wall was no longer allowed. =The Fishmarket Gate= The Fishmarket Gate, built in 1381, stands eastward from the Great Arsenal. The three arches of the 15th century Small Arsenal, where small boats were repaired, are situated a bit further. The old tower of St. Luke's protects the harbour in the east, and the harbour entrance is encircled and guarded by the Revelin Fortress. Forts The Minƒçeta Tower is a symbol of the \\"unconquerable\\" city of Dubrovnik. Fort Bokar is the key point in the defense of the Pila Gate. St. John Fortress prevented enemy ships from accessing the City Harbour. In 16th century Revelin Fortress became the strongest city fortress. The walls of St. Lawrence Fortress exposed to enemy fire are almost thick. Forts within walls The fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the Ottomans was a clear sign to the cautious citizens of Dubrovnik that ample defensive measures were quickly needed, the strengthening of its defensive structures the foremost of the issues. The fall of Bosnia, which followed soon in 1463, only hastened the works. As a result, the Republic invited the architect Michelozzo di Bartolomeo of Florence to direct the improvement of the city's defenses. His work in Dubrovnik resulted in the construction and expansion of numerous buildings of key importance for the defense of Dubrovnik. Minƒçeta Tower The Minƒçeta Tower was built by a local builder named Nicifor Ranjina and Italian engineers sent by Pope Pius II in 1463, at the height of the Turkish threat. Originally as a strong four- sided fort, it is the most prominent point in the defensive system towards the land. The tower's name derives from the name of the Menƒçetiƒá family, who owned the ground upon which the tower was built. By its height and impressive volume, the tower dominates the northwestern high part of the city and its walls. In the middle of the 15th century, around the earlier quadrilateral fort, Michelozzo built a new round tower using new warfare technique and joined it to the new system of low scarp walls. The full six-meter (20 feet) thick walls of the new tower had a series of protected gun ports. The architect and sculptor Giorgio da Sebenico of Zadar continued the work on the Minƒçeta tower. He designed and built the high narrow round tower while the battlements are a later addition. The tower was completed in 1464 and became the symbol of the unconquerable city of Dubrovnik.\\"...symbol of the unconquerable city of Dubrovnik.\\" Dubrovnik citizens surrendered to the French army in 1806 by permitting their entrance into the city. Although Dubrovnik was not conquered by France in war, two years later in 1808, Marshal Auguste de Marmont abolished the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamated its territory into the French Illyrian Provinces. After a long excavation, a 16th-century cannon foundry was discovered under Minƒçeta Tower in Gornji ugao (Upper Tower). It is now a museum. Since Minƒçeta Tower is the highest point of the wall, it is considered to offer a seemingly \\"unforgettable\\" view on the city. Fort Bokar The Fort Bokar, often called \\"Zvjezdan\\", is considered to be amongst the most beautiful instances of harmonious and functional fortification architecture. Built as a two-story casemate fortress by Michelozzo from 1461 to 1463, while the city walls were being reconstructed, it stands in front of the medieval wall face protruding into space almost with its whole cylindrical volume. It was conceived as the key point in the defense of the Pila Gate, the western fortified entrance of the city; and after the Minƒçeta Tower, it is the second key point in the defense of the western land approach to the city. St. John Fortress The St. John Fortress (), often called Mulo Tower, is a complex monumental building on the southeastern side of the old city port, controlling and protecting its entrance. The first fort was built in the mid 14th century, but it was modified on several occasions in the course of the 15th and 16th centuries, which can be seen in the triptych made by the painter Nikola Bo≈æidareviƒá in the Dominican monastery. The painting shows Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik. Dominant in the port ambiance, the St. John Fortress prevented access of pirates and other enemy ships. Always cautious at the first sign of danger, the inhabitants of Dubrovnik used to close the entry into the port with heavy chains stretched between the St. John Fortress and the Kase jetty, and they also used to wall up all the port entries to the Great Arsenal. Today, the fortress houses an aquarium on the ground floor, stocked with fish from various parts of the Adriatic Sea. On the upper floors there is an ethnographic and a maritime museum devoted to the Republic Maritime Period, the Age of Steam, the Second World War, and the section of techniques of sailing and navigation. Detached forts Revelin Fortress In the period of unmistakable Turkish danger and the fall of Bosnia under Turkish rule, a detached fortress providing additional protection to the land approach to the eastern Ploƒçe Gate was built to the east of the city in 1462. The name Revelin derives from rivelino (ravelin), a term in military architecture which refers to work built opposite the city gate in order to afford better protection from enemy attack. Danger of Venetian assault suddenly increased in the times of the First Holy League, and it was necessary to strengthen this vulnerable point of the city fortifications. The Senate hired Antonio Ferramolino, an experienced builder of fortresses in the service of the Spanish admiral Doria, a trusted friend of the Republic. In 1538 the Senate approved his drawings of the new, much stronger Revelin Fortress. It took 11 years to build it, and during that time all other construction work in the city had stopped in order to finish this fortress as soon as possible. The new Revelin became the strongest of the city fortresses, safeguarding the eastern land approach to the city. Shaped in the form of an irregular quadrilateral with one of its sides descending towards the sea, it is protected by a deep ditch on the other. One bridge crosses the protective ditch and connects it to the Ploƒçe Gate, while another bridge connects it to the eastern suburb. The construction work was executed so perfectly so that the devastating earthquake of 1667 did not damage Revelin. Divided into three large vaulted rooms in its interior, Revelin became the administrative center of the Republic. St. Lawrence Fortress St. Lawrence Fortress (), often called Dubrovnik's Gibraltar, is located outside the western city walls, above sea level.Dubrovnik Tim Emert. Retrieved 5 November 2009. The fortress has a quadrilateral court with mighty arches and, as its height is uneven, it has 3 terraces with powerful parapets with the broadest one looking south towards the sea. Lovrijenac was defended with 10 large cannons, the largest and most famous of which was called \\"Lizard\\" (). The walls exposed to enemy fire are almost 12 meters (39 feet) thick, but the large wall surface facing the city does not exceed 60 centimetres (2 feet). Two drawbridges lead to the fort, there being the inscription \\"Non Bene Pro Toto Libertas Venditur Auro\\" ‚Äì \\"Freedom is not to be sold for all the treasures in the world.\\" above the gate. To ensure loyalty, the troops in St. Lawrence Fortress were rotated every 30 days. And to ensure complete loyalty, they were given only 30 days of rations when they went into the fort. According to old scripts it was built in only three months. Today its interior is one of the most dignified stages in Europe, and a well-known place for William Shakespeare's Hamlet performances. Fortifications around Dubrovnik Walls of Ston are long. Fortifications around Dubrovnik were set up along Republic's borders. The Prevlaka Fortress from the 19th century was built as a part of the fortification system of Bay of Kotor. Walls of Ston The Walls of Ston are originally a series of defensive stone walls of more than long. Despite its small size, the well protected Republic of Ragusa decided to use Pelje≈°ac to build another line of defense. At Pelje≈°ac's narrowest point, just before joining the mainland, a wall from Ston to Mali Ston was built. Today's long wall that links these two small communities has the shape of a pentagon. It was completed in the 15th century along with other 40 towers and 5 fortresses. The \\"wall\\" meant protection to the precious salt pans that greatly contributed to Dubrovnik's wealth, which are still being worked today. Falcon Fortress The Falcon Fortress () was one of the largest and most important fortresses on the territory of the Republic of Ragusa, due to its position in the mountainous region near the Bosnian inland. It was built at the location of earlier Illyrian and later Roman fortifications, evident from the remains of ceramics and Roman bricks in its walls. In 1391, the Sankoviƒá brothers, at that time the rulers of Konavle, gave to the Republic of Rag full authority over the Falcon Fortress, while it came under republic's final possession only in 1423. Due to its strategic importance, the Republic of Ragusa constantly invested in the maintenance of the fortress, which contained a cistern, a powder storage, wine and food cellars, sentry-boxes, military barracks, and sanctuary buildings to accommodate refugees from nearby villages in the event of war. Imperial Fortress The Fortress is placed at the top of the mountain Srƒë, just above the city of Dubrovnik. It was built in 1806 by Marshal Marmont, called the Imperial, in honor of emperor Napoleon. The fortress was strategically important to defend the northern side of the city. Prevlaka Fortress This fortress is placed at Ponta O≈°tro, at the very end of Prevlaka peninsula. It was built in the mid-19th century, between 1856 and 1862, as part of the fortification system of the Bay of Kotor at the time of the Austrian Empire. By its monumentality and unique structure, it presents an exceptional example of military architecture of its time. Today, the fortress is out of use and badly damaged by various destructions during history. City walls during sieges Saracen corsairs in 867 laying siege to Dubrovnik (Madrid Skylitzes manuscript). Flag of the Republic of Ragusa with Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik. Old map of the Republic of Ragusa, dated from 1678. Marked damage on city map, from the shelling by the Yugoslav People's Army. Saracen siege in 866‚Äì867 In 866, a major Arab raid along Dalmatia struck Budva and Kotor, and then laid siege to Dubrovnik in 867. The city appealed to Byzantine Emperor Basil the Macedonian, who responded by sending over one hundred ships. Finally, the 866‚Äì867 Saracens' siege of Dubrovnik, which lasted fifteen months, was raised due to the intervention of Basil I, who sent a fleet under the command of Niketas Oryphas in relief of the city. After this successful intervention, the Byzantine navy sailed along the coast collecting promises of loyalty to the empire from the Dalmatian cities. The damage done by Saracens is not known, but the fact that Dubrovnik managed to survive a fifteen-month-long siege, proves how well the city was fortified. Venetian siege in 948 With the weakening of Byzantium, Venice began to see Ragusa as a rival who needed to be brought under her control, but the attempt to conquer the city in 948 failed. The citizens of the city attributed this to Saint Blaise, whom they adopted as the patron saint of the city. Nemanja's siege in 1185 After some territorial disputes, war broke out between Stefan Nemanja, Grand prince of Ra≈°ka, and the city of Dubrovnik, at that time under Norman suzerainty. In 1185, Nemanja attacked the city and laid siege to it, but a Ragusan counter-attack drove Nemanja's forces back. According to chronicles from Dubrovnik, which are accepted by most historians, the siege ultimately failed.However, there are some indications that the siege was severe and possibly resulted in a partial or integral penetration of Nemanja's forces into part of the city's area. How much help Dubrovnik received from the Normans while repelling the siege is also not known exactly. Venetian and Fourth Crusades siege in 1205 In 1205, the Republic of Venice invaded Dalmatia with the forces of the Fourth Crusade. Ragusa was forced to pay a tribute, eventually becoming a source of supplies for Venice, thus saving itself from being sacked like Zadar in the Siege of Zara, used as Venice's naval base in the southern Adriatic Sea. In the 14th century, after liberation from Venetian supremacy, extensive work was done on the walls to ensure the republic's liberty. Siege by Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça in 1451 In 1451, the very powerful Bosnian regional lord Herzeg Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça attacked Dubrovnik, and laid siege to the city. He had earlier been made a Ragusan nobleman and, consequently, the Ragusan government now proclaimed him a traitor. A reward of 15,000 ducats, a palace in Dubrovnik worth 2,000 ducats, and an annual income of 300 ducats was offered to anyone who would kill him, along with the promise of hereditary Ragusan nobility which also helped hold this promise to whoever did the deed. Stjepan was so scared by the threat that he finally raised the siege. Russian siege in 1806 By 1800, the Republic had a highly organized network of consulates and consular offices in more than eighty cities and ports around the world. In 1806, the Republic surrendered to the forces of the First French Empire to end a months-long siege by the Russian and Montenegrin fleet during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city. The French lifted the siege and Ragusa was saved. The French army, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, entered Dubrovnik in 1806. In 1808, Marshal Auguste de Marmont abolished the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamated its territory into the French Illyrian Provinces, himself becoming the \\"Duke of Ragusa\\" (Duc de Raguse). Anglo-Austrian siege in 1814 Austria declared war on France in August 1813 and by the Autumn the Royal Navy enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea. Working in conjunction with the Austrian armies now invading the Illyrian Provinces and Northern Italy Rear Admiral Thomas Fremantle's ships were able to rapidly transport British and Austrian troops from one point to another, forcing the surrender of the strategic ports one after another December.James, Vol. 6, p. 257 Captain William Hoste with his ship HMS Bacchante (38 guns) along with HMS Saracen an 18 gun brig, arrived at Ragusa already blockaded by Pro Austrian Croat forces led by Todor Milutinoviƒá. The British with the Austrians were able to take the Imperial fortress and positions on Lokrum island. By hauling cannon up to Srƒë hill they bombarded the city until the French General Joseph de Montrichard decided it was best to surrender. British and Croat troops entered the city via the Pile gates shutting the Ragusan rebels out. Yugoslav army siege in 1991‚Äì1992 The Siege of Dubrovnik () is a term marking the battle and siege of the city of Dubrovnik and the surrounding area in Croatia as part of the Croatian War of Independence. Dubrovnik was besieged and attacked by forces of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) in late 1991, with the major fighting ending in early 1992, and the Croatian counterattack finally lifting the siege and liberating the area in mid-1992. At the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the prosecution alleged that, \\"It was the objective of the Serb forces to detach this area from Croatia and to annex it to Montenegro.\\" In 1991, the American Institute of Architects condemned the bombardment of the city's buildings. The Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments, in conjunction with UNESCO, found that, of the 824 buildings in the Old Town, 563 (or 68.33 percent) had been hit by projectiles during the siege. Of these 563, nine buildings had been completely destroyed by one of several major fires that occurred during the siege. In 1993, the Institute for the Rehabilitation of Dubrovnik and UNESCO estimated the total cost for restoring public, private, and religious buildings, streets, squares, fountains, ramparts, gates, and bridges at $9,657,578. By the end of 1999, over $7,000,000 had been spent on restoration. It is a testament to the resilience of the ancient walls that more buildings in the old town were not destroyed during the bombardment; the ancient walls in fact were more effective at resisting modern weaponry than contemporary structures in the city's periphery.

The B5300 (known locally as the Coast Road) is a B road which runs for approximately twelve miles between the towns of Silloth and Maryport in the Allerdale borough of Cumbria, United Kingdom. From north to south, it passes through the villages of Blitterlees, Beckfoot, Mawbray, Dubmill, and Allonby. It runs through the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, passes close to the Salta Moss Site of Special Scientific Interest, Milefortlet 21, a Roman archaeological site, the salt pans, a remnant of the Solway plain's medieval saltmaking industry, and the village of Crosscanonby. It is an important route for carrying goods to and from Silloth docks and Maryport harbour. It is also the major road connecting smaller coastal settlements with Maryport and Silloth, from where other roads lead to Workington, Whitehaven, Wigton, and Carlisle. A short section of the road between Dubmill and Mawbray was closed in February 2019 due to coastal erosion, and reopened in June 2019. The route Silloth-on-Solway to Beckfoot The B5300's northern terminus is close to the town centre of Silloth-on-Solway. The cobblestone B5302 gives way to the paved B5300, which then crosses over the old railway bridge that once led to Silloth railway station before winding past the Crofts estate and Stanwix holiday park on its way out of Silloth. The short stretch of road after departing Silloth is the furthest away from the shoreline that the B5300 gets during its entire twelve miles, and after passing through the village of Blitterlees just outside Silloth, and coming within a hundred yards of the hamlet of Wolsty, it joins the coast. The B5300 heading through Blitterlees in Cumbria. The next settlement on the route is the hamlet of Beckfoot, about a mile and three-quarters from Blitterlees, and upon entering, the B5300 passes from the parish of Holme Low, where it has been since departing Silloth, into the parish of Holme St. Cuthbert. Bank Mill to Dubmill A mile south of Beckfoot is the side-road which leads to Newtown, and also to the Gincase, a farm park and tearoom. Immediately past the Newtown road comes Bank Mill Nurseries, which includes a garden, nature reserve, play area, and restaurant. The B5300 continues past Bank Mill, with sand dunes known locally as Mawbray Bank on the shore side, and agricultural land belonging to local farmers on the land side. The road then arrives at the western end of the village of Mawbray, and passes by a farm and several houses. There are two turnings here, one which leads away from the shore and into the village itself, and another unpaved road which leads to Mawbray Yard, a small collection of homes located very close to the beach. Near Mawbray Yard there is also a car park for visitors to the Solway coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which incorporates much of the road's route. Mawbray Bank, looking north. The B5300 is slightly to the right of the sand dunes. Shortly after passing Mawbray, the B5300 takes a more southerly turn at Dubmill Point. This marks the start of Allonby Bay, an inlet of the Solway Firth. There are two side roads within a couple of hundred yards of each other in the vicinity of Dubmill, the first leads to Salta, and ultimately on to Mawbray via Hailforth, and the second leads to Edderside. Also along this section of the road, a large concrete sea wall is present to prevent erosion and damage to the road or nearby farms. However, particularly heavy storms have damaged the sea defences in the past, and in 2014, Cumbria County Council launched a ¬£130,000 repair scheme. In the first half of 2015 major repair work has been carried out to the sea wall for several hundred yards north of Seacroft Farm. This section of the B5300 is also susceptible to closure during bad weather. The B5300 crosses over several small streams in this area, including Cross Beck and the Black Dub. Allonby to Milefortlet 21 Just under one mile from the Edderside road is the village of Allonby. Among the side-roads in the village are Moss Lane, which leads to Spring Lea leisure centre, and Wigton Road, which eventually leads out of Allonby to the village of Westnewton. The road also crosses over Allonby beck, before passing the village green and Twentyman's shop and ice cream parlour, which is popular both with locals and tourists, especially during the summer months. The Crosscanonby junction before the car park was destroyed in a storm in 2014. The village of Allonby can just be made out in the background.The B5300 continues south, following the shoreline of Allonby bay out of the village, past the side-road that leads to Hayton, and the caravan park at Blue Dial, and shortly passes by Milefortlet 21. These are the well-preserved remains of a Roman milefortlet, part of the coastal defences which extended beyond the western end of Hadrian's Wall. On the opposite side of the road from the milefortlet are the remains of medieval salt pans, which would have been used for salt production, once a major industry along the Solway coast. Crosscanonby to Ellen Grove Maryport Cemetery and chapel. The B5300 runs right past the cemetery gates.A quarter of a mile past Milefortlet 21 is another side-road, this time leading to the village of Crosscanonby. There was a car park opposite the turning, but it was claimed by the sea during a winter storm in early 2014. As Allonby bay turns, so does the road, and by the time it reaches Maryport golf club it is heading almost due west. A bend in the road as it cuts through the golf course, however, puts it back on a more southerly course as it enters the final mile toward its southern terminus. A quarter of a mile beyond the golf club is Maryport cemetery, on the outskirts of the town. Just outside the town of Maryport, approximately a quarter of a mile east of Netherhall School, is the B5300's southern terminus. Here, at Ellen Grove, it meets the A596, which heads west into Maryport, and east towards Crosby, and eventually Aspatria and Wigton. Incidents The B5300 has seen several accidents and crashes, including some fatalities. In 2005, 18-year-old Lloyd Marsh, of Beckfoot, was killed when the car he was driving collided with a taxi. In May 2014, Yvonne Elizabeth Hetherington-Tunstall, 48, a restaurant owner from Maryport, was killed in another accident on the road. Repairs to the B5300 at Dubmill after a severe storm in March 2008. As a result of some of these incidents, campaigners have been arguing for a reduction of the road's speed limit since at least 2004. The speed limit for most of the road (excepting where it passes through settlements) is currently 60 miles per hour, the highest limit for non-motorways in the United Kingdom. However, at times of bad weather, the speed limit can be reduced by Cumbria County Council. The road itself has been damaged on several occasions as a result of storms and inclement weather. In particularly vulnerable areas around Mawbray and Dubmill, a concrete sea wall has been constructed to minimise damage and prevent coastal erosion. However, the sea wall itself has been breached on several occasions, including in 2008. The sea wall is maintained annually, at a cost of ¬£10,000 to Allerdale Borough Council. In October 2018, the southern section of the B5300 was closed to all traffic for three weeks. Initially, the road was closed between Allonby and Crosscanonby, and after work on this stretch was completed, the section between Crosscanonby and Maryport was closed. Local businesses complained that the scale of the work did not require the closure of the road, suggesting that traffic controls should have been used instead, as the road closure was adversely affecting trade. From November to December 2018, a public consultation called the Cumbria Coastal Strategy was held to evaluate and manage the risks related to coastal flooding and erosion along the Cumbrian coastline. Concerns were raised about the proximity of the B5300 to the shoreline, especially in unprotected areas or where coastal defences had been damaged. The possibility of re-routing the road in future to protect it from coastal erosion and storm damage was raised. The B5300 closed between Dubmill and Mawbray in April 2019 In February 2019, a section of the road between Dubmill and Mawbray was closed \\"indefinitely\\" after an emergency inspection revealed significant coastal erosion of over two metres in a matter of weeks. The road was deemed to be \\"too close to the sea\\" by inspectors, and emergency funding totalling ¬£281,000 was allocated to shore up the road and prevent damage. A license was granted by the Marine Management Organisation to install new rock armour coastal defences. Sue Hayman, the MP for the constituency of Workington in which the B5300 road is located, called for an urgent meeting with DEFRA officials, believing that any further delay in installing the new coastal defences could leave the road irreparably damaged. The closure had a serious effect on local businesses and charities. Several licenses were required in order for work to be able to begin, including a European Protected Species License. This license was eventually granted by Natural England on the basis that an ecologist would be on-site for the duration of the work. Protecting the Site of Special Scientific Interest and the local natterjack toad population was behind the delay, and the license was finally granted on the 17th of April 2019. Work commenced on the 23rd of April, with the road expected to re-open in July 2019. The road re-opened on the 20th of June 2019, after a section of rock armour 120m long was installed. The closed section of the road was also resurfaced. After the road was re-opened, local MP Sue Hayman called for \\"urgent action\\" over the future of the road. A meeting between Hayman and the government was delayed, in part due to that year's Conservative Party leadership election. Parts of the route of the B5300 are designated as being in managed retreat, further confusing the road's future. Special events The Tour of Britain riders on the B5300 coast road at Dubmill, near Salta. In September 2015, stage three of the Tour of Britain ran along the entire length of the B5300 as part of its route from Cockermouth to Floors Castle. The road was closed in stages as police officers on motorcycles rode ahead of the peloton, closing off side roads and stopping traffic. Silloth-on-Solway in particular made a big fuss about welcoming the riders from the Tour. Public transportation Two Stagecoach Cumbria & North Lancashire buses at Carlisle bus station. Stagecoach Cumbria & North Lancashire run routes from Maryport and Silloth to Carlisle and other locations around Cumbria.The B5300 is served by a single bus route which runs the entire length of the road. The number 60, operated by Ellenvale without any government or local subsidies, runs from Silloth to Maryport as of April 2019, and had previously continued as far as Workington. There are five services each way from Monday to Friday, dropping to two on Saturdays. The route was not listed as among the bus services threatened by cuts made by Cumbria County Council. Connections are available in Maryport to buses heading south to Workington and north to Carlisle, and in Silloth to services to Carlisle via Abbeytown. The number 60 was temporarily only able to run between Allonby and Maryport in February 2019 due to the closure of the section of the road between Dubmill and Mawbray, but subsequently was able to resume its full route by taking a diversion. In addition to the public bus service, there are several school bus routes which run along all or part of the B5300, carrying pupils to Solway Community Technology College in Silloth, Netherhall School in Maryport, and Nelson Thomlinson School in Wigton. Approximately one mile from the southern terminus of the B5300 is Maryport railway station, on the Cumbrian Coast Line, where services run hourly between Carlisle and Whitehaven, with some trains going on to Barrow-in-Furness and Lancaster.

In 1941, he went 5-4 with a 4.36 Earned run average; the Mexican League at that time was dominated by Negro League and Cuban players and few Mexicans held down a regular roster spot. In 1942, Francisco fell to 7-9, 6.10 with 76 walks in 125 1/3 IP for the Algodoneros de Torre√≥n. During 1943, he had a 7-9, 4.11 record; it would be his last season pitching regularly in Mexico's top circuit. Returning to the amateur ranks, Alcaraz became a star in Mexico's leagues, winning awards. He went 3-0 for Mexico in the 1944 Amateur World Series to help them win a Silver Medal, better than a Cuban team with five future major leaguers in the rotation. Alcaraz led the Series in wins. Alcaraz resurfaced in 1949 as a pro, hitting .233 and slugging .308 for the Indios de Ciudad Ju√°rez.

The game is a direct sequel to White Knight Chronicles (2008). The game was released in Japan on July 8, 2010, in PAL regions in June 2011, and in North America on September 13, 2011. The game allows the player to transfer their character from White Knight Chronicles along with money, equipment and guild ranks. The game also contains a remastered version of the original White Knight Chronicles. Gameplay White Knight Chronicles II is similar to its predecessor White Knight Chronicles, a role-playing video game presented in a third-person perspective. However, some changes to improve gameplay in all aspects have been made, introducing battle system mechanics, combos, armor and weapons to make, enemies and dungeons. Georama The Georama system, an online mode that lets the player create their own town, is back with various changes. Now players can play with their friends online in quests of up to 6 characters. Story The games begins with a prologue in Faria, where the Farian general Scardigne is trying to get the Farian Princess Miu out of the city safely due to a civil war led by Ban Nanazel. They manage to escape the city but are pursued. The game then cuts to where Princess Cisna has summoned Leonard, Eldore and Yulie, she tells them that they need to go to Faria and speak with a mystic known as Father Yggdra. The group goes to Faria where they encounter Scardigne and Miu and save them from Ban Nanazel's forces. The group then learns that the now reborn Yshrenian Empire (formerly the Magi), headed by Grazel and High Priest Ledom (formerly Sarvain, the regent of Balandor following Cisna's kidnapping in the first game) from the previous game, supported Ban Nanazel. They travel back into the city and fight and defeat Ban Nanazel and save Father Yggdra who Ban Nanazel was attempting to destroy. Father Yggdra is revealed to be a sentient tree and the protector of the Moon Maiden, the final incorruptus from the war between Yshrenia and Athwani. For their reward, Father Yggdra gives them a book to go into the past, which they use to travel to the day the Magi attacked Balandor castle. They attempt to save the Archduke of Faria (Miu's grandfather) but fail. However, he gives them an insignia, which upon coming back they learn from Father Yggdra that they need to get three of. Knowing this they head to Greede. Once there, they learn that Greede's citizens are being poisoned by a purple mist. Once they find Caesar, their old friend and current ruler of Greede, they learn that a black dragon is causing the mist. They once again travel to the past where they learn they need a lance to defeat the dragon. Once they retrieve the lance and defeat the dragon, they learn that the desert town of Albana was taken over by Yshrenia. Leonard and co manage to oust the Yshrenians. As a reward, the Avatar is awarded with a mysterious stone. This stone technically allows the Avatar to become the sixth pact maker and bestow the ability to summon an incorruptus of their own which they're also able to modify to become equal to the other five. With Albana safe once again Leonard and party decide it's time to go against the now reborn Yshrenian army that has been residing on a volcanic island. Back at Balandor things have gotten worse as Grazel and Shapur, pactmaker of the Black Knight, in their knight forms alongside their army have begun attacking the city in hopes of weakening them. Leonard, knowing this and the fact he cannot use his knight for much longer without having part of himself damaged, still goes against them to a point as him to become unconscious. Yulie believes the help of the Moon Maiden hidden inside Father Yggdra will help but requires the Ark of the knight to become its pact maker. Searching through the tunnels she eventually finds it and becomes the soul of the last knight and appears before the battlefield in earnest using her bow to destroy all the enemy ships and damage the Sun King and Black Knight with help. Defeated, the team regroups and begins to set for the Redhorn Isle, location of the Yshrenian army. Knowing they cannot use their knights unless desperate for they must save their strength for Grazel and Shapur, they reside in the flying ship whilst the army of Balandor sails alongside the Windwalkers who pay their debt to the party from the previous game. On the ship Queen Cisna prepares all of Balandor for attack, although in battle a majority of the Balandor knights are destroyed, and it is by the help of Faria that they are able to turn the tides and begin winning the new war. Grazel sees this as a chance to test his new weapon, The Hand of God, a large island cannon powered by the volcano and magic combined. Aware of the destruction it can produce, Cisna asks Leonard and company to land on the island and destroy its power supply before they can make land to assist. After succeeding at this, Grazel traps the group with a large lava monster, Brimmflame, which once defeated begins to release the remaining volcanic substance upon the island forcing a retreat from both the new Yshrenian army and the Balandor/Faria alliance. Frustrated, Grazel with High Priest Ledom and Shapur appear in their true base of operations, Garmatha Fortress, a large floating castle that begins to head for Balandor with the plan of destroying it. However, this is halted thanks to the Demithor, the beast the Free City of Greede rides upon, which turns itself to frozen stone to pause the Garmatha. With this advantage Leonard and friends instantly head for the fortress. There, Ledom reveals himself to be a fellow time traveler similar to Eldore who plans to join the knights to bring forth his former Lord and Master, Emperor Madoras of Yshrenia, from the past to establish a new empire and finish off Queen Cisna who carries the spirit of Queen Mureas of the Athwan Empire. He also reveals that Leonard is Madoras's intended vessel while the presence of the five knights combined triggers the Final Awakening, triggering Leonard's transformation into Madoras. Without the knights, the party are forced to battle Madoras unaided until he is weakened, allowing Cisna to use her power to separate both Leonard and Madoras, causing the Emperor to disperse in the air. With Yshrenia defeated everyone returns to Balandor as the fortress begins to crumble under itself and into the ocean. Leonard, now unbound from the White Knight, places the Ark into storage. Although defeated, it is apparent Madoras survived the ordeal and resides in the rift readying himself to return in his own form without need of another's body. Development D3 Publisher confirmed that players would receive additional content that is exclusive to the U.S. This content ranged from a fully localized version of the Japanese game and many others. Reception White Knight Chronicles II received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Famitsu gave it a score of one eight, one nine and two eights, with the reviewers criticizing the story but praising the updated gameplay features. The game sold 107,655 on its first day in sales and 162,289 in the first week, which was below expectations, given first-week sales of the first game. GameTrailers said, \\"It's hard to overlook White Knight Chronicles flaws the second time around. The subtle improvements don't have a huge impact on the bottom line, and the game lacks the refinements expected of a sequel. If you're looking for an RPG that delivers both a lengthy single-player mode and comprehensive online component, there are far better choices available.\\" GameSpot praised the improvements to combat and the multiplayer, but criticized the single player. Game Informer said, \\"Where the game falls depressingly short is in Level-5 ignoring the many valid criticisms of the first game and churning out a cookie-cutter sequel that is even more of a rehash than the average yearly sports title or shooter franchise.\\" The A.V. Club gave the game an A‚àí, saying that \\"The rewards for engaging, learning, and conquering Chronicles II are many, especially for those who enjoy falling into the sticky trap of co-operative online role-playing games, where loot is hard- earned with time and skill.\\" 411Mania gave it a score of 7.5 out of 10, saying that \\"In the end, White Knight Chronicles II is hard to recommend. If you liked the first game, then the sequel's improvements might be enough to make it a must have. If you like JRPG's like me, then you will find some enjoyment. But here is the catch: if you want to play offline only, SKIP THIS GAME. The online is the best part about the game and the single-player feels like an afterthought, like something you need to do in order to make online more fun. Thumbs in the middle, but leaning down.\\" Digital Spy gave it a score of three stars out of five, saying that \\"The quests and upgrades feel poorly applied, meaning the game struggles to establish its true purpose and identity. Stripping away all the extra elements brings just a pretty standard JRPG that offers little really to get excited about.\\" References External links SCEI official website *Level-5 official website Category:2010 video games Category:Cooperative video games Category:D3 Publisher games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Level-5 (company) games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 3-only games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender Category:Darkness in fiction Category:White Knight Chronicles (video game series) Category:Japanese role-playing video games ","title":"White Knight Chronicles II"},{"id":"24460111","text":"John Thompson Brown (February 6, 1835 - May 6, 1864) was a Confederate States Army colonel and artillerist in the American Civil War.

On May 9, 1861, Brown was elected captain of the second company. A month later, on June 10, 1861, Brown's battery fought at the Battle of Big Bethel, Virginia. Brown became a major in September 1861 and a lieutenant colonel in the spring of 1862. Brown led the First Virginia Artillery as a battalion in the artillery reserve of the Army of Northern Virginia in the Seven Days Battles.Sibley, F. Ray , Junior, The Confederate Order of Battle, volume 1, The Army of Northern Virginia, Shippensburg, PA: White Mane, 1996. p. 19. Brown was promoted to the rank of colonel on June 2, 1862. He led the battalion at the Battle of Antietam and the Battle of Fredericksburg.Sibley, pp. 33, 39. In October 1862, Thompson was assigned to work with Brigadier General William N. Pendleton and Colonel, later Lieutenant General Stephen D. Lee to make recommendations for the reorganization of the army‚Äôs artillery. Pendleton recommended that Brown retain his battalion.Wise, pp. 338, 417. In 1863, at the Battle of Chancellorsville, Brown‚Äôs battalion served in the artillery brigade of Stonewall Jackson‚Äôs corps. Brown distinguished himself by protecting the Confederates involved in Jackson‚Äôs flanking movement from a probe by the federal III Corps.Wise, pp. 469-470. After the wounding of Colonel Stapleton Crutchfield, Brown became acting chief of artillery of Jackson‚Äôs corps.Wise, p. 494. During the reorganization of the army after the death of Jackson, Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell took charge of II Corps. Colonel Brown became the commander of the artillery reserve of the corps. The battalions of Captain Willis J. Dance, formerly Brown‚Äôs own, and Lieutenant Colonel William Nelson served under him. Dance's battalion played a part in the Second Battle of Winchester. Their guns reached the field at the Battle of Gettysburg but too late for the fighting on July 1. Dance‚Äôs guns were employed on Seminary Ridge and Nelson‚Äôs near Benner‚Äôs Hill on July 2 and 3. Brown is among those criticized for the failure to get ammunition trains to the front, reducing the number of guns available for the grand bombardment on July 3.Wise, pp. 665-666. Brown‚Äôs gunners helped cover the retreat of the army to the Potomac River, reaching Hagerstown, Maryland on July 7.Wise, pp. 696-697. They were assigned on the left of General Robert E. Lee's defensive position near Williamsport, Maryland as the army waited to cross the river.Wise, p. 701. Brown reported on the role of the corps' artillery in the campaign. Shortly after Gettysburg, Lee named his military secretary, Brigadier General Armistead L. Long, chief of artillery of II Corps. Despite being the senior artillerist of the corps, Brown is not found on record complaining about Long‚Äôs promotion. Others, however, thought Long was promoted because of his West Point education.Wise, pp. 713, 851. Brown returned to command of his battalion for the Bristoe Campaign and the Mine Run Campaign.Sibley, pp. 57, 62. Before the Overland Campaign began, Long divided his corps artillery into two divisions. Brown took command of one. It contained the battalions of Nelson, Lieutenant Colonel Robert A. Hardaway and Lieutenant Colonel Carter M. Braxton. On May 6, 1864, while seeking a position for the guns in his division, Colonel J. Thompson Brown was killed by a sharpshooter. Brigadier Generals Pendleton and Long praised their fallen lieutenant for his character and skill.Wise, pp. 769-770; Sibley, pp. 70, 289 n. 182. Notes References * Gordon, E. Clifford.

Despite being more issues \\"The Gauntlet\\" was solicited as leading up to the \\"Grim Hunt\\" story, and the two storylines are interconnected. Written by The Amazing Spider-Man architects (Mark Waid, Marc Guggenheim, Fred Van Lente and Joe Kelly), \\"The Gauntlet\\" is not a strict event or storyline; it is the branding that indicates the direction of Spider-Man's life. In effect it is an event similar to Dark Reign only focusing on Spider-Man and his circle. \\"Grim Hunt\\" directly follows \\"The Gauntlet\\" and acts as a sequel of sorts to \\"Kraven's Last Hunt\\". The storyline received generally positive reviews.  Premise  The story features many old Spider-Man villains: Sandman, Electro, Chameleon, Mysterio, Hammerhead, Lizard, Morbius, the Living Vampire and Rhino as well as appearances by Deadpool, Scorpion II, Vulture (Jimmy Natale), and Juggernaut.

Billy Connors is kidnapped by Ana Kravinoff after she left his foster mother for dead, and Ana abandons Billy when the Lizard arrives. Connors's personality fights with his reptilian will, but the Lizard drowns out Connors's and eats Billy while Ana and Alyosha watch on. Then the Lizard sheds his skin and becomes a new form. This form is smarter than any previous form of the Lizard and has the telepathic abilities to connect to the \\"lizard part\\" of the human brain. However, some of Connors's emotions were passed to this new Lizard, which causes him regret for what he has done.  Grim Hunt preludes  In Amazing Spider-Man: Grim Hunt: The Kraven Saga, a free one-shot, Spider-Man has a dream revealing the dark future that awaits him and his kin. In the Amazing Spider-Man: Origin of the Hunter one-shot Ana Kravinoff looks over some of her father's journals recounting the original Kraven's skirmishes with Spider-Man.  Grim Hunt  In The Amazing Spider-Man #634 Peter is approached at his apartment by a severely wounded Kaine. Then an explosion is heard outside and Peter sees Arachne fighting Ana and Alyosha Kravinoff, so he rushes to help her. After a battle with them, they go to Mattie Franklin's apartment where they find Ezekiel, a wall-crawling superhuman who had died prior to these events. Ezekiel starts to talk about a war between spiders and hunters. Mattie Franklin is killed by Sasha Kravinoff as a sacrifice that resurrects Vladimir Kravinoff as a large human-lion hybrid creature. Sasha says they will need the blood of Spider-Man to properly resurrect Sergei. In The Amazing Spider-Man #635 Spider-Man, Arachne, and Ezekiel go to search for Ara√±a who is the next target. They find her already under attack by the Kravinoffs and join the fight. However, they are defeated and Arachne and Ara√±a are captured. Kaine arrives late since the Kravinoffs already escaped and tells Spider-Man that he should run. Spider-Man and Ezekiel have a long discussion before they leave for the Kravinoff's base. Once there, Ezekiel reveals himself to be the Chameleon, and Spider-Man is defeated. In the presence of the Kravinoffs and Mysterio, Spider-Man is then put on a table where he is killed with a knife. With Spider-Man's death, Sergei Kravinoff steps out of his grave. In The Amazing Spider-Man #636 Kraven gets acquainted with his family after his awakening. Kraven states that Sasha restored him with corrupted blood, or the \\"unlife\\". They pull off the mask of the corpse of Spider-Man hung in their mantel and find out that it is Kaine in Spider-Man's costume. Peter finds a coffin with Kaine's corpse along with his black suit with a note from Kraven reading \\"Hunt Me\\". In The Amazing Spider-Man #637 Spider-Man puts his black suit on again and goes on to take revenge on the Kravinoff family. Madame Web is killed by Sasha, but before dying she transfers her powers to Arachne. Spider-Man defeats the Chameleon, Alyosha, and Vladimir. He then ambushes Sasha and violently tears part of Sasha's face off with his wall-climbing power for what happened to Mattie Franklin, Madame Web, and Kaine. While Spider-Man fights Kraven, Ara√±a fights both Sasha and Ana. Spider-Man defeats Kraven and is about to kill him with a spear when Kraven whispers \\"thank you\\" and Arachne begs Spider-Man not to kill Kraven. Arachne shows him a future where Spider-Man turned into an outcast killer because of killing Kraven. With Spider-Man silent, Kraven begs him to end his life as he believes that his life is linked to Spider-Man and that he cannot die by any other hand, and while he was dead, he was apparently in a better place. Due to the visions that Arachne received, Spider-Man reluctantly lets Kraven live and states that his return gave him a second chance and he should use it. Spider-Man idly suggests that Kraven should go and be a dentist or something. The Kravinoff family then disappear in a flash, leaving the spiders alone before they can hand them over to the authorities. Spider-Man, Ara√±a (now in Arachne's costume) and Arachne (no longer in costume, and now blind due to her gaining Madame Web's powers) bury Kaine and Cassandra in a potter's field. Arachne, now the new Madame Web, predicts that the Kravinoffs will be back, simultaneously assuring Spider-Man and Ara√±a that she is fine with the trade- off of her vision for Madame Web's powers. In the Savage Land, Kraven decides to hunt his own family where if they survive long enough, they could be called a Kravinoff. He breaks Sasha's neck for arguing back and euthanizes Vladimir due to respect for the dead. Alyosha then leaves, but Ana then makes a deal with Kraven: if she kills her brother, he will train her and create a stronger family. If not, he will forget about family. In the epilogue, Kaine crawls out of his grave, mutated into a more spider-like form ‚Äì including six extra eyes in a spider-like pattern ‚Äì now referred to as 'Tarantula', implied to be the result of Kraven's resurrection creating an imbalance.  Other versions   What If?  * An alternative possibility for the events of Grim Hunt begins with the decision of Spider-Man to kill Kraven as Kraven insisted. Spider-Man is conflicted and runs back into the arms of Mary Jane after killing Kraven. She is thrilled until she finds an issue of a newspaper that pegs Spider-Man as the murderer of Kraven. He says it was a mistake coming to her. After a heated exchange with Mary Jane at the bridge, he goes to his apartment as Peter Parker to find an intervention waiting for him, and drunkenly confesses to Spider-Man having murdered Norman Osborn in the Raft. After being refuted, he decides to discard his Spider-Man self and lives the life of Kraven. He has the Kravinoff family under his command.

Numerous court decisions upheld the 1894 statute over municipal regulations of all sorts, including those that attempted to limit the products that vendors could sell to printed materials and food. The legislation gained new meaning after World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War created a large pool of veterans unable to secure traditional employment as a result of their disability. In 1990, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division held that the 1894 law preempted a 1979 city ordinance banning street vendors from 30th to 61st Streets, between Second and Ninth Avenues, except on Sundays.Felicia R. Lee. December 20, 1990. \\"5th Avenue Merchants Want a Ban on Vendors\\". New York Times. In 1991, the legislation's effect was restricted in Midtown Manhattan, limiting the total number of vendors allowed, and placing some congested Avenues and sidewalks off limits. That legislation expired in 2003. Legislation has been introduced in the New York Senate to make impersonation of such a vendor a Class A misdemeanor.\\"Bill S1956: Provides that impersonation of a disabled veteran vendor is a class A misdemeanor\\".

Current practice Disabled veterans are required to abide by local licensing requirements for vendors, as provided in General Business Law ¬ß 35.People v. Sands, 15 Misc.3d 459, 829 N.Y.S.2d 887. However, time, place, and manner restrictions have been found to violate ¬ß 32. Kaswan v. Aponte, 160 A.D.2d 324, 553 N.Y.S.2d 407 [1st Dept. 1990].

On non-restricted streets, there is no limit to the number of disabled veteran street vendors that can operate in a given area. On restricted streets in Midtown Manhattan only one may operate; outside of Midtown, two. For example, some areas would otherwise be off limits to street vendors entirely because they would either be ticketed for being too far from the curb or obstructing a bus or taxi stop. Such is the case in the plaza outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art--\\"the most coveted location for selling a hot dog in New York\\", for which a company called New York One has paid the city $575,990/year since 2007 to operate two carts--where the city began to crack down on veteran vendors in August 2009. New York One was able to negotiate their rent down to $364,672 for 2007 due to the competition from veteran vendors, and later ended its contract early; the winner of the auction to succeed New York One was later evicted for non-payment. Some vendors have alleged that their competitors merely hire veterans to sit near their carts, a practice lawyers for the city say would not qualify under the law. Effect on First Amendment vendors Once a Blue or Yellow (not White) licensed disabled veteran street vendor is operating on an otherwise restricted street, vendors of First Amendment protected merchandise such as art and books can also operate on the street. Once the disabled veteran street vendors opens up, there is no limit to the number of First Amendment street vendors that can follow.Robert Lederman.

The arena is the home of the California Vulcans men and women's basketball and volleyball teams, as well as the host of graduation commencement. The Convocation Center is able to host other sporting events, concerts, and trade shows, featuring a removable hardwood surface. The building, covering over 142,000 sq. feet, is the largest indoor venue between Morgantown, West Virginia, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Cal U Convocation Center is also home to the \\"Rivers Bend Conference Center,\\" which features executive-level conferencing facilities. Also included in the venue are \\"smart\\" classrooms, configurable for large or small-group presentations, high-tech audio and visual systems, wireless Internet access, webcams, videoconferencing equipment, and interactive response systems. The building replaces the Vulcans previous basketball and volleyball arena, Hamer Hall, which opened its doors in 1965.  Construction and opening  thumb thumb The first Undergraduate Commencement ceremony in the Convocation Center was held on December 17, 2011. A ceremonial ground- breaking ceremony was held on August 5, 2009.\\"California University to break ground for convocation center\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, July 23, 2009. The convocation center was constructed across from Hamer Hall in the area which previously served as the Hamer Parking Lot. While the University is looking for a sponsor for naming rights, the building has been officially deemed the \\"California University Convocation Center.\\" Dr. Angelo Armenti, President of Cal U, stated in the groundbreaking ceremony that the center \\"will be a landmark building for our campus,‚Äùand ‚ÄúBesides meeting the University‚Äôs needs, it will serve as a cultural resource and contribute to the economic vitality of Southwestern Pennsylvania.‚Äù On August 3, 2010, a topping-off ceremony was held at the construction site to mark the placement of the final of the forty- six steel trusses on the building's frame. Construction of the building took approximately two years and three months to complete. Construction has forced the closure of multiple streets, lots, and intersections, including the Hamer Parking Lot, Hamer Way, the intersection of Hamer and Third Street, the Third Street entrance to the river parking lot, as well as a two-year-old recreational basketball court. The Convocation Center's location had created a parking quagmire on campus, as construction of a new parking garage located behind the Manderino Library did not open until Fall of 2010, leaving a full year of school without enough parking on campus. L. Robert Kimball & Associates served as the architects and engineers for the project, while General Contracting was under the direction of The Whiting-Turner Contracting Company of Hershey, PA. Wayne Crouse, Inc. served as the HVAC Contractor, while WG Tomko, Inc. also served as the Plumbing Contractor. In addition, California University contracted A-1 Electrical Service of Venetia, PA and Ryco, Inc., as Electrical and Fire Protection Contractors, respectively. The tight space the Convocation Center lies in between Hamer Hall, Gallagher Hall, and the railroad track forced construction equipment and staging areas to be moved behind the Morgan Learning Resource Center in the current \\"University Loop Road\\" area. The Convocation Center officially opened for basketball action on December 3, 2011, with both the men's and women's teams defeating Mansfield University. The women won the opening game 79-52, while the men defeated the Mounties 91-65 in the second game of the doubleheader.  Controversy  The project's large size had been questioned before construction began, including by a university consultant who recommended building the arena with 3,500 seats.Bill Schackner, \\"Size of California University of Pennsylvania arena raises questions\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 11, 2012. By April 2011 the university was reporting that construction costs on the center were $5.5 million over the original budget.Bill Schackner, \\"Why California University center will cost $5.5 million more\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 9, 2011. A \\"grand opening\\" concert by Kenny Rogers in April 2012 attracted only a half-capacity audience, leading to renewed questions about the scale and cost of the project. In May 2012, university president Angelo Armenti was fired by the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education Board of Governors; among the issues cited in reports of this action were concerns about the financing and financial impact of the convocation center.Taryn Luna, \\"CalU president Angelo Armenti fired\\", Pittsburgh Post- Gazette, May 17, 2012.Susan K.

They are thought to have been introduced to Lake Eacham in the Atherton Tablelands. Other common English names are: serrated snapping turtle or common sawshell turtle.Ryan, Michelle, General Editor.

Angus&Robertson.; (Reptiles) Description left The female is considerably larger than the male, with a carapace up to 28 cm long compared to the males which rarely get longer than about 18 cm. The carapace is roughly oval and broad at the rear. They are not usually aggressive, but can bite fiercely. They can also emit a strong smell. The shell has marginal serrations which are the reason for its common name. It retains some of these serrations throughout its life. \\"The head shield extends down the side of the head to just above the tympanum, and the top of the neck has prominent pointed tubercules (many of these with an apical sensory pit).\\" The carapace is mainly brown to dark brown, commonly with some dark blotches. The plastron (underside) is yellowish. The head is large with a projecting snout and a horny plate on the top. The neck can fold sideways. The feet are webbed and also clawed.

Reproduction and nesting Myuchelys latisternum reaches sexual maturity at an SCL of 125‚Äì135 mm in males and 182‚Äì189 mm in females. Courtship behaviors continue throughout the year but mating is observed during mid January. There is no indication of large congregates of nesting sites, but instead, they are seen in ones or twos at dispersed localities along the watercourse. Nest have been seen in soil as far as 100 m from the water. The females nest from September to December. They can have three to four clutches in one season of 9 to 20 eggs which hatch before winter in about 60 days, with the incubation period shortened in southern regions. The eggs are variably described as either \\"hard-shelled (34 √ó 22 mm)\\", or as small and \\"flexible-shelled\\".Hatchlings from central Queensland measured 30 x 29 mm SCL x carapace width, while hatchlings from northern New South Wales averaged 32.5 √ó 22.5 mm. Feeding habits The saw-shelled turtle is an opportunistic omnivore with a carnivorous preference. It feeds on fish, tadpoles, frogs, bivalves, crustaceans, snails, carrion, and aquatic and terrestrial insects. It is also one of the few native Australian animals successful in preying on the introduced and very poisonous cane toad (Rhinella marina) which is lethal to many freshwater turtles. Toads too large to swallow whole are first shredded with their front claws.. They also eat vegetation including fruits, leaves, filamentous algae, and water weed. Behaviour Like many other aquatic turtles, the saw-shelled turtle is able to obtain oxygen from water through skin, cloaca, and buccopharyngeal cavity, thus extending its ability to stay under water for prolonged periods.  Habitat and ecology  Myuchelys latisternum is most often located in headwaters or tributaries of larger rivers in creeks, waterholes, dams, and lakes. However they are a highly adaptable species and have been seen in a variety of landscapes such as savannah woodlands, tropical rainforest, farmland, and semi-urban environments. Can be observed on logs and rocks adjacent to their habitat for basking, it is unknown if this is for thermoregulatory purposes or not.

It is directed by Ken Ghosh and produced by Ronnie Screwvala under his banner, UTV Motion Pictures. The film was released on 15 January 2010 and failed to make a mark at the box-office.[2]. The film's working title was Yahoo and another title, Star, was also considered. Also, the film was shot halfway through with Jiah Khan as the heroine, but was later replaced by Genelia D'Souza. Plot Sameer Behl (Shahid Kapoor) comes to Mumbai with Bollywood dreams, struggles through the day as a courier boy, and keeps failing in auditions for advertisements. More stereotypes are stuffed in as he refuses to take help from his dad in Delhi, is thrown out from his rented flat by the landlord, and comes away with his calculative companion. One day, a movie director named Rajeev Sharma (Mohnish Behl) and Assistant director (Prince Rodde) sees Sameer dancing and calls him to his office. Soon, Sameer is signed as the male lead in his film, and his friend Tina (Genelia D'Souza) is selected as the choreographer on the same project. Homeless, Sameer sleeps in his car and works as a dance teacher in a school. Subsequently, Sameer loses his film and is disillusioned. Tina finds this out and asks him how he can spend his life like this. After some time, Tina tells him that she also quit the film and did not want to be the choreographer for that film because she saw him upset. Sameer realises the love Tina had for him. Tina encourages him to participate in a television talent-hunt show, the winner of which will win the same role that Sameer was to play. After some time, he agrees to participate in it. After filling up the contest form, he also says \\"I love you\\" to Tina. In his screen-test, Sameer dedicates his monologue to his mother. After his monologue, during the interview, he comes to know that his father's shop in Delhi has been demolished. He promises Tina that he will come back for her and leaves to meet his father, heart-broken about the whole thing. After watching Sameer's performance on TV, his father convinces him to go back to Mumbai and participate in the show. After coming back to the show, he is initially denied entry into the show for being late. However, he is given a chance to perform on the show after Sameer convinces the director. He wins the show and is later shown to be the hero of the movie \\"Chance Pe Dance\\" walking the Red Carpet a year later with Tina.

Katrina Kaif was rumoured to be Shahid‚Äôs co-star but the makers eventually chose Jiah Khan. She shot for the film but was asked to leave halfway through. Reportedly, she got over-friendly with Shahid Kapoor and was not doing her job well. She was replaced by Genelia D'Souza who shot her scenes in a whirlwind schedule. However, later Khan said that she was asked to leave because the director had a bad eye on her and Kapoor said that he got to know about the replacement when D'Souza came on the set for shooting. Kapoor further said that he has no hand in the replacement of Khan. Chance Pe Dance is loosely based on Shahid Kapoor and D'Souza's lives as it was mentioned on Tere Mere Beach Mein, a show hosted by Farah Khan, that they were both given a second chance in life.

A handful ‚Äî as few as 16 and as many as 24, depending on classification ‚Äî are known today and continue to thrive. Most are in older cities, where they may preserve architecturally significant buildings and hold special collections of rare books, prints, maps, photographs, and manuscripts of interest to scholars. Founding In April 1991, a support group for membership libraries was formed in New York, hosted by the Mercantile Library and its director, Harold Augenbraum. The twelve libraries in attendance chose the name Membership Libraries Group. It was decided that the Membership Libraries Group (MLG) would meet annually in the fall, at a different member institution each year. Attendees at the meetings would exchange ideas and discuss issues especially pertinent to membership libraries. The twelve institutions in attendance, and their respective directors, were declared the Founding Members of the MLG.

The river was a few kilometres in length, flowing from Lake √úlemiste into the Tallinn Bay. H√§rjapea was one of the most exploited rivers in Estonia in the Middle Ages. First, watermills were constructed in the 13th century. A map from the end of the 17th century depicts 8 mills on the river, some of which later became the basis for larger industries. Due to the growth of industry in the 19th century, the river became increasingly polluted and was already then partly covered. In 1923 it was covered with planks and in 1938 the construction of an underground sewage pipe was completed in place of the river, which was around 4.5 km in length at the time. Nowadays the course of the river is recognizable in some places, otherwise little else remains of it. The underground sewage channel is still operational.

It is the first episode from Season 4, the 66th overall, and the first of a two-part, two-hour episode. It is also the first episode to air on its new night, Friday, after spending three seasons on Thursday nights, and the second episode in the series to start its season opener with an episode title that was inspired by a movie of the same name. Plot The story begins with a fantasy sequence in which we see Betty taking off her braces, but in reality it was just a dream as Betty tells Hilda and Ignacio that they will be taken off in a few months. Hilda also gets a photo op for Betty and Justin to mark their move up in the world. As Betty begins her day as features editor, she tries to adjust to not being an assistant but this is not working out as she meets her new office-mate, Megan (pronounced, MEE-gan) who gave her back-handed compliments. And during a meeting, Betty is ignored by Matt, who, as her new boss, hands over Betty's assignment to Megan. Betty also gets ignored by Marc. She discovers that Amanda is taking stuff from the Closet and though she is warm to Betty, she confesses that she has to pretend that they are not friends anymore, as a favor to Mark. This makes her miss he best -friend Christina even more. While she visits the sauna, she runs into Wilhelmina, who gives her a little advice: If she is going to move up, then it's time to change. Unfortunately, Betty tries to win over everyone at work with muffins, but no one will accept them. After a pep talk from Claire while looking at Daniel's office, Betty catches up with Matt to see if he still has feelings for her, because it might have been the reason he took the job as Betty's boss. She then kisses him but Matt pushes her away and runs off. After that event, Betty gets a call from Daniel, who was being held face down at the airport as it turns out that he assaulted someone upon arrival. After she bails him out, Betty provides comfort to Daniel, who admits that he is still angry over Molly's death, while Betty confides her challenges at Mode. Daniel tells Betty about how people felt about her at work and even has a daily blog that criticizes her. This has Betty really upset that for the past three years that everyone has made jokes and comments about her. Daniel also helps Betty by giving her information that can help Megan's assignment. Betty then goes to see the insect jewelry designer that Daniel tipped her off about. There she witnesses the amazing transformation of a butterfly from a caterpillar, a metaphor for her own change. But as she gives the idea to Megan, Megan accuses Betty of trying to steal it at first, but Betty eventually earns Megan's respect and the two seem to become friends. Betty also had a conversation with Matt, which thawed his coldness. Betty believes that things start to become better now that she is getting more allies. However, as Daniel returns to work, he lays down the law at the meeting by informing Matt that as long as he is editor-in-chief, he has the power to make changes, so he reassigns the project back to Betty. This did not set well with Matt, Megan, or any of the co-workers, making Betty a marked features editor and earns back her office mate's dislike. At high school, Justin is discovering that freshman year just got interesting when he is embarrassed by a group of bullies, leading to his shirt getting stained on. However, when he returns home he tells Hilda about the incident. He then later seeks out Marc at work because he looks to him as someone who can understand him. When Hilda finds out his visit to Mode, she confronts him at home but still hides the real truth behind the visit, saying it was to replace a shirt and that Marc bought him another. The following day Hilda comes to Mode to thank Marc for buying Justin a new shirt, only to learn from Marc about what really happened. During lunch Marc tells Justin about what happened, and Justin is not happy about it. Wilhelmina meanwhile is fretting about her future at Mode. That all changes after a meeting when Cal and Claire tell her that they want her to stay. She then tells Marc about why they might keep her, but Marc suspect something else when Wilhelmina began to tell him that she wants privacy, and he later tells Amanda at the Closet that she might be hiding Connor. Marc then heads over to Wilhelmina's apartment and to Wilhelmina's shock, she sees Marc talking to Nico. Marc also learns from Wilhelmina about Connor and her plans to retrieve the money he stole from Meade so she can take over the company. After Marc tells Wilhelmina not to keep anymore secrets, Wilhelmina then turns to Nico and asks her if anyone else other than Marc knew why she was at the apartment, and as we see the flashback from \\"The Fall Issue\\" where Wilhelmina dropped her glass and discovers Nico all covered in blood, it's apparent as to why Wilhelmina was keeping this a secret. Production In an interview with TV Guide, creator Silvio Horta noted that this season will take a different approach from Season Three, starting with this episode. When asked about the sudden changes, Horta replied \\"I think it's gradual; I don't think you see a huge transformation; it's a step. During the first two seasons, she was Homely Betty. Season 3 she was working at a fashion magazine, so she was inheriting some nice clothes, but she just doesn't know how to put it together. It was important to me and America that the change not come because someone says, \\"You need to change.\\" I think the look is still her. Sure, she's never worn pants before, but she wears a butterfly pin. The trick is: How far do you take it?\\" He also revealed that the opening scene in this episode that was inspired from 2001: A Space Odyssey was his idea.\\"Ugly Betty Creator: She's No Longer Homely Betty\\" From TV Guide (October 15, 2009) See also * The Butterfly Effect Part 2 * Ugly Betty * Ugly Betty (season 4) Notes *For the first hour, the episode was watched by 5.0 million viewers and placed third with a 1.3 among 18- to 49-year-olds and a 3.4/6 overall, which was down from last season when it was on Thursday night.

Common cases include a room situated above a shared passageway in a semi-detached house, or a balcony which extends over a neighbouring property. In the law of England and Wales, originally a freehold property included the ground, everything below it and everything above it. By the 13th century, the courts had begun to accept that one freehold could overhang or underlie another. This concept was settled law by the 16th century.Perrott, R. & Brandes, A.: Get the hang of it: Flying Freeholds. Estates Gazette, 25 June 2011, p. 101. . Flying freeholds are viewed as a title defect, because they rarely have adequate rights of support from the structure beneath or rights of access to make repairs.Dunn, S. The house we're buying has a flying freehold - what's this?, The Independent, 5 November 2008. Retrieved 6 September 2011. This is an issue if, for example, scaffolding needs to be erected on the land beneath the flying freehold: the landowner's consent will be required and he may refuse, or want to charge a premium. If the work is necessary it may be possible to obtain a court order under the Access to Neighbouring Land Act 1992, but there are costs and uncertainties involved, and the situation could be even worse if the structure beneath is unregistered land and the identity of the owner is unclear. There is a counterpart situation called a creeping freehold where similar issues arise. A creeping freehold is where, for example a basement or cellar belonging to one freehold underlies a different freehold at ground level. Works may be impossible without the consent of the freeholder above if any works could affect it, or need access to it. These concerns mean that mortgage lenders and other finance providers usually want more detail on the property before approving mortgages etc. The approach by lenders varies greatly. Some lenders are wary of flying freeholds while others appreciate that this is a common occurrence (particularly in older terrace properties) and act accordingly. When considering a mortgage application for a property with flying freehold the extent to which the property extends over a neighbouring property may also be considered before approving an application and may result in a lender requiring a title indemnity policy, which is a kind of insurance against problems arising from the flying freehold, or even demand that a deed of right of access be purchased. Because of the various problems, nowadays flying freeholds are not created willingly, long leases being used instead.  See also  * Tyneside flat, an arrangement of two flats, one above the other. These often involve reciprocal arrangements for the freeholds.
