It has a single hairy leaf and up to three pale pink flowers which have a labellum with three distinct lobes. It is similar to subspecies reptans except that its leaf is green on both sides and the flowers are larger and on a taller flowering spike. Description Caladenia reptans subsp. impensa is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single, hairy leaf, long and wide and green on both surfaces. Up to three pale pink flowers long and wide are borne on a spike tall. The dorsal sepal is erect and the lateral sepals are a similar size to it. The petals and lateral sepals spread fan-like and the labellum has three distinct lobes. The lateral lobes lack teeth but the middle lobe has a dark pink tip and between four and ten short teeth on the sides. There are two rows of thick calli along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from July to August. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia reptans was first described in 1840 by John Lindley and the description was published in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. In 2001, Stephen Hopper and Andrew Phillip Brown described two subspecies, including subspecies impensa and the description was published in Nuytsia.

Founded as a fur trading post at the head of navigation of the Missouri River, it was prior the advent of the railroad one of the nation's largest inland ports, playing a pivotal role in the development of the American and Canadian West. The Front Street and waterfront area of the city preserves elements of this history. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961, although its boundaries were not formally determined until 2012. Description and history Fort Benton was founded in 1846-48 by Alexander Culbertson, a fur trader working for the Chouteau brothers firm. It was named for Senator Thomas Hart Benton, and was originally little more than a palisaded fort, with the facilities of the trading firm within. At first goods were moved up and down the river by keelboats and other human or animal-powered watercraft. In 1859 the Chouteaus acquired a steamboat, and began service from St. Louis, Missouri. At more than 3000 river miles from the sea, it has been described as \\"the world's innermost port\\". From 1860 to 1890 it was one of the principal points of embarkation for supplies and good that drove the development of the American West. Its proximity to Canada meant that goods and supplies also traveled north, helping fuel the growth of cities such as Edmonton, Alberta. Goods were loaded and unloaded on the levee, and merchants managing the trade had their business on Front Street, with homes nearby. The river trade declined in the late 19th century after railroads became a more reliable means of transportation in the region. The historic district extends along Front Street, from the 1200 to 1900 blocks, and includes the levee along the river bank, and the 1888 Fort Benton Bridge, built in an attempt by the local merchants to maintain the city's influence as the steamboat trade declined. The district includes the site of Fort Benton, which has a surviving element an 1856 blockhouse, the levee, built in 1860, the 1882 Grand Union Hotel, and the Fort Benton Engine House, a fire station that also served as city hall for many years. The 1867 I.G. Baker House is the oldest surviving residence in the district.

Similar to other strains of Polynesian dogs, it was introduced to the Society Islands and Tahiti by the ancestors of the Tahitian (MƒÅ‚Äôohi) people during their migrations to Polynesia. They were an essential part of traditional Tahitian society; their meat was included in Tahitian cuisine and other parts of the dog were used to make tools and ornamental clothing. Dogs were fed a vegetarian diet and served during feasts as a delicacy. European explorers were the first outsiders to observe and record their existence, and they were served to early explorers including Captain James Cook. The Tahitian Dog disappeared as a distinct breed after the introduction of foreign European dogs. History The Tahitian Dog, known as the  ª≈™rƒ´ MƒÅ‚Äôohi in the Tahitian language, was introduced to Tahiti and the Society Islands (in modern French Polynesia) by the ancestors of the Tahitian (MƒÅ‚Äôohi) people during their migrations to Polynesia. They were closely related to the Hawaiian Poi Dog and the New Zealand kurƒ´; the latter is believed to be a descendant of the breed. Similar breeds of Polynesian dogs were brought alongside pigs and chickens when the people settled the islands of Polynesia. Genetic studies indicate that the New Zealand kuri/dog is derived from Indonesian dogs, and therefore by inference it is likely that Society island dogs are of the same origin. The Marquesan Dog became extinct in the neighboring Marquesas Islands before 1595. Even though dogs were virtually absent from Western Polynesia, they were recognized when European explorers later brought them as items of trade, indicating a universal cultural recognition of the dog in the many islands. Dogs were tied with strings around the belly and kept in the house where they were raised as a food source alongside domesticated pigs. Seen as a delicacy, they were served during feasts and to the high chiefs. Dogs were less abundant than pigs in the islands, possibly because they were killed while they were young. European visitors noticed that native women, especially those who lost their own children, would often breastfeed puppies and small pigs. The taumi, a traditional breast ornament, fringed with dog hair from the Tuamotus, James Cook Collection: Australian Museum They were an essential part of traditional Tahitian society. Dog teeth were fashioned into fishhooks and dog bones were made into weapons and implements. They also used dog hair, especially the long tail hairs of the Tuamotuan varieties of dogs, to decorate the fringes of the taumi ‚Äì a traditional breast ornament often called a gorget ‚Äì which were worn by priests and high chiefs. The Tuamotuan breed were described as similar to their Tahitian counterparts distinguishable by their longer hair. Historian Margaret Titcomb noted that Tuamotuan varieties may not have been a separate breed that developed in isolation, arguing that the people of the Tuamotus could have eaten their short hair varieties and kept their longer haired dogs for exports to the Society Islands. The Tahitian Dog became extinct in the Society Islands some time after the arrival of European settlers due to the introduction and interbreeding with European dog breeds. By 1834, British traveler Frederick Debell Bennett noted: \\"Amongst the Society Islands, the aboriginal dog, which was formerly eaten as a delicacy by the natives, is now extinct, or merged into mongrel breeds by propagation with many exotic varieties.\\" Most other breeds of Polynesian dogs also became extinct due to interbreeding with foreign dogs by the beginning of the 20th century. This breed and other Polynesian dogs were sometimes considered a distinct species by 18th century naturalists and scientists, and received scientific names such as Canis domesticus, indicus taitiensis (1778) by Georg Forster, Canis familiaris villaticus, meridionalis (1817) by F. L. Walther, Canis otahitensis (1836) or Canis familiaris orthotus otahitensis (1836) by Heinrich Gottlieb Ludwig Reichenbach, Canis pacificus (1845) by Charles Hamilton Smith, and Canis familiaris otahitensis (1859) by Christoph Gottfried Andreas Giebel. Luomala noted that the \\"source material of taxonomists has been derived, often at second- and third-hand, from impressionistic descriptions by members of the expeditions of Captain Cook and other eighteenth-century explorers, none of whom give a single measurement or preserved a specimen for scientific study\\". Characteristics A dog sitting below a boy in an outrigger canoe from Sydney Parkinson's A view of the island of Otaheite with several vessels of that island, c. 1773. The Tahitian dogs were described as having a small or medium build, resembling terriers or crooked-legged dachshund in size. Their coats were usually brown, white or rust-yellow with smooth hairs. They had broad heads, small eyes, long backs, sharp-pointed muzzles and erect ears. They were described as lazy, shy, and not ferocious, but as having notoriously bad dispositions. They seldom barked but sometimes howled. Often they are lumped together with the Hawaiian Poi Dog by 19th-century taxonomists because of their similar appearance and diet, in contrast to the kurƒ´, which was much larger in size due to their higher protein diet. Their diet included breadfruit, coconut, yam and poi made from taro and sometimes fish. This soft vegetarian diet caused the dogs to develop round skulls and a small stature. German naturalist Georg Forster wrote generally about the Polynesian dogs, but more specifically in response to the ones he saw in the Society Islands during a visit to Huahine in September 1773: > The dogs of all these islands were short, and their sizes vary from that of > a lap-dog to the largest spaniel. Their head is broad, the snout pointed, > the eyes very small, the ears upright, and their hair rather long, lank, > hard, and of different colours, but most commonly white and brown. They > seldom if ever barked, but howled sometimes, and were shy of strangers to a > degree of aversion.  European encounters  Tahitian Dogs were offered and served by high ranking chiefs to the early European explorers who visited the islands. In 1767, British explorer Samuel Wallis observed the breed for the first time in Tahiti. They were bounded \\"with their fore-legs tied over their heads\\" and attempted to run away in an erect position; Wallis initially took them for \\"some strange animal\\". When trading with natives, Wallis' men accepted the offerings of hogs and cloth but untied the dogs and turned them loose, an act that confused the Tahitians. On his first voyage, Captain James Cook and his crew developed a taste for the dog during a three-month stay in the Society Islands in 1769. Cook wrote an account of the first time his men tried dog meat and the traditional process of preparing the meat: In his journal, Cook noted, \\"For tame Animals they have Hogs, Fowls, and Dogs, the latter of which we learned to Eat from them, and few were there of us but what allow'd that a South Sea dog was next to an English lamb\\". Artist Sydney Parkinson reported that Captain Cook, Banks and Solander when in Tahiti said roasted dog was 'the sweetest meat they ever tasted' although Parkinson stated he abhorred the 'disagreeable smell' which put them off, such that they could not be prevailed upon to eat it. Naturalist Joseph Banks made a similar report. Dog in a canoe depicted in John Webber's A view of Huaheine, from the Third voyage of James Cook During Cook's second voyage, Forster brought two Tahitian Dogs aboard the ship to take home to England. They were tested with arrow poison at Malakula by having their legs opened with a lancet and inserted with the substance; both dogs recovered, though one later died from eating poisonous fish. However, the fate of the other dog and their remains is unknown. Depictions in European art Western artists often infused Euro-American characteristics in their depictions of the dogs of Polynesia and possibly many actually depicted the pet dogs kept on European ships rather than native breeds. This resulted in few accurate depictions of the dogs surviving. A few works likely depicting the aboriginal dog breed done by Parkinson, Webber, Alexander Buchan and John Frederick Miller were compiled by American anthropologist Katharine Luomala including the two images above. Otaheite Dog, aquatint engraving by Charles Catton the younger, 1788 In 1788, Charles Catton the younger, who did not accompany any of voyages, depicted an aquatint engraving of an \\"Otaheite Dog\\" in his book Animals Drawn from Nature and Engraved in Aqua-tinta. Based on its appearance and description, it may actually been a kurƒ´ instead. Artist Paul Gauguin depicted dogs in Tahiti and the Marquesasalthough it is unclear whether they were the prototypical Polynesian Dogin several works, including I raro te oviri (I) (Under the Pandanus I) (1891) and Arearea (Joyfulness) 1892. The prominence in his paintings of these collarless free range dogs has been the subject of much speculation as to their symbolic or metaphorical meaning.  Archaeology  Archaeologic records indicate that dogs were present in the Society Islands from the period of initial settlement up to the point of European contact. Modern digs in Tahiti and the other Society Islands have uncovered few surviving remains of the Tahitian Dog. In 1960, a few canine teeth were uncovered at Ana Paia shelter, on Mo'orea. In 1962, a complete skull, limbs, and vertebrae were discovered at a marae site on Mo'orea along with a jawbone at another site on the same island. In 1973, American archaeologists Yosihiko H. Sinoto and Patrick C. McCoy discovered bone fragments of domesticated dogs and pigs in the early settlements of Vaiato'oia (near Fa'ahia) on the island of Huahine.

These dogs were used for both companionship and food and were introduced alongside poultry and pigs to various islands. They became extinct as a result of the cross-breeding that occurred after other breeds of dogs were introduced. Modern studies done on the DNA of the Polynesian dogs indicate that they descended from the domesticated dogs of Southeast Asia and may have shared a remote ancestor with the dingo. Taxonomy In 1839, the British naturalist Charles Hamilton Smith gave this dog the scientific name of Canis pacificus in his 1840 book The Natural History of Dogs: Canidae Or Genus Canis of Authors; Including Also the Genera Hyaena and Proteles. In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf Canis lupus the taxon \\"familiaris Linneaus, 1758 [domestic dog]\\". Wozencraft then listed Canis pacificus C. E. H. Smith, 1839 as junior taxonomic synonym for the domestic dog.  History and distribution  These dogs were introduced by the ancestors of the Polynesian people during their settlement of the far-flung islands with a few major archipelagos developing isolated breeds. Notable breeds include: *Hawaiian Poi Dog ‚Äì introduced to the Hawaiian Islands *Kurƒ´ ‚Äì introduced to New Zealand *Marquesan Dog ‚Äì introduced to the Marquesas Islands *Tahitian Dog ‚Äì introduced to the Society Islands Tuamotuan Dog ‚Äì introduced to the Tuamotus, this may have been a longer- haired version of the Tahitian Dog. Described by British naturalist Georg Forster. Kurƒ´ specimen, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, 1924 The distribution of Polynesian dogs on other islands was somewhat patchy. Islands like Mangareva, Tokelau and the Marquesas possessed domesticated dog populations after initial settlement that went extinct before the arrival of European explorers. On Easter Island, no evidence or traces of dogs have been found in middens around the island or in the oral tradition of the Rapa Nui people. They were virtually absent from Western Polynesia (i.e., Samoa and Tonga) by the time Europeans arrived. However, dogs brought on European ships were recognized by the natives when they were introduced as items of trade, indicating a universal cultural recognition of dogs across the islands. While MƒÅori brought dogs to New Zealand, the Moriori had no dogs in the Chatham Islands at the time of European discovery.  Relationship to humans  The Polynesians raised dogs for companionship and food. Along with domesticated pigs and chickens, dog meat was an important animal protein source for the human populations of Polynesia. For the most part, they were fed a vegetarian diet of either breadfruits, coconuts, yams or poi made from taro, while the larger Kurƒ´ predominantly subsisted on a diet of fish. They never became feral because of the scarcity of food in the native forests. The diet and environment of the islands resulted in a dog with small stature and a docile disposition, and European explorers described them as lazy. They were said to rarely bark, but would howl occasionally. The distinct breeds of the Polynesian Dog became extinct between the 19th and early 20th centuries due to interbreeding with introduced European dog breeds; the declining consumption of dog meat was another contributing factor.  In mythology  Dogs were an important part of the Polynesian narrative. They are often associated with the legendary exploits of the demigod MƒÅui. According to MƒÅori narrative, MƒÅui transformed his brother-in-law Irawaru, husband of Hina, into the first dog which was used to explain the human characteristics of dogs. In the Tongan narrative, Maui-Atalaga and his son/brother Maui-Kijikiji attempted to hunt down Fulububuta, an enormous man-eating dog, larger than a horse, living in a cave on the Fijian island of Moturiki. However, Atalaga is killed and dragged into a cave by the monster, which is later slain by Maui-Kijikiji, who wastes away mourning his dead father.  Genetic studies  Proposed route for the migration of dogs based on mDNA. Haplotype A29 relates most to the Australian Dingo and the New Guinea Singing Dog, the ancient Polynesian Arc2 to modern Polynesian, Indonesian and ancient New Zealand dogs, and the ancient Polynesian Arc1 is indistinguishable from a number of widespread modern haplotypes. DNA evidence indicates that Polynesian dogs descended from the domesticated dogs of Southeast Asia and may have shared a remote ancestor with the dingo. The study of mtDNA show they carried two haplotypes: Arc1 and Arc2. In 2011, the mDNA of dogs from the Malay Peninsula found that the two most common dog haplotypes of the Indonesian region, in particular Bali and Kalimantan, were mDNA haplotype A75 (40%) and \\"the dingo founder haplotype\\" A29 (8%). Also present were haplotypes A120 and A145. All 4 haplotypes fall within the a2 mDNA sub-haplogroup. The study also looked at archaeological specimens of ancient Polynesian dogs from which only a \\"short-haplotype\\" (a short sequence) could be derived. This short haplotype was named Arc2 and corresponds to mDNA haplotypes A75 and A120, and it could be found in 70% of samples found as far away as Hawaii and New Zealand. No dogs from Taiwan nor the Philippines carried the dingo or Polynesian haplotypes, which indicates that dogs did not enter the Pacific from a northeastern route. In 2015, a study looked at the mDNA sequences taken from ancient New Zealand Kurƒ´ dog samples discovered at an archaeological site at Wairau Bar and found they correspond to the a2 mDNA sub-haplogroup. The dog samples all carried the mDNA haplotype A192, which has only been reported in some modern village dogs from Bali, Indonesia. When compared with the two ancient Polynesian haplotypes Arc1 and Arc2, all of the Wairau Bar dogs matched Arc2. Dogs from Wairau Bar likely represent part of the initial population of dogs introduced to New Zealand, having arrived with people around the beginning of the fourteenth century. All of these dogs carry haplotypes that fall under the mDNA a2 sub-haplogroup and are therefore descendants of a dog/Chinese wolf hybrid ancestor. In 2015, the most comprehensive study of mDNA haplotypes to date found that the a2 sub- haplogroup represents 3% of all dogs in Southeast Asia, 22% in the Indian subcontinent and 16% in East Asia. =Dogs enter Oceania from southern China= In 2020, an mDNA study of ancient dog fossils from the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins of southern China showed that most of the ancient dogs fell within mDNA haplogroup A1b, as do the Australian dingoes and the pre-colonial dogs of the Pacific, but in low frequency in China today. The specimen from the Tianluoshan archaeological site, Zhejiang province dates to 7,000 YBP and is basal to the entire lineage. The dogs belonging to this haplogroup were once widely distributed in southern China, then dispersed through Southeast Asia into New Guinea and Oceania, but were replaced in China 2,000 YBP by dogs of other lineages.

He is currently the Resident Scholar of the Valley Ranch Islamic Center and the Co-Chair Emeritus of Faith Forward Dallas at Thanks-Giving Square, a multi-faith coalition of clergy for peace and justice. His opinion pieces have appeared in CNN, USA Today, The Guardian, HuffPost, and The Dallas Morning News among other outlets. Early life and education Suleiman was born to a Palestinian family in New Orleans in 1986. His studies of the Islamic tradition have taken Suleiman across the Muslim world to countries including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and Malaysia. In addition to receiving traditional certifications in the Islamic sciences, he received a Bachelor's in Islamic Law, Masters in Islamic Finance and Political History, and he completed a doctoral studies in Islamic Thought and Civilization from the International Islamic University of Malaysia. Career Upon returning to New Orleans, he served as the Imam of the Jefferson Muslim Association for 6 years, and as director of the ‚ÄúMuslims for Humanity‚Äù Hurricane Katrina relief effort in late 2005. It was at this time he received national recognition for his community service, interfaith, and social justice efforts. He co-founded the East Jefferson Interfaith Clergy Association and was awarded for outstanding civic achievement by the Mayor and City Council of New Orleans in 2010. In 2016, Suleiman founded the Muslim think-tank, Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research. He is also the founding director of MUHSEN (Muslims Understanding and Helping Special Education Needs) - a non-profit umbrella organization that aims to create more inclusive Muslim communities that better cater to the disabled and their families. He is () Professor of Islamic Studies at Southern Methodist University. He was () Resident Scholar of the Valley Ranch Islamic Center and Co-Chair of Faith Forward Dallas at Thanks-Giving Square. Omar Suleiman also starred in the award-winning Inspiration Series which aimed at imparting moral lessons from the life and example of the Prophet Muhammad through a drama mini-series. The series was widely viewed globally, and would go on to win the award for Best Movie at the 2016 International Contribution to Dawah Awards in Dubai. Activism Suleiman has engaged in social justice organizing and activism on a host of progressive causes. He states that Donald Trump's presidency \\"fatigues\\" American citizens. He also \\"considers [himself] a student of Malcolm X\\" and believes that \\"his most important contribution to the revolution is his idea that the greatest casualty of the subjugation of African Americans was the loss of black consciousness.‚Äù He has expressed that \\"America is a work in progress, and the most patriotic Americans are those that demand it live up to its promise.\\" He also believes that \\"Muslim theology can be a source of liberation.\\" In July 2016, he marched with demonstrators in Dallas against the killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. These demonstrations would eventually be punctuated by a deadly shooting in which five police officers were killed in retaliation for police shootings of African Americans. Suleiman recalls \\"an eternity of gunshots\\" ringing out just as the march came to a close. In the wake of the shooting, Imam Omar Suleiman was invited to lead the invocation at a memorial service for the slain officers attended by President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden, as well as President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush. Since 2015, Suleiman has frequently visited Syrian refugee camps delivering aid with the Muslim humanitarian relief group, Helping Hand for Relief and Development. Suleiman led airport demonstrations in Dallas in reaction to the Trump travel ban, which has since come to be known as the ‚ÄúMuslim ban\\" due to its restricting immigration from 7 predominantly Muslim- majority nations, as well as Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslim entry into the United States following the 2015 San Bernardino attack, and again after the Orlando nightclub shooting. In 2017, Omar Suleiman was arrested on Capitol Hill protesting outside of the office of then-House Speaker Congressman Paul Ryan. He had been participating in sit-in demonstration calling for comprehensive immigration reform. He later led a group of clergy to the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border to protest in solidarity with and meet migrants affected by Trump's family separation policy. He has also worked to assist families of victims of police brutality, voiced support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and underscored the importance of anti-racism work more broadly. =Threat from ISIS= In March 2017, ISIS called for his assassination, among a number of other prominent Western Muslim faith leaders, in a propaganda film titled \\"Kill The Apostate Imams.\\" The call was in response to a video Suleiman produced with Pastor Andrew Stoker of First United Methodist Church Dallas titled \\"An Imam, a Pastor and a Dream,‚Äù in which he calls for unity between Christians and Muslims in the United States and around the world. Suleiman responded to the threat stating, \\"I believe that their venom needs to be condemned. They‚Äôve hijacked my religion.\\" Recognition Imam Omar Suleiman has been noted for his work in the fields of community service, interfaith dialogue, and social justice, and was awarded for outstanding civic achievement by the Mayor and City Council of New Orleans in 2010. He was featured as ‚Äúrising star‚Äù in Ozy Magazine and dubbed \\"The Religious Leader Dallas Needs\\" by the D Magazine. Suleiman was also the subject of a BBC documentary in 2016 highlighting the experience of Muslims in Texas facing rising Islamophobia, and a 2017 PBS documentary showcasing his work with Syrian refugees. On May 9, 2019, Suleiman served as the congressional guest chaplain upon the invitation of Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson and delivered the day's opening invocation. In addition to being recognized by CNN as one of 25 Muslim American change-makers, Suleiman was also included in The Muslim 500 - an annual ranking of the world's most influential Muslims compiled by the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre in Amman, Jordan. He also serves in an ethical advisory capacity within Muslim financial groups including the investment and wealth management firm, ShariaPortfolio, as well as A Continuous Charity - an organization aimed at promoting interest-free student loans for Muslims across North America.

The organization, headquartered in Sacramento, was founded by 6 counties (Sacramento, Colusa, Yuba, Yolo, Sutter and Glenn) but came to comprise representatives from 6 more (Solano, Butte, Shasta, Placer, El Dorado and Tehama), each selected by their respective county supervisor. It remained operational and influential until 1925 when the Sacramento Valley Regional Advisory for the larger California Development Association filled the void.https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d;=LMJ19250313.1.2 History President Will S. Green, former State Treasurer, Surveyor General and Assemblyman Upon suggestion from local Woodland attorney C.W. Thomas, former Colusa mayor Will S. Green called on the Colusa County Board of Trade to request a meeting of delegates to the inaugural Sacramento Valley Irrigation Convention. On January 15 and 16, 1900, delegates from six counties gathered in Woodland where they formally elected General Green, a renowned state politician and fierce advocate for Central Valley irrigation, as President, a capacity in which he served until his death in 1905. Another meeting would be held soon afterward in Oroville to formalize the proceedings and make permanent the renamed Sacramento Valley Development Association, then headquartered in Colusa. The office was moved once more to Sacramento in 1903, where a building had been erected near the Southern Pacific train depot specifically for the group's purpose. =Leadership= Hon. Marshall Diggs, 1906 candidate for Governor and 2nd President of the Sacramento Valley Development Association After General Green's death in 1905, Yolo County Democratic state senator (1903‚Äì1907) Marshall Diggs was elected President (with widespread support), an office which he held for over 16 years. His director turned co-vice president for a time was C.H. Dunton. Dunton was an invaluable aide, if not partner, to Diggs. Although the two men hailed from different parts of Northern California (Dunton was from El Dorado) and different political parties, the two were a formidable duo. Different as the two were, both were widely respected across the state. As proof, Diggs had been considered for the governorship in 1906, Dunton the lieutenant governorship in 1914. However, unlike Dunton, who had served as delegate to the state convention and on a committee to the National Irrigation Congress, Diggs wasn't particularly keen on politics. Diggs was \\"a business man, pure and simple\\", who \\"continually expressed a desire to get back to his ranch and to his business.\\" Together they arranged meetings and luncheons with some of California's most influential so that, for example, members of the Commonwealth Club of California were there to hear Dunton's talk on \\"The Relationship of San Francisco to the Development of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys\\" During his tenure, Biggs was chosen by Dunton to serve on the Northern California Development League's 15-man conference committee, which he chaired, in order to unite the disparate organizations working to promote Northern California. The irony in Dunton and Biggs' close involvement is that the decision to create such a League in the first place had been opposed principally by some members of their own organization, the Sacramento Valley Development Association. They agreed with Colonel John P. Irish, a member of the California Development Board, that the newly found organization of 33 counties was itself unnecessary. Irish contended at the organizing conference in Marysville that it would really only duplicate work of existing organizations which had already helped Northern California prosper as much as the southern part of the state. Nevertheless, the conference, which focused on the method of advertising by which the most northern counties could be better brought into the fold and how Northern California could compete with Southern California for tourists, immigrants and consumers, was a success and convinced most of the prospective League members it was a good idea. After his reelection as President for the 16th straight year in 1921, Diggs stepped down in January 1922, at which time Vice President W.A. Beard took over. With the exception of time spent on his run as the Democratic nominee for California's 2nd congressional district, Beard had served continuously within the organization (manager, secretary, editor and vice president) since 1905. =Fundraising= With their organizational structure set after the Oroville meeting, the most daunting challenge the Association faced was the raising of funds. The financial situation was so dire that Green himself travelled the valley appealing to county supervisors for $50 apiece. Working within these economic limitations, the group threw its moral weight behind an education campaign regarding the unique opportunities and advantages of the region. They took actions to negotiate the subdivision of a large ranch in Glenn County, secure reports on irrigation possibilities from the Department of Agriculture and induce the Geological Survey to send experts to map sites for storage reservoirs (the first study of water storage problems in the valley). Such barebones campaigning wasn't sustainable, however, so a permanent rule was implemented that required each participating county to contribute one-half cent for every one hundred dollars of assessed valuation. In April 1910, they partnered with the Sacramento Realty Board, who pledged $10,000 to the Association's proposed five year, $50,000 per year campaign for the development of the valley. The first three years went towards an advertising campaign until the association established a magazine which they published for six years after that. =Initiated and supported projects= As early as 1905, the Association had been pushing Congress for a comprehensive Sacramento Valley Project with a price tag of $40 million. With only $28 million in the Reclamation Fund at the time, the pitch was never plausible but, in his last public activity, Green managed to bring members of the Irrigation Committees of the United States Senate and House of Representatives, accompanied by officials of the Department of the Interior and of the Reclamation Service, out for a two-day tour of the Sacramento Valley's current irrigation situation. At their most important stop in Red Bluff, a banquet was held, during which California Gov. George C. Pardee, Nevada Sen. Francis G. Newlands, Idaho Sen. Fred Dubois, California Reps. Duncan E. McKinlay and Theodore Arlington Bell, Wyoming Rep. Franklin Wheeler Mondell and California Sen. Frank Putnam Flint all spoke. However, it was Green who, weeks from death, stole the show. Detailing the aims and intentions of the Association, he recognized how little work had actually yet been accomplished before finishing with a singular wish: \\"But, gentlemen, my only hope, as I am on the decline of life, is that some day I may stand on Pisgah An allusion to the biblical Mount Pisgah, from where Moses was shown the Promised Land which he would not enter. and see a Promised Land for God's people in this valley.

Hitchcock. Less than four years later, the East Park Dam had been constructed on Stony Creek, the Sacramento River's principal tributary from the west, along with a spillway, dikes and a system of canals capable of irrigating 53,000 acres 210 days out of the year. Proposed Iron Canyon Reservoir with approximate canal line to a point near Red Bluff (1919) In September 1908, the Association called for a meeting of delegates across the state to discuss plans for improving the highways of California. An earlier suggested plan, which had yet to be enacted was proposed at the meeting by the Governor's secretary in his stead. It called for an $18 million bond to construct 3000 miles of roads including highways across the tules between Davis and Sacramento as well as a state highway connection from Folsom to Placerville. The passage of the State Highways Act in 1909 and subsequent success of Proposition 2, The California State Highway Bonds Proposition, just over two years after the original meeting, provided $18 million in funds. This started the construction of 3,000 miles of roads including the Yolo Causeway in 1914 and the portion of U.S. Route 50 (then State Route 11) connecting Folsom and Placerville sometime before that. The road up the Feather River Canyon (now the northern part of California State Route 49) was also touted as a critical trans-Sierra highway. In 1905, at the urging of fellow Yolo County leaders, Marshall Diggs (still state senator) sponsored the State Farm Bill of 1905 which selected Davisville as the site for the University of California's new State Farmers' Institute, an adjunct to the university's College of Agriculture. He and his fellow Yolo County leaders infamously had a hand in pushing Judge Peter J. Shields to pin a blue slip to the bill, which added an irrigation requirement disqualifying more than a dozen other locations (many in Southern California) but not Davisville. Three years later, on behalf of the Sacramento Valley Development Association, Diggs spoke with his predecessor in the state senate A.E. Boynton, U.S. Representatives Benjamin Franklin Rush and Horace Davis as well as UC Berkeley President Benjamin Ide Wheeler on the campus pavilion for the formal opening of short instructional classes open to all adults of at least 17 years of age. The Association strongly supported the passage of John E. Raker's H.R. 348 bill, which created Lassen Volcanic National Park, even though it was criticized by some conservationists as a way to siphon federal funds to subsidize roads. The last large undertaking championed by the Association and President W.A. Beard's crowning achievement was the Iron Canyon Project on the upper Sacramento River, which would help to supply water for irrigation across 225,000 acres of land from Red Bluff to Glenn County west of the river. Beard and his director, A.L. Conrad, testified at a consequential record of public hearing in 1916 against opposition that wished to keep the river navigable up to Red Bluff year round. Beard, hyperbolic as always, cited \\"how [they were] sufficiently near to justify the War Department in providing us with this information\\", by which he meant the amount of water needed for storage and navigation. He emphasized the fact that development would reach its maximum output soon if storage capacity weren't increased, while others pointed to the decreasing navigability of the riverbed and banks. In the end, inertia and a Shasta County Board of Supervisors campaign against the plan was enough to stall it for years to come. The Association soon dissolved itself and many of its members became founders of the Sacramento Valley Regional Advisory Council to the larger California Development Association, while Beard worked for several more years as the President of the Iron Canyon Project Association in an effort to secure federal aid.https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/95888126/ Publications and publicity The Great West: A Journal of Development and Progress (September 1909) The Development Association also published regular literature to promote their endeavors and attract consumers from within and to the area. Their very first venture was a 40-page illustrated article outlining the climate, soil, resources and advantages of all nine member counties. It was decided in December 1900 that their first buy would be in Sunset, a South Pacific-owned magazine aimed at promoting the West. Including the 15,000 copies printed by the State Board of Trade, 25,000 reached circulation in early 1901. Later in the year, they published an article in 30,000 copies of the Overland Monthly, along with 10,000 in pamphlet form. Most of these early pamphlets were written by President Green himself under straightforward titles such as \\"Northern California and the Sacramento Valley\\" or \\"The Sacramento Valley as a field for profitable investment\\", while others embellished \\"The Best Spot on Earth is the Sacramento Valley\\". One pamphlet from 1911 boasted of \\"one of the great valleys of the world, with a vast and fertile soil area. It produces great quantities of precious metals and structural materials. It is blessed with an abundant water supply, and an agriculture much more diversified than is found anywhere else on the face of the earth.\\" =Monthly journals= In 1902, the association published a booster periodical called the Wednesday Press, which was renamed The Great West in October 1907 by manager turned editor W.A. Beard. As a booster, he tracked Sacramento's progress from what he called \\"one of the most backward and unprogressive cities on the entire Pacific Coast\\" to one in which \\"the population ... business ... property values have increased and every prominent interest in the city has been infused with life.\\" He signaled the dawn of a new era with headlines that alluded to science, \\"Substantial Evidence of Sacramento's New Growth\\", and faith, \\"Sacramento's New Awakening\\". At this, he'd been a natural since his days as secretary-manager: In truth, Redding did not grow to over 4,000 inhabitants until 1930, but the narrative helped Beard, on behalf of the Association, make the demand for \\"the gridironing of the valley with railroads\\" among other things. Sacramento Valley Monthly (1915) Prominent Catholic journalist and booster Thomas Augustus Connelly also worked for a time as an associate editor under Beard and played a role in the name change. While most of his work was spent promoting the economic interests and growth of the area, he also covered its social development in pieces like \\"Sacramento's Numerous and Beautiful Church Structures\\", in which he highlighted each of the city's established denominations. Like the Great West, the Sacramento Valley Monthly focused on educational writing for a wide variety of agricultural topics such as sanitation, reclamation, irrigation, navigation, tributaries, dams, reservoirs, power, maps, hunting and fishing, but they also dabbled in tourism, education and immigration. Ads and coupons for railroad companies, land, banks/loans, cattle and crops were also largely the same. The biggest difference was the fact that the Great West was more than 30 pages longer. The extra space was used to feature projects, cities and counties and to expand its advertisements to physicians, grocers, hotels and even funeral directors. Both publications also often highlighted success stories of farmers and laborers who had come to the Sacramento Valley from the midwest and east for a better life. One told of a man who moved from Moore, Oklahoma to Glenn County, another of an Illinois man who settled in Elk Grove, the latter of whom spoke of satisfaction owing to a quick 11% return on his investment and a friendly climate. =Great Prune Bear= Lewis and Clark Exposition, Portland, Oregon. The Great Prune Bear presented by Sacramento County (1905) One of the association's special promotional projects which gained brief national attention made its debut at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. The \\"Great Prune Bear\\", as they called it, was a life-sized bear made entirely of prunes adorned with gleaming teeth and flashing electric eyes, which attracted visitors and photographers from all over. Each was given a folder on the advantages of the area and asked to estimate the number of fruits used in the bear's creation. As California became an agricultural powerhouse, the valley was transitioning to fruits and vegetables, hence why the much maligned prune was marketed so heavily. The next year, the same groups were granted $100,000 by the state legislature to represent the Sacramento Valley and California at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland, Oregon. Having received their own building this time around, many California exhibits embellished upon the last year's display. Yet, according to a final report by the state itself, none featured more items than Sacramento County, which included a 12-foot high mural of the Great Seal of California made entirely of beans, a model of the California State Capitol constructed of nuts and a pyramid of beer bottles from the Buffalo Brewery in the shape of a giant beer bottle. But, of course, none received as much publicity as the upgraded Great Prune Bear, located on the central rotunda and now featuring a graphophone in its jaws.

Lawton was an American jurist and politician who served as a probate judge in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, and a Brockton city councilor. Early life Lawton was born on October 20, 1925 in Brockton to Irish immigrant parents. In 1931, Lawton's father was killed by a hit-and-run driver who was never apprehended. During his youth, Lawton did impersonations of public figures, including Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Eleanor Roosevelt, for money. He attended Brockton High School until his junior year, when he left to enlist in the United States Army. He served in the 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment. On March 24, 1945 he participated in Operation Varsity, the final Allied airborne invasion of Europe. Six days later he was seriously wounded in action in Munster. He spent the next eighteen months in Army hospitals and was discharged in November 1946. He then returned to Brockton High School and graduated. He went on to earn degrees from Suffolk University and Portia Law School (later known as New England School of Law). Political career In 1947, Lawton was elected to the Brockton City Council. At the age of 22 he was the youngest councilor ever elected in the history of Brockton. In 1950, Lawton was an unsuccessful candidate for a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He ran again two years later and this time was successful. At the time, he was one of the few Democrats from Plymouth County to serve on Beacon Hill. During his tenure in the House, Lawton served on the Ways & Means Committee, chaired the Committee on Bills in Third Reading, and served as House Chairman on the Commission to Redistrict Legislative, Council & Congressional seats. In 1960, Lawton was a last-minute candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts. He showed surprising strength on the first ballot at the Democratic convention, but did not win the party's endorsement. After the convention, Lawton decided that he would run for Attorney General of Massachusetts in 1962 if there was a vacancy. He won the endorsement of the Massachusetts Democratic Party at the party convention, but lost the nomination to Francis E. Kelly in the primary election. In 1963, Lawton became legislative secretary to governor Endicott Peabody. That May, Peabody appointed Lawton to the position of Registrar of Motor Vehicles. During his tenure as Registrar, Lawton supported mandatory use of seat belts, licensing for auto mechanics, compulsory vehicle inspections, and retraining for drivers with frequent violations. He also took a stand against public officials who sought to have their constituents' traffic tickets \\"fixed\\". Legal career In October 1964, Peabody appointed Lawton to the Plymouth County Probate Court. In February 1995, Lawton presided over a child custody case involving 10-year-old identical twin girls. After consulting with both children, he found that found that one of the girls strongly desired to live with their mother while the other expressed a very strong desire to live with their father. Lawton decided to accommodated the children and ruled that one girl should live with their mother and the other should live with their father. The decision gained national attention and lingered in court until 1998, when a different judge placed both twins with their mother. Lawton remained a judge until October 20, 1995, when he reached the mandatory retirement age of seventy. From 1969 until his death, Lawton was Chairman of the Board of Trustees of his alma mater, the New England School of Law. During his tenure, the school moved from Beacon Hill to Newbury Street and then from Newbury Street to the Boston Theater District. Personal life and death On October 16, 1948, Lawton married Jeanne Cashman in Brockton. They had five sons, one of whom, Mark Lawton, also served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and as a state court judge. On February 3, 2007, Lawton fell and broke his hip at his Brockton home. He never recovered and died in Brockton Hospital on March 20.

Rusch was nominated to the international Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in 2019, owns seven World Championship titles in multiple disciplines and was a member of the US National Whitewater Rafting Team as well as several international adventure racing teams, participating in the Eco Challenge (1997‚Äì2002), Primal Quest (2002‚Äì2006) and Raid Gauloises (2000, 2002, 2003) series.  Personal life  Rusch was born August 25, 1968 in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico to Stephen Rusch and Judy Tomlinson Rusch. Her father, a US Air Force F-4 pilot, was shot down during combat in the Vietnam War in 1972 when Rusch was 3 years old. She has an older sister, USAF Brigadier Gen. Sharon Bannister. Rusch attended college at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where she studied business marketing. Rusch married Greg Martin in September 2014; Martin is an engineer firefighter for the Ketchum fire department and accomplished mountain biker and outdoorsman. Rusch, Martin and their dogs Diesel & Gracie reside in Ketchum, Idaho.  Event Production & Activism  Rated a Top 5 gravel event by Global Cycling Network and one of the 25 Best Bike Rides in the World by Outside Magazine, Rebecca's Private Idaho has been staged every Labor Day weekend since 2013 in Rusch's hometown and surrounding Idaho backcountry. Conceived and reconned by Rusch, produced in partnership with her sponsors, the gravel grinder, stage race and outdoor festival benefits local, national and global charities: the [Wood River Trails Coalition; the Idaho chapter of the National Interscholastic Cycling Association; People for Bikes and World Bicycle Relief. RPI, along with other cycling clinics, camps and guided tours coordinated and led by Rusch (including Rusch Academy and MTB Lao), plus adventures like mountain biking up and down Mount Kilimanjaro have raised over $500k to date in support of select nonprofits. Rusch established the Be Good Foundation, a 501(c)3 nonprofit, in honor of her father Capt. Stephen A. Rusch, who signed his letters home from Vietnam using those two words. Its mission is to enrich communities by using the bicycle as a catalyst for healing, empowerment and evolution and to create opportunities for outdoor exploration, personal discovery and humanitarian service. Priorities include removal of UXO, or unexploded ordnance, throughout Laos; protecting public lands for recreation and access; and partnering with other cycling-related nonprofits to fund impactful change. Rusch has partnered with Mines Advisory Group (MAG) and jewelry company Article22 to support UXO mitigation efforts.

This means that there is no oxygen (O2) and a raised level of free hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Euxinic bodies of water are frequently strongly stratified, have an oxic, highly productive, thin surface layer, and have anoxic, sulfidic bottom water. The word euxinia is derived from the Greek name for the Black Sea (Œï·ΩîŒæŒµŒπŒΩŒøœÇ Œ†œåŒΩœÑŒøœÇ (Euxeinos Pontos)) which translates to \\"hospitable sea\\". Euxinic deep water is a key component of the Canfield ocean, a model of oceans during the Proterozoic period (known as the Boring Billion) proposed by Donald Canfield, an American geologist, in 1998. There is still debate within the scientific community on both the duration and frequency of euxinic conditions in the ancient oceans. Euxinia is relatively rare in modern bodies of water, but does still happen in places like the Black Sea and certain fjords.  Background  Euxinia most frequently occurred in the Earth's ancient oceans, but its distribution and frequency of occurrence are still under debate. The original model was that it was quite constant for approximately a billion years. Some meta-analyses have questioned how persistent euxinic conditions were based on relatively small black shale deposits in a period when the ocean should have theoretically been preserving more organic matter. Before the Great Oxygenation Event happened approximately 2.3 billion years ago, there was little free oxygen in either the atmosphere or the ocean. It was originally thought that the ocean accumulated oxygen soon after the atmosphere did, but this idea was challenged by Canfield in 1998 when he proposed that instead of the deep ocean becoming oxidizing, it became sulfidic. This hypothesis is partially based on the disappearance of banded iron formations from the geological records 1.8 billion years ago. Canfield argued that although enough oxygen entered the atmosphere to erode sulfides in continental rocks, there was not enough oxygen to mix into the deep ocean. This would result in an anoxic deep ocean with an increased flux of sulfur from the continents. The sulfur would strip iron ions from the sea water, resulting in iron sulfide (pyrite), a portion of which was eventually buried. When sulfide became the major oceanic reductant instead of iron, the deep water became euxinic. This has become what is known as the Canfield ocean, a model backed by the increase in presence of Œ¥34S in sedimentary pyrite and the discovery of evidence of the first sulfate evaporites. Anoxia and sulfidic conditions often occur together. In anoxic conditions anaerobic, sulfate reducing bacteria convert sulfate into sulfide, creating sulfidic conditions. The emergence of this metabolic pathway was very important in the pre-oxygenated oceans because adaptations to otherwise inhabitable or \\"toxic\\" environments like this may have played a role in the diversification of early eukaryotes and protozoa in the pre-Phanerozoic. Euxinia still occurs occasionally today, mostly in meromictic lakes and silled basins such as the Black Sea and some fjords. It is rare in modern times; less than 0.5% of today's sea floor is euxinic.  Causes  Diagram of mechanisms of euxinia in the Canfield Ocean The basic requirements for the formation of euxinic conditions are the absence of oxygen (O2), and the presence of sulfate ions (SO42‚àí), organic matter (CH2O), and bacteria capable of reducing sulfate to hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The bacteria utilize the redox potential of sulfate as an oxidant and organic matter as a reductant to generate chemical energy through cellular respiration. The chemical species of interest can be represented via the reaction: 2CH2O + SO42‚àí ‚Üí H2S + 2HCO3‚àí In the reaction above, the sulfur has been reduced to form the byproduct hydrogen sulfide, the characteristic compound present in water under euxinic conditions. Although sulfate reduction occurs in waters throughout the world, most modern-day aquatic habitats are oxygenated due to photosynthetic production of oxygen and gas exchange between the atmosphere and surface water. Sulfate reduction in these environments is often limited to occurring in seabed sediments that have a strong redox gradient and become anoxic at some depth below the sediment-water interface. In the ocean the rate of these reactions is not limited by sulfate, which has been present in large quantities throughout the oceans for the past 2.1 billion years. The Great Oxygenation Event increased atmospheric oxygen concentrations such that oxidative weathering of sulfides became a major source of sulfate to the ocean. Despite plentiful sulfate ions being present in solution, they are not preferentially used by most bacteria. The reduction of sulfate does not give as much energy to an organism as reduction of oxygen or nitrate, so the concentrations of these other elements must be nearly zero for sulfate- reducing bacteria to out-compete aerobic and denitrifying bacteria. In most modern settings these conditions only occur in a small portion of sediments, resulting in insufficient concentrations of hydrogen sulfide to form euxinic waters. Conditions required for the formation of persistent euxinia include anoxic waters, high nutrient levels, and a stratified water column. These conditions are not all-inclusive and are based largely on modern observations of euxinia. Conditions leading up to and triggering large-scale euxinic events, such as the Canfield ocean, are likely the result of multiple interlinking factors, many of which have been inferred through studies of the geologic record at relevant locations. The formation of stratified anoxic waters with high nutrient levels is influenced by a variety of global and local-scale phenomena such as the presence of nutrient traps and a warming climate. = Nutrient traps = In order for euxinic conditions to persist, a positive feedback loop must perpetuate organic matter export to bottom waters and reduction of sulfate under anoxic conditions. Organic matter export is driven by high levels of primary production in the photic zone, supported by a continual supply of nutrients to the oxic surface waters. A natural source of nutrients, such as phosphate (), comes from weathering of rocks and subsequent transport of these dissolved nutrients via rivers. In a nutrient trap, increased input of phosphate from rivers, high rates of recycling of phosphate from sediments, and slow vertical mixing in the water column allow for euxinic conditions to persist.  Geography  A simplified model of estuarine circulation in a silled basin. Depicted here is a three-layered body of water which has been further simplified in the article by combining the intermediate and deep layers. The arrangement of the continents has changed over time due to plate tectonics, resulting in the bathymetry of ocean basins also changing over time. The shape and size of the basins influences the circulation patterns and concentration of nutrients within them. Numerical models simulating past arrangements of continents have shown that nutrient traps can form in certain scenarios, increasing local concentrations of phosphate and setting up potential euxinic conditions. On a smaller scale, silled basins often act as nutrient traps due to their estuarine circulation. Estuarine circulation occurs where surface water is replenished from river input and precipitation, causing an outflow of surface waters from the basin, while deep water flows into the basin over the sill. This type of circulation allows for anoxic, high nutrient bottom water to develop within the basin.  Stratification  Stratified waters, in combination with slow vertical mixing, are essential to maintaining euxinic conditions. Stratification occurs when two or more water masses with different densities occupy the same basin. While the less dense surface water can exchange gas with the oxygen-rich atmosphere, the denser bottom waters maintain low oxygen content. In the modern oceans, thermohaline circulation and upwelling prevent the oceans from maintaining anoxic bottom waters. In a silled basin, the stable stratified layers only allow surface water to flow out of the basin while the deep water remains anoxic and relatively unmixed. During an intrusion of dense saltwater however, the nutrient-rich bottom water upwells, causing increased productivity in the surface, further enhancing the nutrient trap due to biological pumping. Rising sea level can exacerbate this process by increasing the amount of deep water entering a silled basin and enhancing estuarine circulation. = Warming climate = A warming climate increases surface temperatures of waters which effects multiple aspects of euxinic water formation. As waters warm, the solubility of oxygen decreases, allowing for deep anoxic waters to form more readily. Additionally, the warmer water causes increased respiration of organic matter leading to further oxygen depletion. Higher temperatures enhance the hydrologic cycle, increasing evaporation from bodies of water, resulting in increased precipitation. This causes higher rates of weathering of rocks and therefore higher nutrient concentrations in river outflows. The nutrients allow for more productivity resulting in more marine snow and subsequently lower oxygen in deep waters due to increased respiration. Volcanism has also been proposed as a factor in creating euxinic conditions. The carbon dioxide (CO2) released during volcanic outgassing causes global warming which has cascading effects on the formation of euxinic conditions.  Evidence for euxinic events  = Black shale = Black shale is one of the preliminary indicators of anoxia and perhaps euxinia Black shales are organic rich, microlaminated sedimentary rocks often associated with bottom water anoxia. This is because anoxia slows the degradation of organic matter, allowing for greater burial in the sediments. Other evidence for anoxic burial of black shale includes the lack of bioturbation, meaning that there were no organisms burrowing into the sediment because there was no oxygen for respiration. There must also be a source of organic matter for burial, generally from production near the oxic surface. Many papers discussing ancient euxinic events use the presence of black shale as a preliminary proxy for anoxic bottom waters, but their presence does not in and of itself indicate euxinia or even strong anoxia. Generally geochemical testing is needed to provide better evidence for conditions. = Geochemistry = Some researchers study the occurrence of euxinia in ancient oceans because it was more prevalent then than it is today. Since ancient oceans cannot be directly observed, scientists use geology and chemistry to find evidence in sedimentary rock created under euxinic conditions. Some of these techniques come from studying modern examples of euxinia, while others are derived from geochemistry. Though modern euxinic environments have geochemical properties in common with ancient euxinic oceans, the physical processes causing euxinia most likely vary between the two.  Isotopes  Stable isotope ratios can be used to infer the environmental conditions during the formation of sedimentary rock. Using stoichiometry and knowledge of redox pathways, paleogeologists can use isotopes ratios of elements to determine the chemical composition of the water and sediments when burial occurred. Sulfur isotopes are frequently used to look for evidence of ancient euxinia. Low Œ¥34S in black shales and sedimentary rocks provides positive evidence for euxinic formation conditions. The pyrite (FeS2) in euxinic basins typically has higher concentrations of light sulfur isotopes than pyrite in the modern ocean. The reduction of sulfate to sulfide favors the lighter sulfur isotopes (32S) and becomes depleted in the heavier isotopes (34S). This lighter sulfide then bonds with Fe2+ to form FeS2 which is then partially preserved in the sediments. In most modern systems, sulfate eventually becomes limiting, and the isotopic weights of sulfur in both sulfate and sulfide (preserved as FeS2) become equal. Molybdenum (Mo), the most common transition metal ion in modern seawater, is also used to look for evidence for euxinia. Weathering of rocks provides an input of MoO42‚Äì into oceans. Under oxic conditions, MoO42‚Äì is very unreactive, but in modern euxinic environments such as the Black Sea, molybdenum precipitates out as oxythiomolybdate (MoO4‚àíxSx2‚Äì ). The isotope ratio for Molybdenum (Œ¥97/95 Mo) in euxinic sediments appears to be higher than in oxic conditions. Additionally, the concentration of molybdenum is frequently correlated with the concentration of organic matter in euxinic sediments. The use of Mo to indicate euxinia is still under debate.  Trace-element enrichment  Under euxinic conditions, some trace elements such as Mo, U, V, Cd, Cu, Tl, Ni, Sb, and Zn, become insoluble. This means that euxinic sediments would contain more of the solid form of these elements than the background seawater. For example, Molybdenum and other trace metals become insoluble in anoxic and sulfidic conditions, so over time the seawater becomes depleted of trace metals under conditions of persistent euxinia, and preserved sediments are relatively enriched with molybdenum and other trace elements.  Organic biomarkers  Pigments from purple and green sulfur reducing bacteria are strong evidence for euxinic conditions Bacteria such as green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria, which exist where the photic zone overlaps with euxinic water masses, leave pigments behind in sediments. These pigments can be used to identify past euxinic conditions. The pigments used to identify past presence of green sulfur bacteria are chlorobactane and isorenieratene. The pigments used to identify past presence of purple sulfur bacteria is okenane.  Iron geochemistry  Pyrite (FeS2) is a mineral formed by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and bioreactive iron (Fe2+). In oxic bottom waters pyrite can only form in sediments where H2S is present. However, in iron-rich euxinic environments, pyrite formation can occur at higher rates in both the water column and in sediments due to higher concentrations of H2S. Therefore the presence of euxinic conditions can be inferred by the ratio of pyrite-bound iron to the total iron in sediments. High ratios of pyrite-bound iron can be used as an indicator of past euxinic conditions. Similarly, if >45% of the bioreactive iron in sediments is pyrite- bound, then anoxic or euxinic conditions can be inferred. While useful, these methods do not provide definitive proof of euxinia because not all euxinic waters have the same concentrations of bioreactive iron available. These relationships have been found to be present in the modern euxinic Black Sea.  Euxinic events in Earth's history  Presence of euxinia in the world's ancient deep oceans. According to Canfield, the deep ocean became sulfitic around 1.8 billion years ago and stayed that way for much of the boring billion. Periodic euxinia dominated through the Late Devonian Kelwasser events, and then most likely disappeared during the Carboniferous. Euxinia reemerged at the Permian-Triassic Boundary, and may have been present during the Ocean Anoxia Events of the Mesozoic. Euxinia is rare in Cenozoic oceans. Adapted from Lyons, 2008 = Proterozoic = The Proterozoic is the transition era between anoxic and oxygenated oceans. The classic model is that the end of the Banded iron formations (BIFs) was due to the injection of oxygen into the deep ocean, an approximately 0.6 billion year lag behind the Great Oxygenation Event. Canfield, however, argued that anoxia lasted much longer, and the end of the banded iron formations was due to the introduction of sulfide. Supporting Canfield's original hypothesis, 1.84 billion year old sedimentary records have been found in the Animike group in Canada that exhibit close to full pyritization on top of the last of the banded iron formations, showing evidence of a transition to euxinic conditions in that basin. In order for full pyritization to happen, nearly all of the sulfate in the water was reduced to sulfide, which stripped the iron from the water, forming pyrite. Because this basin was open to the ocean, deep euxinia was interpreted as being a widespread phenomena. This euxinia is hypothesized to have lasted until about 0.8 billion years ago, making basin bottom euxinia a potentially widespread feature throughout the Boring Billion. Further evidence for euxinia was discovered in the McArthur Basin in Australia, where similar iron chemistry was found. The degree of pyritization and the Œ¥34S were both high, supporting the presence of anoxia and sulfide, as well as the depletion of sulfate. A different study found biomarkers for green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria in the same area, providing further evidence for the reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide. Molybdenum isotopes have been used to examine the distribution of euxinia in the Proterozoic eon, and suggest that perhaps euxinia was not as widespread as Canfield initially postulated. Bottom waters may have been more widely suboxic than anoxic, and there could have been negative feedback between euxinia and the high levels of surface primary production needed to sustain euxinic conditions. Further work has suggested that from 700 million years ago (late Proterozoic) and onward, the deep oceans may have actually been anoxic and iron rich with conditions similar to those during the formation of BIFs. = Phanerozoic = There is evidence for multiple euxinic events during the Phanerozoic. It is most likely that euxinia was periodic during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, but geologic data is too sparse to draw any large scale conclusions. In this eon, there is some evidence that euxinic events are potentially linked with mass extinction events including the Late Devonian and Permian‚ÄìTriassic.  Paleozoic  The periodic presence of euxinic conditions in the Lower Cambrian has been supported by evidence found on the Yangtze platform in South China. Sulfur isotopes during the transition from Proterozoic to Phanerozoic give evidence for widespread euxinia, perhaps lasting throughout the Cambrian period.Gill, Benjamin C, Timothy W Lyons, Seth a Young, Lee R Kump, Andrew H Knoll, and Matthew R Saltzman. 2010. \\"Geochemical Evidence for Widespread Euxinia in the Later Cambrian Ocean.\\" Nature 469 (7328): 80‚Äì83. doi:10.1038/nature09700. Towards the end of the Lower Cambrian, the euxinic chemocline grew deeper until euxinia was present only in the sediments, and once sulfate became limiting, conditions became anoxic instead of euxinic. Some areas eventually became oxic, while others eventually returned to euxinic for some time. Geological records from the paleozoic in the Selwyn Basin in Northern Canada have also shown evidence for episodic stratification and mixing, where, using Œ¥34S, it was determined that hydrogen sulfide was more prevalent than sulfate. Although this was not originally attributed to euxinia, further studies found that seawater in that time likely had low concentrations of sulfate, meaning that the sulfur in the water was primarily in the form of sulfide. This combined with organic-rich black shale provide strong evidence for euxinia. There is similar evidence in the black shales in the mid-continent North America from the Devonian and early Mississippian periods. Isorenieratene, a pigment known as a proxy for an anoxic photic zone, has been found in the geological record in Illinois and Michigan. Although present, these events were probably ephemeral and did not last for longer periods of time. Similar periodic evidence of euxinia can also be found in the Sunbury shales of Kentucky. Evidence for euxinia has also been tied to the Kellwasser events of the Late Devonian Extinction event. Euxinia in basinal waters in what is now central Europe (Germany, Poland, and France) persisted for part of the late Devonian, and may have spread up into shallow waters, contributing to the extinction event. There was perhaps a period of oxygenation of bottom waters during the Carboniferous, most likely between the Late Devonian Extinction and the Permian-Triassic Extinction, at which point euxinia would be very rare in the paleo oceans. The Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event may also have some ties to euxinia, with hypercapnia and hydrogen sulfide toxicity killing off many species. Presence of a biomarker for anaerobic photosynthesis by green sulfur bacteria has been found spanning from the Permian to early Triassic in sedimentary rock in both Australia and China, meaning that euxinic conditions extended up quite shallow in the water column, contributing to the extinctions and perhaps even slowed the recovery. It is uncertain, however, just how widespread photic zone euxinia was during this period. Modelers have hypothesized that due to environmental conditions anoxia and sulfide may have been brought up from a deep, vast euxinic reservoir in upwelling areas, but stable, gyre-like areas remained oxic.  Mesozoic  The Mesozoic is well known for its distinct Ocean Anoxic Events (OAEs) which resulted in the burial of layers of black shale. Although these OAEs are not stand alone evidence for euxinia, many do contain biomarkers which support euxinic formation. Again, evidence is not universal. OAEs may have spurred the spread of existing euxinia, especially in upwelling regions or semi-restricted basins, but photic zone euxinia did not happen everywhere.  Cenozoic  Few episodes of euxinia are evident in the sedimentary record during the Cenozoic. Since the end of the Cretaceous OAEs, it is most likely that the oceanic bottom waters have stayed oxic.  Modern euxinia  Euxinic conditions have nearly vanished from Earth's open-ocean environments, but a few small scale examples still exist today. Many of these locations share common biogeochemical characteristics. For example, low rates of overturning and vertical mixing of the total water column is common in euxinic bodies of water. Small surface area to depth ratios allow multiple stable layers to form while limiting wind- driven overturning and thermohaline circulation. Furthermore, restricted mixing enhances stratified layers of high nutrient density which are reinforced by biological recycling. Within the chemocline, highly specialized organisms, such as green sulfur bacteria take advantage of the strong redox potential gradient and minimal sunlight. = The Black Sea = Map of the Black Sea showing the many rivers that supply the basin with low-density fresh water, along with the narrow Bosphorus Strait to the southwest that supplies the basin with high-density salt water. This assists in the stratification and euxinia that exists in the modern Black Sea. The Black Sea is a commonly used modern model for understanding biogeochemical processes that occur under euxinic conditions. It is thought to represent the conditions of Earth's proto-oceans and thus assists in the interpretation of oceanic proxies. Black Sea sediment contains redox reactions to depths of tens of meters, compared to single centimeters in the open ocean. This unique feature is important for understanding the behavior of the redox cascade under euxinic conditions.Stewart, Keith, et al. \\"Oxic, suboxic, and anoxic conditions in the Black Sea.\\" The Black Sea Flood Question: Changes in Coastline, Climate, and Human Settlement. Springer Netherlands, 2007. 1-21. The only connection between the open ocean and the Black Sea is the Bosphorus Strait, through which dense Mediterranean waters are imported. Subsequently, numerous rivers, such as the Danube, Don, Dnieper, and Dniester, drain fresh water into the Black Sea, which floats on top of the more dense Mediterranean water, causing a strong, stratified water column. This stratification is maintained by a strong pycnocline which restricts ventilation of deep waters and results in an intermediate layer called the chemocline, a sharp boundary separating oxic surface waters from anoxic bottom waters usually between 50m and 100m depth, with interannual variation attributed to large scale changes in temperature. Well-mixed, oxic conditions exist above the chemocline and sulfidic conditions are dominant below. Surface oxygen and deep water sulfide do not overlap via vertical mixing, but horizontal entrainment of oxygenated waters and vertical mixing of oxidized manganese into sulfidic waters may occur near the Bosphorus Strait inlet. Manganese and iron oxides likely oxidize hydrogen sulfide near the chemocline, resulting in the decrease in H2S concentrations as one approaches the chemocline from below. = Meromictic lakes = Meromictic lakes are poorly mixed and anoxic bodies of water with strong vertical stratification. While meromictic lakes are frequently categorized as bodies of water with the potential for euxinic conditions, many do not exhibit euxinia. Meromictic lakes are infamous for limnic eruptions. These events usually coincide with nearby tectonic or volcanic activity that disturbs the otherwise stable stratification of meromictic lakes. This can result in the release of immense concentrations of stored toxic gasses from the anoxic bottom waters, such as CO2 and H2S, especially from euxinic meromictic lakes. In high enough concentration, these limnic explosions can be deadly to humans and animals, such as the Lake Nyos disaster in 1986. Mariager fjord often produces a \\"rotten egg\\" smell in the summer due to sulfur content. = North Sea fjords = Some fjords develop euxinia if the connection to the open ocean is constricted, similar to the case of the Black Sea. This constriction prohibits relatively dense, oxygen-rich oceanic water from mixing with the bottom water of the fjord, which leads to stable stratified layers in the fjord. Low salinity melt water forms a lens of fresh, low density water on top of a more dense mass of bottom water. Ground sources of sulfur are also an important cause for euxinia in fjords.  Framvaren Fjord  This fjord was born as a glacial lake that was separated from the open ocean (the North Sea) when it was lifted during glacial rebound. A shallow channel (2m deep) was dug in 1850, providing a marginal connection to the North Sea. A strong pycnocline separates fresh surface water from dense, saline bottom water, and this pycnolcine reduces mixing between the layers. Anoxic conditions persist below the chemocline at 20m, and the fjord has the highest levels of hydrogen sulfide in the anoxic marine world. Like the Black Sea, vertical overlap of oxygen and sulfur is limited, but the decline of H2S approaching the chemocline from below is indicative of oxidation of H2S, which has been attributed to manganese and iron oxides, photo-autotrophic bacteria, and entrainment of oxygen horizontally from the boundaries of the fjord. These oxidation processes are similar to those present in the Black Sea. Two strong seawater intrusion events have occurred through the channel in recent history (1902 and 1942). Seawater intrusions to fjords force dense, salty, oxygen-rich water into the typically anoxic, sulfidic bottom waters of euxinic fjords. These events result in a temporary disturbance to the chemocline, raising the depth at which H2S is detected. The breakdown of the chemocline causes H2S to react with dissolved oxygen in a redox reaction. This decreases the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the biologically active photic zone which can result in basin-scale fish die-offs. The 1942 event, in particular, was strong enough to chemically reduce the vast majority of oxygen and elevate the chemocline to the air-water interface. This caused a temporary state of total anoxia in the fjord, and resulted in dramatic fish mortality.  Mariager Fjord  This fjord is marked by a highly mobile chemocline with a depth that is thought to be related to temperature effects. Local reports of strong rotten egg smell- the smell of sulfur- during numerous summers around the fjord provide evidence that, like the Framvaren fjord, the chemocline has breached the surface of the fjord at least five times in the last century. Sediments export during these events increased the concentrations of dissolved phosphates, inorganic bioavailable nitrogen, and other nutrients, resulting in a harmful algal bloom. = Cariaco Basin = The Cariaco Basin in Venezuela has been used to study the cycle of organic material in euxinic marine environments. An increase in productivity coincident with post glacial nutrient loading probably caused a transition from oxic to anoxic and subsequently euxinic conditions around 14.5 thousand years ago. High productivity at the surface produces a rain of particulate organic matter to the sub surface where anoxic, sulfidic conditions persist. The organic matter in this region is oxidized with sulfate, producing reduced sulfur (H2S) as a waste product. Free sulfur exists deep in the water column and up to 6m in depth in the sediment.

History =Background= White immigrants flooded into northern California in 1848 due to the California Gold Rush, increasing the non-Indian population of California from 13,000 to well over 300,000 in little more than a decade. The sudden influx of miners and settlers on top of the nearly 300,000 Native Americans living in the area strained space and resources. In 1851, the civilian governor of California declared, \\"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged, until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected.\\" This expectation soon found its way into law. An 1851 legislative measure not only gave settlers the right to organize lynch mobs to kill Indians, but allowed them to submit their expenses to the government. By 1852 the state had authorized over a million dollars in such claims. =Incident= On May 15, 1854, six Missouri-based explorers led by Pierce Asbill happened upon Round Valley while searching for a route between Weaverville, an interior mining center, and Petaluma, an important river port. Round Valley was in an isolated, difficult to access region of the Coast Range, allowing it to remain relatively untouched by settlers and miners to this point. While crossing a meadow, the explorers spotted movement in the grass and realized that Indians were in the valley. Asbill stated, \\"We've come a long way from Missouri to locate this place... an' be damned if wigglin' grass 'ull keep us away! Git a‚Äìhold of yer weapons‚Äîwe'uns are goin' in!\\" The party proceeded to a creek bed where they encountered a large settlement of Yuki. Through the combination of superior weaponry, horses, and focused intent, the party killed approximately 40 of the people. =Repercussions= Neither Asbill nor any of his fellow settlers were charged with any malfeasance for killing the nonthreatening Indians. Asbill stayed on to hunt the land and eventually began kidnapping and trafficking Yuki women to be sold to non-Indian men outside of the valley. Asbill sold 35 women in this manner by 1855. Aftermath Due to Round Valley's remote location, it became a destination for other Indians the settlers had forced off their lands, and soon its native population swelled to 20,000, while the White settlers in the area remained a few dozen. With their concentrated and vulnerable position (along with the 1850 California law \\"Act for the Government and Protection of Indians,\\" which legalized the kidnapping and forced servitude of Indians by White settlers), slave raids against the Round Valley Indians became common. Further conflict soon led to terrorist attacks meant to drive the Indians from the valley (see Round Valley Settler Massacres of 1856 - 1859 and Mendocino War). By 1860 all remaining Yuki Indians had been forced into reservations. In the 1880s, settlers began taking over the reservation lands which instigated another \\"war\\" (see Round Valley War), resulting in the further loss of land and lives by the Yuki Indians.

Club career Asnawi was a student at PDS International School (now known as Seri Mulia Sarjana School) in Jangsak. He was also in the books of Muara Vella's academy which competed in Brunei's youth leagues, and played alongside future Brunei internationals such as Aminuddin Zakwan Tahir. Together they were runners-up of the 2013 NFABD TelBru Youth Under-16 National Football League, losing in the final against Al-Idrus Junior. Asnawi began playing for Jerudong FC in the 2009‚Äì10 Brunei Premier League season, and finished fourth with the help of wonderkid Azwan Ali Rahman. Asnawi helped shoulder the burden of Azwan's departure to Brunei Youth Team in 2011, beginning to play in an advanced role and chipping in with goals despite still being 15 years of age. Already an established youth international since 2014, Asnawi was transferred to newly formed Tabuan Muda in 2015, playing for the Under-23 team in the Super League. Tabuan Muda finished fifth in the league in 2015 and 2016. Asnawi returned to Jerudong FC in 2017 after the Super League team of Tabuan Muda was allocated for the Under-18s. He scored his first goal since re- signing for the Jerudong-based team on 30 April against Wijaya FC. Asnawi joined Wijaya at the start of the 2018-19 Brunei Super League. He scored on his debut against MS ABDB on 27 October in a 1‚Äì2 loss. International career Asnawi played for the host nation and defending champions Brunei U21 at the 2014 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy. He played all five matches where Brunei failed to advance from the group stage. Asnawi next played for the under-23s at the 2016 AFC U-23 Championship qualification in Indonesia in March 2015, and later the 28th SEA Games in Singapore the following June. Altogether he made seven appearances, all of them defeats. Asnawi was included in the national squad for the 2016 AFF Suzuki Cup qualification held in Cambodia. He made his international debut as a first-half substitute against hosts Cambodia on 18 October. A fortnight later, he played three games at the 2016 AFC Solidarity Cup in Malaysia where Brunei finished fourth in the new tournament. Asnawi returned to the under-23 side for the 2018 AFC U-23 Championship qualification matches held in Myanmar on 19‚Äì23 July 2017. He was sent off in the second group game against the hosts towards the end of the first half after a high boot.

It is meant to guard the area against the Rajputs. The fort is unique in the area as bricks were only used for its construction and did not use materials such as wood and iron. The fort is developed of burnt bricks in mud mortar which is 113 meters in length and 98 meters in breadth. On the southern side of the castle, another four-sided construction which measures 15 meter √ó 13 meter has it the merely entrance and narrow approach to the internal placement of fort. The entire walls and bastion reflects attenuating look. The thin narrow entrance is accessed via a twisted passage established by 2 heavy and semi circled bastions. The bastion is near to the gateway, and making a section of the 4-sided squarish establishment, is over 9.5 cm tall with a base of having a diameter about 42 meters. The altitude of arched entrance is 7 meters and breadth is 4 meters. The access to the internal section of the fort is via causeway kind room and hall, which is the part of 4-sided construction, itself a castle. The fort is composed of 9 semi circled bastions, while the 2 of them are protecting the primary entrance, four at the edges and one each at the center of the southern, northern and western walls. A four-meter-wide wall extends on the four sides of the castle. It owns two burnt-brick stairs to climb the wall upwards, from the internal side of the castle. The internal portion of the fort consists of the remnants of rooms etc. which might go to recommend that these were the residential luxurious quarters. A minor construction like a prison or dungeon could have been the room of barood khana, or the area to secure ammunition. Talpurs belongs to the Balochi tribe who later settled in Sindh. The Talpurs dynasty encamped in northern Sindh, spoke the Sindhi language very fluently. Soon their successors and associates established a federation against the dynasty of Kalhora. Although, they enjoy good relation with Kalhoras later then and were offered by them to help arrange the scattered Balochi tribes surviving in Sindh. Talpurs are generally known to be as the founder of Sindh‚Äôs Unity. The ruling era of Talpurs in Sindh was from 1783 to 1843. Later, it was captured by the British East India Company commanded by General Charles James Napier. The building is currently undergoing restorations since its drainage might be blocked, leading to water accumulating within the location.

It is a ground orchid with a single, hairy leaf and usually only one yellowish-green and red flower. Description Caladenia reticulata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy leaf, long, wide. A single yellowish-green and red to wholly red flower is borne on a spike tall. The sepals have dark, narrow, club-like glandular tips long. The dorsal sepal is erect at its base but curves forward and is long. The lateral sepals are long and wide and spreading. The petals are slightly shorter and narrower than the lateral sepals and taper to narrow, thread-like tips. The labellum is red or yellowish-green with red markings and is long and wide. The sides of the labellum sometimes have teeth up to long and there are four or six rows of calli which are long near the base of the labellum but decreasing in size towards its tip. Flowering occurs from September to November. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia reticulata was first formally described in 1882 by Robert D. FitzGerald and the description was published in The Gardeners' Chronicle. The specific epithet (reticulata) is a Latin word meaning \\"netted\\" or \\"net-like\\". Distribution and habitat The veined spider orchid is widespread but localised in Victoria near Stawell, Ararat, Horsham and Dunolly where it usually grows in open woodland. In South Australia it occurs in the Southern Lofty and Kangaroo Island bioregions, growing on forested slopes. Conservation Caladenia reticulata is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" in Victoria.

Middle Kingdom (ca. 2055 ‚Äì 1650) The Middle Kingdom was a period of reunification after Mentuhotep II‚Äôs defeat of the rival 10th Dynasty of Herakleopolis that would last for about 400 years.[4] While the Old Kingdom could be defined by their large tombs and pyramids the Middle Kingdom holds no such trait and was more of a time of change.[5] The Middle Kingdom was a time of strong kings and military expansion into lower Nubia led by 12th Dynasty kings Senusret I and Senusret III.[6] The Middle Kingdom was a period of powerful kings and military might. Going in to the 13th dynasty there were many kings and the throne was passed along from ruler to ruler, but this ‚Äúimage of chaos is contradicted, however, by the contemporary documentation on court officials.[7]‚Äù The Middle Kingdom was by many accounts a stable period of powerful kings up until the 13th Dynasty that would eventually transition in to the Second Intermediate Period. Middle Kingdom literature One thing that the Middle Kingdom is known for was in the cultural realm, and the works of literature during this time would later be referred to as classics by Ancient Egyptians.[8] Literature had a strong impact and ‚Äúmany of the works known today were composed in the Middle Kingdom, and later Egyptians saw several of them as classics.[9]‚Äù The writings in the Old Kingdom was somewhat limited, but that changed in the Middle Kingdom when different genres were able to develop.[10] The Middle Kingdom was a period of creativity that was not possible earlier in Egyptian history. Interpretation The Complaints of Khakheperraseneb has been regarded as purely a literary composition. Since the writing was likely during the reigns of Senwosret III or Amenemhet III it is seen as literature because evidence points to these reigns being prosperous.[11] Miriam Lichtheim believes that the Complaints are nothing more than literature although she does leave the door open for possible political criticism.[12] When Gardiner interpreted the work he also saw it as nothing more than a literary composition and ‚Äúfor him the work is no great achievement.[13]‚Äù Evidence showed that Egypt was largely in a prosperous state at the likely time of the writing. Other scholars feel that the writing holds a stronger and more significant message. Jan Assmann for example believes that this piece from Khakheperraseneb is an expression of a problem only authors feel, and that problem is the pressure to create something new.[14] Khakheperraseneb sees the ‚Äúlack of originality among the contemporaries‚Äù of his time and he is very much aware of the repetitiveness of his time and he wants something new to say.[15] Assman continues on by saying that ‚Äúthe bard embodies and performs a tradition, an author changes it by adding to it.[16]‚Äù Fragmented Work? Without any new evidence, it cannot be said for certain, but given the fact that the work that we have is only 20 lines suggests that the writing board is a fraction of the original work.[17] It would be hard to believe that ‚ÄúKhakheperraseneb‚Äôs reputation should have rested on so slender a foundation.[18]‚Äù Further evidence is the fact that Khakheperraseneb ‚Äúis included in the list of sages preserved in Papyrus Chester Beatty IV, and in a similar list inscribed on a tomb wall at Saqqara.[19]‚Äù A writer who is revered would either have had more well-known compositions or his complaints were originally a larger piece and astounded future Egyptians looking back on his work.

It was founded in January 2011 by former Chief Ombudsman, Public Service Commission chairman and Police Commissioner Ila Geno on an anti-corruption platform. He was supported by anti-corruption advocates John Toguata and Daniel Kassa and former National Court judge Nemo Yalo, while Tobias Thomas served as party secretary. It won its first seat in August 2011, when accountant Tobias Kulang, an in-law of Geno, won a by- election in the seat of Kundiawa-Gembogl caused by the death of Joe Mek Teine. Kulang was re-elected at the 2012 election, but the party won no other seats. After the election, Kulang as party leader attacked O'Neill for being involved with people who he claimed had been involved in alleged fraud, and vowed to join the opposition to provide public scrutiny of the government's performance. Kulang continued as an outspoken individual member of the opposition after his re-election, although very little was heard of the party itself thereafter. In October 2013, Geno and Kulang jointly filed a constitutional challenge against a law extending the parliamentary grace period from no-confidence motions. However, the next month, in November 2013, Kulang resigned from the PNGCDP and crossed to the government, joining O'Neill's junior coalition partner, the People's Progress Party. After a period of inactivity, Geno reactivated the party for the 2017 election. The party was named as part of a proposed \\"alternative government\\" of opposition parties should the governing People's National Congress fail to win a majority.

It is intended as a comprehensive list of tactical approaches to Software Quality Assurance (more widely colloquially known as Quality Assurance (traditionally called by the acronym \\"QA\\") and general application of the test method (usually just called \\"testing\\" or sometimes \\"developer testing\\"). Installation testing An installation test assures that the system is installed correctly and working at actual customer's hardware.  The box approach  Software testing methods are traditionally divided into white- and black-box testing. These two approaches are used to describe the point of view that a test engineer takes when designing test cases. = White-box testing = White-box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing and structural testing, by seeing the source code) tests internal structures or workings of a program, as opposed to the functionality exposed to the end-user. In white-box testing an internal perspective of the system, as well as programming skills, are used to design test cases. The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determine the appropriate outputs. This is analogous to testing nodes in a circuit, e.g. in-circuit testing (ICT). While white-box testing can be applied at the unit, integration and system levels of the software testing process, it is usually done at the unit level. It can test paths within a unit, paths between units during integration, and between subsystems during a system‚Äìlevel test. Though this method of test design can uncover many errors or problems, it might not detect unimplemented parts of the specification or missing requirements. Techniques used in white-box testing include: * API testing ‚Äì testing of the application using public and private APIs (application programming interfaces) * Code coverage ‚Äì creating tests to satisfy some criteria of code coverage (e.g., the test designer can create tests to cause all statements in the program to be executed at least once) * Fault injection methods ‚Äì intentionally introducing faults to gauge the efficacy of testing strategies * Mutation testing methods * Static testing methods Code coverage tools can evaluate the completeness of a test suite that was created with any method, including black-box testing. This allows the software team to examine parts of a system that are rarely tested and ensures that the most important function points have been tested.Introduction, Code Coverage Analysis, Steve Cornett Code coverage as a software metric can be reported as a percentage for: :* Function coverage, which reports on functions executed :* Statement coverage, which reports on the number of lines executed to complete the test :* Decision coverage, which reports on whether both the True and the False branch of a given test has been executed 100% statement coverage ensures that all code paths or branches (in terms of control flow) are executed at least once. This is helpful in ensuring correct functionality, but not sufficient since the same code may process different inputs correctly or incorrectly. = Black-box testing = Black box diagram Black-box testing treats the software as a \\"black box\\", examining functionality without any knowledge of internal implementation, without seeing the source code. The testers are only aware of what the software is supposed to do, not how it does it. Black-box testing methods include: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, all-pairs testing, state transition tables, decision table testing, fuzz testing, model- based testing, use case testing, exploratory testing and specification-based testing. Specification-based testing aims to test the functionality of software according to the applicable requirements. This level of testing usually requires thorough test cases to be provided to the tester, who then can simply verify that for a given input, the output value (or behavior), either \\"is\\" or \\"is not\\" the same as the expected value specified in the test case. Test cases are built around specifications and requirements, i.e., what the application is supposed to do. It uses external descriptions of the software, including specifications, requirements, and designs to derive test cases. These tests can be functional or non-functional, though usually functional. Specification-based testing may be necessary to assure correct functionality, but it is insufficient to guard against complex or high-risk situations. One advantage of the black box technique is that no programming knowledge is required. Whatever biases the programmers may have had, the tester likely has a different set and may emphasize different areas of functionality. On the other hand, black-box testing has been said to be \\"like a walk in a dark labyrinth without a flashlight.\\" Because they do not examine the source code, there are situations when a tester writes many test cases to check something that could have been tested by only one test case, or leaves some parts of the program untested. This method of test can be applied to all levels of software testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance. It typically comprises most if not all testing at higher levels, but can also dominate unit testing as well. Visual testing The aim of visual testing is to provide developers with the ability to examine what was happening at the point of software failure by presenting the data in such a way that the developer can easily find the information she or he requires, and the information is expressed clearly. At the core of visual testing is the idea that showing someone a problem (or a test failure), rather than just describing it, greatly increases clarity and understanding. Visual testing therefore requires the recording of the entire test process ‚Äì capturing everything that occurs on the test system in video format. Output videos are supplemented by real-time tester input via picture-in-a-picture webcam and audio commentary from microphones. Visual testing provides a number of advantages. The quality of communication is increased drastically because testers can show the problem (and the events leading up to it) to the developer as opposed to just describing it and the need to replicate test failures will cease to exist in many cases. The developer will have all the evidence he or she requires of a test failure and can instead focus on the cause of the fault and how it should be fixed. Visual testing is particularly well-suited for environments that deploy agile methods in their development of software, since agile methods require greater communication between testers and developers and collaboration within small teams. Ad hoc testing and exploratory testing are important methodologies for checking software integrity, because they require less preparation time to implement, while the important bugs can be found quickly. In ad hoc testing, where testing takes place in an improvised, impromptu way, the ability of a test tool to visually record everything that occurs on a system becomes very important in order to document the steps taken to uncover the bug. Visual testing is gathering recognition in customer acceptance and usability testing, because the test can be used by many individuals involved in the development process. For the customer, it becomes easy to provide detailed bug reports and feedback, and for program users, visual testing can record user actions on screen, as well as their voice and image, to provide a complete picture at the time of software failure for the developers. = Grey-box testing = Grey-box testing (American spelling: gray-box testing) involves having knowledge of internal data structures and algorithms for purposes of designing tests, while executing those tests at the user, or black-box level. The tester is not required to have full access to the software's source code. Manipulating input data and formatting output do not qualify as grey-box, because the input and output are clearly outside of the \\"black box\\" that we are calling the system under test. This distinction is particularly important when conducting integration testing between two modules of code written by two different developers, where only the interfaces are exposed for test. However, tests that require modifying a back-end data repository such as a database or a log file does qualify as grey-box, as the user would not normally be able to change the data repository in normal production operations. Grey-box testing may also include reverse engineering to determine, for instance, boundary values or error messages. By knowing the underlying concepts of how the software works, the tester makes better-informed testing choices while testing the software from outside. Typically, a grey-box tester will be permitted to set up an isolated testing environment with activities such as seeding a database. The tester can observe the state of the product being tested after performing certain actions such as executing SQL statements against the database and then executing queries to ensure that the expected changes have been reflected. Grey-box testing implements intelligent test scenarios, based on limited information. This will particularly apply to data type handling, exception handling, and so on.  Automated testing  Many programming groups are relying more and more on automated testing, especially groups that use test-driven development. There are many frameworks to write tests in, and continuous integration software will run tests automatically every time code is checked into a version control system. While automation cannot reproduce everything that a human can do (and all the ways they think of doing it), it can be very useful for regression testing. However, it does require a well- developed test suite of testing scripts in order to be truly useful. = Automated testing tools = Program testing and fault detection can be aided significantly by testing tools and debuggers. Testing/debug tools include features such as: * Program monitors, permitting full or partial monitoring of program code including:  Instruction set simulator, permitting complete instruction level monitoring and trace facilities  Hypervisor, permitting complete control of the execution of program code including:-  Program animation, permitting step-by-step execution and conditional breakpoint at source level or in machine code  Code coverage reports * Formatted dump or symbolic debugging, tools allowing inspection of program variables on error or at chosen points * Automated functional GUI(Graphical User Interface) testing tools are used to repeat system-level tests through the GUI * Benchmarks, allowing run-time performance comparisons to be made * Performance analysis (or profiling tools) that can help to highlight hot spots and resource usage Some of these features may be incorporated into a single composite tool or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). = Abstraction of application layers as applied to automated testing = There are generally four recognized levels of tests: unit testing, integration testing, component interface testing, and system testing. Tests are frequently grouped by where they are added in the software development process, or by the level of specificity of the test. The main levels during the development process as defined by the SWEBOK guide are unit-, integration-, and system testing that are distinguished by the test target without implying a specific process model. Other test levels are classified by the testing objective. There are two different levels of tests from the perspective of customers: low-level testing (LLT) and high-level testing (HLT). LLT is a group of tests for different level components of software application or product. HLT is a group of tests for the whole software application or product.  Unit testing  Unit testing refers to tests that verify the functionality of a specific section of code, usually at the function level. In an object-oriented environment, this is usually at the class level, and the minimal unit tests include the constructors and destructors. These types of tests are usually written by developers as they work on code (white-box style), to ensure that the specific function is working as expected. One function might have multiple tests, to catch corner cases or other branches in the code. Unit testing alone cannot verify the functionality of a piece of software, but rather is used to ensure that the building blocks of the software work independently from each other. Unit testing is a software development process that involves synchronized application of a broad spectrum of defect prevention and detection strategies in order to reduce software development risks, time, and costs. It is performed by the software developer or engineer during the construction phase of the software development lifecycle. Rather than replace traditional QA focuses, it augments it. Unit testing aims to eliminate construction errors before code is promoted to QA; this strategy is intended to increase the quality of the resulting software as well as the efficiency of the overall development and QA process. Depending on the organization's expectations for software development, unit testing might include static code analysis, data- flow analysis, metrics analysis, peer code reviews, code coverage analysis and other software verification practices.  Integration testing  Integration testing is any type of software testing that seeks to verify the interfaces between components against a software design. Software components may be integrated in an iterative way or all together (\\"big bang\\"). Normally the former is considered a better practice since it allows interface issues to be located more quickly and fixed. Integration testing works to expose defects in the interfaces and interaction between integrated components (modules). Progressively larger groups of tested software components corresponding to elements of the architectural design are integrated and tested until the software works as a system.  Component interface testing  The practice of component interface testing can be used to check the handling of data passed between various units, or subsystem components, beyond full integration testing between those units. The data being passed can be considered as \\"message packets\\" and the range or data types can be checked, for data generated from one unit, and tested for validity before being passed into another unit. One option for interface testing is to keep a separate log file of data items being passed, often with a timestamp logged to allow analysis of thousands of cases of data passed between units for days or weeks. Tests can include checking the handling of some extreme data values while other interface variables are passed as normal values. Unusual data values in an interface can help explain unexpected performance in the next unit. Component interface testing is a variation of black-box testing, with the focus on the data values beyond just the related actions of a subsystem component.  System testing  System testing tests a completely integrated system to verify that the system meets its requirements. For example, a system test might involve testing a logon interface, then creating and editing an entry, plus sending or printing results, followed by summary processing or deletion (or archiving) of entries, then logoff.  Operational acceptance testing  Operational acceptance is used to conduct operational readiness (pre- release) of a product, service or system as part of a quality management system. OAT is a common type of non-functional software testing, used mainly in software development and software maintenance projects. This type of testing focuses on the operational readiness of the system to be supported, and/or to become part of the production environment. Hence, it is also known as operational readiness testing (ORT) or Operations readiness and assurance (OR&A;) testing. Functional testing within OAT is limited to those tests which are required to verify the non-functional aspects of the system. In addition, the software testing should ensure that the portability of the system, as well as working as expected, does not also damage or partially corrupt its operating environment or cause other processes within that environment to become inoperative.Whitepaper: Operational Acceptance ‚Äì an application of the ISO 29119 Software Testing standard. May 2015 Anthony Woods, Capgemini Compatibility testing A common cause of software failure (real or perceived) is a lack of its compatibility with other application software, operating systems (or operating system versions, old or new), or target environments that differ greatly from the original (such as a terminal or GUI application intended to be run on the desktop now being required to become a web application, which must render in a web browser). For example, in the case of a lack of backward compatibility, this can occur because the programmers develop and test software only on the latest version of the target environment, which not all users may be running. This results in the unintended consequence that the latest work may not function on earlier versions of the target environment, or on older hardware that earlier versions of the target environment was capable of using. Sometimes such issues can be fixed by proactively abstracting operating system functionality into a separate program module or library. Smoke and sanity testing Sanity testing determines whether it is reasonable to proceed with further testing. Smoke testing consists of minimal attempts to operate the software, designed to determine whether there are any basic problems that will prevent it from working at all. Such tests can be used as build verification test.  Regression testing  Regression testing focuses on finding defects after a major code change has occurred. Specifically, it seeks to uncover software regressions, as degraded or lost features, including old bugs that have come back. Such regressions occur whenever software functionality that was previously working correctly, stops working as intended. Typically, regressions occur as an unintended consequence of program changes, when the newly developed part of the software collides with the previously existing code. Common methods of regression testing include re-running previous sets of test cases and checking whether previously fixed faults have re-emerged. The depth of testing depends on the phase in the release process and the risk of the added features. They can either be complete, for changes added late in the release or deemed to be risky, or be very shallow, consisting of positive tests on each feature, if the changes are early in the release or deemed to be of low risk. Regression testing is typically the largest test effort in commercial software development, Paul Ammann; Jeff Offutt (2008). [https://books.google.com/books?id=leokXF8pLY0C&pg;=PA215 Introduction to Software Testing]. p. 215 of 322 pages. due to checking numerous details in prior software features, and even new software can be developed while using some old test cases to test parts of the new design to ensure prior functionality is still supported.  Acceptance testing  Acceptance testing can mean one of two things: # A smoke test is used as an acceptance test prior to introducing a new build to the main testing process, i.e., before integration or regression. # Acceptance testing performed by the customer, often in their lab environment on their own hardware, is known as user acceptance testing (UAT). Acceptance testing may be performed as part of the hand-off process between any two phases of development.  Alpha testing  Alpha testing is simulated or actual operational testing by potential users/customers or an independent test team at the developers' site. Alpha testing is often employed for off-the-shelf software as a form of internal acceptance testing, before the software goes to beta testing.  Beta testing  Beta testing comes after alpha testing and can be considered a form of external user acceptance testing. Versions of the software, known as beta versions, are released to a limited audience outside of the programming team known as beta testers. The software is released to groups of people so that further testing can ensure the product has few faults or bugs. Beta versions can be made available to the open public to increase the feedback field to a maximal number of future users and to deliver value earlier, for an extended or even indefinite period of time (perpetual beta). Functional vs non- functional testing Functional testing refers to activities that verify a specific action or function of the code. These are usually found in the code requirements documentation, although some development methodologies work from use cases or user stories. Functional tests tend to answer the question of \\"can the user do this\\" or \\"does this particular feature work.\\" Non-functional testing refers to aspects of the software that may not be related to a specific function or user action, such as scalability or other performance, behavior under certain constraints, or security. Testing will determine the breaking point, the point at which extremes of scalability or performance leads to unstable execution. Non-functional requirements tend to be those that reflect the quality of the product, particularly in the context of the suitability perspective of its users. Continuous testing Continuous testing is the process of executing automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline to obtain immediate feedback on the business risks associated with a software release candidate.Part of the Pipeline: Why Continuous Testing Is Essential, by Adam Auerbach, TechWell Insights August 2015The Relationship between Risk and Continuous Testing: An Interview with Wayne Ariola, by Cameron Philipp-Edmonds, Stickyminds December 2015 Continuous testing includes the validation of both functional requirements and non- functional requirements; the scope of testing extends from validating bottom- up requirements or user stories to assessing the system requirements associated with overarching business goals.DevOps: Are You Pushing Bugs to Clients Faster, by Wayne Ariola and Cynthia Dunlop, PNSQC October 2015DevOps and QA: What‚Äôs the real cost of quality?, by Ericka Chickowski, DevOps.com June 2015Shift Left and Put Quality First, by Adam Auerbach, TechWell Insights October 2014  Destructive testing  Destructive testing attempts to cause the software or a sub-system to fail. It verifies that the software functions properly even when it receives invalid or unexpected inputs, thereby establishing the robustness of input validation and error-management routines. Software fault injection, in the form of fuzzing, is an example of failure testing. Various commercial non-functional testing tools are linked from the software fault injection page; there are also numerous open-source and free software tools available that perform destructive testing. Software performance testing Performance testing is generally executed to determine how a system or sub-system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload. It can also serve to investigate, measure, validate or verify other quality attributes of the system, such as scalability, reliability and resource usage. Load testing is primarily concerned with testing that the system can continue to operate under a specific load, whether that be large quantities of data or a large number of users. This is generally referred to as software scalability. The related load testing activity of when performed as a non-functional activity is often referred to as endurance testing. Volume testing is a way to test software functions even when certain components (for example a file or database) increase radically in size. Stress testing is a way to test reliability under unexpected or rare workloads. Stability testing (often referred to as load or endurance testing) checks to see if the software can continuously function well in or above an acceptable period. There is little agreement on what the specific goals of performance testing are. The terms load testing, performance testing, scalability testing, and volume testing, are often used interchangeably. Real-time software systems have strict timing constraints. To test if timing constraints are met, real-time testing is used. Usability testing Usability testing is to check if the user interface is easy to use and understand. It is concerned mainly with the use of the application. Accessibility testing Accessibility testing may include compliance with standards such as: * Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 * Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 * Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Security testing Security testing is essential for software that processes confidential data to prevent system intrusion by hackers. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines this as a \\"type of testing conducted to evaluate the degree to which a test item, and associated data and information, are protected so that unauthorised persons or systems cannot use, read or modify them, and authorized persons or systems are not denied access to them.\\"ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1:2013 ‚Äì Software and Systems Engineering ‚Äì Software Testing ‚Äì Part 1 ‚Äì Concepts and Definitions; Section 4.38 Internationalization and localization testing  The general ability of software to be internationalized and localized can be automatically tested without actual translation, by using pseudolocalization. It will verify that the application still works, even after it has been translated into a new language or adapted for a new culture (such as different currencies or time zones). Actual translation to human languages must be tested, too. Possible localization failures include: * Software is often localized by translating a list of strings out of context, and the translator may choose the wrong translation for an ambiguous source string. * Technical terminology may become inconsistent if the project is translated by several people without proper coordination or if the translator is imprudent. * Literal word-for-word translations may sound inappropriate, artificial or too technical in the target language. * Untranslated messages in the original language may be left hard coded in the source code. * Some messages may be created automatically at run time and the resulting string may be ungrammatical, functionally incorrect, misleading or confusing. * Software may use a keyboard shortcut which has no function on the source language's keyboard layout, but is used for typing characters in the layout of the target language. * Software may lack support for the character encoding of the target language. * Fonts and font sizes which are appropriate in the source language may be inappropriate in the target language; for example, CJK characters may become unreadable if the font is too small. * A string in the target language may be longer than the software can handle. This may make the string partly invisible to the user or cause the software to crash or malfunction. * Software may lack proper support for reading or writing bi-directional text. * Software may display images with text that was not localized. * Localized operating systems may have differently named system configuration files and environment variables and different formats for date and currency. Development testing \\"Development testing\\" is a software development process that involves synchronized application of a broad spectrum of defect prevention and detection strategies in order to reduce software development risks, time, and costs. It is performed by the software developer or engineer during the construction phase of the software development lifecycle. Rather than replace traditional QA focuses, it augments it. Development Testing aims to eliminate construction errors before code is promoted to QA; this strategy is intended to increase the quality of the resulting software as well as the efficiency of the overall development and QA process. Depending on the organization's expectations for software development, Development Testing might include static code analysis, data flow analysis, metrics analysis, peer code reviews, unit testing, code coverage analysis, traceability, and other software verification practices. A/B testing A/B testing is basically a comparison of two outputs, generally when only one variable has changed: run a test, change one thing, run the test again, compare the results. This is more useful with more small-scale situations, but very useful in fine-tuning any program. With more complex projects, multivariant testing can be done. Concurrent testing In concurrent testing, the focus is on the performance while continuously running with normal input and under normal operational conditions, as opposed to stress testing, or fuzz testing. Memory leaks, as well as basic faults are easier to find with this method. Conformance testing or type testing In software testing, conformance testing verifies that a product performs according to its specified standards. Compilers, for instance, are extensively tested to determine whether they meet the recognized standard for that language.

She is the founder and chair of the Women of the Don NGO, which was set up in 1993. In 2016 Valentina's long service to these causes was recognised by two international awards. One was a special prize announced in October 2016, to be given concurrently with the annual Anna Politkovskaya Award.Valentina Cherevatenko, \\"A letter to Anna: what I didn't get to say\\", Rights in Russia, 27 March 2017. (The main 2016 prize-winner was Jineth Bedoya Lima; she and Valentina received their prizes in London on 11 March 2017.)See RAW in WAR website. The other award is a new prize jointly created by the French and German governments. It was awarded for the first time in December 2016 in Berlin to 15 men and women from all over the world.\\"We respect people who defend others\\", Novaya gazeta, 3 December 2016 (in Russian). Cherevatenko was given these prizes in recognition of past achievement and as a response to present harassment. The Russian government has shown its displeasure with her recent activities and those of the Women of the Don by bringing criminal charges against Valentina Cherevatenko under the 2012 Foreign Agent law. If convicted she faces a heavy fine or two years' deprivation of liberty. In late July 2017, the charges against Cherevatenko were dropped.\\"Charges Dropped Against Activist for 'Non-Compliance' With Foreign Agents Law\\", Moscow Times, 25 July 2017. Early life Valentina grew up in Novocherkassk in the Rostov Region and as a child witnessed part of the 1962 events in the city (see Novocherkassk massacre). Later in life she learned that her mother, then 23, had saved the life of a policeman during those confused and tragic days.\\"They haven't broken us yet\\", Cherevatenko interview with BBC Russian Service, 10 March 2017 (translation, Rights in Russia). Her father was Ukrainian; the city of Novocherkassk has many historical ties with Ukraine, as do its present inhabitants (pop. 170,233 in 2016). First intervention in an armed conflict, 1990 Valentina's first intervention in an armed conflict came when the USSR was still in existence. Late in 1990 the army recruitment offices in Novocherkassk called up the city's middle-aged reservists, put them on airplanes and sent them to Baku, the capital of Soviet Azerbaijan. This was not the local six-monthly training camps that such men usually attended and rumours of the continuing unrest and violence in Azerbaijan alarmed people whose husbands and fathers had now been sent there (see Baku pogrom). The director of the factory where Valentina was working gave her and her team access to his telex and they sent urgent messages to Gorbachev, Yeltsin and other decision-makers in the Soviet and RSFSR governments. As a result, the men returned home. They had not advanced beyond the airport in Baku or engaged in combat, but some had already been killed by stray bullets.Account given by Valentina Cherevatenko on 9 March 2017 at a gathering in Pushkin House, Bloomsbury. Creation of Women of the Don, 1993 \\"The Union of Women of the Don is unique,\\" wrote an OpenDemocracy profile of the organisation and its leader Valentina Cherevatenko in 2016. Set up in 1993 to help local women left unemployed in the wake of the Soviet collapse, over the past 23 years it had turned into \\"one of Russia‚Äôs largest human and civil rights NGOs\\".\\"I am convinced that the war {in eastern Ukraine} will affect us all\\" (Valentina Cherevatenko), Open Democracy website, 17 November 2016. Visit to Chechnya, 1995 Harassment by Russian authorities, 2012 onwards In 2012, after Putin's re-election as President of Russia for a third term, a law was passed that required NGOs receiving funding from abroad and engaging in \\"political activities\\" to register as Foreign Agents (see Russian foreign agent law). Like many other long-standing non- commercial organisations, the Women of the Don refused to adopt this denigrating term or voluntarily add themselves to the Register organised by the Ministry of Justice. Pressure was then brought to bear and Cherevatenko and her colleagues decided to divide the Women of the Don into two distinct organisations, one dealing with matters at the local level (the Union of the Women of the Don, operating in the Rostov Region), and the other operating in Russia and abroad (the \\"Women of the Don\\" Foundation for Civil Society and Human Rights).Civil Society under Attack: the Right to Freedom of Association in Russia, January 2015 to September 2016 (October 2016), see \\"A contested definition\\" in Legislative Developments. The report may be found on the Rights in Russia website. The Union of the Women of the Don was, nevertheless, declared a Foreign Agent in 2014. Two years later that designation was withdrawn, though it still applied to the companion Women of the Don Foundation. In June 2016 charges were brought against Valentina Cherevatenko herself (see below). Contacts with Nadia Savchenko, 2015-2016 In her role as a member of the Public Oversight Agency for places of confinement run by the Federal Penitentiary Service in the Rostov Region Valentina paid regular visits to the jailed Ukrainian airforce pilot Nadia Savchenko after she was moved to the Novocherkassk pre-trial detention centre in July 2015.\\"Where have they moved Nadia Savchenko?\\" Broadcast on TSN news service (in Ukrainian). Savchenko was held there before and after her conviction at the trial in Rostov in March 2016. During this period Cherevatenko kept the media informed about Savchenko's health‚Äîshe was then refusing to eat or drink‚Äîand Valentina's reports were published in a variety of outlets, before and after the trial when Savchenko was due for transfer to a penal colony.\\"Savchenko is in a critical condition\\", Bagnet website, 17 April 2016 (in Russian). As a consequence of this behaviour Cherevatenko lost her position with the Oversight Agency. People's diplomacy and the Minsk Accords On 24 July 2015 Valentina and the Women of the Don suggested, in an address to the Presidential Council on Civil Society and Human Rights, that people's diplomacy should also become part of the Minsk Agreements, establishing terms for ending armed conflict in eastern Ukraine and ensuring respect for the agreements on all sides.\\"A 'civilian Minsk' - The Women of the Don call for the involvement of civil society in the implementation of the Minsk Accords\\", 24 July 2015, website of The Russian Federation Presidential Council on Human Rights and Civil Society.. Cherevatenko said that such preliminary meetings had already taken place between women from Ukraine and Russia, involving journalists, members of NGOs and action groups; specialists‚Äîsuch as psychologists, doctors and others‚Äîwere also ready to help individuals, and support the process of dialogue. \\"A great many initiatives are already being implemented,\\" she said: \\"to overcome the breakdown in [formerly] close relations, to withstand propaganda and aid the formation of a critical approach, and to help those suffering from the effects of post-traumatic stress\\". Charges against Cherevatenko, 2016-2017 In late June 2016 Valentina Cherevatenko was the first individual against whom a criminal investigation was formally opened under the 2012 law on \\"foreign agent\\" NGOs.\\"First criminal case against a Foreign Agent\\", Novaya gazeta, No 72, 6 July 2016 (in Russian). She was accused of \\"malicious evasion‚Äù of the duties imposed on ‚ÄúNGOs that perform the functions of a foreign agent\\", and if convicted could pay a heavy fine or be given a two-year sentence in a penal colony. This attack on a prominent, veteran rights defender aroused concern in Russia and abroad.\\"Prominent rights defender declared a suspect under foreign agents law\\", Amnesty International, 1 July 2016.

Overview On November 9, 2016, JR Kyushu released a press release detailing its new themed limited express, Kawasemi Yamasemi, scheduled to debut in spring 2017. On December 16, 2016, it was revealed that the new train would begin operation on March 4, 2017. It is currently in normal operation. The Kawasemi Yamasemi is named for the Kingfisher and Crested Kingfisher, and follows the Kuma River along its route. It features the birds extensively as its motif. Design The train was designed by Eiji Mitooka and Don Design and Associates, and used local resources (such as Japanese cypress and cedar) extensively in its construction. Onboard sales will also consist of local products. The President of JR Kyushu, Toshihiko Aoyagi, at the train's unveiling, was quoted as saying that he hoped the train would run as a symbol of recovery (from the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes).

He is most known for his work at Monticello, Montpelier, Bremo, and the University of Virginia. Early life Neilson was born around 1770 in the town of Ballycarry, County Antrim, Ireland near Belfast. In the 1790s, Neilson worked as an apprentice to a Belfast architect. At the time, Neilson was also part of a brewing rebellion against the British; and as a result, he was captured along with two of his brothers during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. One of these brothers, William, only fifteen years old, was hanged. John Neilson and his brother Sam were banished and sent on exile ships to the West Indies. John Neilson ended up in Philadelphia, where he became a naturalized citizen on September 28, 1804. Career Sometime in 1804 Neilson would meet Thomas Jefferson, who was then the third President of the United States. From that point until 1808 Neilson would live and work as a joiner at Monticello, Jefferson's home in Albemarle County, Virginia. It was at Monticello that Neilson began his long collaboration with fellow master joiner James Dinsmore, who was also an Irishman from Ulster. Then from 1809-10, Neilson worked on the expansion of Montpelier, the home of the fourth President of the United States, James Madison, located in Orange County, Virginia. From 1817 to 1820, Neilson worked at Bremo, the Fluvanna County, Virginia plantation of John Hartwell Cocke. Neilson's most important work took place at this estate because it was Neilson who helped design Upper Bremo by interpreting all the ideas and sketches of Cocke. Indeed, it was Neilson who gave this Palladian masterpiece its final appearance. Bremo has been described by Fiske Kimball as the most nearly perfect \\"of all the houses in the Jeffersonian tradition.\\" Neilson later went on to assist in the construction of the University of Virginia. He worked on Pavilions IX and X, seven dormitories, the Rotunda, and the Anatomical Theater. Death Neilson died June 24, 1827 at his estate in Keene, Virginia, near Charlottesville. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Charlottesville's Maplewood Cemetery. Neilson's estate included a number of his own drawings and paintings: a \\"book of drawings of the U.Va. by Jno. Neilson,\\" a \\"book of drawings of Ionic, Doric and Corinthian Orders by John Neilson,\\" a \\"book of observations of the orders of architecture and intended to accompany this book of drawings of the orders,\\" \\"3 books of drawings with drawings on oil paper,\\" \\"a book of drawings and designs,\\" and drawings of the Rotunda and two Pavilions.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and one or two green, yellow and red flowers. Until 1971 It was known as a variety of the green comb spider orchid Caladenia dilatata then, until 1989 as a variety of the clubbed spider orchid, Caladenia longiclavata.labellum detail  Description  Caladenia rhomboidiformis is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, long and about wide. One or two green, yellow and red flowers long, wide are borne on a stalk tall. The sepals have yellowish to brown, club-like glandular tips long. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide. The lateral sepals are long, wide, turn stiffly downwards and roughly parallel to each other. The petals are long, wide, spread widely and are also turned stiffly downwards. The labellum is long, wide, broadly diamond-shaped and white to yellow with a deep red tip. The sides of the labellum have greenish teeth up to long and the tip is curled under. There are four rows of deep red calli along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from September to October.  Taxonomy and naming  This orchid was first described in 1930 by Edith Coleman who gave it the name Caladenia dilatata var. rhomboidiformis and published the description in The Victorian Naturalist. In 1971, Alex George recognised it as Caladenia longiclavata var. rhomboidiformis and in 1989 Mark Clements and Stephen Hopper raised it to species status. The specific epithet (rhomboidiformis) is derived from the Ancient Greek word ·ø•œåŒºŒ≤ŒøœÇ rhombos meaning \\"rhombus\\", the suffix oid meaning \\"likeness\\" and the Latin word forma meaning \\"shape\\" or \\"figure\\" referring to the diamond-shaped labellum of this orchid.  Distribution and habitat  The diamond spider orchid is found between Busselton and Augusta in the Jarrah Forest and Warren biogeographic regions where it grows in a variety of habitats but often in jarrah forest, or Banksia or sheoak woodland. Conservation Caladenia rhomboidiformis is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

The club fields a team in both the Men's SBL (MSBL) and Women's SBL (WSBL). The club is a division of Stirling Basketball Association (SBA), the major administrative basketball organisation in the City of Stirling. The SBA was established in 1971, and in 2012, came under the umbrella of the Churches of Christ Sport & Recreation Association (CCSRA). The Senators play their home games at Warwick Stadium. Club history =Background= The creation of Stirling Basketball Association began in the late 1960s when a group of 15‚Äì17-year-old boys from the Tuart Hill Junior Basketball Club formed a new club because there was no clear pathway for them to continue their basketball careers in the Western Australian Senior District Basketball Competition. Introduced to the sport of basketball at Tuart Hill High School, the boys dominated the state's junior competitions through the 1960s and provided the bulk of the Western Australian junior state team representatives. At that time, Tuart Hill was a feeder club for the Perth Basketball Club, the leading senior club in Western Australian basketball. Limited selection meant that many boys would be left with the prospect of not having a senior career in basketball after dominating the sport in junior ranks. Led by Alan Simmonds, a number of boys from Tuart Hill approached the state association and proposed that a new district association be formed called the Stirling Basketball Association. The Stirling proposal was based on the incorporation of the Tuart Hill Boys and Norths Girls junior basketball clubs. The proposal was accepted and Stirling Basketball Association was formed in 1971, providing a pathway for all Tuart Hill boys and Norths girls basketball players to enter the Western Australian Basketball Association senior competitions under the Stirling name. The Senators had the most successful program in the era of the District Competition, as they claimed the John Leonard Perpetual Shield four times and competed for it a further six times Nicknamed the Senators, the inaugural Stirling 'A' Grade District men's team competed for the first time in the 1972 season. While Simmonds became the first Club President and team captain, Colin James from New South Wales became the team's first head coach. In just their third season, the Senators men reached their first ever grand final, where they lost 80‚Äì67 to Swan Districts. The following year, the team again made the grand final, this time winning 69‚Äì68 over Perth to claim their maiden premiership. Between 1974 and 1987, the Senators men competed in 10 A-Grade grand finals, where they won four premierships (1975, 1978, 1981 and 1982). Furthermore, the Senators women were also a force in the District Competition, as they won the inaugural women's A-Grade premiership in 1974 before competing in grand finals in 1977, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1987 and 1988, winning five titles (1974, 1981, 1984, 1985 and 1988). 1978 proved a milestone year as the club was selected to represent Western Australia in the National Australian Club Championships. This competition was a precursor to the NBL. At the 1978 Australian Club Championships in Adelaide, the Senators were the surprise team of the championships. While expected to lose early in the qualifying rounds, the team reached the final to become the first Western Australian team to do so. There they lost to the highly-credentialed Nunawading Spectres led by Bill Palmer and Alan Black, despite leading by a point at half time. =SBL= Early years and success 1989 saw the formation of the State Basketball League (SBL) with both a men's and women's competition. Stirling, trading as the Senators, entered a team into both the MSBL and WSBL. In 1990, the men's team earned a seventh-place finish with a 13‚Äì13 record before reaching the MSBL Grand Final, while the women's team claimed the minor premiership with a first-place finish a 20‚Äì4 record, before too reaching the WSBL Grand Final. Both teams however fell short, with the men losing 114‚Äì91 to the Perth Redbacks and the women losing 70‚Äì67 to the Wanneroo Wolves. For the men, it marked their first and so far only MSBL Grand Final appearance. In 1993, the Senators women returned to the WSBL Grand Final, where they lost 68‚Äì51 to the Swan City Mustangs. In 1994, the women played in their third WSBL Grand Final, this time winning their maiden championship behind a 72‚Äì59 win over the Perry Lakes Hawks. Success eluding the club Success eluded the Senators throughout the 2000s and 2010s. Season 2007 marked a rare successful year for the club, as the women's team won their second minor premiership with a 20‚Äì2 record before reaching their fourth WSBL Grand Final. There they faced the Perry Lakes Hawks, where they were defeated 66‚Äì40. Rebrand In January 2019, the club rebranded as the Warwick Senators. In August 2019, the Senators women reached their first WSBL Grand Final since 2007, where they lost 85‚Äì56 to the Rockingham Flames. Notable club figures In July 2014, club legend and Perth Wildcats great Mike Ellis was honoured with his No. 6 jersey being retired. Ellis began playing for Stirling in 1974 at the age of 17, and was in the club's first premiership team the following year. In the early 1980s, Ellis averaged over 30 points a game for five consecutive seasons and throughout his NBL career with the Perth Wildcats, he continued to play with the Senators. After his retirement from the Wildcats, Ellis continued to play with the Senators until 1998. Since retirement, Ellis has continued to be a key figure in the life of the club, contributing on every level from coaching junior and SBL teams to playing key leadership roles. In July 2018, one of the club's all-time best players, Carmie Olowoyo, had his No. 42 jersey retired by the Senators. Olowoyo played over 260 games for the Senators, beginning his career in 1995 before ending his career in 2010.

It depicts a group of women within a mosquito net preparing for an overnight visit. Background Ukiyo-e art flourished in Japan during the Edo period from the 17th to 19th centuries, and took as its primary subjects courtesans, kabuki actors, and others associated with the \\"floating world\\" lifestyle of the pleasure districts. Alongside paintings, mass-produced woodblock prints were a major form of the genre. In the mid-18th century full-colour ' prints became common, printed using a large number of woodblocks, one for each colour. A prominent genre was ' (\\"pictures of beauties\\"), which depicted most often courtesans and geisha at leisure, and promoted the entertainments of the pleasure districts. Kitagawa Utamaro (‚Äì1806) made his name in the 1790s with his bijin ≈çkubi-e (\\"large-headed pictures of beautiful women\\") portraits, focusing on the head and upper torso, a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors. Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background. Utamaro's individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm. Publication The multicolour nishiki-e prints in the horizontal triptych are each ≈çban-sized, measuring about . They were published by in . On each print appears the title in a corner and the signature Utamaro hitsu (, \\"brush of Utamaro\\"). Description and analysis The scene depicts women in and outside a mosquito net. Outside in the centre stands a woman changing into nightclothes, and behind her to the right an servant folds a tomesode, a ceremonial black kimono worn by married women. The kimono bears a mon crest. From inside, a woman to the right holding an uchiwa hand fan in her hands and folded sheets of kaishi paper in her mouth lifts the net as if to get out. In the middle, another woman removes a kanzashi as she prepares to go to sleep. To the left sits a woman of apparent middle age; her eyebrows are shaved off, indicating she is married. She looks outside to the left at a woman hanging the net up, and appears to be chatting with her.

Biography  Vasyl Ponikarov was born on 26 August 1929 in the village Dolynske of Ananyiv Raion of Odessa Oblast (Ukraine). His childhood coincided with the years of the Second World War. After 7 years of schooling, he left his native village. After the end of the war Vasyl continued his studies firstly in the A.S. Makarenko Tiraspol Pedagogical College (1947‚Äì1948), lately in the Odessa Art school (1949‚Äì1958). In the Art school his pedagogues were , , L.O. Tokareva-Aleksandrovych. Leonid Ovsiiovych Muchnyk while getting acquainted with the works of Vasyl advised him: \\"You should to paint in watercolor. As I think, it's yours\\". Ponikarov was called up for military service after the first course in the Art school. He was doing his military service in Yevpatoria. The military base where Vasyl was in the service appreciated a talent of young artist by entrusting to his charge all visual agitation (leaflets, placards). His gift and high appreciation of his effort as an artist culminated in increase of a duration of military service. Vasyl Ponikarov served longer than needed ‚Äì three and one half years instead of three years. After the demobilisation Vasyl continued his studies within the walls of the same Art school in Odessa . Three years after graduation from the Art school Vasyl Ponikarov becomes a student of Moscow Polygraphic Institute (1961‚Äì1970). Over this years his pedagogues were Y.K. Burdzhelyan, B.A. Sholokhov, G.T. Goroshchenko. Entering of Vasyl into the Artists' Union of the USSR (1971) was recommended by , , A.L. Yakovlev who remarked considerable growth of mastery of the artist after graduation from the Institute. Background of Vasyl Ponikarov already consisted of art works that had been exposed in all of the USSR. From 1980 onwards Vasyl Ponikarov painted on journeys on the ocean liner \\"Fedor Shalyapin\\", where he served as a staff artist. Like so, the paintings were made, those on which the artist pictured what he saw in Italy, France, Spain, Turkey, Egypt, Germany.  ≈íuvre  Landscape painting and still life were genres Ponikarov gave preference to. He painted using the wet-on-wet technique in watercolor on the premoistened paper that deprived dabs of paint of hardness. The artist painted in transparent watercolor, he didn't combine watercolor with other techniques and precluded the use of white paint (titanium dioxide PW6 or zinc oxide PW4) to obtain white color. White color is unpainted paper. Among landscape paintings of Ponikarov there are lots of works pictured Odessa and its environs since almost all his life was connected with this region. Examples of those works: ¬´Arcadia¬ª (1984), ¬´In Odessa Courtyard¬ª (1984), ¬´Winter on the Big Fountain¬ª (1986), ¬´Odessa. Proletarian boulevard¬ª (1986), ¬´Ilyichyovsk. Lighthouse¬ª (1986). However, Vasyl created a good many of his watercolor paintings on his journeys across Soviet republics and abroad: ¬´Dombay¬ª (1972), ¬´Karelian pines¬ª (1975), ¬´Lake in Sedniv¬ª (1980), ¬´Caucasian birches¬ª (1981), ¬´Rozluch. Carpathians¬ª (1983), ¬´Holosiivo. Ponds¬ª (1984), ¬´Vylkovo¬ª (1987). On journeys that served him as a source of new impressions artworks cycles like ¬´Ancient monuments¬ª, ¬´Channel Dnepr-Donbass¬ª, ¬´Pushkin reserve¬ª, ¬´In Gurzuf¬ª were painted. Cycles of art works painted abroad contain images of Paris, Rome, London, Prague, Barcelona, Budapest, Istanbul, Jerusalem and Cairo. In landscape painting the artist was giving pride of place to generous gifts of the South of Ukraine ‚Äì juicy, mature vegetables and fruits, vivid flowers. Watercolors of flowers united in series brought him great success. As a \\"King of flowers and emperor of sunflowers\\" a fine art expert from Alexandria M. Sheryf named Vasyl. Vasyl Andriiovych worked a lot and incessantly on floral compositions by moving up images to the frames of pictures, by approaching images as much as possible to spectators. He pictured flowers in contourless sketchy manner that makes possible to reproduce flowering, rustle, smell. As a rule, Vasyl Ponikarov worked on location finishing a watercolor painting in one session. Often he turned to work without planning it in advance. For example, departing somewhere on his car, Vasyl could pull up in the middle of the flowering field and turn to paint. Vasyl Andriiovych by creating several sheets a day for a half of century of his creative activity pictured tens of thousands of artworks that dispersed around the world. Ponikarov in Iryna Tymokhova (a fine art expert) opinion is one of the most productive artists. In this regard on the pages of news paper \\"Vechernyaya Odessa\\" Iryna Tymokhova compared the artist with I.K. Aivazovsky.

The method is versatile as interface structures of different optical regimes, e.g. geometrical and wave optics, can be included. It is very efficient due to the re-usability of the calculated light redistribution properties of the individual interfaces.Tucher, N.; Eisenlohr, J.; Goldschmidt, J. C.; Bl√§si, B. \\"A versatile formalism for optical simulation of textured sheets\\", SPIE Newsroom, It has so far been mainly used to model optical properties of solar cells and solar modules but it is also applicable for example to LEDs or OLEDs with light extraction structures.  History  The development of the OPTOS formalism started in 2015 at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE in Freiburg, Germany. The mathematical formulation has been described in detail in several open access publications. Eisenlohr, J.; Tucher, N.; H√∂hn, O.; Hauser, H.; Peters, M.; Kiefel, P.; Goldschmidt, J.

Continuous updates and a list of OPTOS related publications can be found on ResearchGate.  OPTOS simulation procedure  One key aspect of OPTOS simulations is the division of the modeled system into interface and propagation regions. The light redistribution properties are calculated with the most appropriate method for each interface individually and depending on the relevant structure dimension. Large scale structures can for example be modeled via ray tracing while for interfaces with structure dimensions in the range of the wavelength wave optical approaches like RCWA, FDTD or FEM can be used. Simulation procecure of the OPTOS formalism  System description  The discretization of the complete angular space into a fixed number of angle channels, as second key aspect of the OPTOS formalism, allows representing the angular power distribution within the system by a vector v which consists of one entry for each angle channel. The value of the entry is the power fraction of the corresponding angle channel with respect to the total incident power.  Interface interaction  The light redistribution properties of an interface are represented by the so-called reflection and transmission matrices, R and T. They store for each of the angle channels the redistribution information into other angle channels for light incident onto a certain interface with a certain wavelength. There are in total four different redistribution matrices for each interface, characterized by the incidence direction as well as reflection or transmission redistribution.  Propagation through the sheet  The incoherent propagation of light through the sheet can also be represented by a matrix. If no light redistribution takes occurs on the path, the propagation matrix D is a diagonal matrix. The single entries consist of the Lambert-Beer absorption factor, including cosine of the polar angle and the absorption coefficient of the respective material.  Calculation of optical properties  Using the pre-calculated matrices described above, optical properties like reflectance, transmittance or absorptance within the sheet can be calculated via matrix multiplications [2‚Äì4] and can be performed within seconds or minutes using a standard personal computer. Also a depth-dependent absorption profile can be calculated. This is of special importance for the subsequent electrical simulation of structured silicon solar cells.  OPTOS simulation characteristics  = Strengths = * Versatility ‚Äì Optical systems with interface structures operating in different optical regimes can be accurately simulated. The redistribution properties of each interface are modeled individually with the most suitable method. * Efficiency - The re-usability of the redistribution allow for the very fast simulation of different structure combinations, sheet thickness variations and the optical analysis with respect to different angles of incidence. * Linear polarization can be taken into account by exchanging each entry of the power distribution vector with two entries, one for each polarization direction. Each matrix entry has to be exchanged with a two by two matrix taking also the redistribution between different polarization directions into account. = Limitations = OPTOS couples redistribution properties of different interfaces. If there is no accurate modeling technique to calculate redistribution matrices, such interfaces cannot be included in OPTOS. OPTOS models the propagation through the sheet incoherently. If the sheet thickness becomes very low and interference effects play a significant role, this needs to be handled coherently and not as ‚Äúthick‚Äù sheet. However, as coherently modeled sub-system, it can be included in OPTOS as effective interface. Circular or elliptical polarization effects are not taken into account as all phase information is neglected during the propagation.  Application Examples  The main application of OPTOS has so far been the simulation of: * Solar cells with different front and rear side structures such as random pyramids, the isotexture, the honeycomb texture or diffractive gratings. * The layer stack of solar panels, including the effect of the encapsulation onto the optical solar cell properties as well as the investigation of different angles of incidence. * Complex optical interactions in photovoltaic systems with nanowire solar cells. Alternative fields of application could be: * LEDs or OLEDs with light extraction structures * Display technology, for example brightness enhancement films  References   External links  OPTOS page at Fraunhoer ISE website (includes documentation and download of basic version) OPTOS project on ResearchGate (with continuous updates and a list of OPTOS related publications) Physical optics ","title":"OPTOS formalism"},{"id":"53490634","title":"2012 Tajik Super Cup"},{"id":"53490635","text":"Nimesha Gunasinghe (born 12 June 1995) is a Sri Lankan cricketer.

It was part of a complex of three buildings (including a machine shop and waterworks, now demolished, located across Judd Street) built by Ephraim Shay. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History Ephraim Shay was born in Ohio in 1839. He moved to Michigan in 1864 and eventually to Harbor Springs in 1888. He was already nationally known as the inventor of the Shay locomotive, typically used in logging applications. ON arriving on Harbor Springs, Say built an octagon house for his own use, and a nearby machine shop, where he constructed machines (including some of his eponymous locomotives) and manufacturing tools. About a year after the construction of the machine shop, Shay built a waterworks, which supplied Harbor Springs and Harbor Point with up to 100,000 gallons of water a day. A reservoir was constructed in 1894. Shay lived in his house until his death in 1916. The house was sold in 1924/25, and housed a series of commercial shops. As of 2017, it is privately owned and has been carefully restored. Shay sold the waterworks to the city of Harbor Springs in the late 1890s. The machine shop was later used as a city garage, and then as the city Fire Hall. Both buildings have been subsequently demolished, leaving the Hexagon House as the only remaining structure in the complex. Description The Shay Complex is composed of three structures: Ephraim Shay's private residence (known as the \\"Hexagon House\\"), his machine shop, and the waterworks. The Hexagon House, located at 396 East Main Street, is sheathed entirely of metal on a foundation of cut stone. The roof, originally of metal sheet, was later covered with asphalt shingles. The sheets of metal used to construct the house were embossed to give the appearance of brick. Interior walls are of pressed steel. The main body of the house is a two-story hexagon shape, and surrounding the center structure are four single-story hexagonal wings, each one a single room with five windows spaced around the perimeter. The room in the center was used as a sitting room, with the upper floor an observatory. Two main entrance halls lead to the front and rear of the house, and the center room opens onto a parlor, a dining / family room, a kitchen with a bath for the maid, and three bedrooms with two main baths. The interior was originally finished with oil paints in contrasting designs. The machine shop is located on Judd Street across from the Hexagon. It is a large single- story brick building with a hip roof covered in shingles. Windows are set in segmental arches. The waterworks is located just east of the machine shop. It has a partial hip roof covered in shingles. File:Shay Hexagon House, built in 1876 by Ephraim Shay, who sheathed it inside and out in stamped metal.

Bayer Edward A. Bayer is an American-Israeli scientist. Early life  Edward A. Bayer was born on January 4, 1947, in Detroit, Michigan, US to Adele A. and Harmon S. Bayer. Edward (‚ÄúEd‚Äù or ‚ÄúEddie‚Äù) spent most of his primary school years in a predominantly Jewish northwest Detroit neighborhood, where so many of his fellow Baby Boomers lived. Here his Jewish identity, and other aspects of his identity, was established. The eldest of four siblings, two brothers (Gerald E. and Charles S.) and later a sister (Irene S.), he demonstrated many talents at an early age by organizing creative games, baseball competitions, productions, nature outings and other diversions. His interest in science and animals was formed early as exhibited by many excursions with his brothers into the \\"wilds\\". When his family moved to the Detroit suburb of West Bloomfield, his first year in Junior High School, Ed continued his creative pursuits. Demonstrating remarkable artistic tendencies even as a toddler, he used his skills to produce a puppet show, designing and creating by hand all the puppets and guiding his brothers in every aspect of the production. Ed was known in High School as a jokester and often combined this with his love of Science, and repeatedly topped his Chemistry teacher by proving him wrong in a funny and delicate way. Education He graduated with B.Sc. and M. Sc. in Zoology and Biology in University of Michigan and Wayne State University. He immigrated to Israel in 1971. He then graduated a Ph.D. in biophysics from the Weizmann Institute of Science, under the supervision of Meir Wilchek. Edward A. Bayer became a professor in the Weizmann Institute of Science in 2001 and published over 400 scientific papers in reputed journals. He is a member of the Scientific Advisory Board, of US-Department of Energy BioEnergy Science Center (BESC) since 2008 and of the Israel VATAT Planning and Budgeting Committee: National Subcommittee on \\"Energy & the Environment\\" and also serves as editor in several distinguished scientific journals.

The Shahumyan Province is a modern analogue of their alternative local government, in their infancy. With adoption of tu duan and merger, these nominal subdivisions transitioned to the actual administrative divisions.  Background  Since the invasion of the five barbarians, a large number of northern refugees migrated south. These migrants who called \\"qiao ren (, literally the migrated people)\\" were the base of the migrated provinces, commanderies, and counties. Bearing northern place names, they were set up by Eastern Jin. Such a move was not unprecedented, the central government migrated the whole commandery or county to a new place as early as Han dynasty. However, they emerged on a massive scale since Eastern Jin.  History  During the Emperor Yuan, Emperor Ming and Emperor Cheng period, the migrated provinces, commanderies and counties were concentrated in the area south of the Huai River and the Lower Yangtze Plain. The earlier typical classic examples was migrated Langya Commandery (, its original counterpart in modern Linyi, Shandong) within migrated Fei County () in Jiankang, but they were certainly not the earliest. At least migrated Huaide County (, its original counterpart in modern Fuping, Shaanxi) was established in there, around 320 before that. According to the Book of Song: > (After Disaster of Yongjia, the refugees from You, Ji, Qing, Bing, Yan and > Xu provinces came across the Huai River, some even came across the Yangtze > River and stayed in Jinling Commandery... The migrated commanderies and > counties were established to govern them. The seats of Xu and Yan provinces > perhaps were moved to the area north of the Yangtze River, where the > migrated You, Ji, Qing, Bing provinces were established also.) = Purposes = * declaring the legitimacy of government * claiming to the occupied northern territory and evoking people's desire to resume * deadening the homesickness of qiao ren * manifesting the higher status of the qiao ren who came from the aristocratic clans * attracting the Han Chinese in the North cross the border to pledge to the South authorities * fostering economic growth The belts where qiao ren lived subdivided into 3 administrative levels, similar to the ordinary administrative divisions: * migrated provinces or qiao zhou () * migrated commanderies or qiao jun () * migrated counties or qiao xian () After Emperor Wu of Liu Song recaptured some lost northern territory, some of them there were prefixed with \\"north\\" or \\"bei\\" () to distinguish them from their migrated counterparts in the south. After Liu founded the Liu Song, the prefix bei was dropped while migrated place names that had derived from their prototypes in the north took on the prefix \\"south\\" or \\"nan\\" (). Still, there were a few exceptions to prefixed with \\"east\\" or \\"dong\\" () and \\"west\\" or \\"xi\\" (). For instance, Dong Jingzhao (, in modern Xingyang) and Xi Jingzhao (, in modern Hanzhong). As time goes by, the migrated provinces, commanderies and counties plunged the administrative divisions into chaos. For instance, Yinping County was located in the southeastern part of Gansu Province nowadays initially. While it had four migrated counterparts. = Development = = Baiji and huangji = Considering most property of qiao ren had been lost or exhausted as they arrived, they were privileged to be free from diao (), a special poll tax was paid via the silken or cotton cloth etc in the ancient China, and service.

Over a given period, baiji was a preferential identification states the bearer's hometown. The imperial court had a specific intent, which scarcely be succeeded,to sort out hukou conveniently in the future after regaining the lost territory. = Abolition = Fan Ning () once submitted a memorial to the throne: > (In olden days, subdividing the territory was for the benefit of the > ordinary people; while a former noble monarch devised the system, he would > be fair to his people without distinction between huangji and baiji.

Once the situation settled down and the population swelled, the considerable amount of northerners flooding into the south magnified the economic and social problems. Reforms were clearly in order. Hence, tu duan was an increasingly important issue for the Eastern Jin and the subsequent Southern dynasties. = Tu duan policy = The tu duan (') is the abbreviation for yi tu duan (', means classifying people according to their present habitation).

The play is known in English as The Flower of Edo. The play is strongly associated with the Ichikawa Danj≈´r≈ç family of actors.  Plot  Events take place in Yoshiwara, a pleasure district of present-day Tokyo. Agemaki is a courtesan who is frequented by Sukeroku (who turns out to be Soga Gor√¥). Sukeroku is continually looking for fights. An old samurai called Iky√ª arrives and tries to coax Agemaki away from Sukeroku. Sukeroku does not succeed in provoking Iky√ª to draw his sword. A sak√©-seller named Shimbei shows up, and Sukeroku picks a fight with him, but Shimbei reveals himself to be Soga J√ªr√¥ (Sukeroku's elder brother) in disguise. Sukeroku explains to his brother (and later his mother) that he tries to provoke people into drawing their sword. If the sword turns out to be Tomokirimaru (their fathers sword), the person who holds the sword is probably the killer of their father and revenge can be exacted. Iky√ª tries to convince the brothers to join him. To demonstrate his power he hacks a leg of an incense burner. Thus revealing that his sword is in fact Tomokirimaru and he is Iga Heinaizaemon, an enemy of the family, and their father's killer. Quite often the play ends here, although there are versions where Sukeroku kills Iky√ª.  History  The work is derived from The Tale of the Soga Brothers. In popular culture The play is still regularly performed. The Ichikawa family secured its control over the play in 1832 using the title Sukeroku Yukari Edo Zakura. As the play is extremely popular, other families have developed their own versions, such as Sukeroku Kuruwa no Momoyogusa performed by the Onoe Kikugor√¥ line of actors. In Junichiro Tanizaki's novel, \\"Diary of a Mad Old-Man\\", Sukeroku is referred to five times at the beginning of Chapter I. Translation The play was translated into English by James R.

History  Carabinieri during riot control in 2015 While the 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade was established in its present form on 1 February 2001, together with Carabinieri Mobile Units Division, it can track its origins in the first formation grouping all Carabinieri units tasked with mobile, riot control and combat duties: the 11th Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade, established in 1963. = 1963-2001: 11th Carabinieri Brigade = Lieutenant General Giovanni De Lorenzo established the XI Mechanized Brigade when he was Carabinieri Commandant- General. Following the 1960 Genoa clashes, a reform project for the Mobile Battalions was envisioned, but later abandoned. Both the organization and the equipment (which included old Sherman tanks) were found to be obsolete either inadequate to emergency tasks.p. 48 In 1963, with the 1960s Army and Carabinieri reorganization, the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade was established directly under the General Command led by Giovanni De Lorenzo, in order to cope with the internal territorial defence needs. The establishment of the new brigade was in order to adjust the organization of the Battalions and of cavalry units both for strictly military tasks, and those related to the protection of public order. The aim was to ensure Carabinieri Battalions the availability of all elements necessary to be in a position to act in isolation and overcome considerable resistance without having to rely on the competition of other Army Corps or other Armed Forces, to ensure Battalions' speed of movement and concentration in large sectors of foreseeable use and a constant high training level. Overall, the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade consisted of about 5,000 men with 80 tracked vehicles, 200 other military vehicles, 130 M47 tanks and a paratroopers battalion. However, the brigade never had responsibility for actual unitary operational command, lacking supports due to a political choice, but exercised the tasks of instruction and preparation for the riot control activities. In the reorganization, Mobile Battalions were renamed simply Battalions and were marked with a sequential number, while remaining administratively dependent on the relevant Legion; the Battalions Groups were renamed Carabinieri Regiments, and were given the conceptual role of a resolution unit in both riot and tactical tasks; According original resolutions, Regiments were to have only disciplinary, training and deployment functions, while general management rested within the relevant Legion. The newly formed Mechanized Brigade exercised its operational and training authority on: * 1st Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Milan): commanding I, II, III and IV Battalions; * 2nd Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Rome): commanding V, VI, VIII and IX Battalions; * 3rd Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Naples): commanding X, XI and XII Battalions; * 4th Mounted Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Rome) with 2 Squadrons Groups (Battalion-level units) and 1 Armoured-motorized Squadron; * VII Battalion (directly under the Brigade Command), under IV Army Corps; despite being the newest Battalion, the unit inherited traditions and number of the second battalion of Rome, which was disestablished. * XIII Battalion (directly under the Brigade Command), under V Army Corps. The command structure of the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade consisted of: * Staff, with personnel management and training bodies; * Services Office, with activation and research tasks; * Army officers of Transmissions and Motorization organizations, with management, technical, inspecting and consulting tasks. Each Carabinieri Battalion was led by a lieutenant colonel or a major and consisted of: 1 Command Company (1 Command Platoon, 1 Services Platoon, 1 Scouts Platoon), 2 Rifle Companies (command platoon, 3 rifle platoons, 1 company weapons platoon each), 1 Mortars Company and 1 Tanks Company (Command Platoon, 3 Tanks Platoons). It was therefore a robust tactical complex. The Carabinieri Battalions had to be used only when the police and the local organization of the Carabinieri they had found insufficient, in order not to deprive the General Command of a valuable combat tool. Within the VII Battalion, based in Laives, the Counter-terrorism Special Company was established in 1960s to counter South Tyrolean terrorism;p. 187 the security operations were also supported by several Trucked Units. Both VII and XIII Battalions were to be always maintained at their full wartime force. The establishment of the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade was controversial: some senior officers criticized the decision, deeming that the essential features of the Carabinieri were capillarity and focus on criminal police activity. However, the 1963 reorganization did not mark the end of the organizational shifts. In 1964, 1st Carabinieri Helicopter Section was established. The XI Brigade was subordinated, on 7 March 1965, to the Inspectorate of Mechanized and Special Units, which included not only the XI Mechanized Brigade, but also all other tactical Carabinieri units: the Carabinieri Paratroopers Battalion, the Territorial Squadrons Groups of Milan, Cagliari and Palermo, the Trucked Units, as well as the naval service. Two years later, on 10 March 1967, the post was modified in \\"Inspectorate of Mechanized Units\\", being disbanded in May 1967. In 1968 the blue beret was modified, making it identical in shape to the maroon beret used by paratroopers. Between 1967 and 1968 it was set up the Inspectorate of Mechanized and Training Units (led by a Divisional general), with responsibility on the X Carabinieri Brigade (including schools) and XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade. In 1971 it was established the Inspectorate Schools and Special Carabinieri Units; it controlled the X Brigade (dedicated to training) and XI Brigade. In 1969, Battalions framed within Carabinieri Regiments were reorganized. The new structure consisted of Battalion Command Unit, Command and Services Company (Command and Services Platoon, Scouts Platoon, Transmissions Platoon, Tanks Platoon, Transportations Platoon), 2 Mechanized Rifle Companies (Command and Services Platoon, 3 Rifle Platoons, Mortars Platoons). Between 1973 and 1976, the 5th Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Mestre) also existed, including IV, VII and XIII Battalions. On 1 September 1977, 1st, 2nd and 3rd Carabinieri Regiments were disestablished and their Battalions were transferred under the direct operational and training authority of the 11th Mechanized Brigade; the 4th Mounted Carabinieri Regiment was renamed Mounted Carabinieri Regiment. In 1975 the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade changed its name in 11th Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade (with Arabic numerals) and in 1976 the formation was renamed 11th Carabinieri Brigade; at the same time, the Brigade Command was tasked to exercise only training and logistical authority. In 1977, the three Carabinieri Regiments were disestablished and 4th Carabinieri Cavalry Regiment changed its name in Carabinieri Cavalry Regiment, with the Battalions being directly under the Brigade Command. The following year an Inspecting Colonel was appointed, while in 1979 two additional Colonels followed. In 1980, the Inspectorate changed its name to Command Division School and Special Carabinieri Units \\"Palidoro\\". In 1985, the department was deprived of training component and was reorganized on the XI Brigade (Carabinieri Battalions) and the XII Brigade (specialist units); the brigade was therefore placed under a command called Carabinieri Mobile and Special Units Division \\"Palidoro\\". Overall, Carabinieri Battalions were divided into two groups, according to the main type (motorized or mechanized unit) of unit the unit deployed.  Operations  During the Years of Lead and the subsequent period, however, most of the Battalions reduced their military training in order to deal with riot control activities. 7th and 13th Battalions maintained instead their military capabilities and were transferred under direct Army operational control. Each infantry company of each Battalion established, in this period, an \\"Intervention Platoon\\", in order to upgrade the responsiveness to serious riots.p. 191 In the 1976 Friuli earthquake, the XIII Carabinieri Battalion \\"Friuli Venezia Giulia\\", IV Carabinieri Battalion \\"Veneto\\" and VII Carabinieri Battalion \\"Trentino Alto Adige\\" intervened paying rescue and providing police and utility services. In the 1980 Irpinia earthquake Carabinieri Battalions from Bari, Naples and Rome also intervened.pp. 203‚Äì204 = 2001-present day: 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade = Protesters burn a Carabinieri vehicle during the 27th G8 summit. With the transformation of the Arma dei Carabinieri in autonomous Armed Force, the 11th Carabinieri Brigade was split in two Brigades: the 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade controlled riot units, the 2nd Carabinieri Mobile Brigade was assigned combat-oriented Carabinieri Regiments. The two Carabinieri Mobile Brigades were grouped in the Carabinieri Mobile Units Division. The 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade was initially headquartered in Rome; in 2001 it was transferred in Treviso; in 2013 it was moved back in Rome. Some of its subordinate units, from being all Battalion-level entities, have been raised to the regimental status. On 10 September 2014 the 1st Carabinieri Battalion \\"Piemonte\\" was raised to Regimental status as 1st Carabinieri Regiment \\"Piemonte\\"; the 11th Carabinieri Battalion \\"Puglia\\" was raised to Regimental status on 18 September 2017.  Operations  The first major engagement of the newly formed Brigade was the 27th G8 summit, a major protest, drawing an estimated 200,000 demonstrators. Clashed erupted heavily; 329 people were arrested and over 400 protesters and about 100 among security forces were injured during the clashes. On the occasion, Carabinieri formed the shortly- existed Compagnie di contenimento e intervento risolutivo, units formed with personnel drawn from existing Battalions of the 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade (Battalions \\"Lombardia\\", \\"Lazio\\", \\"Toscana\\", \\"Campania\\" and \\"Sicilia\\"), integrated with personnel drawn from the more military-oriented 2nd Carabinieri Mobile Brigade. Critics of the CCIR frequently point out the militarization of police brought by the establishment of such units. On July 20, 23-year-old activist Carlo Giuliani of Genoa, was shot dead by Mario Placanica, a Carabiniere, during clashes with police. On 14 July 2007, 13 Italian Carabineri, GOMPI Mobile and prison police were convicted for abuse of authority, abuse of office and uniform. Other charges included abuse and negligence.  Mission  The 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade is tasked with: * Participation to the integrated defence of the national territory; * Participation in crowd and riot control during large demonstrations and events; * Surveillance on sensitive military objectives and those of civil nature defined, from time to time, by the Public Security authority; * Support to territorial organization to increase control of the territory in large urban and rural areas in the most sensitive areas in terms of public security; * Civil protection.  Organization  Emblem of 1st Carabinieri Regiment \\"Piemonte\\" The 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade is commanded by a Brigadier general, who in turn is assisted by a Staff. Subordinate units include thirteen regiments and battalions: * 1st Carabinieri Regiment \\"Piemonte\\" in Moncalieri  2nd Carabinieri Battalion \\"Liguria\\" in Genoa * 3rd Carabinieri Regiment \\"Lombardia\\" in Milan * 4th Carabinieri Cavalry Regiment in Rome * 5th Carabinieri Regiment \\"Emilia-Romagna\\" in Bologna  6th Carabinieri Battalion \\"Toscana\\" in Florence * 8th Carabinieri Regiment \\"Lazio\\" in Rome  9th Carabinieri Battalion \\"Sardegna\\" in Cagliari * 10th Carabinieri Regiment \\"Campania\\" in Naples * 4th Carabinieri Battalion \\"Veneto\\" in Mestre * 11th Carabinieri Regiment \\"Puglia\\" in Bari * 12th Carabinieri Regiment \\"Sicilia\\" in Palermo * 14th Carabinieri Battalion \\"Calabria\\" in Vibo Valentia = Operational Intervention Company = The \\"Operational Intervention Companies\\" () are 7 units are designed to cope with the appropriate urgency in sudden danger to public security, thanks to the special training of personnel and the allocation of substantial vehicles and materials, intervening whenever the resurgence of particular crimes, especially those of predatory character, requires even more intense and visible control activity. Companies operate in small squads performing patrols in the urban context; they are also employed in extensive territorial control activities, such as patrols, checkpoints, spot-checks and raids. They have been established in 2000, within the 8th Carabinieri Regiment \\"Lazio\\" in Rome and within the Carabinieri Battalions in Milan, Florence, Naples, Bari, Palermo, Vibo Valentia and Mestre. Carabinieri assigned to the Operational Intervention Companies are selected and specially trained in Velletri to detect and deal with dangerous individuals, such as former offenders, drugs dealers and others. The training includes hand-to-hand combat, disarmament techniques, shooting and riot procedures. = Rescue Units = In order to allow Carabinieri Battalions to deal with emergencies in case of public calamity, special Rescue Units are established, when needed, within the individual Carabinieri Battalions. These Rescue Units are previously trained and provided with equipment and materials which allow them to provide initial assistance to people affected while awaiting the intervention of the civil protection system.

He began as a neuro-physiologist in Russia and after emigrating in 1976 he went on to study anthropology in Canada, England and the Netherlands. His academic work focuses on medical anthropology and European and Mediterranean studies. His literary work covers a diverse range of socio- cultural milieus and psychological perspectives, extending cultured and incisive insights into the human condition. He has lived in Italy since 1989.  Fields of research  Korovkin specializes in political and economic anthropology, symbolic expression and social organisation, and medical anthropology of stress. His articles have been published in journals that include Epistemology and Philosophy of Science (2011), European Journal of Sociology (1988), Comparative Studies in Society and History (1988), Language in Society (1987) and Current Anthropology (1986). Over the years, he has consulted on political and economic processes, power dynamics of social groupings and immigration policies for various government and private institutions, including the UN, both in Italy and Canada.  Formation  In Russia Korovkin studied biology and medicine at the Moscow State Pedagogical University and at I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University. He specialised in neuro-physiology and during his internship he worked at the Burdenko Scientific Research Neurosurgery Institute in the department directed by his uncle, Prof. Samuel M. Blinkov, co-author of the seminal work The Human Brain in Figures and Tables (S.M Blinkov, I.I Glezer 1964). After leaving Russia at the age of 27 he arrived to Canada where he studied cultural and social anthropology under Judith Nagata at York University. After winning a Doctoral Fellowship from Canada's Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), he spent a year at the London School of Economics (LSE) and went on to complete his studies the University of Amsterdam School for Social Science Research under Jeremy Boissevain.  Theoretical approach  In his anthropological work Korovkin‚Äôs treatment of the socio-cultural process can be seen as a concerted effort to ‚Äúreconcile the irreconcilable‚Äù namely ‚Äì structuralism and phenomenology. This leads him to a ‚Äúfractal approach‚Äù or to what he calls the quantum mechanics of symbols‚Äù by analogy with Heisenberg‚Äôs principle of uncertainty where the more is known about the meaning of the symbol the less is known about its entity, and vice versa.  Medical anthropology  In the field of medical anthropology Korovkin propones his particular cross disciplinary ‚Äúparabiotic‚Äù approach (i.e. Cannon, Richter, et al.) to coping with stress primarily in terms of its socio-cultural and physiological dynamics; teaching individuals and groups to develop analytical strategies of resilience and thus deal with stress competently rather than attempt to eliminate it (www.stressalternative.org). He is co-author with P. Stephenson of Zombie Factory: Culture, Stress & Sudden Death (2010). His treatment of stress falls within the canons of neuroanthropology: the anthropological aspect concerns primarily the role values play in the perception of stressors and somatisation of stress. The neuro-physiological treatment of the issue emphasises the patterns of stress rather than its intensity as a measurable physiological symptom.  Academic career  Korovkin has taught social and medical anthropology in Canada at McMaster University, the University of British Columbia and the University of Victoria. At the end of the 1980s he settled in Italy where he taught at the University of Bari, University of Perugia, Tuscia University, and Libera Universit√† Maria SS. Assunta (LUMSA) in Rome. He was Professor of Sociology and Communication Studies at ESE - European School of Economics, where he served as Academic Director from 2001-2004 at the Rome and Naples campuses. Currently he is Professor of Social Sciences at USAC - (University Studies Abroad Consortium).  Literary work  In 1991, the late Indro Montanelli, Editor-in-Chief of the leading Italian national daily Il Giornale, offered Korovkin a column on the newspaper‚Äôs cultural page Terza pagina. Montanelli was seeking to divulge a view on Russian political culture that would provoke a dialectical challenge to the ‚Äúradical-chic‚Äù notions dominant among European intellectual elites. With this in mind, he approached Korovkin with a plan to publish a pseudo Samizdat, which Korovkin agreed to write. Montanelli sent him to Russia as a special envoy in order to gather ethnographical material for the job at hand. For both Korovkin and Montanelli this ‚Äúeditorial operation‚Äù was not merely a gratuitous literary scherzo: it fronted a well considered notion that they shared, but could hardly expect to present personally, both due to their known ideological stands (‚Äúelegant right‚Äù Montanelli and ‚Äúelegant left‚Äù Korovkin) and their geographically vicarious position. The idea sustaining the novel is that Russia is a culturally feudal and idiosyncratically monarchic society, loving to hate their strong czars and falling apart under the weak ones; where the \\"tyrant\\" is a necessary product, simulacrum and even an ‚Äúexistential victim‚Äù of his own subject-people. The novel‚Äôs original title in English is Voice from the Orphanage: Memories of the Man Between Seasons. It is a sui generis rejoinder to what has been regarded as one of the first ever samizdat: A Voice from the Chorus (1976) by Abram Tertz (Andrei Sinyavsky). Korovkin‚Äôs reverts Tertz‚Äô thesis by presenting Russians as Stalin‚Äôs post-Perestroika perestroika orphans as opposed to repressed mass victims (chorus) of the Soviet regime. He correctly predicts what he saw would be the inevitable return of a strong authoritarian ruler. Montanelli personally wrote the introduction thus giving the work an imprimatur of ‚Äúauthenticity‚Äù; it was serialised in Il Giornale, and became the object of widespread interest and debate. Upon publication by Sperling & Kupfer the work, titled Orfani di Madre-Russia; Memorie di un Cinico (1992) written under the pseudonym Vadim Dubrovski, became a national bestseller. Following the success of ‚ÄúOrphans,‚Äù Korovkin was approached by the Italian publishing house Mondadori with a request to write another samizdat; this time the memories of a Moscow courtesan. Korovkin accepted the challenge, seeing the offer as an opportunity to write what he called ‚Äúthe first-ever feminist novel written by a man‚Äù. The novel, titled Dancing with Fat Cats: Memories of a Moscow Call Girl, was written in English under the pseudonym Lena Volgina. It was translated into Italian by the writer Stefania Pergola and published by Mondadori as Memorie di una ma√Ætresse moscovita (1994). Later, it was to be published under the original title in Russian translation by Aletheia (St Petersburg, 2004), and then re-published in Moscow by AST Publishers as Diary of a Moscow Courtesan (2005). It came out to wide critical acclaim, but apart from Katerina Nistratova, critics treated it as anti-Soviet, while Korovkin himself intended it as primarily ‚Äúanti-men‚Äù, with a Russian setting. The novel also provoked lively discussion on the Italian literary scene with Italian journalists eager to interview the mysterious ma√Ætresse. Notwithstanding the prestigious backing and successful initial promotion, the publication of the Korovkin‚Äôs writings in Italy in the early 1990s proved untimely. This was the period when the nation underwent the clamorous fall of the First Republic as government corruption surfaced through the institutionalised graft scandal known as ' (\\"Bribesville\\"). Thus, in the wake of the nation‚Äôs moral upheaval further promotion of the ‚Äúforged‚Äù novels was judiciously halted. Subsequently, however, he published other three novels in Russia under his own name: Once a Good Man and Short Stories (2001), Terms of Estrangement: Diaries of A Paratrooper (2002) and Excursion: Adventures of Modigliani the Ghost (2005).  Critique  Korovkin is described as ‚Äúa brilliant and ferocious poet whose furious, defiant but consistently classical and supremely elegant poetry, controlled and yet fluid, draws, without ever becoming heavy, on a very rich and varied cultural patrimony‚Äù (Franca Rovigatti, Roma Poesia 1998). His last book of poetry to-date is Fields of Vision: Selected Poems and The Soldier‚Äôs Tale (2014). It consists of 14 poems whose programmatic direction is best attested to by the title of the first piece of the volume: Looking for Faith. A large section of the book is occupied by The Soldier‚Äôs Tale: a completely new rendering of the fable used by Stravinsky for the homonymous suite and inspired by the latter. It bears the subtitle A Narcissus Variation ‚Äî narcissism in contemporary society is a topic that Korovkin repeatedly turns to both in his poetry and prose. In his poetic work, Korovkin often collaborates with American composer Jakov Jakoulov. He also intensively collaborates with Stephanie Morin. Currently they are working together on preparing for the publication of Morin‚Äôs research for a book titled Gold Fish in a Blender: An Essay on Approaches to Communicating Contemporary Visual Art.

This first building was probably mainly of wood but nothing of it survives in the present structure.Hardy, Michael Meredith All Saints Radwell, Privately Printed (ND) The present All Saints Church is a small parish church in the Perpendicular style probably dating to the mid-14th century but which was much restored in the 19th century. The church consists of a chancel 20 ft. by 13 ft. 6 in., a north vestry 14 ft. by 7 ft., the nave 35 ft. by 16 ft. 6 in., and the south porch 8 ft. 6 in. by 8 ft.The Parish of Radwell - British History Online Constructed of flint and clunch rubble with the cement render removed in places, the chancel arch, window openings and the walls of the nave and chancel are probably mid-14th century in date, while the East window (a three- light window of about 1500 with decorative late 19th century glass given in 1885) and tower arch date to the early 16th century. The nave was restored in 1875, at which time the pews were added, while the chancel was restored in 1882, at which time the vestry and South porch were added. The short nave does not have an aisle and has only one window in each of the North and South walls. The steeply pitched roof has coped gable parapets, while above the West bay of the nave can be seen a bell-cot with a small broached copper spire over the timber bell chamber. A pointed arch separates the West bay as if the builders had intended to add a tower. The chancel arch dates to about 1340 and is similar in design to the tower arch but is more finely moulded, while the chancel's wagon roof is 19th century.Doubleday, A.H., The Victoria History of the County of Hertford, (1923)Nikolaus Pevsner and Bridget Cherry, The Buildings of England: Hertfordshire, (1977) The chancel arch shows traces of where at one time a rood screen was fixed across the archway, but this was presumably destroyed centuries ago. The large and undecorated baptismal font is 14th or 15th century in date and has shields carved in the recesses on its shaft. The communion rails are 17th century with square tapering balusters. The oak pulpit was given as a memorial to Frances Temple Proctor (died 1889), the wife of the Rector, the Rev Lovell Proctor, and their son Charles, who drowned in Bombay Harbour in 1906. Monuments Tomb of Mary Plomer (1605) On the South wall of the chancel can be found an effigy tomb to Mary Plomer, who died in 1605 at the age of 30 after giving birth to her 11th child. A fine example of rustic Elizabethan sculpture, she is depicted as a large seated frontal figure holding a chrisom child (removed from the effigy for safekeeping) with one foot on a skull and an hour-glass in her hand. The baby is wrapped in a linen chrisom-cloth which at that time was worn for a month after christening in order to protect the sign of the cross made with chrism oil on the baby's head during baptism. This monument suggests that the baby died within a month of baptism. A smaller figure of Time is displayed to the left, with the whole tomb surrounded by decorated piers. On the plinth below is a panel depicting kneeling effigies of her 10 children, showing she had six sons, two of whom are slightly recessed showing they had predeceased her, and her four daughters, with obelisks and achievement above. Effigy tomb of John Parker with his wife and son (1595) On the same wall is a monument to Ann Plomer (d.1625), with an inscribed slab framed by an arch and pediment with achievement above. On the North wall of the chancel is a monument with small kneeling figures of John Parker (d.1595), together with his wife and son in a surround similar to Mary Plomer's tomb but more modest. At the West end of the South chancel wall is a small leather plaque inscribed to William Pym (d.1729). On the South wall of the nave is a monument to William Plomer (d.1625) which displays Plomer kneeling at an altar with flanking obelisks and crests over an arch. Several memorials dating from the 18th century and later are on the nave walls. Several monumental brasses are set in the floor of the chancel, including in the North with one dedicated to Elizabeth Parker (d.1602), while in the South is a brass to William Wheteaker (d.1487), with his wife and son. In the North East corner of the nave is a brass to John Bele (d.1516) together with his two wives and children and the inscription \\"Pray for the soules of John Bele gentleman and Anne and Agnes hys wyfes, the whiche John decessed in the yere of our Lord God MVXVI\\".

Today, only ruins of the former fort can be found. The ruins are easily accessible by a pathway from the Ankobra Beach Hotel and frequented by tourists who enjoy the panoramic view of the site.  History  In the 17th century, the Ankobra River was an important means of transport for the gold trade in the area. Between the 1650s and 1680s, the Dutch had levied a toll from people using the Ankobra River at its mouth from a stone toll house, but abandoned it after Dutch influence in the area diminished and locals refused to pay the toll any longer. However, by the turn of the 18th century, French interest in the Ankobra River area made the Dutch take a renewed interest in the area, and after receiving a request from the local Azane people, the Dutch West India Company decided to build a lodge on the hill at the mouth of the Ankobra River. The trade at this lodge was so promising that in 1706, the company decided to extend it into a fort. Shortly thereafter, a conflict emerged between the Azane and other peoples at the coast, which eventually led to the abandonment of the fort by the Dutch in 1711. The fort was subsequently destroyed by John Conny in 1712. Archaeological excavations were done at the site of the fort in 1999 and the fall of 2011.

The neural activities are picked up by electrophysiological recordings from the brain (e.g. EEG, MEG, ECoG, etc.). It is a method to study the brain's neural communication and function at rest or during functional tasks.  History and basics  Initial applications of spectral analysis for finding the relationship between the EEG recordings from different regions of scalp dates back to 1960's. Corticocortical coherence has since been extensively studied using EEG and MEG recording for potential diagnostic applications and beyond. The exact origins of corticocortical coherence are under active investigation. While the consensus suggests that the functional neural communication between distinct brain sources leads to synchronous activity in those regions (possibly connected by neural tracts, in either direct or indirect way), an alternative explanation emphasises on single focal oscillations that occur at single brain sources that eventually appear connected or synchronous in different scalp or brain source regions. Corticocortical coherence has been of special interest in delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands (commonly used for EEG studies).  Methods, mathematics and statistics  Cortico-cortical coherence is commonly studied using bipolar channels of EEG recordings, as well as unipolar channels of EEG or MEG signals; however, unipolar channels are usually used to estimate the brain sources and their connectivity, using electrical source imaging and connectivity analysis. A classic and commonly used approach to assess the synchrony between neural signals is to use Coherence.Halliday, D. M., Rosenberg, J. R., Amjad, A. M., Breeze, P., Conway, B. A., & Farmer, S. F.

My father went to the store and said that the Soviets were probably good people, they had brought so many products once. \\" But \\"enthusiasm\\" abruptly waned after Soviet \\"liberators\\" began repressing conscious Ukrainians, setting fire to villages, and so on.  OUN-UPA struggle against the Soviet occupiers  On August 15, 1944, after the battle of the \\"liberators\\" with the Ukrainian Insurgent Army detachment, the village was set on fire again by the Bolsheviks. Five insurgents from the OUN Security Service militant were killed in the battle. After the battle, the Bolsheviks carried out a \\"purge\\" and took away many men. From the chronicles of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army it is known that on April 26, 1944. in the village housed for one day a hundred \\"Poor\\". The next time the hundred stood guard in the woods near Yakimov on August 28, 1944. The forest was not suitable for them to live in, but because the rebels were caught in the day, they could not move. The rebels did not have time to rest after the hard road when the shots were heard. The Bolsheviks attacked the forest from two sides. The defense was difficult to conduct, so the commander of \\"Yastrub\\" decided to break through the road Lviv-Zolochiv and stay in another location. Fortunately, hundreds have succeeded. September 4, 1944 one family was arrested and deported. December 1, 1944 The Bolsheviks raided the village of Yakymov, where they captured one man, two girls, and killed two men from the special forces. During the same raid, the Bolsheviks burned three farms. December 4, 1944 another NKVD raid was carried out, two insurgents were captured during the raid and the morgue in the cemetery was burned. During the raid, a Bolshevik lieutenant said, \\"Dig for hiding places, because the actions will be intensified now.\\" In the end, he said that the war would end soon. December 4, 1945 The NKVD arrested two residents - Kruk J. and Makar M. In 1947, there was a Bolshevik garrison in the village, which had to keep order, because the village was considered nationalistic and dangerous for the new government, because there was constant resistance. The occupiers went from house to house, gathering people, campaigning for the people to vote for the communist Pelekhaty. The rebels called on the people to boycott the elections, to disregard the orders of the occupying power. Communications were broadcast in the villages \\"flyers\\", which urged residents not to obey and not to participate in elections. The peasants obeyed the rebels, and no one went to the polls, except the units to the death of intimidated people or supporters of the occupiers. Elections in the village were disrupted. The Bolsheviks began to teach the rebellious inhabitants. The village was cleansed ... During the so-called \\"cleansing\\", on March 20, 1947, a resident Anna Girna was arrested (they had two pieces of evidence: one - she is in the photo among the girls who were taught to be nurses by the rebels, the other - her handwriting under \\" flyer \\"). The consciousness of some villagers was so great that even children joined the struggle. They left the village and when they saw that the Bolshevik garrison was coming, they immediately let the villagers and insurgents know. Among those children was the younger sister of the above- mentioned Anna - Maria Girna, who on January 16, 1946. also arrested. Maria Hirna was a liaison. Mostly received and transmitted information received from the insurgents to Ubyn.  Church of the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church  Church of the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (1852) The church was built in 1852. The wooden church stands at the beginning of Yakimov, on the rise, to the right of the road (if you go from the side of Vyrov). Until 1939, the church belonged to the Roman Catholic administration.  Cultural life of the village  On October 13, 2019, the village of Yakymiv was visited by the American astronaut Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper. Her father, Mykhailo Stefanyshyn, was born in the village. He was deported to Germany during World War II. After the war, he married a German woman, and together they emigrated to the United States. There they had a daughter and three sons, whom they raised in Ukrainian traditions. Gaidi is proud of her Ukrainian roots and sincerely enjoyed the opportunity to visit Yakymiv to learn more about her past. It was a very warm and sincere meeting. From the Ukrainian land, the first woman astronaut of Ukrainian origin and the eighth conqueror of star routes in the world was presented with a fragrant loaf.

Dickens appended a note to the last instalment noting that the opinions of the work should be attributed to the author, not the periodical. Reade's work did better when released (with some reordering and amendment of the text, less concerned with creating instalment cliffhangers) as Hard Cash in three-volume book form by Sampson Low in December 1863.Wynne D.

Synopsis A late nineteenth-century synopsis of the novel: > This book, originally published in 1863, as Very Hard Cash is an alleged > ‚Äúexposure‚Äù of the abuses of private insane asylums in England and of the > statutes under which they were sheltered. The ‚ÄúHard Cash‚Äù is the sum of > ¬£14,000, the earnings of years, of which Richard Hardie, a bankrupt banker, > defrauds David Dodd, a sea-captain. Dodd has a cataleptic shock and goes > insane on realizing his loss. Hardie's son Alfred loves Julia, Dodd's > daughter. He detects his father's villainy, accuses him of it, and to insure > his silence is consigned by his father to a private insane asylum. There he > meets Dodd; a fire breaks out, and both escape. Dodd enlists and serves as a > common seaman, appearing to be capable but half-witted, until a second > cataleptic shock restores his reason, when he returns home. Alfred reaches > his friends, and vindicates his sanity in a court of law. The receipt for > the ¬£14,000 is found, and the money recovered from the elder Hardie. The > book properly divides itself into two parts. One embraces the maritime > adventures of Dodd with pirates, storms, shipwreck, and highwaymen, while > bringing his money home; and his subsequent service as a half-witted > foremast-hand until his restoration to reason. The other covers Alfred's > thrilling experiences as a sane man among the insane.

Dr. Sampson, the sturdy Scotch physician, who despises all > regular practitioners, and comes to Alfred‚Äôs rescue at the crisis of the > book, is one of Reade‚Äôs strongest and most original characters. The love > scenes are tender and touching. Hard Cash is in some sense a sequel to Love > me Little, Love me Long which relates the early history and marriage of > Captain and Mrs. Dodd.

The US Bureau of Land Management owns and administers the wilderness area. The semi- arid wilderness includes few natural resources but has a diverse geology, as well as a range of plant and animal species. There were multiple failed legislative attempts to establish the Sabinoso Wilderness, both as an individual bill as well as part of more comprehensive legislation, prior to the eventual success in 2009 as part of an omnibus bill. , the wilderness was inaccessible to the public without trespassing, as it and adjoining state- owned property were entirely surrounded by privately owned land. In conjunction with the Wyss Foundation, a plan to allow public access through the donation and purchase of additional adjacent lands was implemented and the wilderness opened to the public on November 10, 2017. Legislative history On June 7, 2007, Tom Udall introduced H.R. 2632, the Sabinoso Wilderness Act of 2008, which would have set aside a total of 15,995 acres of land for the site. The bill passed the US House of Representatives on June 9, 2008 by a voice vote, but never passed the Senate. On March 13, 2008, Ra√∫l Grijalva introduced H.R. 5610, the Protecting America‚Äôs Wild Places Act of 2008. Title III of the act, Sabinoso Wilderness, would have set aside 19,880 acres of land for the site. It was passed by neither the House nor the Senate. On February 9, 2009, Ben Luj√°n introduced H.R. 921, the Sabinoso Wilderness Act of 2009, which would have set aside 15,995 acres for the site, and was not passed by either chamber. Sabinoso was finally established as part of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009, signed into law by Barack Obama on March 30, 2009. Subtitle G Section 1602 reads: > In furtherance of the purposes of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et > seq.), the approximately 16,030 acres of land under the jurisdiction of the > Taos Field Office Bureau of Land Management, New Mexico, as generally > depicted on the map, is designated as wilderness and as a component of the > National Wilderness Preservation System, to be known as the \`Sabinoso > Wilderness'. Description View across Ca√±on Largo The Sabinoso Wilderness area consists of canyons and steep-sided mesas with elevations ranging from to . The mesa tops are grassland while the canyon walls support a pinyon pine and juniper woodland with scattered groves of ponderosa pine. The area is semi-arid receiving to precipitation annually. The canyon bottoms have periodically flowing streams, as well as deep incisions cut by the Ca√±on Olguin, Ca√±on Largo, and Lagartija Creek. Riparian vegetation such as cottonwood and willow trees is found along the ephemeral streams. Wildlife includes, elk, mule deer, black bear, and wild turkey. The northeastern corner of the wilderness area is near the Canadian River and the 1890s settlement of Sabinoso, now mostly abandoned except for a few remaining buildings. No other settlements, except a few ranches, are near the wilderness area. The nearest city is Las Vegas, New Mexico, about 50 miles distant by road. =Geology= The Sabino Wilderness contains a sequence of sedimentary rocks, which are close to flat lying or dipping very gently to the southeast. These rocks are almost entirely sandstones, siltstones, and shales, and represent geological time from the Late Triassic to the Early Cretaceous epochs. These rocks record a variety of paleoenvironments, including alluvial streams, floodplains, lakes and ponds, wind-blown eolian dunes, and in the youngest of the rocks, some sandy shallow marine settings. The geological formations represented at the surface within the Wilderness include the Santa Rosa, Chinle, Entrada, Morrison, and Mesa Rica Formations. Buried beneath the area are Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and Precambrian crystalline rocks making up the geological basement. Several of the lithologies present in the Wilderness have eroded to form prominent cliffs, including the thick sandstone beds of the Chinle Formation, and the Entrada Sandstone. The former are reddish-brown to maroon; the latter a salmon-orange color. =Mineral resources= United States Geological Survey map showing areas of moderate potential for Uranium In 1987 the United States Geological Survey published a report on the mineral resources of Sabinoso. They concluded that \\"no identified mineral resources were found in the study area.\\" While they identified some occurrences of uranium associated with the Chinle Formation, the deposits were too small, scattered and low-grade to constitute a viable resources for uranium. =Cultural resources= As of 2013 the area had not been systematically surveyed for cultural resources. However, the archaeological record of the surrounding territory suggests a high density of prehistoric Paleo-Indian sites, as well as sites related to the period of homesteading and ranching, around the mid-19th century. Many of the artifacts which have been found in the area are centered along the Largo Canyon Road which is thought to be a pre-historic trail, as well as a road used by the United States Army to connect Fort Union and Fort Bascom. =Grazing= Cattle grazing on Sabinoso is rare due to the relative scarcity of water. However, 10 grazing allotments had been granted as of 2013, with grazing taking place mostly in the southern portion of the area. Public access Map of the Sabinoso Wilderness including grazing areas, state owned land, and the planned addition of the Rimrock Rose Ranch and an access road. Sabinoso Wilderness Area is surrounded by privately owned land and initially had no route for public access. About a dozen state-owned parcels of land adjoin Sabinoso, but they are themselves also \\"landlocked,\\" entirely surrounded by privately owned property. In 2016 the Wilderness Land Trust, financed by the Wyss Foundation, purchased the Rimrock Rose Ranch for $3,150,000 with the goal of enabling public access to the area. The environmental evaluations needed before visitors would be allowed to enter the park, were estimated to require up to a year to complete, and were made available for public comment as of August 2016. In August 2016, The Bureau of Land Management proposed to accept a donation of of the Rimrock Rose Ranch for addition to the Wilderness Area. The BLM proposed to purchase the remaining of the ranch, as well as of inholdings. They also plan to cancel two allotments for livestock grazing to alleviate the impact on the sparse riparian environments. The transfer of the land was finalized in 2017. The Wilderness became open to the public on November 10, 2017, accessible from an improved dirt road along San Miguel County Road C51A.

Probably built in 1851 for a local lockmaker, it is one of three surviving 19th-century water wheels in the state. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in 2002. Description and history The Terryville Waterwheel is located in Terryville, a historic 19th- century manufacturing district of eastern Plymouth, and now the town's main commercial center. It is located on the north side of Main Street (United States Route 6) on the western bank of the swiftly flowing Pequabuck River. The wheel is built out of wood and iron, and is mounted in its original wheel well formed out of rubblestone capped in concrete. It is in diameter and wide, and is sheltered by a form-fit shelter erected in 1951. Most of the wheel's parts are pressure-treated wood, replacing original materials in a 1990-91 restoration. The axle of the wheel is cast iron, with a cast iron hub providing attachment mortises for the wheel's arms. The arms are fastened to the hub with metal bolts, and are cross braced with iron tie rods. The wheel was traditionally thought to date to the construction of Eli Terry's clock factory, which was built on this site in 1824. However, that factory was destroyed by fire in 1851, and was rebuilt by its then-owner, the Lewis Lock Company. It is believed that the present wheel fittings date to that period. The wheel was powered by water delivered from a dam upriver (no longer extant) via a wooden head race (also not extant, although it survived until 1951). This wheel provided power to lockmaking concerns until about 1940, when the factory was demolished. Of Connecticut's three surviving 19th-century water wheels it is the best preserved.

He appeared in 175 La Liga matches during seven seasons, with Athletic Bilbao and Rayo Vallecano. Playing career =Early years / Athletic= Born in Bergara, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country, Etxeberria began playing with local Mondrag√≥n FC in Tercera Divisi√≥n, based in Arrasate. In 1994 he moved to SCD Durango at the same level, helping them promote to Segunda Divisi√≥n B in his sole season. Exteberria's performances drew the attention of regional giants Athletic Bilbao, and in summer 1995 he was signed on the recommendation of goalkeeping legend Jos√© √Ångel Iribar, joining a professional club for the first time at the relatively old age of 22. He was initially assigned to the reserve team, who was eventually relegated from Segunda Divisi√≥n. Etxeberria was promoted to the main squad for 1996‚Äì97, and after spending the first half of the campaign as back-up to Juanjo Valencia he made his La Liga debut on 9 February 1997 in a 1‚Äì1 away draw against Rayo Vallecano, and subsequently became the starter. The former later stated that he enjoyed competition between them, and that he considered the latter a friend (both went on to work as youth coaches at San Mam√©s). In 1997‚Äì98, Etxeberria played all 38 league games as the Lions finished in second position, adding 37 the following season. In that year's UEFA Champions League group stage, even though his team ranked last, he conceded only six goals in as many matches. Etxeberria eventually lost his starting position to I√±aki Lafuente, being further demoted to third-choice by fellow youth graduate Daniel Aranzubia under manager Txetxu Rojo. He was willing to leave the club, but Athletic asked for a transfer fee which no other clubs were willing to meet, so he remained on the payroll without making a single appearance during the 2000‚Äì01 campaign; he left on 30 June 2001, having made 140 appearances all competitions comprised. =Rayo / Later career= Etxeberria then moved to fellow league side Rayo Vallecano, replacing the departed Kasey Keller. In his first season he beat competition from veteran Julen Lopetegui, helping to an 11th-place finish. From 2002 to 2004, Etxeberria played 35 league games but was also consecutively relegated. In the latter campaign, which saw Lopetegui kickstart his managerial career, the player was largely overlooked in favour of Sergio Segura by Lopetegui's successor Jorge D'Alessandro, who then brought in another goalkeeper, his compatriot Sebasti√°n Saja, on loan; Rojo became the third coach in February 2004, and he also had no place in his plans for Etxeberria, who was released and trained with Bilbao Athletic to stay fit. Etxeberria then dropped down to the third level to play for Cultural y Deportiva Leonesa, leaving at the end of the season. He returned to division two and his native region in the summer of 2005, being first-choice for SD Eibar but being relegated as last; he then chose to retire from the game, aged 33. =International= Etxeberria never earned any caps for Spain at any level. He did feature for the unofficial Basque Country regional team. Coaching career Afterwards, Etxeberria spent some years as goalkeeping coach for Athletic's youth teams, interrupted by a spell performing the same role at SD Lemona working under his former teammate Aitor Larraz√°bal. In 2012, he became Bilbao Athletic's goalkeeping coach as part of the backroom team led by another former teammate, Jos√© √Ångel Ziganda. When Ziganda was promoted to senior team boss in summer 2017, Etxeberria moved up with him to continue in his specialist role. Personal life Etxeberria operated a training scheme for young goalkeepers, based in Deusto. He was not related to Joseba Etxeberria, his teammate for several years at Athletic and later a colleague on the coaching staff at the club. Coincidentally, they were raised just a few miles from one another (Joseba hailed from Elgoibar).

History Modern bridge into the castle The castle was probably built in the 13th century by the Masein/Rialt family near Untertagstein Castle. In 1316 Margareta von Rialt left all her properties in Tagstein to her nieces. The first mention of a castle in the area is in 1322, but it probably refers to Untertagstein in Masein. In 1322 the male line of the Rialt family died out and it was inherited by the B√§renburg family. The B√§renburg family were ministerialis, or unfree knights in service to a higher noble, to Vaz family. After the extinction of the Vaz family in 1337, they became vassals of the Counts of Toggenburg and the castle was given to the Tumb family. They began to refer to themselves as von Tagstein, but again probably referring to Untertagstein. In 1385 and 1387 Untertagstein is specifically mentioned. The castle was originally built with an outer gate at the south-west corner of the castle. This gate led to narrow path that wrapped around the southern side of the castle, passed through a middle gate and then led to an inner gate on the east side. At some point in the castle's history the western wall at the main cistern collapsed. The cistern was abandoned and the hole in the wall became a new gate. The old outer gate was then walled up. In the 15th century the castle was gutted by a fire and abandoned. In 1512 the ruins of Obertagstein were recorded in the property of Cazis Priory. As early as the 16th century the castle was visited by hikers who carved their initials and dates into the plaster walls. Castle site Floorplan of the castle The castle occupies the entire top of a small rock outcropping south of Thusis. The castle complex is about . Storage buildings and workshops were probably built on the mountain side of the outcropping and were separated from the castle by a ditch. Above the ditch was a ring wall that is mostly still standing. During construction the trunks of two trees were left standing and incorporated into the wall. Across a small courtyard, the palas filled the eastern end of the complex. The original entrance into the castle was on the east side of the palas, but after the cistern collapse the outer gate was sealed. The new western entrance had a wooden bridge over the ditch.

Originally a Swedish Army officer, Virgin became commanding officer of the Svea Train Corps (T 1) in 1926 and was appointed Inspector of the Swedish Army Service Troops the year after. In 1931 he was appointed Chief of the Air Force for the newly established Swedish Air Force. Virgin left the position as major general in 1934 to become advisor to the Emperor of Abyssinia. He left Abyssinia two days before the outbreak of the Second Italo- Ethiopian War in 1935 and back in Sweden he was placed in the Swedish Air Force reserve where he remained until 1947. Virgin died three years later. Career Virgin was born on 18 May 1876 in Sk√∂vde, Sweden, the son of colonel Ivar Virgin and his wife Hedvig (n√©e af Klint). He was commissioned as an officer in Sm√•land Grenadier Corps (I 7) in 1898 with the rank of underl√∂jtnant and attended the Royal Central Gymnastics Institute from 1899 to 1901 and the Royal Swedish Army Staff College from 1902 to 1904. Virgin served at the Horse Life Regiment (Livregementet till h√§st, K 1) in 1903 and was promoted to l√∂jtnant in 1904 and served as a company officer at the Royal Military Academy in 1905. Virgin then served at Wendes Artillery Regiment (A 3) in 1907 and at the Swedish State Railways from 1908 to 1910. He was a teacher at the Royal Swedish Army Staff College from 1910 to 1916 and became captain of the General Staff in 1912. The year after, Virgin served at Positionsartilleriregementet (A 3) and he became captain in the Life Regiment Grenadiers (I 3) in 1916. He accompanied the 1st, 5th and 10th Austro- Hungarian Army in 1917 and was a member of the Study Commission to the German Western Front in 1918. Back in Sweden, Virgin was appointed chief adjutant (√∂veradjutant) and major of the General Staff in 1918 and was appointed head of the Communications Department there in 1919. Virgin was appointed chief adjutant and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1922. He became commanding officer of Svea Train Corps (Svea tr√§ngk√•r, T 1) in 1926 and was appointed Inspector of the Swedish Army Service Troops (Tr√§nginspekt√∂r) in 1927. Virgin was promoted to major general and was appointed Chief of the Air Force and head of Flygstyrelsen in 1931. He left the post in 1934 to become political and military advisor to the Emperor of Abyssinia the same year. Virgin and captain Viking Tamm as well as four other military officers (the lieutenants Nils Bouveng, Arne Thorburn, Gustaf He√ºman and Anders Nyblom) entered together into the Abyssinian service to organize the country's only military school for the training of Abyssinian officers. A Swedish military academy for cadets was established in Holeta Genet under captain Tamm who, with his staff, stayed on in Abyssinia after the outbreak of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War despite pressure by the Swedish government to return. Virgin, who in Abyssinia was called \\"the White Emperor\\" and \\"Italy's enemy No. 1\\" because of his great influence, did nothing to dampen the Italian annoyance. On the contrary, he tried to tease Rome by recurrent condescending comments about Italians' military skills and their little prospect to emerge victorious from an armed conflict with the Abyssinians. He went so far as to even captain Tamm and the Swedish consul in Addis Ababa turned to the Foreign Ministry in Stockholm and asked for a transfer of the talkative general. The result was that Virgin left Abyssinia on 1 October 1935, only two days before the Italian invasion. Back in Sweden he was placed in the Swedish Air Force reserve in 1936 where he stayed until 1947. Other work Major General Virgin (third from right) in Addis Ababa in 1934. Virgin was chairman of the Military Association K.H.S. from 1918 to 1923 and secretary of Military Literature Association (Milit√§rlitteraturf√∂reningen) from 1914 to 1918. He was also an expert for the reorganization of the Road and Waterway Construction Service Corps in 1924, for the drafting of war regulations for the Swedish Air Force in 1928 and chairman of the experts drafting the new field service regulations for the Swedish Army in 1929. He became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences in 1924 and was second president from 1937 to 1940. Virgin was a member of the National Board of the Swedish Red Cross in 1927 and of the central board of the voluntary defense organization R√∂da stj√§rnan from 1928 to 1931.

Being the first of the eleven Street Fighter V Premier Events of the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour, the winner of the tournament automatically qualified for the Capcom Cup in December 2017. The event also hosted an Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 tournament after the game was absent in 2016, and the first major For Honor tournament. Background Final Round 20 took place on March 10‚Äì12 in Atlanta, Georgia and featured various fighting game tournaments. As staff and participants of Final Round 19 encountered issues regarding the size of the venue, Final Round was held in a 37,500 square foot exhibit hall, with all games being played in one room. Online registration for the event was handled by Smash.gg. In celebration of its 20th anniversary, Final Round hosted an Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 tournament, which was absent in the previous year due to the game's lack of popularity. After a \\"somber\\" display of the game at Evo 2016, Capcom and its community of fans worked to get Marvel vs Capcom back in the spotlights, resulting the Curleh Circuit, a series of fighting game events Final Round is part of. Final Round also hosted the first tournament of the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour, and thus kicked off the second season for Street Fighter V. The tournament attracted a large variation of international talent - among which Fuudo, Yusuke Momochi, and Capcom Cup 2016 champion NuckleDu - as its winner would take a sizable advantage for the rest of the season. Final Round 20 was the first major event to hold a For Honor tournament. Competitors played Ubisoft's open world fighting game, which was released one month prior, in two-versus-two matches. Street Fighter V tournament summary Final Round 20 continued the rivalry between Joshua \\"Wolfkrone\\" Philpot and Kenneth \\"KBrad\\" Bradley, which started at Frosty Faustings two months earlier when Wolfkrone harshly taunted KBrad after winning 2‚Äì1. Both players had won their respective pools when they met in the winner's bracket of the top 64. KBrad defeated Wolfkrone 2‚Äì0, not losing a single round during their matches, followed by KBRad literally putting his head inches in front of his opponent's face while the crowd went wild. KBrad eventually took fourth place in the finals, while, Wolfkrone came in at 13. The top 8 featured a larger variation of characters than usual, as the metagame was still catching up with the gameplay changes of the new season. Three players made a comeback by finishing in the top 8, two of them being Hiromiki \\"Itabashi Zangief\\" Kumada and Gustavo \\"801 Strider\\" Romero. The third was Kun Xian Ho, who dominated the tournament with Ibuki and defeated Fuudo's R. Mika in the grand finals. Xian became known for playing the low- tier character F.A.N.G., having told Compete that he \\"never think[s] about high or low tier [but instead] like[s] playing characters that look cool and hype.\\" When Ibuki was introduced in Street Fighter V around the end of the 2016 Capcom Pro Tour, Xian was looking to change his game, noting that he \\"had some matchups I just couldn't figure out.\\" Some fans have speculated that Xian was only able to win the stacked tournament by switching to a mid-tier character. BlazBlue upset During the pool play finals of Final Round 20's BlazBlue: Central Fiction tournament, low-seeded player Glyn \\"Doza\\" Mendoza defeated top-seeded Japanese player and Evo 2014 finalist Ryo \\"Dogura\\" Nozaki.

Shabazz was a minister and spiritual leader of thousands of Muslims in Newark and Jersey City and had been a member of the Nation of Islam, or Black Muslims, for more than 30 years. He was murdered in the driveway to his home in September, 1973.  Personal life  Shabazz was originally from Southern Pines, North Carolina and was the father of 13 children.  NOI  Shabazz was the head of Muslim Mosque No. 25 in Newark and in Jersey City at the time of his murder.  Murder  Shabazz was shot several times in the face while opening the door of his 1973 Cadillac in the driveway of his South Seventh Avenue home in Newark. Two gunmen ran off on foot. Police reports indicated that was a power struggle among the Black Muslims and discontent due to several Muslims being recently disbarred from membership.  Funeral  Shabazz's funeral at Mosque No. 25 was attended by over 3,000 people.  Related incidents  McGregors murder was one of three related incidents within a year that involved Black Muslims. The Hanafi Murder and the murder of Major Coxson being the other two. Police believed the killing was motivated by internal strife. After the murder, three reportedly Black Muslims, abducted an off‚Äêduty policeman from the street near Mr. Shabazz's home. He was driven around in a car, questioned him about Mr. Shabazz, and released. They were arrested later that day and were charged with kidnapping. The day following the kidnapping and release of the police officer, a black man was abducted nearby, driven around in a car for 24 hours, questioned about the Shabazz murder, and released. A Chicago Tribune article reported, \\"Internal disputes, including burning of mosques, have characterized the Black Muslims, also known as the Nation of Islam during the last decade. Some of the dissent has been between supporters of Elijah Muhammad, of Chicago and those who think it is time to replace the 75-year old leader of the sect which preaches racial separation. Previously another racial separatist group known as the Black Nationalists rivaled the [Black] Muslims for control of New York during the mid-1960s.\\" On October 18, 1973, two decapitated bodies of Warren Marcell and Michael A. Huff, were found in Newark Park. Their heads were found 4 miles away and one block from the home of Shabazz. Sources within the police told the Chicago Tribune, \\"they suspected the deaths were linked to a violent internal struggle within the Muslims. Twin brothers, Roger and Ralph Banston were killed one month earlier on September 18. A prison brawl occurred in October 1975 that involved 4 people from the New World of Islam that were serving life sentences for the murder. One prisoner was killed and six were stabbed with sharpened chisels. A Chicago Tribune article referred to the incident as \\"a preplanned attack by the Black Muslims on the Bellites,\\" and that \\"Bellites were identified as members of the New World Muslim faction.\\"  Aftermath  Fourteen people were indicted for murder in an alleged conspiracy to seize control of Newark's Mosque No. 25.

We live in a connected world. An estimated 40% of the world‚Äôs population now uses the internet and this number is growing at a remarkable rate. While there are significant variations in internet connectivity among countries and regions, the number of households with such links in the global South has now overtaken those in the global North. Moreover, over 70% of mobile telephone subscriptions worldwide are now in the global South. Five billion people are expected to go from no to full connectivity within the next twenty years. However, there are still significant gaps among countries and regions, for example between urban and rural areas. Limited broadband speed and lack of connectivity hamper access to knowledge, participation in society and economic development. The internet has transformed how people access information and knowledge, how they interact, and the direction of public management and business. Digital connectivity holds promise for gains in health, education, communication, leisure and well- being. Artificial intelligence advances, 3D printers, holographic recreation, instant transcription, voice-recognition and gesture-recognition software are only some examples of what is being tested. Digital technologies are reshaping human activity from daily life to international relations, from work to leisure, redefining multiple aspects of our private and public life. Such technologies have expanded opportunities for freedom of expression and for social, civic and political mobilization, but they also raise important concerns. The availability of personal information in the cyber world, for example, brings up significant issues of privacy and security. New spaces for communication and socialization are transforming what constitutes the idea of ‚Äòsocial‚Äô and they require enforceable legal and other safeguards to prevent their overuse, abuse and misuse. Examples of such misuse of the internet, mobile technology and social media range from cyber-bullying to criminal activity, even to terrorism. In this new cyber world, educators need to better prepare new generations of ‚Äòdigital natives‚Äô to deal with the ethical and social dimensions of not only existing digital technologies but also those yet to be invented. Education and internet are interrelated to each other.In pandemic time of 2020 online class are very important for students study for that online class internet has help a lot we can any information regarding our subject in internet Education and technology in developing countries The OLPC laptop being introduced to children in Haiti Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and developing countries. Educational technology is not merely a matter of education and technology alone but is also about the societal culture wherein that educational technology is implemented. Charities like One Laptop per Child are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials. According to one article, technology in developing countries is mostly limited, but some countries do have new advances in terms of pro-technology policies and biotechnology developments. One position effect of improving technology in developing countries is less dependence of developing countries on developed countries' exports of goods or technology. Developing infrastructures, promoting entrepreneurship, and formulating more open policies to technology are all somewhat effective ways of improving education and economies of developing countries. The OLPC foundation, a group out of MIT Media Lab and supported by several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a $100 laptop for delivering educational software. The laptops were widely available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations. In Africa, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) has launched an \\"e-school program\\" to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and internet access within 10 years. An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com, started with the support of former American President Bill Clinton, uses the Internet to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development. India is developing technologies that will bypass land-based telephone and Internet infrastructure to deliver distance learning directly to its students. In 2004, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched EDUSAT, a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the country's population at a greatly reduced cost. Educational tech (EdTech), mostly, information and communication technology can address issues, such as, an absent school teacher by conveying better lessons, preparing instructors and motivating students. In this generation, the price of educational technology has fallen to the point where EdTech is easily accessible even in generally poor nations. Tablets cost as low as $28 and India has the least expensive data plans on the planet. With less expensive data plans new companies such as ExtraClass has come into light which aims to provide affordable education to 260million school students in India. The OETC Consortium is composed of educational organizations, joined under a common conviction that everybody has access to technology for extraordinary learning. Together, these establishments employ a solid negotiating voice with the goal that each of the 1,000 individuals from OETC, can provide the educational technology to all students that deserve.  Technology Effects on Education  The key job that innovation needs to play in education is proportional access to a portion of the core tools that can make an important effect in the lives of both instructors and students. Some important themes can be identified to create worldwide techniques to help advancements that match the particular needs of a developing society. Some of the significant topics is to guarantee that students have access to the correct learning material, particularly in their own dialects since it guarantees a better comprehension of subjects. An AI-based tutoring system, Education Dominance, was put into an entry-level IT school in Pensacola by the U.S. Navy. This system relates to a human tutor in which the student's progress is monitored while providing individual assessments. According to the Navy, the students that worked with the digital tutoring system consistently performed better on the tests than did the students who did not use the digital tutor. The adaptive technology appears to affect students positively because it can assist individuals that have different learning skills than others and therefore better equipped to learn on their own. Technology programs that are already being used in education fields: Tablets, such as google chrome book, where students can access a range of google's educational software. DreamBox, Zearn, and ST Math, are math software programs that adapt to students as they learn.  Controversy  We are designing technologies to address different challenges in topics such as education, health and global poverty, But we can still identify cases in which this is not working or the results achieved are far away from the expectations. Kentaro Toyama, in his book Geek Heresy mentions examples in which this happen. He highlights the cases of computers in Bangalore that are locked away because teachers don't know what to do with them and mobile phone apps meant to spread hygiene practices and fail to improve health in Africa. Moreover, these past decades we experienced huge improvements in technology which have done little to turn rising poverty and inequalities, even in developed countries like United States. In addition to this, an interesting example is the one found by the economist Ana Santiago and her colleagues at the Inter-American Development Bank which conclude no educational advantage in a One Laptop per Child program in Peru. Another team of researchers found similar results in Uruguay, and concluded: \\"Our findings confirm that the technology alone cannot impact learning\\".

Neuroanatomical organization The MLR was first described by Shik and colleagues in 1966 when they observed that electrical stimulation of a region of the midbrain in decerebrate cats produced walking and running behavior on a treadmill. Twenty-eight years later, Masdeu and colleagues described the presence of a MLR in humans. It is now widely acknowledged that, along with other motor control centers of the brain, the MLR plays an active role in initiating and modulating the spinal neural circuitry to control posture and gait. Anatomically, as the name suggests, the MLR is located in the mesencephalon (or midbrain), ventral to the inferior colliculus and near the cuneiform nucleus. Although identifying the exact anatomical substrates of the MLR has been subject to considerable debate, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), cuneiform nucleus, and midbrain extrapyramidal area are thought to form the neuroanatomical basis of the MLR. Nuclei within the MLR receive inputs from the substantia nigra of the basal ganglia and neural centers within the limbic system. Projections from the MLR descend via the medullary and pontine reticulospinal tracts to act on spinal motor neurons supplying the trunk and proximal limb flexors and extensors. The PPN within the MLR is composed of a diverse population of neurons containing the neurotransmitters gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and acetylcholine (ACh). Results from animal and clinical studies suggest that cholinergic neurons in the PPN play a crucial role in modulating both the rhythm of locomotion and postural muscle tone. Glutamatergic and cholinergic inputs from the MLR may be responsible for regulating the excitability of reticulospinal neurons that in turn project to spinal central pattern generators to initiate stepping. Clinical significance The integration of motor and sensory information during walking involves communication between cortical, subcortical, and spinal circuits. Step-like motor patterns of the lower extremities can be induced through activation of the spinal circuitry alone; however, supraspinal input is necessary for functional bipedal walking in humans. Pathologies of the nuclei within the MLR have been associated with a combination of clinical features that are unique to midbrain dysfunction and can be differentiated from other subcortical neurological conditions such as those associated with Parkinsonism and cerebellar lesions. In a clinical case series, three adult males with isolated lesions of the MLR presented with gait hesitation and gait ataxia characterized by stepping that lacked uniform direction, amplitude, and rhythmicity. Although gait hesitation and ataxia are also clinical features of Parkinson's disease and lesions of the cerebellum, respectively, the authors noted that the patients did not display any other common signs or symptoms associated with these neurological conditions, suggesting that pathologies of the midbrain can produce gait disturbances even when cerebellar and basal ganglia function are intact. In a study investigating high-level gait and balance disorders in elderly adults who had no evidence of rheumatologic, orthopedic, or neurologic disease, brain imaging data revealed an association between reduced gray matter density of the PPN and cuneiform nucleus and impaired gait initiation, step execution, and postural control. Additionally, among eighteen individuals with Parkinson's disease who either did or did not experience Freezing of Gait, functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed reduced activity in the MLR and supplementary motor area among those individuals who experienced episodic gait hesitation. Freezing of Gait has also been associated with functional reorganization of supraspinal locomotor networks whereby altered connectivity and communication between the supplementary motor area and MLR were observed. These findings suggest that the MLR does in fact play a unique role in human locomotion, especially with respect to step initiation and motor planning. =Deep brain stimulation= Given the role of the MLR in gait initiation and postural control, researchers and clinicians have investigated the effects of targeted deep brain stimulation (DBS) on gait disturbances in clinical populations. Plaha and Gill reported significant improvements in gait dysfunction and postural instability in two patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who were treated using DBS electrodes implanted in the region of the PPN. Likewise, in a more recent study, six patients with Parkinson's disease demonstrated improvements in posture, gait, and postural stability following 6 months of DBS to the PPN and subthalamic nucleus. Bachmann and colleagues applied DBS to the MLR in rats with chronic, incomplete spinal cord injury and reported improved hindlimb function and near normal restoration of locomotor function following treatment.

It stars Dermot Walsh, Susan Shaw, Barry Letts, and Frederick Piper. The film was made at Highbury Studios as a second feature for release by the Rank Organisation.Chibnall & MacFarlane Like other Highbury productions, it offered acting opportunities for several of Rank's young contract stars. The film's sets were designed by Don Russell, although a number of the scenes were shot on location. The screenplay, written by T.J. Morrison and Arthur Reid, was based on a 1939 radio play by Patrick Hamilton, who had been encouraged to write the story as part of a government road safety campaign. Hamilton had himself been knocked down by a drunk driver. The story was updated slightly, and represents the post-war malaise with the use of noirish sequences.Hutchings p.44-45 After making the film Fisher graduated to directing several more expensive productions for Gainsborough Pictures. Synopsis While having a quiet drink together in a road house, a young working-class couple Fred and Nancy fall into the company of two raffish motorists including the self-confident Captain Cole. After a game of billiards and a number of drinks, they drive out on the road. While spreeding along in the dark they hit what they think to be a man on a bicycle. Although Fred wants to stop, Captain Cole insists on driving on. Nancy takes Cole's side and begins taunting Fred, who eventually manages to escape and raise the alarm. A police investigation reveals that nobody had been injured in the collision with the bike, which had belonged to a poacher who didn't report the accident. In the meantime, Cole, Nancy and the other passenger have suffered a crash of their own while drunken speeding, killing all three of them.

As a self-taught painter, his work was exhibited internationally. He was the author of several books, including collections of essays and novels. He was also a contributor to France Culture. A communist-turned-libertarian, he was a co-founder of Coop√©rative des Malassis, an anti-consumerist artists' collective. He was best known for The Red Men, a series of figurative paintings depicting aspects of the Cold War like the May 1968 events, the Vietnam War and Red Scare, and his 150 still lifes, or \\"portraits,\\" of potatoes. Early life Henri Cueco was born on 19 October 1929 in Uzerche, Corr√®ze, a rural part of France. His father, Vicente Cueco, was an immigrant from Spain. His mother was French. He was essentially self-taught, though his father also taught him how to paint from the age of 13. Career Cueco began his career as a landscape painter in the 1950s. He became a figurative painter, associated with the school of in 1960s. His artwork was political, and he was a critic of materialism and minimalism. He did paintings of hunting dogs and snakes, followed by 150 still lifes, or \\"portraits,\\" of potatoes. In 1969‚Äì1970, Cueco co-founded an artists collective called Coop√©rative des Malassis with Lucien Fleury, Jean-Claude Latil, Michel Parr√© and G√©rard Tisserand. Together, they designed a politically satirical fresco called Le Grand M√©choui in 1972. They designed Qui tue ? ou l‚Äôaffaire Gabrielle Russier in 1973. They also designed Radeau de la M√©duse ou la D√©rive de la soci√©t√©, a decor on consumerism in the Grand'Place, Grenoble, in 1973‚Äì1975. They designed Les affaires reprennent in 1977. His work was first exhibited at the Salon de la Jeune peinture, followed by the Atelier populaire. In 1970, he exhibited The Red Men, a series of paintings on the Cold War (including the May 1968 events, the Vietnam War and the Red Scare), at the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. In 1986, when he exhibited an irreverent portrait of Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud and Mao Zedong in Beijing, China, he was asked to take it down. The painting included the following quotation by Henri Jeanson: \\"Capitalism is the exploitation of men by men. Communism? It is the opposite.\\" In 1997, Cueco exhibited paintings inspired by Nicolas Poussin and Philippe de Champaigne at the Centre d'art contemporain in Meymac. In 2010, he exhibited nudes in the manner of Ingres at the Mus√©e Ingres in Montauban. He exhibited his work at the Mus√©e d'art et d'arch√©ologie du P√©rigord in 2014, when he was the guest of honour at the Expo√©sie Festival. His last exhibition was held at La Maison Rouge in February 2017. Cueco was the founder of the Association Pays Paysage in Uzerche. He was a contributor to the French radio station France Culture, especially its programmes called Les Papous dans la t√™te and Les D√©craqu√©s. He was the author of several books, including novels and collections of essays. One of his novels was made into a 2007 film directed by Jean Becker, Conversations with My Gardener. Cueco was an avid reader of Marxist texts. He was member of the French Communist Party from 1956 to 1976. He also joined the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), one of the main labour unions in France. With Ernest Pignon-Ernest, he co- founded the Syndicat national des artistes plasticiens CGT in 1977. However, by the 1980s, he had become a libertarian. Personal life and death Cueco had a wife, , and a son, , a professional zarb player. He resided between Vigeois in his native Corr√®ze and Paris. Cueco died of a kidney infection but was weakened by Alzheimer's disease on 13 March 2017 in Paris. He was 87.

'Verni' means 'faithful' or 'loyal' in Russian. =Yume (2012‚Äìpresent)= Yume, a 3-month old female Akita puppy, arrived in Moscow from Tokyo, Japan in July 2012, as the Akita Prefecture‚Äôs gift to show gratitude for assistance from Russia after the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. 'Yume', means 'dream' in Japanese. In 2016, the Japanese government offered Putin a male Akita puppy as a companion for Yume, but this gift was declined. =Buffy (2010‚Äìpresent)= Buffy, a caramel and white Bulgarian male 10-week-old shepherd Karakachan dog, was given to President Vladimir Putin during a visit to Bulgaria in November 2010 by Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov. The name 'Buffy' was chosen by a five-year-old boy during a nationwide competition. =Konni (1999‚Äì2014)= Konni with President Vladimir Putin in 2001. Konni (1999‚Äì2014) was a female black Labrador Retriever. Konni was born in 1999 and presented to Putin in December 2000. Konni was often seen at the President's side, and was sometimes allowed to attend meetings when Putin greeted world leaders during their visits to Russia. Putin was being updated on the progress of the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System GLONASS in 2007, when he inquired as to whether he would be able to buy a device hooked into GLONASS that would allow him to keep track of his dog, Konni. The collar was demonstrated on Konni on 17 October 2008, thus making Konni the first recipient of a GLONASS-enabled pet collar.

The technology is used to reduce the use of drinking water and primary energy consumption for water heating. By lowering the (household) hot water demand, water recycling showers also allow for smaller heating appliances, like boilers, solar water heating systems and other HVAC solutions.  History  The first recycling shower, operated by a hand pump, was patented in England in 1767 by the stove maker William Feetham. This recycling shower used the pump to push the water into a basin above the user's head. To receive the water, the user pulled a chain to release the water from the basin. Like this, the invention would recycle the same dirty water during the entire session. It also gradually lost temperature. It was not until 200 years later, in 1979, that Billy G. Bloys invented a motorized version of the same concept, discarding the hand pump. Using no filtration or a means of re-heating the water, the contraption likened the original invention by Feetham but did not improve on it beyond the electronic pump and some fixtures. It was never commercialized. In 1988, Francis R. Keeler patented a similar but smaller and more mobile version of the recycling shower for usage in motor homes, boats and airplanes. In 2011, Nick Christy of Australia won the Postcode Lottery Green Challenge, an annual competition for sustainable ideas for his version of the water recycling shower. The shower aimed to collect, filter, pasteurize and then dilute the water with fresh tap water to cool it again to the set temperature. Citing cultural problems and lack of traction in his native Australia, Christy aimed for the UK market. They are yet to collect certification standards. In 2013, the Swedish company Orbital Systems introduces their first shower, the launching company being a spinoff from a NASA internship. It comprises a closed-loop system where the water is purified using a replaceable filter. These filter out particulate matter and microbes from drain water before sending the water back through the head. After the capsules have been depleted, they have to be replaced at cost. Orbital Systems has had several high-profile investors, including Skype and Kazaa co-founder Niklas Zennstr√∂m and Karl-Johan Persson, CEO of the fashion company H&M.; In 2015, the Dutch company Hamwells introduced the e-Shower at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in London. Citing hygiene issues in earlier solutions, Hamwells opted for a solution with a semi-closed loop where the water is used several times instead of the entire session. External hot water is used to maintain temperature, with incoming hot water replacing the used water within the loop. In addition to replacement, water within the loop is filtered and purified with UV light. For users unable or unwilling to use the recycling mode, the e-Shower offers a classic shower where all the water is drained. Being a computer, the e-Shower is able to self-clean, regulate shower times between users and offer the user music streaming and remote control through mobile apps.  Benefits  Water recycling showers have been explored by people who wish to conserve water and the energy needed to heat the water, for both environmental and economic reasons. = Energy savings = According to the U.S. Department of Energy, water heating is typically the second- largest energy expense in homes (after space heating). Mostly destined for the shower, it accounts for roughly 17% of total household energy consumption. Energy efficiency was the main driver behind the federal regulation, mandating the top flow of a shower head to be restricted to 2.5 gallons per minute. Manufacturers of recycling showers typically claim a 70% to 90% reduction in shower energy consumption. = Water savings = Nearly 1.2 trillion gallons of water is used in the United States annually just for showering. This is enough to supply the water needs of New York and New Jersey for a year. Manufacturers of recycling showers typically claim an 80% to 90% reduction in shower water consumption. Also, before the shower reaches the set temperature, users leave the tap running. Typically 20 percent of every shower session is essentially lost this way. = Comfort increase = A typical shower delivers 9.5 liters per minute (2.5 gallons per minute). Scientific studies that monitored hundreds of homes across the nation have shown that flow rates have little influence on the duration of the shower.

(This was Id's Raven engine, licensed to Raven Software for their 1993 game ShadowCaster.) Mind Shear agreed enthusiastically, expecting that they would be working on a nearly complete Doom engine. Only after contracts were signed and development was underway did they discover just how buggy and incomplete the codebase was. Problems with lag, jerky animation, and slow rendering plagued the project right up until a significantly delayed release. The game was re-released under the name Assassinators by Memorex Software in 1998.

While living in Rome, she and her husband, George Washington Wurts, created an art collection containing approximately 3,000 works that was donated on her death in 1933 to Benito Mussolini. The art collection remains in Rome, and their villa and gardens are open to the public.  Early life  Henrietta Tower was the last of seven children of Charlemagne Tower, a lawyer, businessman, and graduate of Harvard University. On her father‚Äôs death in 1889, Tower inherited a vast fortune from his business ventures which included a coal mining operation in Pennsylvania and an iron production plant in Minnesota. This inheritance made her one of the wealthiest women in the United States at that time.  Life in Rome and art collection  Villa Sciarra in Rome Tower married George Washington Wurts in 1898. In 1902 the couple moved to Rome and bought a villa, known as the Villa Sciarra-Wurts, which they spent the rest of their lives renovating and decorating with a variety of art works. They frequently entertained the wealthy, ambassadors, and aristocratic members of society. After her husband‚Äôs death in 1928 Tower gave their villa to the city of Rome on the condition that the vast garden be turned into a public park and cultural center in honor of the German poet, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. (Included with this was a gift of $50,000 to maintain the property.) The park so dedicated was opened in 1932 and a year later, in 1933, Tower died in Lucerne, Switzerland and is buried in the Protestant cemetery in Rome. Through her will Tower bequeathed the vast art collection that she and her husband had expanded over several decades to Benito Mussolini, on the condition that it be kept in a museum. The collection was given to Rome's Museo nazionale del Palazzo di Venezia where it has remained since (although several works remain in the Villa Sciarra-Wurts). Included in the collection are over 3,000 items including: ceramics, textiles, tapestries, paintings (including works by Ottaviano Nelli, Vincenzo Pagani, John Russell, Paolo Veneziano, and Michael Wolgemut), about 80 wooden sculptures, various works from China and Japan, and a significant number of works from Russia including 33 late 19th-century women's hats.

As of December 1894, he was serving as President of the New York City Board of Health as well. Career When the New York Mining Stock Exchange and the National Petroleum Exchange were consolidated in 1883 into the Consolidated Stock and Petroleum Exchange of New York, Charles G. Wilson was elected president and held the office until 1900. In 1890, he was appointed president of the New York City Board of Health, and as president, by September 1892 he was handling a cholera outbreak in New York City. As of December 1894, he was serving as both president of the Board of Health as well as President of the Consolidated Exchange. After re-appointment by the mayor, he kept his position at the health board until 1898. At the annual Consolidated Stock Exchange election on June 11, 1900, Mortimer H. Wagar defeated Wilson for the presidency of the Consolidated Stock and Petroleum Exchange. According to The New York Times, \\"the contest was the most closely fought in the history of the Exchange, the total number of votes cast being 793. The largest vote ever polled in a previous election was 628.\\" After Wilson's fifteen years as president, Wagar took over in 1900 with \\"a large majority of the members\\" supporting him, having polled 504 votes to 287. On May 29, 1902, he sent a letter to the editor of the Times, clarifying that he was not in fact in opposition to the then present administration of the Exchange, as reported prior. Personal life As of 1894, he had apartments in Chelsea at 23rd Street. He was the stepfather of Mrs. A. E. Kofoed, who disappeared from her home in August 1899. Wilson asserted that she might have been kidnapped, as compared to suicide. His wife, Augusta J. Wilson, died on November 21, 1904. The funeral was held at her home on 94th Street in New York. On February 9, 1929, Charles G. Wilson married Helen L. Carmichel, daughter of Wiliam Carmichel of New York.

Hashimoto is currently ranked first in the lightweight division. Hashimoto rose to prominence by becoming national champion at the All-Japan Judo Championships in 2015. He then became one of the lightweight division's top judokas by winning five tournaments consecutively, spanning from the World Masters to the Grand Slam Tokyo and Paris. He is known for his dynamic style of judo and strong groundwork. Career =2015 Grand Prix Qingdao= Hashimoto's first opponent in Qingdao was Bang Gui-man of Korea. It was a heavy fight for grips, with many penalties on both sides. However, despite both being level with three shidos each, Bang was penalised for the fourth time and awarded hansoku make, bringing Hashimoto through to his second fight. He then faced American Nicholas Delpopolo, in a relatively equal match, with only a yuko separating them when Hashimoto attacked with an osoto gari. Even though the throw was relegated from ippon, it was enough to send the Japanese to the quarter-final. Hashimoto made short work of his opponent, Italian Enrico Parlati, pressuring the latter to be penalised for a false attack with a drop seoi nage in the early seconds of the fight. Hashimoto then threw Parlati with a seoi nage for ippon in just 30 seconds. He again showed a masterclass in the semi-final against Giyosjon Boboev of Uzbekistan, again pressuring the latter to make a false attack with a drop seoi nage just 12 seconds in. Hashimoto unsuccessfully attempted a drop seoi otoshi, however he managed to bring the fight to the ground. He finished the fight by ippon with a signature juji gatame. In the final, Hashimoto was against top-ranked Rustam Orujov. He scored ippon with a seoi nage in a little over a minute, winning the tournament's gold medal. =Rise to prominence: Undefeated run since 2016 till 2018= 2016 Masters Guadalajara At the invitation-only Masters, Hashimoto faced Sainjargalyn Nyam-Ochir in his first fight. It was a smaller group of fighters as the event was only months away from the 2016 Olympics. The bout was shido-filled, both fighters having been penalised for false attacks and passivity. However, Hashimoto pulled through when Sainjargalyn was penalised with a third shido. He then faced Israeli Sagi Muki, in another tight, shido-dominated fight. Over two minutes into the bout, Hashimoto scored a wazaari with an osoto gari. Despite being penalised for avoiding grip twice following the score, he was through to the semi-finals as Muki failed to score. Hashimoto was against rival Orujov for a place in the final. Another tactical fight ensued, with only a shido separating them. Hashimoto's opponent for the gold medal was Ganbaataryn Odbayar. He showed a newaza masterclass with an unusual juji-gatame for ippon. IJF commentators remarked that the armbar was reminiscent of Brazilian jiu-jitsu than judo. They speculate that Hashimoto had trained in BJJ. 2016 Grand Slam Tokyo Hashimoto was against Lee Fengmao of Taiwan in Round 2. He caught Lee with an ippon seoi nage a minute and a half into the fight, and scored wazaari. He then connected to a yoko shiho gatame for ippon. In the following fight, he faced Boboev who was ready for a tactical battle. Hashimoto succeeded when Boboev picked up a second shido for passivity. Hashimoto carried on with a tactical strategy as he went against countryman Arata Tatsukawa in the semi-final. He also won by a single shido, controlling the grips and causing Tatsukawa to be defensive. The final was set against Takeshi Doi in another level fight. Doi tried to bring the fight to the ground in the opening moments of the bout, and fought with a lasso guard as Hashimoto remained in a stand-up stance while attempting osaekomi. He then managed to break Doi's guard as Doi rolled to his front, which Hashimoto followed with an unsuccessful juji gatame attempt. The fight then varied between newaza and fighting for grips. Doi then lost the final by stepping outside the tatami, giving the gold medal to Hashimoto.

His has empirically investigated \\"the Korean Peoples' identity & their mass-psychology\\" by connecting it to a variety of issues such as self, online world identity, consumption behavior, love & relationships, power desire and political decision making. He has mainly researched the different psychological types of people and how the human mind works in on and offline settings. His most well-known projects are WPI (Whang's Personality Inventory), research on the identities of online game players, and research on politicians' public images. Whang has been a professor at Sejong University from 1994-1997 and at Yonsei University from 1994-2016. In January 2016, he was dismissed from his position as a tenured professor at Yonsei University, by excuse of violating an ethical rule, 'having a job outside of professorship without the permission of the university president.' There is controversy and speculation surrounding his dismissal. The unusual dismissal of a tenured professor from his position was a retaliatory decision made because of Whang's criticism against Geun-hye Park, the 11th President of South Korea. She was later impeached and dismissed from the presidency. Whang's dismissal was planned and executed by the late president of Yonsei University, Gap Young Cheung who denied his involvement of this case as a president of university. The late president Gap Young Cheung had a strong reputation that he had wished to hold a government or Blue House position during Ms. Park's presidency. After the impeachment of Ms. Park, Cheung retired from the university and remained as an honorary professor. Whang's dismissal is appreciated as an example of an evidence of latent oppression on academia by power. Dr. Whang currently runs a podcast WhangShimSo, where he provides free consultations on personal and career conflicts, and commentates on the diverse social issues in Korean Society.  Early life and family  He was born as a second child in the town of Jinhae, and lived there until he was 9 years old when his parents decided to move to the bigger city of Pusan for the opportunity to better educate their children. He has said the thought ‚ÄúI need to do well academically in ordered to be treated like a person‚Äù was a motivating factor in his youth to study hard. In an interview with Chosun Ilbo, he recalled ‚ÄúOnce I received grades that put me in 25th place in class and the kids who used to ask me questions during recess stopped asking me any questions. They would not even reply when I said something. What was even more surprising was that kids who were known to be physically dominant in the class started bothering me. It was strange. So I came in 2nd place in class on the next test. The teacher told me to stop playing with grades. And the other kids treated me normally again. This led me to think that in Korean society I need to do well academically in order to be treated properly as a person even before having any idea of what I really want to do.‚Äù  Education and academic career  = College = In the spring of 1981, Whang was admitted into Seoul National University's Social Sciences department. He himself has said it was pure coincidence that he came to major in Psychology. He initially went to the Social Sciences department in order to become a diplomat, but started to rethink his path after spending his first year of college drinking. It was overwhelming for him to consider majoring in Sociology only to be living in and out of jail afterwards due to the political oppression at the time. He did not want to live as a person who had to tout himself for someone or something. He chose psychology because he thought he could quietly study human behavior in a lab instead of having to go on expeditions into remote areas if he had chosen anthropology. In his second- year of college, he was selected as a scholarship recipient of The Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies and received 50,000 won ($50) per month, an event from which he gained hope and confidence to study abroad and pursue the path of a scholar, which he used to assume would be difficult. He was determined to go to America and become B.F. Skinner's student after reading Walden II. = Graduate school = After receiving his BA in psychology in 1985, Sang Min Whang continued his studies at East Graduate School under professor Bong Yeon Suh's guidance. And in September 1986, he received a scholarship from The Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies to study Social Cognitive Development under Sheldon White's guidance in Harvard University's psychology doctorate program. The question that continues to be repeated in Sang Min Whang's work since his graduate school days can be summarized as follows: \\"How are peoples' minds living in a particular society or culture expressed in different ways for each individual?\\" His doctoral dissertation \\"The Organization of Everyday Places and their Dimensional Features: The Priming Effect of Dimensions on the Congruence of Place and Behavior\\" explored what kind of conceptions people had of everyday places, how the psychological meaning people attribute to places can be measured, and whether the measured results came from absolute characteristics of places or were results of peoples‚Äô responses to places. In this study, he employed non-parametric statistical analysis, which unlike parametric statistical analysis that presumes a few set patterns exist, uses data to find an unknown pattern. Since his postdoctoral fellowship, Sang Min Whang focused on the ‚Äúhuman mind that operates in the Internet.‚Äù Under the guidance of Rob Kling at University of California, Irvine, he started research on the mind in the PC network environment and was a pioneer in early research on the virtual world. He accurately predicted that shopping and other real life activities will occur over the Internet and classified the characteristics of the type of person who first finds new electronic products and the characteristics of the consumer that spreads the use of new electronic products. (Refer to \\"Digital Freaks Decide Future Consumption\\") = Academic career and research = In his life as a researcher, Sang Min Whang delved into the subject of the ‚Äúself,‚Äù especially ‚Äúidentification and respect for an individual‚Äôs disposition‚Äù based on the study of ‚ÄúKorean Peoples‚Äô Identity.‚Äù In particular, he researched the relationship between ‚Äúthe self oneself perceives‚Äù and ‚Äúthe self others perceive,‚Äù or the ‚Äúreal self‚Äù and the ‚Äúideal self‚Äù Koreans experience and build in various aspects by connecting it to specific fields in education, development, politics, marketing, etc. He especially asserts that instead of the medical model that defines a student or a child's particular behavior as a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù and tries to solve it, the ‚Äúdevelopmental perspective,‚Äù which helps a student or a child understand herself by diagnosing and understanding each individual's character and the meaning each individual attributes to her actions, needs to be applied to education and psychotherapy. He rejected mainstream psychology that looks for the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù among people and tried to define the different individual characteristics expressed in a cultural or societal setting and measure these ‚Äúunknown concepts‚Äù using MDS (Multidimensional Scaling). However, he started to feel there was a fundamental limitation to his research when it could find factors showing quantitative differences exist among individuals, but could not find each individual's characteristic that has its own attributes manifest in different ways from each other, and later used the Q Methodology to overcome this. Q Methodology Development In order to find a method that can investigate the characteristics of each individual living in a sociocultural environment instead of assuming an absolute and immutable attribute, Sang Min Whang organized a seminar called ‚ÄúWhat is Research Methodology?‚Äù with his students after starting his post in Yonsei University. One of the people invited to this seminar was Heung Gyu Kim, a former professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, who introduced Q Methodology to Whang. Afterwards, Whang studied the different thoughts people had from each other on various topics such as ‚ÄúInternet Psychology,‚Äù ‚ÄúFuture Electronic Products,‚Äù etc. According to Sang Min Whang, Q Methodology makes it possible to do a quantum-mechanical interpretation of the mind unlike the existing factor analysis that was being used in psychology. That is, psychology based on the existing R-technique factor analysis defines each factor as an absolute characteristic that everyone has and only differs in the extent, while Q Methodology made it possible to deduce how each factor comes together differently and manifests in different ways according to each individual in different environments. It applied the fact that like how the subject can be conscious of the observer and decide on its movements and change, an individual can be aware of her environment and her own characteristics to manifest them (Refer to Q Workshop Manual). Afterwards, Sang Min Whang felt the limitation of interpreting each factor deduced from Q Methodology analysis as one characteristic according to the traditional analysis method. This was because he thought there was a need to separate the positive, easily shown disposition and the negative or hidden disposition that both appear within a single factor instead of abstractly lumping them together. In order to overcome this limitation, he divided the statements arranged according to the weight attributed to each statement into high, middle, and low and interpreted them as each different characteristics drawn from one factor. Afterwards, the middle-ranked statement was excluded because it could not reveal a clear disposition about the relevant factor and one factor was interpreted by being divided into two extreme dispositions shown by the highest-ranked statement and lowest-ranked statement. This is the principle of ‚Äúextremes meet‚Äù being applied to Q Methodology and by interpreting one factor into two extreme dispositions, not only was it clearer how each disposition shows itself in a studied society and but it also became possible to show each characteristics‚Äô interaction with one another. In addition, by dividing one factor into two extremes, it was possible to find out in Q Methodology research that proceeds with a comparatively small number of participants not only the disposition that is easily admitted by people or accepted in a societal situation (mainstream), but also the characteristic people are reluctant to show or only a minority of people have (non- mainstream). This new interpretative method based on Q Methodology is found in a number of Sang Min Whang's research. Research on Koreans' psychology =WPI (Whang‚Äôs Personality Inventory)= Sang Min Whang thought there needs to be a tool differentiated from the western psychology tests to measure ‚ÄúKoreans‚Äô psychology‚Äù because Asians and Westerners define and think about ‚Äúthe self‚Äù in different ways. In the field of personality study, the Big 5 Theory of Personality (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism) was already known to exist through Costa & McCrae and others‚Äô research. However, Sang Min Whang thought these five factors would combine and manifest in different ways depending on the sociocultural environment and an individual's experience and beliefs. According to the metaphor he uses frequently, it is important to know the fact that ‚Äúwhen making bread, the ingredients you need are ‚Äòflour,‚Äô ‚Äòeggs,‚Äô ‚Äòmilk,‚Äô ‚Äòyeast,‚Äô and ‚Äòbutter.‚Äô But the bread is not the ingredient. It only becomes bread when you mix the ingredients together to make the dough, proof it, put it in the oven, and bake it. Likewise, a persons‚Äô mind becomes known not by the score from individual psychological traits or factors, but only after going through a larger frame that can look at those comprehensively.‚Äù (<> He was able to classify two dimensional types, the self that yourself sees (I), and the self that others see (Me) based on Q Methodology and after constructing many statements indicating Koreans‚Äô emotion, lifestyle, and behavior pattern based on the Big 5 Theory of Personality. The way Koreans define themselves have been differentiated into 5 types: (I) Realist, Romantist, Humanist, Idealist, and Agent, and the way they define themselves using others as a medium (Me) was differentiated into these 5 types: Relation, Trust, Manual, Self, and Culture. His findings empirically proved how William James‚Äô theory that the ‚Äúself‚Äù is a combination of ‚Äúthe self that yourself thinks of (I)‚Äù and ‚Äúthe self that others see (Me)‚Äù manifests itself in a specific sociocultural setting and WPI (Whang's Personality Inventory) has been organized as a personality test that is being used in counseling and education. =WPI's 5 Types= * Realist: A realist tries to have good relationships with other people because he or she acquires his or her sense of being through others‚Äô acknowledgement. She or he is considerate of other people and caters well to others because she or he does not like big changes or conflicts, but also goes through heartache or a ‚Äúgood person complex‚Äù as a result. In any organization, if there is not a lot of conflict within it, it could be due to the work of a realist. Realists think of the organization they belong to, their wealth, and their academic pedigrees as measures they can use to gain others‚Äô recognition and they also strive for self-improvement in order to live textbook definitions of successful lives, which are decided on by the outside world. * Romantist: Romantists feel alive when they share their feelings with others. If a romantist, for whom the sharing of sensibilities and emotions are important, feels that his or her feelings are not appreciated then he or she may have a heart that is the more impoverished than anyone else even though he or she may be living an abundant life. A romantist's sensibility, delicate like a glass bead, is sometimes also expressed in an artistic sense. Additionally, when working on something new, romantists might appear to be very hesitant because they have a lot of fear and anxiety, but on the contrary, they may also appear to be meticulous and deliberate. * Humanist: Humanists acquire their sense of being through relationships with people. They are out-going, sociable and friendly. They have the ability to utilize their personal networks to solve problems. In contrast, they also show a side where they start off strong and end weak by setting up grand goals without being detailed enough and have difficulty putting in any effort for a long time to achieve said goals. They think it is a matter-of-course and natural to treat superiors with respect and to appear authoritative to subordinates. They can be confident in their ability to build relationships, but they have a hard time noticing delicate and subtle feelings. * Idealist: Idealists acquire their sense of being when they feel free and gain an understanding about the world. They seek something of their own that is different from others, which gives the impression of being idealistic, abstract, and disconnected from reality. Also, they may appear to another person to be selfish and individualistic at times because idealists are only concerned with what they‚Äôre interested in and indifferent to everything else. They prefer spending time alone and try to live independently. Idealists can change their interests frequently because they have a lot of curiosity and are creative, but it is important above all else for idealists to become immersed in one thing and build their own expertise. * Agent: Agents acquire their sense of being through their achievements. Their work is what they are and they feel a joy greater than anything else when they complete a task in the way they wanted to. They have a tendency to prioritize work above relationships and they do not like someone meddling in their work process. This is because they enjoy themselves becoming immersed in the process of their work as it progresses as they have planned. This tendency may also connect to their hobbies. If they start to approach their hobbies like it is work, they can become scarily absorbed and bring to mind the image of an obsessive-compulsive otaku (geek). Koreans‚Äô desires and \\"the Relationship between image and true self\\" In \\"The President and Louis Vuitton\\", Sang Min Whang thought (luxury good) consumption and elections clearly showed how Koreans‚Äô dress up their desires instead of saying what they want, thinking that if they choose the vaguely ‚Äúgood thing,‚Äù it will produce the results they want. When you make a decision to dress up your desire without being able to distinguish between ‚Äúwhat you really want‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat you are saying you want,‚Äù you feel ‚Äúduped‚Äù and cannot be satisfied even after spending money. On the other hand, he suggested ‚Äúthe mind‚Äôs MRI,‚Äù a development from Q Methodology, for suppliers to use as a method to diagnose the consumer's hidden desire and the desire they freely talk of in a societal setting.  Dismissal from Yonsei University and controversy  = Criticism against Geun Hye Park‚Äôs Regime and Dismissal from Yonsei University‚Äôs full professorship = In May 2015, Sang Min Whang researched the types of image the public has about the then President Geun Hye Park using Q Methodology and published his findings in the monthly magazine Shin Dong Ah with the title ‚ÄúFoolish Ruler> Face Madame >Our VIP.‚Äù According to Whang‚Äôs research, people perceived Ms. Park mainly as a ‚Äúpuppet.‚Äù The ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù image the majority of people had of Ms. Park was divided into more detailed types: foolish ruler, our VIP, and face Madame. The study simultaneously found the public expected a president with the image of a ‚Äúleading hero‚Äù as an alternative to Park. This meant the public already knew through her image that Park is incompetent and, at the same time, only a sort of ‚Äúceremonious figure‚Äù with someone else calling the shots. She was being perceived as a leader that did not have the ability to govern a nation. After publishing his ‚ÄúPresident Geun Hye Park Image‚Äù research in Shin Dong Ah magazine, Sang Min Whang was sent to Yonsei University's disciplinary committee for ‚Äúviolation of prohibition on holding a job outside of professorship and violation of prohibition on engaging in commercial activity‚Äù and the former Yonsei University president, Gap Young Cheung, who was being mentioned as a potential minister nominee in Geun Hye Park's regime, passed the dismissal motion on his last day in office on January 29, 2016. Yonsei University has claimed there is no relation between Sang Min Whang's research and the exclusionary disciplinary action and that he was removed because of ‚Äúholding concurrent offices,‚Äù but through the Soon Sil Choi affair it was proven Sang Min Whang's research predicted the hidden commander's existence. The retaliatory decision to dismiss a tenured professor, along with Yoo Ra Chung's illicit admission incident, showed that universities lost academic autonomy and became an instrument of political power. Professor Ho Geun Lee from Yonsei University, who agreed to an interview with Dong-A Ilbo newspaper, claimed that if Whang had only ‚Äúviolated the prohibition on holding a job outside of professorship and the prohibition on engaging in commercial activity‚Äù then he would not have been dismissed and implied that Whang was dismissed because he was negligent in carrying out his duties as a professor. Lee cited examples such as Whang's absence from meetings with professors, scheduling all of his courses to teach on one day during the week, and managing an outside research lab named Wisdom Center even though Whang did a lot of research. However, it was confirmed Sang Min Whang did not receive any salary or engage in any commercial activity for profit and only conducted research by accepting projects through Wisdom Center. In Korea and in the U.S., it is difficult for the excuse ‚Äúholding another office outside of professorship‚Äù to be the grounds for dismissal because many professors in both countries establish their own research labs to work more freely on research or they hold offices at companies in related areas of study. Ultimately, according to Lee's interview, Yonsei University presented the reasons that Whang was ‚Äúnegligent‚Äù because he did not attend the professor meetings and fit all of his courses into one day to remove a tenured, full professor with satisfactory research performance. This kind of measure taken by Yonsei University is one of the examples of how people who satirized Geun Hye Park were oppressed under the regime. Gap Young Cheung, who removed Sang Min Whang from Yonsei University, was one of the figures being mentioned as a nominee for the first chief of staff or the minister of economy under Geun Hye Park's regime, but he unable to take a government post. Afterwards, he tried for reappointment of Yonsei University's president, but failed after ‚Äúbeing ranked as the lowest among potential candidates on performance and qualifications in an opinion gathering session by Yonsei University faculty.‚Äù After the next term (18th) president of Yonsei University was decided to be Yong Hak Kim, the dismissal procedure for Whang progressed quickly. Gap Young Cheung signed the dismissal resolution on his last day of his president term and announced it is ‚Äúchance‚Äù that the two dates coincide. Some analyze Gap Young Cheung's removal of Sang Min Whang, who continued to maintain a critical tone of Geun Hye Park's regime on a daily basis, as a move Cheung made to become appointed to public office under Geun Hye Park's regime. However, Gap Young Cheung claimed in an interview with the press that he ‚Äúdid not know‚Äù about Sang Min Hwang's dismissal from Yonsei University's professorship and that he only followed the decision of the disciplinary committee even though he was Yonsei University's president when the dismissal process was in progress. These actions by Gap Young Cheung along with the illicit admission of Yoo Ra Chung into Ewha University is analyzed as a case of how university personnel have transformed into, not people who pursue learning, but rather agents of political power under Geun Hye Park's regime. In other instances of abuse of power, it became known Geun Hye Park's regime not only made the conglomerate CJ group discontinue the Saturday Night Live television program that satirized Geun Hye Park, but also exerted pressure on CJ group's human resources to influence management position appointments within the company. This example shows thorough vindictive punishment was carried out against people who revealed the true nature of Geun Hye Park's regime by applying ‚Äúcharges that do not have anything to do with the regime.‚Äù Like how in the dynasty era the suspicion of ‚Äúhaving taken part in a conspiracy‚Äù was cast on everyone to cause a ‚Äúpurge‚Äù to happen and was used as an excuse to punish people, in Geun Hye Park's regime where she was called the ‚Äúqueen‚Äù by the masses, the suspicion of ‚Äúhaving engaged in profit-seeking activity‚Äù that could easily incur hatred among people was used to discipline a company that could legitimately engage in profit-seeking activity and discipline a professor who had the right to freely research. The attempt to discipline Sang Min Whang in 2015 was not the first time. In 2014, he was sent to the disciplinary action committee for ‚Äúlack of research production and negligence in teaching students,‚Äù but the charge fell apart after it was revealed not to be true. This is because in 2014 when Sang Min Whang was sent to the disciplinary action committee, he did five presentations in international and domestic academic societies and published one dissertation and the book The Person That Is Me. Also, he was on the editing staff for the Journal of Human Subjectivity and was editor-in-chief of the Korean Society for the Study of Human Subjectivity. In the following year of 2015, he published \\"The New Consumer Psychology: Scanning buying behavior with MRI of the Mind\\" through Routledge, America's publishing company specializing in social sciences. In addition, when the genital scandal arose, Sung Joo Kim who was the co-chair of the Presidential Campaign Committee for Saenuri party, visited Yonsei University demanding Sang Min Whang's resignation from professorship and revealed that she was promised disciplinary action by Yonsei University. It was brought up that Sung Joo Kim may be a member of the hidden power organization called ‚Äúeight fairies‚Äù related to the Soon Sil Choi scandal, but she denied the allegation. Professor Chang Yong Kim, who asserts that he also experienced the dangers of disadvantages caused by criticizing the regime, criticized Yonsei University's actions against Whang and warned against the current danger the state of social sciences is in Korea and scholars‚Äô freedom becoming limited by saying as follows: > ‚ÄúHe was easily terminated by the so-called ‚Äúgenital‚Äù comment even though he > was a full professor who was guaranteed retirement (tenure). If you look at > it, what is wrong with this comment? It was nothing more than an ordinary > opinion, not degradation nor defamation. > After being terminated, professor Whang appeared on a TV program and > claimed, ‚ÄúI became an object of hatred after defining Geun Hye Park as a > ‚Äòfoolish ruler‚Äô and even if there was pressure to terminate me from the Blue > House because of this, the faculty council and university president should > have stepped forward acting as a shield saying it [my comment] is within > academic domain. This is evidence that universities have become trash‚Ä¶‚Äù > Even if a college professor is guaranteed retirement, he still has to assume > risk when practicing the ‚Äúfreedom of expression‚Äù guaranteed by the > constitution against political authority.

It was shown the image the public has of the president can be divided into 8 types through this research. The following is the body of the research explanation that was published in Shin Dong Ah. > ‚ÄúTo the public that perceives President Park as a ‚Äòfoolish ruler,‚Äô she is > like ‚Äúa king that tries to privatize the country.‚Äù Above all, she is an > ‚Äúincompetent and lazy‚Äù leader. She is a person who does not take > responsibility and only has the desire for power. She cannot tolerate a > competent subordinate and is strongly likely to engage in random behavior in > order to maintain power. So the public is anxious and fearful the foolish > ruler may do something a senseless child might do. Above all, to a foolish > ruler, the people and the country is a means to satisfy her desires. She > likely regards ‚Äòthe country=power=me.‚Äô > Even with this kind of presidential image, she is a fine enough leader for > those who want to maintain conservative power. She could even be a really > needed leader if one‚Äôs gains or interests fit well together with the > president. However, the people who see President Park in the image of the > foolish ruler has the thought ‚Äúthe country has been left to someone who is > incompetent and causes uneasiness with the possibility she may do something > preposterous.‚Äù The public having this kind of image about the president does > not, by any means, mean that ‚Äúthe president is this kind of person.‚Äù It just > means some perceive the president as a foolish king. > The more the public think the president is a foolish king, the more the > image of the political leader they desperately want becomes the ‚Äúgreat > commander (strategist).‚Äù A great commander who torments and agonizes himself > and at the same time tries to change society.

It is the image of a leader who can tell us the tasks and > crisis our society faces and can solve it together. This kind of image > stands out more when the uncertainty of the current situation becomes > greater.‚Äù This research was made into PCIC (President Candidate Image Checklist) that diagnoses what kind of wish, desire, and belief people have of a particular politician and is being utilized as material that analyzes the public image of tentative presidential candidates in current event programs. = Genitals remark dispute = Sang Min Whang appeared on the 219th episode of the television program ‚ÄúGordian Knot‚Äù and discussed the phenomenon that Park, who was a presidential candidate at the time, was being advertised as the ‚Äúfirst female president.‚Äù In the episode, he argued the public is delusional to expect a mother like aspect from candidate Park who was raised only as a princess and did not marry or experience becoming a mother. This is because in Korean society the life of a woman comes from having to perform a societal role, not from the genitals that are different from men. After this episode was aired, many in the press including Kyunghyang Shinmun, SBS, Dailian, etc. released articles saying Whang remarked ‚ÄúGeun Hye Park is a woman only in her genitals‚Äù and there was hot debate on the internet on ‚Äúhow a professor could say something like ‚Äòa woman only in her genitals?‚Äô‚Äù As a result, the debate on candidate Park‚Äôs qualifications and tendencies as a leader moved onto value assessment and criticism on a remark made by a peculiar professor, and the question ‚Äúis it possible for the people to expect candidate Park to demonstrate the role and capability of a woman in Korean society?‚Äù was not brought up again. However, in the actual recording of Gordian Knot, the sensational line ‚ÄúCandidate Park is a woman only in her genitals‚Äù was not found and there was only a comment ‚Äòthat (the claim by anchor Jong Jin Park that at-the-time candidate Geun-hye Park also has femininity) is an issue of genitals (not) acting in the role of a woman‚Ä¶‚Äô Sung Joo Kim, who was the co- chair of the presidential campaign committee of Saenuri party at the time, visited Yonsei University in protest and demanded Whang's resignation from professorship in relation to this incident and appeared on Hyun Jung Kim's news show and testified that she received a promise from Yonsei University to send Sang Min Whang to the disciplinary action committee. Sung Joo Kim's comment that ‚ÄúYonsei University promised sending Sang Min Whang to the disciplinary action committee‚Äù as she demanded Whang's resignation shows Yonsei University's decision to terminate Whang is not unrelated to the Geun Hye Park regime. Sang Min Whang said ‚Äú[I] did not [use the word ‚Äúgenitals‚Äù to] belittle women as a whole but used [the word] as an academic term to differentiate between societal role and biological difference,‚Äù but Sung Joo Kim retorted, ‚Äúhis action is one of not being able to distinguish things you should say and things you should not say.‚Äù On this, Sang Min Whang analyzed if Sung Joo Kim ‚Äúis idolizing candidate Park as a divine being and not as a person then it shows the state of mind as is that considers the word ‚Äúgenitals‚Äù as profane and blasphemous.‚Äù > [Gordian Knot Episode 219 relevant section recording (Sang Min Whang / ‚óè: > Jong Jin Park)] > Whang: When we say a woman is less corrupt than a man, in that instance is > the difference between a woman and a man a difference in genitals or are we > talking about a difference in how they live? * > Park: I don‚Äôt know about that. Anyways, there is almost no instance of an > assemblywoman receiving bribes and having to go to the prosecutors‚Äô office. > There is, of course, not a lot of assemblywoman. > Whang: Not long ago a person who was an assemblywoman from Saenuri party > [said] to a small business CEO‚Ä¶ * > Park: But there was no instance of taking a bribe. > Whang: There was no instance of taking a bribe because none was given.

Criticism of college star athletes preferential treatment and Yuna Kim Show controversy  Sang Min Whang who was a regular on CBS Radio‚Äôs ‚ÄúMi Hwa Kim‚Äôs Everybody‚Äù program criticized colleges‚Äô preferential treatment of its sports stars on May 22, 2012. > > When did Yuna Kim go to college? Do you go practice teaching as you > graduate high school? When we say diligence it means practicing an > undertaking consistently well. It is true athlete Kim (Yuna Kim) is busy but > it does not mean she practiced teaching diligently. If Yuna Kim goes to > teaching practice, does it mean she fulfilled all the prerequisites to > become a student-teacher by going to class assiduously for 4 years in > college and received grades for completing courses? Yuna Kim trains mainly > abroad for personal or national work and goes around abroad. Is Korea > University a school that lets one graduate with no classes required? We > provide a lot of special benefits for sports stars exempting them from > military service and paying them a lot of money.

The college is using stars like > Kim for marketing in order to make their name known among the public. A > college has given up being a college and stooped to the level of gaining > publicity like a regular corporation.‚Äù Unlike Sang Min Whang's intention to discuss ‚ÄúKorean universities‚Äô utilizing students as a means for gaining publicity and the preferential treatment of elite sports athletes,‚Äù he became embroiled in the controversy of ‚Äúfact checking Yuna Kim‚Äôs teaching practice.‚Äù A teacher from Yuna Kim's teaching practice site, Seoul Jinseon Girls' High School, refuted in an interview on ‚ÄúMi-hwa Kim‚Äôs Everybody‚Äù to ‚Äúplease check the fact that [Yuna Kim] is coming to school and diligently coming to practice teaching‚Äù and on June 6 Yuna Kim's management company, All That Sports, sued Sang Min Whang for slander saying ‚Äúthere are parts of what he said that are untrue that he spoke of as if it were true and because that damages the athlete‚Äôs honor we are taking legal measures.‚Äù However, they also left the possibility of dropping the lawsuit open by saying, ‚Äúwe can drop the suit at any time if professor Whang apologizes for the false information that was not checked.‚Äù On the controversy surrounding his comments, Whang said ‚ÄúI think it is possible to specially grant college admission to any number of (star athletes). But on whether the athletes receive a proper education while going to college, on whether colleges have a real interest in educating these students, right now they do not‚Äù and ‚Äúthey are only a means to gain publicity and the students grow up really as sports machines completely swayed by sports. And when that student graduates from college is he or she really a person at the intellectual level of a person who graduated from a 4-year university? And later when [that person] does a masters or doctorate program and even becomes a professor in that field, we already saw through athlete Dae Sung Moon‚Äôs case how the dissertation is not written but copied from other sources‚Äù and ‚Äúwe discussed this issue from the perspective of psychological reasoning, from the side of let‚Äôs think about this aspect, but if [Yuna Kim] thought of this as talking about her and sues then who in Korea would raise questions about a problem or issue that makes us frustrated?‚Äù Whang expressed his frustrations for having been weirdly attacked for trying to raise an educational issue. He did not back down from his opinion saying, ‚ÄúI just called it as I saw it,‚Äù but apologized for the discomfort Yuna Kim may have felt being taken as an example and stepped down from the radio program ‚ÄúMi Hwa Kim‚Äôs Everybody.‚Äù Afterwards, Yuna Kim's side dropped the suit against Sang Min Whang saying ‚Äúwe do not want to be caught up in this anymore.‚Äù However, the possibility was mentioned that this decision was made conscious of the potential controversy that may rise when the fact comes out that Yuna Kim cannot normally become a student teacher because she did not attend almost all of the undergraduate classes at Korea University if the defamation lawsuit progressed and the problem of ‚Äúwhether [Yuna Kim] went to teaching practice diligently‚Äù and ‚Äúwhether [Kim] has the qualifications to practice teaching‚Äù had to be proven. Some compared Yuna Kim with ex-Tae Kwon Do athlete Dae Sung Moon's example and the opinions ‚Äúraising national prestige itself does not give [star athletes] the right to skip school‚Äù and ‚Äúthis needs to be a starting point to face the inconvenient truth that we cannot foster ‚Äòstudying athletes‚Äô‚Äù were raised.  Life after dismissal  At the end of 2016, the occurrence of \\"Geun Hye Park‚ÄìSoon Sil Choi Gate\\" shed new light on Sang Min Whang's dismissal from Yonsei University in the press and in politics. He also took this time to reset his own values, which can be known from his words in the following: \\"If I could do what was enjoyable to me then I was not going to be concerned with anything else and tried hard to be indifferent and lived thinking \\"a professor's duty is only to do research.\\" I tried to live detached from the power struggle as an aloof scholar who would occasionally observe it from afar and provide advice. But in Korea, after knowing the truth that I cannot do the work I enjoy and do well at all outside of its influence‚Ä¶ I realized the truth that I was terminated because my desire to stay as an aloof scholar was not as clear compared to those who tried to gain power who had very clear desires and was thorough in their pursuit of it. So I thought I should no longer stay as an observer‚Ä¶ The people were also deceived by Lee-Myung-Park-Geun-Hye because they did not face what they want and did not make it clear enough.\\" After diagnosing the Korean peoples' mind as being in \\"a state of slavery\\" in relation to the \\"Geun Hye Park‚ÄìSoon Sil Choi Gate,\\" Whang spoke out more proactively and clearly on his opinions in politics in the press and on his podcast after his dismissal, and is leading \\"the Korean Peoples' Psychological Independence Movement\\" with the public through the podcast Whangshimso.

After winning twice in his native France he moved to England and won the Top Novices' Hurdle in 2016. In the following season he won two steeplechases before reverting to hurdle races to win the Contenders Hurdle and then recording his biggest success in the Champion Hurdle. In the 2017‚Äì18 season he was unbeaten, winning the Fighting Fifth Hurdle, Christmas Hurdle and a second Champion Hurdle. Background Buveur d'Air (French for \\"drinker of air\\") is a bay gelding with a small white star bred in France by G√©rard Fert√©. In his early racing career he was trained in France by his owner Philippe Chemin. Buveur d'Air's sire Crillon won five races including the Listed Prix Denisy and ran second to Montjeu in the Prix Foy. He later became a successful sire of jumpers whose other offspring have included Alex he Larredya (Grand Prix d'Automne) and Jemy Baie (Prix Troytown). His dam History was unraced but produced several other winners including Punchestowns whose victories included the Long Walk Hurdle and the Scilly Isles Novices' Chase. She was a distant female-line descendant of Kandy who won the 1000 Guineas in 1932. She was not, however, considered a Thoroughbred as her pedigree included the Selle Fran√ßais stallion Evainqueur. Racing career =2014-2015: National Hunt Flat races= Buveur d'Air began his racing career in flat races restricted to AQPS horses. He was unbeaten in two French races, winning at Saint-Jean-de-Monts in August 2014 and at Nantes on 2 October. The gelding was then acquired by Potensis Bloodstock and Chris Giles and was sent to England where he was trained at Upper Lambourn in Berkshire by Nicky Henderson. Competing for his new connections in National Hunt Flat races he finished second to Barters Hill in February 2015 at Newbury Racecourse and then finished fourth behind the same horse in the more competitive Champion Standard Open NH Flat Race at Aintree's Grand National meeting in April. =2015/2016 National Hunt season= In the 2015/2016 National Hunt season Buveur d'Air was campaigned in novice hurdle races. On his debut over obstacles he won a maiden hurdle at Newbury in November taking the lead at the final flight and accelerating clear to win in \\"impressive\\" style by eleven lengths from the favoured Wait For Me. At Huntingdon Racecourse in January he started at odds of 2/11 and won \\"very easily\\" by seven lengths from eight opponents. Buveur d'Air made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival on 15 March 2016 when he started the 10/1 third favourite in a fourteen-runner field for the Supreme Novices' Hurdle. After being restrained by his regular jockey Noel Fehily in the early stages he stayed on without ever looking likely to win and finished third behind his stablemate Altior and the Irish-trained Min. Buveur d'Air returned to Aintree in April and started the 11/4 second favourite behind Limini (winner of the Dawn Run Mares' Novices' Hurdle) in the Grade 1 Top Novices' Hurdle. Equipped with ear-plugs, he moved into contention at the final flight, caught the leader Petit Mouchoir in the final strides and won by a neck with a gap of eight lengths back to Limini in third. The unplaced runners included Bleu et Rouge (Deloitte Novice Hurdle) and Agrapart (Betfair Hurdle). At the end of the season he was bought privately by J P McManus. =2016/2017 National Hunt season= Buveur d'Air began the 2016/2017 National Hunt season by competing in novice chases. On his debut over fences at Haydock Park on 17 December he was ridden by Aidan Coleman and won \\"easily\\" by three and a quarter lengths from Cloudy Dream. He followed up two weeks later at Warwick Racecourse, taking the lead on the run-in and winning by two and a quarter lengths from Gino Trail at odds of 30/100. With several leading hurdlers being injured and the Henderson-trained Altior dominating the novice chase division it was decided to return Buveur d'Air to the smaller obstacles for the remainder of the season. In the Contenders Hurdle at Sandown Park Racecourse he was partnered by Barry Geraghty and went off at odds of 1/4 against three opponents headed by the dual Fighting Fifth Hurdle winner Irving. After racing in fourth place for most of the way he \\"cruised\\" into the lead on the run-in and won by one and a half lengths from Rayvin Black. In the 2017 Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham on 14 March Buveur d'Air started the 5/1 second favourite behind the Christmas Hurdle winner Yanworth. The other nine runners included Petit Mouchoir (winner of the Irish Champion Hurdle), Brain Power (Wessex Youth Trust Handicap Hurdle), The New One, My Tent Or Yours, Footpad (Prix Alain du Breil, Prix Renaud de Vivier) and Wicklow Brave (Irish St. Leger). Ridden by Fehily Buveur d'Air settled in mid-division as Petit Mouchoir set the pace, and moved into contention after the fifth flight. He overtook Petit Mouchoir approaching the final obstacle and drew away on the run-in to win by four and a half lengths. My Tent Or Yours stayed on to take second ahead of Petit Mouchoir, Footpad and The New One. In the Aintree Hurdle over two and a half miles in April, the gelding was partnered by Geraghty and was made the 4/9 favourite against five opponents. After tracking the leaders he went to the front approaching the final flight and drew clear to win by five lengths from My Tent Or Yours with The New One coming home in third. After the race McManus commented \\"It doesn‚Äôt get much better than that. I can‚Äôt remember what Nicky said when he wanted to return Buveur D‚ÄôAir to hurdles but he said it more than once. He was pretty insistent and in the end we let him have his way. He was sure he wanted to give him a shot even before Faugheen and Annie Power were declared non-runners. He's a top man and sometimes you have to go along with it\\". =2017/2018 National Hunt season= Buveur d'Air was ridden by Geraghty in all four of his races in the 2017/2018 National Hunt season. He began his campaign in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle Racecourse on 2 December and won in a \\"canter\\" by five lengths from Irving after taking the lead three hurdles from the finish. Only three horses took the field against the champion in the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton Park Racecourse 24 days later and The New One was the only one of the trio given any serious chance of causing an upset. Starting at odds of 2/11, Buveur d'Air raced in second before overtaking The New One at the last and \\"cruised\\" away to win by two and a quarter lengths. As in 2017, Buveur d'Air prepared for the Cheltenham Festival with a run in the Contenders Hurdle and started at 1/16 against two opponents. He led from the start, went clear after the second last hurdle and was eased down on the run-in only to be challenged by the Swinton Handicap Hurdle winner John Constable, leaving Geraghty needing to drive the favourite out to win by one and three quarter lengths. On 13 March 2017 Buveur d'Air attempted to repeat his 2017 success in the Champion Hurdle and was made the 4/6 favourite. His ten opponents included Faugheen, Melon (WKD Hurdle), Elgin (Kingwell Hurdle), Wicklow Brave, Yorkhill (Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle) and John Constable. The favourite raced in third as his stablemate Charlie Parcs set the pace from Faugheen and moved up to take the lead at the second last. He was immediately joined by Melon and the pair engaged in a sustained struggle up the straight before Buveur d'Air gained the advantage in the final strides and prevailed by a neck. Geraghty commented \\"There was nowhere to hide. The best horse was going to win and, thankfully, I was on the best horse. You don't win these back to back unless you are very good and he's won everything all season. He scrapped it out today. He's been flashy all season because he hasn't had to deal with much but today he had the opposition and he lived up to it. It was a proper race and the runner-up put it up but my fella is battle-hardened and tough as nails\\". =2018/2019 National Hunt season= As in 2017, Buveur d'Air began his campaign in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle, a race which saw him matched at against two of the previous season's outstanding novices Samcro (Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle) and Summerville Boy (Supreme Novices' Hurdle). He raced in second place behind Samcro before taking the lead at the final hurdle and accelerating away to win by eight lengths in \\"impressive\\" style. The gelding started at odds of 1/4 when he attempted to repeat his 2017 success in the Christmas Hurdle and looked likely to win when he took the lead at the second last. On the run-in however, he was strongly challenged by his stablemate Verdana Blue and beaten a short head into second place. On 2 February Buveur d'Air attempted to win the Contenders Hurdle for the third time and went off at odds of 1/5 against four opponents. He led for most of the way before accelerating away from his rivals on the run in and winning by two lengths from Vision des Flos, having been eased down by Geraghty in the final strides. At the Cheltenham Festival, Buveur d'Air attempted to emulate Hatton's Grace, Sir Ken, Persian War, See You Then and Istabraq by winning the Champion Hurdle for the third time. Starting at odds of 11/4 he was tracking the leaders when he fell for the first time in his racing career at the third hurdle. He apparently suffered no ill effects as he continued riderless, crossing the line alongside the winner Espoir d'Allen.

It is located in the Butetown area of the city. Originally developed in the late 1800s as a residential location for nearby dock workers, it quickly became a centre for upscale residential properties which revolved around the main square. By 1900, commercial activity had taken its place, dominated by the Coal Exchange, which occupied the once open central space. The square contains a high concentration of listed buildings, which represent a range of architectural styles and some of Cardiff's finest examples of late 19th and early 20th Century commercial architecture. Mount Stuart Square area was designated a Conservation Area in July 1980.Mount Stuart Square: Conservation Area Appraisal, Cardiff County Council, 2009 Geography The area which Mount Stuart Square currently occupies was originally coastal mudflat.The Cardiff Coal Exchange: Conservation Management Plan, Edwards, Zoe, Cotswold Archaeology July 2017 In its present form, it is an urban area, bordered by the A4119 James Street, a major road to the south, early twentieth century social housing to the north (on a site which had previously been used as a rail yard), historic commercial properties to the west on West Bute Street, and the historic Glamorganshire Canal to the east. The canal was drained in December 1951 when a steam suction dredger crashed into the inner lock gates, forcing them to collapse, and all the water was released into the estuary.Rowson, Stephen; Wright, Ian L., The Glamorganshire and Aberdare Canals (Volume 2), Lydney: Black Dwarf Publications, 2004. The gates were never repaired, and for a number of years the canal remained dry until the land was filled in and converted to parkland, named Canal Park. The square lies approximately half a mile to the south of Loudoun Square, which was also built as a residential square but never developed a commercial hub. Junctions with James Street and West Bute Street provide vehicular access to the square, and pedestrian access exists to the parkland to the west. The square has a one way traffic system, where vehicles enter at the junction with James Street to the south west, and exit via either James Street or West Bute Street. Mount Stuart Square has a distinctive form with buildings on four sides facing the Cardiff Coal Exchange building in the centre. It is not a square in the true sense because the building area was limited by the physical restrictions of the canal to the west. The nearest railway station is Cardiff Bay. History Mount Stuart Square in 1920, Ordnance Survey Aerial view of Mount Stuart Square in 1920, looking northeast The development of Mount Stuart Square is closely linked to that of the coal industry in South Wales. The mining of coal in the South Wales valleys in the 1790s onwards meant that Cardiff developed into a port through which the coal was shipped and exported worldwide. It was initially transported using the Glamorganshire Canal, and later by rail on the Taff Vale Railway, both of which terminated close to the site of the square. A number of docks were constructed to facilitate the movement of this coal, and the entire Butetown area of Cardiff was transformed to accommodate the new industry. By the 1830s, Cardiff became the pre-eminent iron-exporting port, shipping almost half of British overseas iron exports; between 1840 and 1870, the volume of coal exports increased from 44,350 to 2.219 million tonnes.The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008. The population of the area increased accordingly, and a grid pattern residential suburb for port-related workers was built on land which included the site of the square. In its original form, Mount Stuart Square was a residential square with a central garden. It was constructed in 1855 as a select residential enclave around ornamental gardens for merchants and sea captains, and originally consisted of 45 stuccoed three-storey town houses.Square peg: DICMORTIMER'S BLOG www.dicmortimer.com. Retrieved 16 March 2017 The land had originally been mudflats, but later the Cardiff Glassworks had partially occupied the area. As a result, the underlying soil was a mixture of alluvial mud and slag from the glassworks, which required 30 feet concrete shafts to be constructed that rested on a bed of hard gravel in order to construct the foundations of the square. In the period immediately before construction of the square commenced, the land was used as stables for canal horsesWhat Lies Before‚Ä¶ www.savethecoalexchange.com, retrieved 17 May 2018 Named after Lord Mountstuart,Finch, Peter, Real Cardiff, Seren, 2009. the area was the vision of the second Marquess of John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute, who wanted to create a grand Georgian space to rival Berkeley Square in London.Cardiff's neglected coal boom era area 'in danger' BBC, 22 January 2017 The development of the square was part of his vision to transform Cardiff into a major port, improve the value of his lands in Cardiff itself and increase the value of the royalties he could charge on his coal fields.Davies, John, Cardiff and the Marquesses of Bute, University of Wales Press, 1981 As the docks rose in prominence, wealthy residents moved out and it became a commercial centre. The construction of the Coal Exchange building between 1884 and 1888 by Edwin Seward solidified the change in focus to commercial, and it became central to the coal trade activity in Cardiff docks for much of the early part of the 20th century.Cardiff's Coal Exchange saved in ¬£40m hotel revamp BBC, 8 April 2016 Built to provide a dedicated location for merchants and traders to sell coal, it followed construction of buildings of a similar function in London, Liverpool and Manchester. It was constructed in stages, the central trading hall and east block completed first. The London and Provincial Banking Company occupied the majority of the north side. In 1904 the world's first recorded ¬£1m deal was struck there. Those of the original town houses not converted were replaced by purpose-built offices for coal and shipping firms. The buildings surrounding the Coal Exchange housed coal companies, banks and agents.Slaters Commercial Directory 1880 www.genuki.org.uk. Retrieved 21 March 2017 Most of Cardiff's notable architects of the period are represented including Alexander Roos, architect to the Bute Estate, Edwin Seward, E W M Corbett, W D Blessley, Teather and Wilson, Ivor Jones and Percy Thomas, and Henry Budgen. The impact of WW1 was significant on the square, having a damaging effect on the coal industry. By 1921, only six of the 52 companies operating in 1888 were still in business, with the industry never recovering. The Coal Exchange closed in 1958, which in turn reduced the demand for commercial premises on the square and allowed boarding houses to be established.Cape Verde Islands made massive impact on Cardiff Wales Online article, 10 March 2010 By the early 21st century, all banks had vacated their properties on the square. The western side of the square saw a gradual demolition of original properties, and by the 1990s was no longer enclosed on its border with the canal. Much of the land was being used as open air carparks, until the construction of St James and St Stephens Mansions which once again enclosed the square. Current status =Architecture= The 7 storey Empire House on the north side of the square The majority of buildings throughout the square range from 3 ‚Äì 5 storeys, however; some of the surviving domestic buildings are 2-storey. The later commercial buildings are significantly larger than the former houses, both in height and overall mass. The streets are relatively narrow in relation to the large commercial buildings. A key characteristic are the variances in the scale between buildings. This is especially dramatic where the remaining 2-storey buildings are side by side with imposing 5-storey commercial buildings. St Stephens and St James Mansions are large high rise residential buildings constructed in 2003, which occupy a large section of the north western part of the square.

(Today it is in Poland a short distance to the south of the border with the Kaliningrad enclave.) Her father was a landowner. During the war, between 1914 and 1918 she worked on the other side of the country in the city welfare office in Frankfurt am Main, as a counsellor for those bereaved and / or injured by the war. It was here that she met Siegfried Kraus from Vienna whom she married, but the two of them separated quite soon after that. By the end of the war she was recognised for her expertise in social matters, and on 1 October 1919 she was appointed as the first female official in the Prussian Welfare ministry, initially as an internal consultant and, from 1922, as a government officer. She was entrusted with leadership department for child care and morally endangered young women. However, in 1924 she entered into temporary retirement. At the outbreak of the war Kraus-Fessel was a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). However, the decision by the party leadership in 1914 to implement what amounted to a parliamentary truce over the financing of the war was contentious within the SPD from the outset: the tensions only increased as front line slaughter and home front destitution mounted. One result was a series of party splits, and by 1919 Meta Kraus- Fessel was a member of the recently launched Communist Party of Germany. Within the party she became involved in the Workers International Relief operation, launched in 1921, and in 1924 she was a co-founder of the complementary International Red Aid organisation. As Stalinist hardliners, in conscious emulation of developments in Moscow, tightened their control over the Communist Party in Germany, Kraus-Fessel became disillusioned with it, and her political loyalties switched progressively from Communism to Anarchism. She was also working during the 1920s as an assistant to the pioneering sexologist, Magnus Hirschfeld. Following the concentration camp murder of her fellow anarchist, Erich M√ºhsam, she took care of his widow, Zenzl. Fairly soon afterwards the two of them fell out. The change of government in January 1933 heralded a rapid switch to one-party dictatorship. The Reichstag fire in February 1933 was instantly blamed on \\"communists\\", after which people with any sort of a political past involving the Communist Party either fled abroad or were arrested. In 1934 Meta Kraus-Fessel emigrated to Vienna. One of her achievements during the next few years included helping the anarchist, historian and linguistics scholar Max Nettlau escape from Vienna to Amsterdam by 1938. Possibly even more challenging was the rescue and transfer of his very large library and the archives collections that it contained. These were sold to the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam. She herself was able to escape to the United States in 1938. In 1940, after learning that she was incurably ill, she killed herself.

The post is partly ceremonial although the mayor does also preside over full meetings of the council and has the duty of holding decision makers to account. The mayor is elected by fellow councillors in May of each year. Before 1865, when the municipal borough was incorporated, the position was associated with the Court Leet of the Lords of Dudley, which governed the borough of Dudley from at least the middle of the 16th century and probably from the Middle Ages. The earliest known mayor, John A‚ÄôParke was selected in 1565.  History  In the earliest records, the Mayor of Dudley was an official of the Court Leet of the Lords of Dudley. This was a manorial court that provided local governance to the borough of Dudley. The first named mayor is John A'Parke who was mayor in 1565. Records of the court leet before the middle of the 18th century are sparse so only a few names of the earliest mayors are known. One notable early mayor was the ironmaster, Richard Foley, chosen in 1615. Oliver Dixon, mayor in 1690, came from a prominent local family that gave their name to the Dixons Green area of Dudley. Although the leading body governing the town changed in 1791, as the Town Commissioners came into being, the court leet continued to meet until the year after the incorporation of the borough in 1865. The mayor selected in 1860 was Charles Francis George Clark, author of The Curiosities of Dudley and the Black Country. Since 1865 mayors have been chosen from an elected councillor. The first mayor of the new municipal borough, selected on 20 June 1865, was Frederick Smith, Mineral Agent to the Earl of Dudley. One of his first acts was to organize tea, cake, refreshments and entertainment for 4,000 local school children at his residence at the Priory, Dudley. Smith's tenure of the position was short, as on 9 November 1865 his successor, Charles Cochrane was selected by the council. Smith's two successors as municipal mayor were also selected as mayors of the Court Leet. A notable mayor from this period was the industrialist Noah Hingley (1869-70). Noah's son Benjamin Hingley was the last mayor of the municipal borough, serving two terms from 1887. The Local Government Act 1888 changed the status of Dudley to a County Borough, effective from 1 April 1889. The first mayor selected by the new authority was William Squires Gorton. Notable mayors from this period include William Humble Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley (1895-96) and the founder of Bean Cars, Sir George Bean, who served three terms as mayor: in 1908 and 1911-1912. After the Earl of Dudley had finished his two terms, the next mayor was the Netherton- born George Henry Dunn, who had started his working life, still a child, in a colliery. In 1929, John Harry Molyneux, became the first Labour Mayor of Dudley. In 1933 there were a total of 4 different mayors during the year, as the mayor chosen in the previous year, Joseph Fulwood died at the very beginning of the year and his successor, Henry Joseph Golding, died in August of the same year. John Harry Molyneux was elected for the remainder of the municipal year until the selection of William Charles Williams. In 1949, there was a difficulty in selecting a mayor because: \\"the more experienced eligibles were unable to accept for health reasons, and the younger councillors had to decline because they had neither the time to spare from their work nor the means to supplement the expenses allowed for the office\\". Eventually, John Harry Molyneux, who had first been mayor 20 years previously, was elected. The first female Mayor of Dudley was Dr Katherine Churchill Rogers. She was elected in 1971, and then again in 1985. In 1974 the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley was created from the former County Borough of Dudley and other neighbouring local authorities. The first mayor of the new Metropolitan Borough of Dudley was Mrs. Mary J.Pargeter. The present custom is to elect the mayor and deputy mayor in May of each year. The position of Mayoress or Consort is appointed by the mayor and is usually the spouse of the mayor. The position of Mayor is partly ceremonial although the office holder also presides over meetings of the full council and has the duty of holding council decision makers to account. The mayor also raises money for nominated charities during the period of office. Regalia Both the mayor and deputy mayor have ceremonial robes. The mayor also has a badge and chain as does the mayoress or consort. Since the badges predate the creation of the Metropolitan Borough in 1974, they carry the civic arms of the County Borough of Dudley. The regalia also includes a mace and staff. The silver mace, the oldest item in the regalia, was presented by William, Viscount Dudley and Ward to the town of Dudley in 1798.

The title traces its origin from the times of the Old Pahang Sultanate, and was historically known as Maharaja Indera Putera. The traditional pegangan ('fief') of the nobility is Temerloh, as well as the entire land between the Triang river basin to the borders of Selangor and Rembau in Negeri Sembilan (approximately the constituencies of Bera and Bentong). During the reign of Raja Bendahara Tun Ali, the title was renamed 'Orang Kaya Indera Segara'. The title is the second-most influential among the four major chiefs, as his territory is the second-farthest from the capital. Role Historically, the Orang Kaya Indera Segara was part of the Orang Besar Berempat ('four major chiefs') that wielded very wide powers in Pahang. They had the authority to impose taxation and to decide all criminal and civil cases except those which involved capital punishment. In fact, their power was limited only by the capacity of the monarch to restrain them, and it varied according to their proximity to Pekan, the further from the court, the greater their authority. They were obliged to appear at Pekan once a year to menjunjung duli ('pay homage'). They had to pay a form of tribute called banchi to the monarch. Their districts were subject to serahan; the obligation to buy, at exorbitant prices, goods the monopoly for the sale of which, in certain localities the ruler was in the habit of granting to one of his favourites. In the month of Muharram. they appeared at court with offerings. In the time of war they were required to take the field with men, arms and food. The installation of the monarch was incomplete unless the Orang Besar Berempat assisted thereat. The Pahang constitutional theory was that the Orang Besar Berempat and, to a lesser degree, the other chiefs were the foundation upon which the monarch's authority rested. During the time of Johor Empire, the four major chiefs gave allegiance to the Bendahara as representing the Sultan, but, in time, the sovereign being to them a nebulous figure, their allegiance tended to become more and more a matter of loyalty to the Bendahara personally. This became formally sealed with the establishment of Pahang Kingdom in the late 18th century. Succession The titles of the Orang Besar Berempat were hereditary. When a chief died, his successor, before approval of his appointment, was required to make a ceremonial offering to the monarch. This usually took the shape of gold-hilted kris, but other forms of offering were permissible. If the eldest son of a deceased chief were unfitted for the succession, it was proper to appoint a younger son, a brother, or a nephew to the chieftaincy. Genealogical tree Five generations of chiefs are traditionally holding the title, until the Orang Kaya Indera Segara V, Tahir. After the death of Tahir, the title was allowed to lapse, but it has again been revived, though not in the same family, in the person Che Engku Abdul Jamal, who is a grandson of Tun Ali. From here onwards, the title has always been bestowed to a member of Pahang royal family.

Location The v√°rzea forests of this ecoregion extend along the low, seasonally flooded rivers of the central and lower basin of the Amazon River, including a large part of the Madeira River basin, the mouth of the Purus River, tributaries of these rives and an isolated patch of v√°rzea along the Mamor√© River between Bolivia and Brazil. Major population centers in or near the ecorgion are Manaus, Itacoatiara, Coari and √ìbidos. The ecoregion adjoins the Madeira-Tapaj√≥s moist forests to the southeast and the Uatuma-Trombetas moist forests and Japur√°- Solim√µes-Negro moist forests to the north. The Purus-Madeira moist forests lie to the west of the Madeira and the south of the Amazon. The Purus v√°rzea is upstream along the Solim√µes and Purus rivers and their tributaries. The Gurupa v√°rzea is downstream along the Amazon. Physical Elevations range from in the east, where the Tapaj√≥s meets the Amazon river, to on the Madeira. The soils are fertile sediments formed in the present Holocene epoch, carried down from the Andes. The annual floods renew the sediments, making very rich soils compared to the higher terra firme on either side of the v√°rzea. The river waters, loaded with sediment, rise by each year, flooding the land for as long as eight months. The river course through the floodplain constantly shifts over time, creating oxbow lakes, levees, meander swales and bars. These landscape elements support diverse vegetation, predominantly seasonally flooded tropical evergeen rainforest. Typically the levees are relatively high, formed by the deposit of sediments along the river margins. Behind them the land slopes down, flattens out and then rises to the terra firme forest. The area behind the levees holds canarana grassland and lakes that expand and contract with the flood cycle. Climate The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Af\\": equatorial, fully humid. Average monthly temperatures range from with an annual average of . Average annual rainfall in the east is less than , while in some parts of the Madeira in the west it exceeds . Ecology The ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. =Flora= The main vegetation types are aquatic vegetation, permanent swamp vegetation, succession vegetation and forest mosaics. Typically there are fewer tree species in the v√°rzea than on terra firme, although many trees are common to both environments. Trees in the v√°rzea are usually shorter than on terra firme, with a canopy of up to . There are some palms, and often a dense understory of plants in the genus Heliconia and families Zingiberaceae and Marantaceae. Tree species that grow only in wetlands include Virola surinamensis, Calycophyllum spruceanum and A√ßa√≠ palm (Euterpe oleracea). The economically valuable palms Astrocaryum jauari and Mauritia flexuosa are common on the floodplain. Other trees that feed the fruit-eating fish that enter the forest during flood periods are the yellow mombim (Spondias mombim), socor√≥ (Mouriri ulei) and tarum√£ (Vitex cymosa). Grasses in the canarana areas include Echinochloa and Hymenachne species, with tall grasses along the river margin such as Gynerium sagittatum, Paspalum repens and Echinocloa polystachya. Shrubs include Coccoloba ovata, Eugenia inundata, Ruprechtia ternifolia and Symmeria paniculata. Slightly higher up there are early succession trees such as Acosmium nitens, Buchenavia macrophylla, Cecropia latiloba, Crateva benthamii, Ficus anthelminthica, Machaerium leiophyllum, Macrolobium angustifolium, Piranhea trifoliata, Pseudobombax munguba and Tabebuia barbata. Higher up again, but still in flooded areas, trees include Calycophyllum spruceanum, Ceiba pentandra, Couroupita guianensis, Hura crepitans, Pirahnea trifoliata, Virola surinamensis, Genipa americana, Hevea brasilienses, Lecointea amazonica, Sterculia elata and Rheedia brasiliensis. =Fauna= The ecoregion is home to 200 species of mammals including jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), kinkajou (Potos flavus) and white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari). The hairy-tailed bolo mouse (Necromys lasiurus), and Amazonian sac- winged bat (Saccopteryx gymnura) are endemic. Aquatic mammals include Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis) and the endangered Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis) is also endangered. The giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) is also endangered. Large reptiles include black caiman (Melanosuchus niger), spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus) and green anaconda (Eunectes murinus). Primates include spider monkey (subfamily Atelinae), Venezuelan red howler (Alouatta seniculus), common squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), bare-eared squirrel monkey (Saimiri ustus) and red-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas). Endemic primates include Hoffmanns's titi (Callicebus hoffmannsi), ashy black titi (Callicebus cinerascens), Hershkovitz's titi (Callicebus dubius), Santarem marmoset (Mico humeralifer) and white-footed saki (Pithecia albicans). Endangered primate include white-bellied spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth), Peruvian spider monkey (Ateles chamek), white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus), white-nosed saki (Chiropotes albinasus), black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas) and pied tamarin (Saguinus bicolor). 681 species of birds have been reported, including herons and egrets (genera Egretta and Ardea), whistling ducks (subfamily Dendrocygninae), sharp-tailed ibis (Cercibis oxycerca), ibis (genus Theristicus), and the roseate spoonbill (Platalea ajaja). Endemic birds include ash-throated crake (Mustelirallus albicollis), plain-breasted ground dove (Columbina minuta), red-shouldered macaw (Diopsittaca nobilis), green- rumped parrotlet (Forpus passerinus), scaled ground cuckoo (Neomorphus squamiger), and stygian owl (Asio stygius). Endangered birds include sun parakeet (Aratinga solstitialis), wattled curassow (Crax globulosa), varzea piculet (Picumnus varzeae), green-thighed parrot (P'ionites leucogaster) and red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus). =Status= The World Wildlife Fund lists the ecoregion as \\"Critical/Endangered\\". The ecoregion is threatened by contamination of the water and fish by gold mining, and heavy sedimentation caused by destruction of the forests. Huge areas of the floodplain forests are cleared and burned by ranchers to create pastures for livestock. Global warming will force tropical species to migrate uphill to find areas with suitable temperature and rainfall.

The film's sets were designed by John Stoll. The film reflects the media interest in the notorious and elusive cat burglar of the 1930s Harry Edward Vickers who was nicknamed Flannelfoot because he would cover his boots with cloth to silence his footsteps. The title and the burglar's use of cloth on his boots are the only two resemblances between the actual case and the film's plot, with the latter instead mainly set in the early 1950s. Plot At New Scotland Yard Inspector Duggan returns to duty, still suffering from memory loss after having a wall toppled on him in the American sector of post-war Berlin many years previously whilst trailing a jewel thief. He is assigned to the 'Flannelfoot' jewel-thief case, which bears many similarities to the thief in Berlin. Offering information on 'Flannelfoot' to the police, the ex-con informer 'Ginger' Watkins is turned away and instead takes it to Mitchell, a newspaper crime writer specialising in 'Flannelfoot', who advises him to take a job with Dr. Milligan, the owner of the car Watkins had seen 'Flannelfoot' driving. There Watkins tells Milligan about prison rumours of \\"Yank Peterson\\", the thief who had toppled the wall on Duggan, rumoured to be an American deserter with a talent for accents. Mitchell's employer Lord Wexford seeks advice from crime novelist Tyrone Fraser, father of Andy and Kathleen. Watkins informs both Mitchell and the police of a meeting Milligan has planned, but both their surveillance operations fail, with Milligan tipped off and Watkins murdered by 'Flannelfoot'. Wexford invites alcoholic Bill Neilson and his wife Angela to a house-party, asking him to bring his jewel collection as bait for 'Flannelfoot'. Wexford's daughter Renee reprimands her boyfriend Andy for getting too close to Angela - he excuses it as an attempt to get Angela's business for his car firm, but in fact he hopes to uncover evidence of the Neilsons being involved in the 'Flannelfoot' affair. 'Flannelfoot' steals jewels from the Wexford residence and murders a servant during his escape, hiding the body in Andy's car, where is found when Andy is pulled over by the police for speeding. Duggan arrests Andy, hoping this will cause the real 'Flannelfoot' to break cover. 'Flannelfoot' meets Milligan to fence Kathleen's jewels and recognises 'Miss Armitage', in fact Kathleen working undercover as Milligan's personal assistant. That night, Fraser disguises himself as 'Flannelfoot', steals some of Neilson's jewels and plants one beside Kathleen's car before hiding in it. Renee and Wexford discover the planted jewel and call in Duggan and his DS Fitzgerald, thinking the real 'Flannelfoot' has struck again and intends to murder Kathleen. Fraser reveals the ruse and the police arrest Milligan, who mentions that 'Flannelfoot' had an American accent. Among the jewels Milligan was planning to fence for 'Flannelfoot' Duggan sees one stolen in Berlin, restoring his memory of 'Yank Peterson'. The Neilsons plan to flee to France, but 'Flannelfoot' arrives and kills Bill, who had been employing him in Berlin and England to expand his collection of jewels and was the only man who could give him away. The police arrive and Fitzgerald manages to push 'Flannelfoot' from the roof, fatally injuring him and revealing him as Mitchell. Cast * Ronald Howard as Det. Sgt.

Her early interests included Henry VIII, Charles II, and the early modern period of English history, with her later research focused on the Ancien R√©gime (the Kingdom of France from the Middle Ages to the French Revolution). She was elected a Fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge in 1935, and moved to become a Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge after the publication of The Ancien R√©gime (1967). She \\"achieved an international reputation\\" with The Ancien R√©gime, with reviews describing it as \\"remarkable and absorbing\\" and \\"a lively, thought-provoking essay in historical revision\\". Early life and education Behrens was born on 24 April 1904 in London, England. Her father was Noel Edward Behrens (1879‚Äì1967), a Jewish civil servant and banker who had inherited a large amount of money from his father. Her mother Vivien Behrens (1880‚Äì1961), the daughter of Sir Cecil Coward, was a Christian. She was educated at home by a series of governesses and never attended school. She spoke French and English from an early age and later added German. In 1923, Behrens matriculated into Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford to study modern history. She graduated in 1926 with a first class Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. She was awarded a Commonwealth Fellowship to Radcliffe College, a women's liberal arts college in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, in 1928. Academic career Having returned to the United Kingdom, Behrens held research posts at Bedford College, London and at University College, Oxford. In 1935, she was elected a Fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge. Additionally, she was appointed an assistant lecturer in the Faculty of History, University of Cambridge in 1938 and promoted to lecturer the following year. Her research in the mid-1930s was focused on Henry VIII, and she published a number of articles on this period including on his divorce and on resident diplomats. Her interests moved to later English history and she published an article on Charles II in 1941. As with many academics, Behrens offered her services during the Second World War. Therefore she left academia for a number of years to work in Whitehall, where she was likely assigned to the Ministry of War Transport. After the war ended, she spent ten years researching and writing an analysis of the role of British-controlled merchant ships during the war.

Previously, she took the field for New South Wales Breakers and Sydney Sixers. Born in Grafton, New South Wales, Sutherland began playing cricket when she was nine years old. Although her South Grafton school did not have enough girl players to make up a girls cricket team, she was later a prominent member of the NSW Youth squads. On her debut for the New South Wales Breakers in October 2010, Sutherland earned a Player of the Match award. During the 2010‚Äì11 season, she played a major role in the Breakers' Twenty20 squad, and also a bit-part in its WNCL 50-over matches. The following season, her on-field results were disappointing, and she played only one WNCL match. However, she also received the Bradman Scholarship from the Bradman Foundation and a Ben Lexcen Scholarship from the University of New South Wales, and toured New Zealand with the Shooting Stars. During pre-season training for the 2012‚Äì13 season, Sutherland was diagnosed with Plantar fasciitis, or \\"jogger's heel\\", initially in one of her feet, but later in both. The jogger's heel put her at a disadvantage against most of her team mates, but eventually she fought back to resume her place in the Breakers squad. In 2013‚Äì14, Sutherland played in all the Breakers' WNCL games apart from the first one, which she missed due to a broken thumb, and took a bag full of wickets in the Twenty20 competition. At the end of that season, she was once again selected for a Shooting Stars tour, to Sri Lanka. In 2014‚Äì15, Sutherland played for the Breakers in the WNCL semi- final against Victorian Spirit, but was not selected for the final against the South Australian Scorpions. She then joined English county side Kent, for which she achieved her best bowling figures for the year of 3-17 against Lancashire. At the start of the 2015‚Äì16 season, Sutherland moved to the Queensland Fire, where she sought more opportunities to break into the Southern Stars team. However, she also joined the Sydney Sixers squad for its inaugural WBBL01 season (2015‚Äì16). Explaining her choice of WBBL club, she told The Daily Examiner, \\"Sydney's a great city. The colour of the team helped and I guess the rest of the squad that we have was the major drawcard to play for the Sixers.\\" In June 2016, Sutherland injured her knee ligaments in a fall; the injury caused her to concentrate on her batting while she was recovering.

The production of the car is planned to be 275 units at ¬£2 million, all of which have been already sold. Mercedes-AMG received orders for four times the production amount, but have stated that production will not be increased from the planned 275 units, in order to maintain the exclusivity of the car. Currently, the car is at the concept state, since it has not reached homologation regulations yet. The official name of the car was changed from \\"Project One\\" to simply \\"One\\".https://www.motor1.com/news/267680/mercedes-amg-one- hypercar/https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/mercedes-amg-one-hypercar/  Development  The cars will be evaluated on their performance, durability, and ability in Mercedes-Benz's proving grounds and on racing circuits. The Head of Mercedes-AMG, Tobias Moers also states that when \\"the time is right\\", Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 team driver and six-time champion Lewis Hamilton, who has worked on the development of the car, will test the prototypes. Mercedes- AMG Project One Project One wheel  Specifications  = Powertrain = The powertrain of the Mercedes-AMG ONE is expected to be rated at through a hybrid drivetrain that shares many features with modern Formula One cars. The car has five motors with different functions onboard: one internal combustion engine (ICE) and four electric motors.  Internal combustion engine  The Mercedes-AMG F1 W07 Hybrid (being driven by Lewis Hamilton in 2016). A car on which the engine and design of the Project One is based The Mercedes-AMG ONE will utilise a modified 1.6-litre turbocharged 90-degree V6 engine from the Mercedes-AMG F1 W07 F1 car, as confirmed by Mercedes-AMG board member Ola K√§llenius. Modifications will be done to the engine due to the engine's illegality in RPM idle and redline. The head of Mercedes-AMG, Tobias Moers, states that the engine will be at 1,280 rpm when idle, and at 11,000 rpm when at its redline limit. However, the engine will only last for and the owners will have to return their cars for engine refurbishment. The ICE produces , with torque figures still unknown.  Electric motors  The ICE will work in conjunction with four electric motors: a Motor Generator Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K) coupled to the crankshaft, a Motor Generator Unit-Heat (MGU-H) coupled to the turbocharger, and two electric motors at the front axle. The MGU-K and MGU-H are Formula One-style motors responsible for recovering energy and improving efficiency during operation of the car. More specifically, the MGU-K serves to generate electricity during braking, while the MGU-H serves to eliminate turbocharger lag and improve throttle response by keeping the turbine spinning at high speeds. The final two electric motors drive the front wheels to allow for an all-wheel drive drivetrain, and the sum of these four electric motors will contribute effective power to the total power output figure of the Project One. = Transmission = The transmission will be an 8-speed single-clutch automated manual transmission variant (which is actually a similar type of transmission used in modern Formula 1 cars) and will deliver the bulk of the engine power and torque to the rear wheels. The use of a single-clutch over a dual-clutch transmission was due to AMG's engineers wanting to keep the car light and due to concerns over the dual-clutch's ability to handle the high- revving V6 ICE. = Wheels = The Project One has wheels made of aluminium alloy and carbon fibre with diameters of 19 inches at the front and 20 inches at the rear with centre-lock wheel nuts. The tyres are Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2s with codes of 285/35 ZR 19 for the front and 335/30 ZR 20 for the rear. The brakes are ventilated carbon-ceramic discs. = Interior features = Interior The interior is mostly minimalist and driver-focused, continuing the Formula One theme of the Project One. This includes a Formula One-style steering wheel and pedals, and a driver-oriented central infotainment screen. There are some traditional luxury features in the interior, notably napa leather and hand stitching on the bucket seats. = Exterior features = left The exterior of the car is designed primarily for aerodynamics, although it still maintains a profile reminiscent to a road legal car. The notable aerodynamic features include the large front air inlets, the roof-mounted air intake and the large aerodynamic fin extending down the back half of the car. = Chassis = The body will be made entirely of carbon fibre to reduce weight, resulting in a final estimated kerb weight of around .

GLAD-PCR assay do not require bisulfite treatment of the DNA. Method was specially designed to determine methylation of RCGY site of interest in human and mammalian genomes in excess of corresponding unmethylated sites. This is a typical situation for DNA preparations from clinical samples of blood and tissues. GLAD-PCR assay is based on the new type of enzymes - site-specific methyl-directed DNA- endonucleases (MD DNA endonucleases). These enzymes are very similar to restriction enzymes in biochemical properties and cleave DNA completely, but act in opposite way: they cleave only methylated DNA and do not cleave unmethylated DNA at all. Recognition sites of available MD DNA EndonucleasesMammalian DNA-methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b catalyze a reaction of DNA methylation. * DNMT1 maintains DNA methylation pattern in vivo modifying a new strand after replication. * DNMT3a and DNMT3b are responsible for DNA methylation de novo including abnormal hypermethylation in cancer cells. It is well known that hypermethylation of CpG-islands in regulatory regions of promoter and/or first exon in a variety of genes often occurs at early stages of sporadic carcinogenesis. This leads to downregulation of the genes expression in tumor cells, whereas in a healthy tissue the corresponding genes remain to be active. Thus, the detection of such epigenetic biomarkers is one of the most promising diagnostic and prognostic tools Study of DNMT3a and DNMT3b substrate specificity has shown that both enzymes predominantly recognize RCGY site and modify internal CG- dinucleotide to form 5‚Äô-R(5mC)GY-3‚Äô/3‚Äô-YG(5mC) R-5‚Äô sequence. One of new enzymes GlaI recognizes and cleaves site R(5mC)GY. Due to this unique substrate specificity, GlaI is a convenient tool for identification of de novo methylated sites in the human and mammalian DNA.DNMT3 and GLAI equal specificityGLAD-PCR assay includes 3 simple steps: # GlaI hydrolysis of the studied DNA. At this step only R(5mC)GY sites are hydrolyzed. Unmethylated RCGY sites remain uncut. # The universal adapter ligation.

Lady H√º was a friend of Sarah Moore, the wife of the missionary Nathan Sites, who recorded that she endured much persecution as the wife of a minister, but was instrumental in preaching to female visitors interested in Christianity. The family had several daughters, one of whom died only months before H√º was born in 1865. In accordance with contemporary fashions, H√º's feet were bound to make them smaller. During the process, her father decided that foot binding was unnatural and removed the bandages. When he left on a trip, Lady H√º reapplied the bandages, but removed them once again when H√º's father returned. Later, H√º visited a relative, who bound her feet again, but Lady H√º made her take the bandages off when she returned home. H√º argued that she was ashamed of her large feet that everyone ridiculed, but Lady H√º responded, \\"tell them bound-footed girls never enter the emperor's palace.\\" Education Gurubai Karmarkar, H√º, and Mary H. Platt, members of the Class of 1892 at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania H√º attended the Fuzhou Boarding School for Girls, which was run under the auspices of Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. After leaving school, she trained at the Foochow Woman's Hospital under the guidance of Sigourney Trask, who wrote to the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society describing H√º's skills and good character. She requested that H√º should go to the United States to train in medicine. In 1884, H√º travelled to New York City, then to Philadelphia. On arrival in the United States, H√º could not speak English and she spent the summer before college learning intensively with Sarah Moore. She then attended Ohio Wesleyan Female College from 1884‚Äì1888, which by that time had been merged with Ohio Wesleyan University. In 1888, H√º went to the Woman's Medical College of Philadelphia. After two years, H√º fell ill and took a break from study to visit her family in China, with a trip to Japan on the way there. By this time, her father was suffering from tuberculosis and H√º spent her time nursing him, overseeing the construction of a new family home and working in the local hospital. When the house was finished in 1892, she returned to Philadelphia to complete her training, graduating in May 1894. She then worked for a year in the Philadelphia Polyclinic. Career H√º returned to Fuzhou in 1895 and began work at the Foochow Hospital for Women and Children. After one year, the supervising doctor returned to the United States and H√º was put in charge of the entire hospital. In 1899, she became resident physician at the Woolston Memorial Hospital. At first, many patients demanded to see a foreign doctor not a, \\"Chinese student,\\" but by the summer the number of patients had increased and H√º had to open the dispensary on extra days. From 1899‚Äì1901, H√º trained two medical students, one of whom was her younger sister H√º Seuk Eng (). The hospital struggled with the number of patients, to the extent that a house was built for H√º on a hill outside the hospital grounds to allow for more patient beds to be installed. The number of cases dealt with by the hospital increased from 1,837 in 1899 to 24,091 in 1910. Although it has been reported that H√º acted as representative to the International Congress of Women 1899, London, the minutes of the meeting list the representative of China as Madame Shen. In 1906, H√º opened the course taught at the Woolston Memorial Hospital to any female who could pass a certain exam. Of the four students that passed that year, three were not Christian. However, the hospital continued to run Christian services every morning. Some of the patients Hu treated converted to Christianity, but this was relatively small in relation to the total number of patients the hospital served.Pripas-Kapit, Sarah. (2015). Educating Women Physicians of the World: International Students of the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, 1883-1911 (PhD). University of California, Los Angeles. In 1907, H√º fell seriously ill and was unable to run the hospital. Though some advised that the hospital should be closed, her younger sister took over the responsibilities of management. Seuk Eng recalled that many patients arrived expecting to be cured by merely touching H√º's clothing or looking at her and were disappointed to see, \\"the little Dr H√º.\\" However, the hospital continued running and H√º returned to advise her sister when she had recovered. Later life When the Woolston Memorial Hospital was burned down by bandits in January 1927, H√º moved with her younger sister to Singapore. She suffered a stroke and died on 16 August 1929. Awards *Honorary degree in Master of Science, Ohio Wesleyan University Compositions H√º is recorded as having been very popular with her teachers and classmates at college and some of her literary writings are preserved. She composed the poem below to thank her teacher for a gift. Personal life H√º adopted a son and a daughter from the local community when she was working at the Woolston Memorial Hospital. Her adopted daughter was her own brother's eldest daughter, who lived just next door to her in Foochow.

The first permanent public artwork along the Greenway, the concept was selected through a competition for commission by the Mass Highway Department, and integrated into site construction in collaboration with engineers during building of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (Big Dig). The Harbor Fog sculpture is part of a genera of environmental artworks that use high pressure cold water fog, hot steam fog, or other gaseous materials, to produce immersive environmental sculpture. Background In the 17th century the site was at the edge of Boston Harbor. During periods of development over the following 260 years, urban rubble and fill was deposited, creating made land between former wharfs. The sculpture is inspired by the dynamic historical landform alterations at the location, changing light and weather patterns found at the ocean's edge, and the industrial design of harbor navigational aids. Design details The sculpture is constructed of three column forms fabricated from stainless steel and bronze, that reference the shape of buoys, each column contains multiple fog nozzles, LED light sources, motion sensors, and sound systems. The sculptural columns are surrounded by a boat-shaped outline of granite seawall blocks, salvaged from landfill containing 18th century piers that were discovered during sub-surface highway construction. The 2000 lb granite seawall blocks are elevated on stainless steel supports that allow the fog to travel under the blocks, and openings between the elevated blocks allow passage into the interior space. Multiple motion sensors on top of the vertical columns register pedestrian activity that is transmitted to a computer processor to control changing sequences of fog, light, and sound. The technology that operates the sculpture is maintained by the non-profit Rose Kennedy Greenway Conservancy. Open all year, the water fog system operates seasonally.

The Easter Sonata was not published, but is mentioned as her work in her diary and letters written to her family members in 1829. The manuscript, which is signed \\"F.

Some musicologists suggested that the piece might be by Fanny Mendelssohn, but the proposal was not seriously considered by most because of the lack of a known autograph manuscript.

It is an extensive collection of short stories and poems, the first of which was published in 1822 under the title of '.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37. Rimen en Teltsjes developed its present-day form in the course of the 19th century, when the Halbertsma's continuously added new work to their previous publications.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.Wiersma, p. 5. Eventually their works were gathered together, and the first edition of the actual Rimen en Teltsjes was published posthumously in 1871.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.Wiersma, p. 5. Although the literary value of this collection was later disputed by some critics,Breuker 1993, pp. 594‚Äì596. Rimen en Teltsjes and its predecessor De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Western Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.Jensma, p. 197. The authors The three Brothers Halbertsma, the authors of Rimen en Teltsjes, were born in the village of Grou, in the central part of the Dutch province of Friesland in the late 18th century.Breuker 1993, p. 587. The two most important of the brothers were Justus Hiddes Halbertsma (1789‚Äì1869), a Mennonite minister in Bolsward en from 1822 onwards in Deventer,Breuker 1993, p. 588. and Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma (1797‚Äì1858), who was a physician in Grou.Breuker 1993, p. 592. Justus was a man of science, a prominent linguist, who was acquainted with German literary figures such as the Brothers Grimm. He strongly sensed what the public needed, but at the same time he was a somewhat distant and cerebral author, which tended to have an averse effect on his poetry.Breuker 1993, pp. 588‚Äì591.Dykstra and Oldenhof, pp. 38‚Äì40. His brother Eeltsje, whose prose and poetry were of equal quality, was probably the most talented of the brothers. He was also a much more emotional persoan, who was sometimes overcome by periods of melancholy, which found an outlet in his writings.Breuker 1993, pp. 592‚Äì593.Dykstra and Oldenhof, pp. 40‚Äì42.Wiersma, pp. 9‚Äì10. The third brother, Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma (1792‚Äì1852), who was a butter and cheese merchant in Grou, was greatly overshadowed by his brothers as a literary writer. His oeuvre mainly consisted of folk literature, which, however, became quite popular with the common man.Breuker 1993, pp. 591‚Äì592.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 42. Origins As Justus Hiddes Halbertsma would tell it later, the first step towards the writing of Rimen en Teltsjes was taken when his brother Eeltsje returned from his study in Heidelberg, in Germany, in 1818, and noticed that the street songs in the Netherlands were of a very low quality compared to those in Germany. According to Justus, Eeltsje then set out to write poetry with the intent of replacing the existing songs with better ones of his own making.Breuker 1993, p. 593. The linguist Philippus H. Breuker, who added an extensive and penetrating afterword to the reprint of Rimen en Teltsje of 1993, observed, however, that this assertion could \\"never be more than half the truth,\\" as Eeltsje's early poetry was not of a high literary standard; quite the opposite, in fact. According to Breuker, it seems more likely that Eeltsje wanted to emulate these Dutch street songs.Breuker 1993, p. 593. Justus Hiddes Halbertsma In any case, Justus as well as Eeltsje started writing poetry and short fiction, and as Justus remained the editor of Eeltsje's works for his entire life, their oeuvres were strongly connected and published together from the very beginning.Breuker 1993, p. 593. In 1822, the best of their early works were collected under the title of De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar (\\"Gabe Tailor's Rag Basket\\"; original, archaic spelling: De Lape Koer fen Gabe Skroor), a booklet consisting of 36 pages, and including six poems and one short story.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37. This publication was attributed to the fictional 'Gabe Skroar', a lame farmer's son who became a tailor and a writer, but died young.Breuker 1993, p. 597.Twerda, p. 297. This character was in all probability a creation of Eeltsje's.Breuker 1993, p. 597. Hiding behind such a fictional author was fairly normal at that time,Breuker 1993, p. 597.Twerda, p. 297. but Breuker suggests that an extra reason may have been that the Halbertsmas felt it was a little silly to put two names on such a limited collection.Breuker 1993, p. 597. The character of Gabe Skroar (or 'Gabe Tailor') was somewhat ambiguous from the very beginning, which was caused by the difference in the styles of writing used by Justus and Eeltsje. Where Eeltsje's Gabe remained a simple farmer's son who liked to potter about with his writings in the wasted hours, Justus' Gabe was implicitly a more lettered man, who clearly had literary ambitions.Breuker 1993, p. 597. Furthermore, Gabe Skroar's role changed in the course of time: in 1822, he was presented only as the writer of the collection, but in the publications of 1829 and 1834, he developed into the main character of the stories.Breuker 1993, p. 597. In the long run, the character of Gabe became unusable, which was mostly due to Justus' constant little adjustments, and in 1839 even Eeltsje had to admit that there was no point anymore to publishing their works under Gabe Skroar's name.Breuker 1993, p. 597. Development The first edition of De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar, published in 1822, consisted of 200 copies only.Breuker 1993, p. 594.Breuker 2016, p. 1124.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.Terpstra, p. 313.Twerda, pp. 297‚Äì298.Wiersma, pp. 5, 11. Those were not sold, however, but at the expense of Justus Halbertsma presented to acquaintances of his all over Friesland.Breuker 1993, p. 594.Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.Twerda, p. 298. In this way he awoke among his public a desire for more reading-matter of this nature.Breuker 1993, p. 594.Hemminga, p. 56.Twerda, p. 298. Later he would write about this: \\"That first blow was half the battle. The fans who did not receive a copy were squealing like bleeding pigs, and the way was cleared for all the stories and poems which followed.\\"Breuker 1993, p. 594. The contents of De Lapekoer were in fact something entirely different from what readers were used to, not only as to what language they were written in, but also and especially concerning their informal style. Copies of the booklet were often shared around through entire networks of family and friends, and frequently its stories and poems were transcribed by hand before the booklet was given back or passed on.Terpstra, p. 313.Wiersma, p. 11. A second, expanded edition of De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar, consisting of 237 pages, was published in 1829, followed by a third, further expanded edition in 1834, running to almost 500 pages in a larger size.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.Terpstra, p. 313.Twerda, p. 298.Wiersma, p. 5, 11. After that, additions were published separately in 1836 (De Noarger R√∫n oan Gabe Skroar), 1840 (Twigen √∫t in Alde Stamme), 1854 (Leed en Wille en de Flotgerzen), and 1858 (De Jonkerboer and Teltsjes fan de Wize Mannen fan Esonst√™d).Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.Brothers Halbertsma 1958, pp. 589‚Äì594. Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma After the death of all three brothers, their short fiction and poetry was collected and published in 1871 by the publishing house of J. de Lange in Deventer (where Justus Halbertsma had lived) under the title of Rimen en Teltsjes (\\"Rhymes and Tales\\").Breuker 1993, pp. 603‚Äì606.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.Terpstra, p. 313.Wiersma, p. 5. This was done in thirteen installmentsBreuker 2016, p. 2251. (the first of which was published in October 1868),Breuker 2016, p. 2251. which meant it took more than two years before the buyers, who had to subscribe to the entire series of installments, possessed the book in its complete form.Breuker 1993, p. 603.Breuker 2016, p. 2251. The decision to publish Rimen en Teltsjes was made in 1863,Breuker 2016, p. 2251. and the first two installments were edited by Justus Hiddes Halbertsma himself.Breuker 1993, p. 604. He even wrote some new pieces for the collection, such as the short story It Grouwe Pak (\\"The Thick Suit\\").Breuker 2016, p. 1127.Breuker 2016, p. 2251. The rest of the installments were, however, composed under the supervision of librarian and archivist Gerben Colmjon and bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff,Breuker 1993, p. 604.Wiersma, p. 5. with Eekhoff giving permission to add the works by Eeltsje Halbertsma which had originally been published by him, not De Lange.Breuker 2016, p. 2251. Rimen en Teltsjes, in its complete form, was a thick book, with 586 closely printed pages, full to the brim with short stories and poems, including classics like De Boalserter Merke (\\"The Bolsward Fair\\"),Brothers Halbertsma 1993, p. 8-9.

The first reprint of Rimen en Teltsjes was published in 1881, again by the firm of J. de Lange.Breuker 1993, p. 607. This time, the sole editor was Gerben Colmjon, who, in general, did not make many changes to the first edition, although he did introduce \\"a certain unity in the spelling of vowels and consonants.\\"Breuker 1993, p. 607. It is possible that in 1887 there was a reprint issued of the 1881 edition, although Breuker considers it likely that the scant sources for this were actually referring to a remnant of the 1881 printing. In any case, nothing was changed in the text of the book.Breuker 1993, p. 608. In 1891 G. M. Merkelbach from Bolsward resolved to publish a new edition, but nothing came of it,Breuker 1993, p. 608. and neither did the linguist succeed in publishing the new edition he contemplated in 1892.Breuker 1993, p. 608. Hence it was not until 1895 before a new edition saw the light, published by the Deventer Boek- en Steendrukkerij (formerly the firm of J. de Lange).Breuker 1993, p. 608. It was edited by W. P. de Vries, who changed the text to the so-called Selskipsstavering (\\"Society Spelling\\"), which had been introduced for the Western Frisian language in 1879. However, because he retained the lay-out from the 1881 edition, this caused a rather restless page image, as he kept exactly the same words on a given line, while the number of letters within the words was changed quite dramatically in some cases.Breuker 1993, p. 608. In 1904, publisher Rinse van der Velde from Leeuwarden bought the rights to Rimen en Teltsjes and the remnant of the 1895 printing from De Lange's heirs. After he had sold the last of the 1895 books in 1916, he began to prepare for a new edition, which would see the light in 1918.Breuker 1993, p. 608. To that end he asked his friend, the artist Ids Wiersma, to make a series of illustrations, which afterwards developed into a permanent fixture of Rimen en Teltsjes, and have become almost as famous as the book itself.Breuker 1993, pp. 608‚Äì609.Breuker 2016, p. 2251. Wiersma, as a matter of fact, was paid for his drawings by the Halbertsma family, instead of by Van der Velde.Breuker 1993, p. 608. The 1918 edition of Rimen en Teltsjes was printed on thin paper by Jacob Hepkema of Heerenveen.Breuker 1993, p. 609. Minister Geart Aeilco Wumkes was asked to write an introduction, for which he could draw on the extensive correspondence between the Halbertsma Brothers which the family made available for his use. This meant that after 37 years the Dutch-language introduction Eekhoff had added to the 1881 edition was finally discarded.Breuker 1993, p. 609. The composition of Rimen en Teltsjes itself was also changed, especially by adjusting the sequence in which the stories and poems were placed, and also by the addition of several of the Brothers Halbertsma's works which had remained outside of the collection up until then.Breuker 1993, p. 609. The most important of these was De Wiersizzerij fan Maaike Jakkeles (\\"The Fortune-telling of Maaike Jakkeles\\"), with which the contribution of Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma finally took on a more visible form.Breuker 1993, p. 609. This was primarily done on the insistence of Wumkes,Breuker 2016, p. 2251. who was an admirer of Tsjalling Halbertsma.Wumkes, p. 485. The 1918 edition of Rimen en Teltsjes was again published in installments, which meant the book did not reach its complete form before October 1919.Breuker 1993, p. 608. In the Second World War the German authorities in the German-occupied Netherlands gave permission towards the end of 1943 for a fifth edition of Rimen en Teltsjes to be issued,Breuker 1993, p. 609. which was yet again published in installments, by Van der Velde of Leeuwarden, between the summer of 1944 and September 1945.Breuker 1993, p. 609. This edition was printed by Miedema & Co. in Leeuwarden,Breuker 1993, p. 609. and had a large printing (for the standards of Western Frisian literature) of 2,500 copies, which was however outsubscribed three times and therefore sold out immediately.Breuker 1993, p. 596. The editor this time was the author J. P. Wiersma, who added a new introduction of his own making, in which he offered a romanticised biography of the Brothers Halbertsma.Breuker 1993, p. 609. Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma When in 1958 the sixth edition was published, Wiersma was again the editor.Breuker 1993, p. 609. At that time, he replaced his earlier introduction with a new one, which was clearer and more matter-of-fact and to the point, but he also made further changes to the Halbertsma's text and choice of words, which he had smoothed and simplified somewhat already for the 1944 edition. This intervention (or interference) of Wiersma's led to a large amount of criticism, although there is a case to be made that these changes were actually beneficial to the uninitiated reader.Breuker 1993, pp. 609‚Äì610. The publishers of the 1958 edition were Van der Velde and A. J. Osinga Publishers of Bolsward.Breuker 1993, p. 610. Afterwards two facsimile editions were published in 1969 and 1978, which were direct photocopies of the 1958 edition (in 1969), and the 1969 edition (in 1978) respectively. Especially Ids Wiersma's illustrations were not improved by making a copy of a copy.Breuker 1993, p. 610. In 1993 the 10th edition of Rimen en Teltsjes was published by A. J. Osinga Publishers of Drachten,Breuker 1993, p. 610. in the framework of the series of Fryske Klassiken (\\"Frisian Classics\\"), consisting of the repubishing of fourteen classics of Western Frisian literature.Schroor, p. 936. For the composition of this edition editor Philippus H. Breuker reached back to the original edition of 1871, while retaining later additions, like Ids Wiersma's illustrations and the stories and poems which had been absorbed into the collection in 1918. These were now appended to the rear of the original Rimen en Teltsjes under the title Neirisping (\\"After-harvest\\"), to which Breuker also added some earlier, lower- quality works by the three authors, which had never before been part of Rimen en Teltsjes.Breuker 1993, pp. 610‚Äì611.Breuker 2016, p. 2251. As for the spelling, Breuker remained as close as possible to the 1871 edition as long as that did not make the text entirely incomprehensible to modern readers.Breuker 1993, p. 612. The 1993 edition had a (for Western Frisian literature) ambitious printing of 3,000 copies, but was sold out within two months.Breuker 2016, p. 1124. Reception When the Brothers Halbertsma started on De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar, there was not much enthusiasm in Friesland for reading Western Frisian-language literature.Breuker 1993, p. 594. The so- called Grutte Lapekoer (\\"Big Rag Basket\\"; that is to say, the 1834 edition) needed twenty years to sell out, to Justus Halbertsma's disappointment.Breuker 1993, p. 596. In the letters he wrote later in life, Justus indicates, however, that he would do it all over again, as he and Eeltsje had set themselves the goal of making the Frisian people start to read in their own language again, and by 1850 they had succeeded handsomely.Breuker 1993, p. 594. By that time they had won a large number of loyal fans, as they would be called today, consisting mostly of people of standing, such as ministers, physicians, public notaries, gentleman farmers, etc., and also of the peasantry.Breuker 1993, p. 594. Furthermore, there must also have been interested persons from outside of Friesland, and from among the urban middle class, as Gerben Colmjon mentioned in 1881 that Rimen en Teltsjes was often read, by that time, by people who did not speak Frisian in daily life.Breuker, 1993 p. 594. By the end of the 19th century, Rimen en Teltsjes were held in high regard in Western Frisian literary circles, being the book which had rescued the Western Frisian language from literary oblivion.Breuker 1993, p. 594. In the oeuvre of poets like Obe Postma and Pieter Jelles Troelstra, who grew up in that period, Rimen en Teltsjes reverberates quite clearly.Breuker 1993, p. 595. Even in 1918, Geart Aeilco Wumkes wrote, \\"this book remains a monument for a section of the life of a nation, which calls on the Frisian soul to love its own nature and being.\\"Breuker 1993, pp. 594‚Äì595. At the beginning of the 20th century, such admiration turned to aversion, a development coinciding largely with the formation of the Jongfryske Mienskip (\\"Community of Young Frisians\\") in 1915.Breuker 1993, p. 594. This was inevitable, really, since Rimen en Teltsjes was the seminal book of the generation against which the Young Frisians were reacting.Breuker 1993, p. 594. Douwe Kalma, the pre-eminent representative of the new order, maintained that \\"on the development of the Frisian spiritual life [this book] can not have other than an unsuitable and unfavourable influence.\\"Breuker 1993, p. 594. Kalma measured (in concurrence with the notions of his time) the literary value of a book by the degree of life tragedy which it included, and concluded that Rimen en Teltsjes were no more than \\"vulgar children's amusement\\" and a \\"cruel mockery\\" of said life tragedy.Breuker 1993, p. 595. He even went so far as to say that the works of the Brothers Halbertsma had \\"spiritually murdered thousands of people.\\"Breuker 1993, p. 595. Another Young Frisian, Eeltsje Boates Folkertsma, missed in Rimen en Teltsjes not so much life tragedy as the mysticism which he felt was an indispensable element of true literature. In fact, for all intents and purposes Kalma's opinion and Folkertsma's were much the same when it came to Rimen en Teltsjes.Breuker 1993, p. 595. In the middle of the 20th century, when the Young Frisian fire had died down somewhat, the pendulum swung back in the other direction. At that time literary critics like Anne Wadman, Jelle Hindriks Brouwer and Ype Poortinga again found beauty in Rimen en Teltsjes, referring primarily to Eeltsje Halbertsma's poetry.Breuker 1993, p. 595. Wadman wrote that the Halbertsmas gave \\"the Western Frisian people a literary monument, in which it saw its own life as a nation [...] reflected.\\"Wadman, p. 14. As neither Willem Bilderdijk nor Isa√§c da Costa were fit to hold a candle to Eeltsje Halbertsma (Wadman also wrote), one would look invain for someone of the same stature in the Dutch literature of the same period.Breuker 1993, p. 595. The linguist Philippus H. Breuker, writing in 1993, for the most part subscribed to the same view, and elucidated that it was the whistfulness for wat was and the surprise for wat is which makes Eeltsje Halbertsma's poetry in particular so special. Justus Halbertsma's works, on the other hand, are more abstract, revolve more around ideas and not so much around emotions, and therefore they feel more sharp-edged.Breuker 1993, p. 595. As of today the Brothers Halbertsma's Rimen en Teltsjes still occupies the first slot in the ranking of Western Frisian literary classics.Jensma, p. 197. It is commonly seen as \\"the classical work of Western Frisian literature. It is read by high and low, by learned and unlearned, maybe even still by Frisian and un-Frisian.\\"Breuker 1993, p. 594.

Education Nordgren earned a B.A. in physics from Reed College and an M.S. and Ph.D. in astronomy from Cornell University. Research Before joining the University of Redlands in 2001, Nordgren was an astronomer at the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station and Lowell Observatory. In 2004, with six other astronomers and artists, Nordgren helped develop MarsDials, functioning sundials that NASA's Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity rovers carried with them to Mars. Nordgren also designed the giant sundial that resides on the wall of Appleton Hall at the University of Redlands and is accurate within 10 minutes. For the past five years, Nordgren has been traveling around the U.S. to educate the public about what eclipses are and how the opportunity to see the total solar eclipse on August 21, 2017 should not be missed. More of Nordgren's research on eclipses can be found in his most recent book Sun Moon Earth: The History of Solar Eclipses from Omens of Doom to Einstein and Exoplanets (Basic Books, 2016). Collaboration with U.S. National Park Service Nordgren has been a member of the National Park Service Night Sky Team since 2007, working with the U.S. National Park Service to protect the night skies and promote astronomy education in U.S. national parks. Nordgren has helped document the parks' night skies with photography that has been on display in galleries from New York City to Flagstaff, Arizona, and is on display in a number of national parks.

It suppresses allergic reactions by binding to FcŒµRI receptor in mast cells, thereby inhibiting production of histamines. It is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and is proven hepatotoxic for dogs as a result of its accumulation in the biliary canaliculus.  History  Proxicromil was developed in the late 1970s as an oral analogue and a successor of anti-allergy drug Intal, whose patent protection period was to expire in 1982. Disodium cromoglycate in the form of an inhaler licensed as Intal (derived from ‚Äòinterfere with allergy‚Äô) had become the Fisons company's leading product, generating immense income and stimulating further research; thus several attempts at developing a congener were undertaken. Nevertheless, because of its possible carcinogenic properties, Fisons decided to withdraw the drug in 1981, just before it was to be marketed.  Structure and reactivity  Proxicromil has a strongly acidic chromone skeleton. The 5-hydroxy group increases the activity and, along with the 10-alkyl group, causes an increase in lipophilicity of the compound. The relatively high lipophilicity of the molecule allows it to be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is postulated that the absorption may take place via ion-pair formation. Due to these properties proxicromil operates efficiently as a mast cell stabilizer, preventing the release of histamine. This causes the compound to have anti-allergic properties.  Synthesis  The condensation of 6-acetyl-7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (I) with allyl bromide (A) using of K2CO3 in DMF gives 6-acetyl-7-allyloxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (II), which is isomerized to 5-allyl-7-acetyl-6-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (III) by warming at 200 ¬∞C. Reduction of (III) with H2 over Pd/C in ethanol results in 5-propyl-7-acetyl-6-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (IV), which is now cyclized using diethyl oxalate (B) using sodium ethoxide in refluxing ethanol to give ethyl 10-propyl-4-oxo-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-naphtho[2,3-b]pyran-2-carboxylate (V). The nitration of (V) with nitric acid in sulfuric acid gives ethyl 10-propyl-4-oxo-5-nitro-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-naphtho[2,3-b]pyran-2-carboxylate (VII), which is hydrogenated with H2 over Pd/C in ethanol-acetic acid to afford the corresponding amino derivative (VIII). At the end, this substance is diazotated with NaNO2 and H2SO4 and afterwards treated with 50% H2SO4 at 120 ¬∞C. The synthesis of Proxicromil from 6-acetyl-7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene through respectively condensation, isomerization, hydrogenation, cyclization, nitration, reduction and diazotation. The schematic representation is created using Chemdraw Professional.  Mechanism of action  Mast cells are a type of white blood cells that function in the immune and neuro-immune system. Allergic reactions or responses to inflammation or invading microorganisms are coordinated by these cells in a process called degranulation. Antimicrobial cytotoxic and inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, proteoglycans, serotonin and serine proteases, are released from cytoplasmic granules in the mast cells once their high-affinity receptors FcŒµRI detect IgE antibodies and bind their Fc region. The released histamines cause irritations to the organism such as sneezing and an itchy sensation in the nose. Proxicromil acts as an inhibitor of this process, competing with IgE antibodies for binding with the FcŒµRI receptors, thereby reducing the irritation caused by histamines. The substance was found to reduce allergic reactions and the severity of clinical diseases when administered just before the onset. Furthermore, the antihistamine blocks the elicitation of adoptively transferred EAE, an allergic brain inflammation reaction, and it shows a reducing effect on the severity of skin irritation. The inhibiting effect of Proxicromil on the high-affinity FcŒµRI disables bonding to the IgE antigen and that way blocks the release of mediators such as histamine that would normally give an allergic response.  Metabolism  The pathway of metabolism, by most tested species, is by hydroxylation of the alicyclic ring to yield monohydroxylated metabolites with trace amounts of dihydroxylated product. This pathway occurs in rats, hamsters, rabbits, squirrel monkeys, cynomolgus monkeys, baboons and humans, where the metabolites are found in urine and faeces. For dogs a different elimination occurs, which is essentially as the unchanged drug. The reason for this difference in species, results from the dog having a higher dependence on biliary excretion of the unchanged drug for clearance. The value of the plasma clearance for dogs (0.2 ml min-1 kg-1), is 20 fold lower than the value for rats (4.1 ml min-1 kg-1), a species which is capable of metabolism. This difference leads to the different clearance route. Which becomes saturated after administration of a toxic dose of the drug. If the metabolism of proxicromil in a rat is inhibited with SKF-525A, the plasma clearance of proxicromil is lowered (0.6 ml min-1 kg-1), which increases the amount of unchanged drug cleared by biliary excretion. After giving nursing rat mothers proxicromil, the drug and its metabolites gets also excrete in the milk of these rats. At a maternal dose level of 20 mg/kg, an amount 1-2% was present in the milk. From which 63% was proxicromil and 37% the hydroxylated metabolites.  Efficacy, toxicity and side effects  Proxicromil is tested through a variety of independent studies for its beneficial effect as an anti- allergen, its efficacy against migraine, asthma and tumor enhancement. It shows no effect as a prophylactic against migraine. The reported side effects during this study related mainly to transient gastrointestinal troubles and were generally of a mild nature. For asthma and exercise-induced bronchospasm, Proxicromil was found to be mildly effective. But the investigation was discontinued when malignancies occurred in long-term animal studies. In preventing in vitro antigen-induced pulmonary anaphylaxis, Proxicromil was found to be twenty times less potent than Cl-922, another anti-allergy compound. The same result were found in an animal model with rats. Treatment with Proxicromil reverses the tumor enhancement in immunosuppressed animals. Proxicromil is a mast-cell stabilizer that prevents degranulation and release of mediators such as histamine from mast cells. In normal animals, the drug has no effect. Proxicromil is found to be hepatotoxic in dogs but not in rats, which is a result from the different metabolisms. This comes through the route of excretion which Proxicromil undergoes and which leads to a high concentrations at the biliary canaliculus and thus its accumulation and a consequent increase in hepatic exposure. Animal studies revealed possible carcinogenic properties.

Carb√≥ writes poetry, essays, and edits magazines and anthologies. He is primarily known for his book of poetry titled Secret Asian Man (2000) Tia Chucha Press which won the Asian American Writers Workshop's Readers Choice Award. He also won the 2005 Calatagan Award from the Philippine American Writers & Artists for his book Andalusian Dawn (2004) Cherry Grove Collections. His most noted award is the 1999 Gregory Millard/New York City Department of Cultural Affairs New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship. Carb√≥ spent most of his early career developing contemporary Filipino-American literature as a genre and he is credited by scholars such as Elisabetta Marino as playing an instrumental role in its modern conception. Through his anthologies Returning a Borrowed Tongue, Babaylan, and Pinoy Poetics, he consolidates both Filipino and Filipino-American experiences.  Life and career  = Early life = Carb√≥ was born in Legazpi City, where he and his younger sister Maribri were adopted by Sophie and Alfonso Carb√≥. At age 7, the family moved from their large home in Bicol to Makati, Metro Manila. He attended the International School of Manila for Grades 2‚Äì12, putting him in direct contact with Filipino, American, and international elite. Carb√≥ has stated that some of his early poems, such as \\"Civilizing the Filipino,\\" stem from his experiences with the injustice of white administrators. As the capital city of the Philippines, Manila's close ties with America resulted in a heavy saturation of American pop culture and television shows like The Bionic Man, Charlie's Angels, and Star Trek which dominated his childhood. The movie and story of South Pacific particularly resonated with him, as the family dynamic of the French plantation owner and his two children in the movie musical resembled his own, as noted in his featured interview on National Public Radio. Carb√≥ also enjoyed local Tagalog TV shows such as John N Marsha, Kulit Bulilit, and Uncle Bob's Lucky Seven Club. His father was a major influence in Carb√≥'s decision to become a writer and poet. Carb√≥'s father was well connected to Philippine literature, as he was college friends with Philippine literary giant Raphael Zulueta y da Costa, whose book Like the Molave and Other Poems won the Commonwealth Literary Prize in 1940. He was also friends with the legendary short story writer Bienvenido N. Santos who used to play tennis in their house in Legazpi. His father often interrupted his television time to quiz him on classic literature and read poetry. Between ages 7 and 10, Carb√≥'s father would cajole him to recite Philippine national hero Jos√© Rizal's \\"Mi Ultimo Adios\\" at large dinner parties, instilling in him an interest in classic literature. In the fall of 1984, Carb√≥ moved to the United States to attend Bennington College, and he began to write poetry that Carb√≥ calls \\"silly love poetry that rhymes a lot.\\" He was impressed by the famous writers that taught at Bennington like W.H. Auden, Theodore Roethke, and Bernard Malamud. While there he took classes from noted scholar Jose Hernan Cordova who exposed him to important Latin American writers Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortazar, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Rosario Castellanos, Octavio Paz, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, Gabriela Mistral, and Jose Lezama Lima. During that period at Bennington College writers were getting published or signed by New York literary agents even before they graduated like Bret Easton Ellis and Donna Tartt. That was where Carbo forged a life-long friendship with Vietnamese writer Jade Ngoc Huynh, author of South Wind Changing. In 1985 he moved to San Antonio, Texas and he finally graduated from St. Mary's University where he helped to establish the Pecan Grove Poets. That group would go on to become the Pecan Grove Press. In 1990 he was accepted into the Masters of Fine Arts Poetry Program at Sarah Lawrence College. He studied under the poets Brooks Haxton, Thomas Lux, and Jean Valentine. Carb√≥ married fellow American poet Denise Duhamel on August 22, 1992, at the Stadler Center for Poetry at Bucknell University, where he was serving as the Stadler Resident Poet. Both worked for anti-censorship causes as a result of having their works banned. In 2008, the couple divorced. = Works and reception = Literary reviewers such as Vince Gotera and critics such as M. Evelina Galang have called Carb√≥'s poetry witty, humorous, and avant-garde. Gotera has also described his work as balancing cynical satire with poignant humor while addressing American erasures of Asian history. The most clear example, according to Gotera, is Carb√≥'s Secret Asian Man. The book's main premise is mishearing the lyrics in Johnny Rivers's 60s hit \\"Secret Agent Man\\" as 'secret Asian man.' The poetry's protagonist is named Ang Tunay na Lalaki (The Real Man) and he comments on New York pop culture through a Filipino-American lens. The book itself is written as a novel-in-verse and the character Orpheus acknowledges his status of being a character of Carb√≥'s first book, El Grupo McDonald's. The unconventional inter-textual approach to narrative in Secret Asian Man became a staple to Carb√≥'s style. His work in collecting Filipino- American poetry into anthologies has set foundation for a Filipino-American literary culture to build off the rudimentary literary tradition of its mother country. There are not strong fundamentals for a literary tradition in the Philippines; in his 1961 lecture at Yale University \\"Philippine Literature: A Two-Fold Renaissance\\", Miguel Bernad contended that Philippine literature as an \\"inchoate literature of many languages.\\" With 175 indigenous languages and both Spanish and American imperialism giving them new languages, Philippine authors split their readerships when choosing which language to write in. Carb√≥'s conscious decision to amass Filipino-American writers into his anthology Returning A Borrowed Tongue intended to base Filipino-American literature in the English language to keep their audience whole, which literary critics such as Al Camus Palomar appreciate. The anthology includes poetry that recounts symbols of Filipino and Filipino-American life, such as jeepneys and cuisine, and use them as vehicles to convey the issues of their united identity. Palomar comments that the poets, who range from the early 1900s to 1990, are masters of English nuance and idioms and the volume as a whole being a stylish testament to Filipino poetry. Not all reviewers appreciated the focus on English, however; Roger J. Jiang Bresnahan opposed the decision, claiming it bred disunity by ignoring their common Philippine culture.  Influence  Carb√≥'s efforts to create both a Filipino and Filipino-American literary genre has, according to Marino, established him as a major influence among his peers. He describes his first two books of poetry, El Grupo McDonald's and Secret Asian Man as \\"collective biographies,\\" sharing the experiences of Filipinos other than him. Carb√≥ often alludes to older Filipino works, his stories often contain historical figures, continuing the literary tradition F. Sionil Jos√© established in Dusk by depicting the famous Apolinario Mabini in the novel. In an interview with El Ghibli's Elisabetta Marino, Carb√≥ claimed \\"the necessity of publishing more Filipino-related material for a world where there was no previous representation takes over the creative impulse.\\" Carb√≥, alongside his poetry, began editing anthologies to group his contemporaries into the Filipino-American genre. In his introduction to the anthology Babaylan, Carb√≥ establishes discourse on Filipina identity, citing Spanish and American colonialism to be the cause of the Filipinas' disconnect to identity. His introduction serves as an unbiased account of the Philippine colonial history, and the role Spaniards and Americans played in the creation of Philippine culture and identity. His contemporary colleague Eileen Tabios's introduction serves as an artist's take on history, starkly contrasting Carb√≥'s with her inclusion of emotion and experience as a Filipina. The verse and prose celebrate the Filipina and their struggle, and Carb√≥ uses Babaylan to establish Filipino-American literary tradition further.

Northampton Borough Council information sheet Hazelrigg House (OS map reference SP7504560412 - ) It is not known exactly when the building was built, but an examination of the building's roof trusses suggests that the property dates from the early 16th century and it is one of the few houses to escape the Great Fire of Northampton in September 1675, when only a part of it was destroyed. The building's name derives from the Hazelrigg family who owned it for many years. It has also been known as Cromwell House and Hazelrigg Manor. The Cromwell reference derives from a local tradition that Oliver Cromwell spent the night at Hazelrigg House on his way to the Battle of Naseby in 1645. Unfortunately this local reference isn't supported by any documentary evidence. The property has a tiled roof and has three gables; the house as built was originally wider, with five rather the current three gables which were added in the 17th century, probably at the same time that the front of the house was remodelled; an extension was also added at the rear. This rebuilding may have been made in addition to the repairs after its partial damage caused by the Great Fire. The property was divided into three separate houses sometime in the 19th century, and subsequently (sometime before 1886) reduced in width from 5 gables to the present 3 gables when part was demolished. The house stayed in the Hazelrigg family until 1831. After this, the new owner let the property. In 1913 the Northamptonshire Ladies Club purchased the building to use as its meeting place, sharing it with the local Women's Institute branch as well as the Northamptonshire Architectural & Archaeological Society. In the early 1960s it was acquired by the national architects practice of Marshman Warren Taylor who remained there until the late 1970s. After this the building sat empty for most of the 1980s, by which time it had been acquired by Northampton Borough Council. In 1989 it was refurbished by its tenant, another firm of architects. In 1994 English Heritage became the tenant, staying until 2004; after this the property was occupied by a succession of children's nurseries.; the property is presently occupied by a dance company. Pevsner describes the building thus: \\"Dates from 17th C. Altered later and reduced in size. Coursed rubble, three big dormers with semi-circular gables typical of the mid 17th C. Tall mullioned windows. Irregular fenestration. Doorway with flat classical surround. Staircase with twisted balusters.

In standard statistical models the effects of a categorical explanatory variable are assessed by comparing one category (or level) that is set as a benchmark against which all other categories are compared. The benchmark category is usually referred to as the 'reference' or 'base' category. In order for comparisons to be made the reference category is arbitrarily fixed to zero. Statistical data analysis software usually undertakes formal comparisons of whether or not each level of the categorical variable differs from the reference category. These comparisons generate the well known ‚Äòsignificance values‚Äô of parameter estimates (i.e., coefficients). Whilst it is straightforward to compare any one category with the reference category, it is more difficult to formally compare two other categories (or levels) of an explanatory variable with each other when neither is the reference category. This is known as the reference category problem. Quasi- variances are approximations of variances. Quasi-variances are statistics associated with the parameter estimates (coefficients) of the different levels of categorical explanatory variables within statistical models. Quasi- variances can be presented alongside parameter estimates to enable readers to assess differences between any combinations of parameter estimates for a categorical explanatory variable. The approach is beneficial because such comparisons are not usually possible without access to the full variance- covariance matrix for the estimates. Using quasi-variance estimates addresses the reference category problem. The underlying idea was first proposed by Ridout but the technique was set out by David Firth. The suitability of this technique for social science data analysis has been demonstrated. An on-line tool for the calculation of quasi-variance estimates is available and a short technical description of the methodology is provided.

The song Alien Girl was dedicated to Angelina Jolie, while his title song, The Others was later released in a different version to support UNHCR. The album features Robert Harvey in Unite. For this album, Miyavi changed his electric guitar to a Telecaster, which resulted in an \\"edgier and more aggressive\\" sound. According to Miyavi, the concept of the album was about the acceptance of being different, something that was on his mind for a long time, as he often felt pressure to conform to societal norms, especially when he moved to the United States.

Early life Mac Todman was born on Christmas day 1923 in Tortola, British Virgin Islands. Like many successful Caribbean nationals, he began life as a teacher. In 1952 he married Audrey Creque, to whom he would remain married for life. Together they would have three children, one of whom predeceased him. Todman was also a regular lay preacher at the Road Town Methodist Church. Politics After he left teaching Mac Todman held various administrative posts during the colonial administration in the British Virgin Islands before the introduction of self- rule in 1967. This role took him first to Antigua, and later in 1957 to Barbados as part of the doomed Federation of the West Indies. Todman played in active role in supporting the right of the British Virgin Islands for political self-determination. He famously described the constitutional reforms which led to the 1950 general election as \\"an instrument minimal in its intent and its effect\\". He was also a longstanding member of BVI Public Service Commission, serving from 1970 until 1994, just two years before his death.

He founded his own practice, McW Todman & Co, which continues in existence today. He has been described as a lawyer of \\"exceptional ability.\\" In 1981 in the early days of the British Virgin Islands financial services industry, other than the Chief Minister of the British Virgin Islands Lavity Stoutt, Mac Todman was the only native-born member of the delegation sent by the Territory to negotiate with the United States in relation to the proposed cancellation of the double tax treaty between the two countries. He memorably described the process as one of \\"plea-gotiation\\" rather than \\"negotiation\\". Death On 7 March 1996 he died peacefully of natural causes.

At an early age, her parents decided Jones would become a physician, but she longed to become a farmer. The young Jones had spent most of her childhood in Chicago but had visited the Van Hoosen Farm, often attired in overalls and high boots. Jones earned her bachelor's degree in foreign languages from the University of Chicago and a master's degree in Animal Husbandry from the University of Wisconsin.

The farm began to produce certified Vitamin A and Vitamin D milk from these cattle, whose genetics had gained a fair amount of popularity as the Van Hoosen Farm began branching out into retail sales during the Great Depression. The farm was run scientifically, and earned a reputation in being efficient as well as economically progressive which eventually earned her the title of \\"Master Farmer\\" by the Michigan Farmer in 1933. Her cattle won prizes in breeding and she was awarded the title of \\"Michigan Premier Breeder\\" for a total of nine years. = Work in education = Jones had made significant contributions to civic and educational affairs and served on the Rochester school board from 1924 to 1961, earning her a local nickname as the \\"first lady of Rochester.\\" She was elected for two six-year terms to the State Board of Agriculture, which was the governing board of Michigan State University. Dr. Jones was also a member and president of the Association of Governing Boards of State Universities and Allied Institutions.

Paintings and influences Jackson's work has been shown in a variety of galleries including the Stone Center for the Arts at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, The African American Museum (Dallas), and the Harriet Tubman Museum and the Afro- American Historical and Cultural Society Museum in Philadelphia. Jackson has received a Special Projects Grant from the National Endowment of the Arts and several individual grants from the Georgia Council for the Arts. The Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation gave Jackson an award in 2002. Jackson's paintings draw on her own life experience as well as broader issues of social justice. Her influences span a broad range of styles including surrealism and African American literature. One major influence on Jackson's work is Southern blues music and culture. Much of Jackson's work deals with major events in U.S. and African American history. Her art has responded to the Atlanta Race Riots, the destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina, issues of public housing in Detroit and New Orleans, and the French colonial history of New Orleans. More personally, Jackson draws inspiration from family tragedies, including losing her cousin to violence in Detroit, which is commemorated in the painting Little Girl Blue.
