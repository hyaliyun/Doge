It operated from its construction in 1908 until the Kirklees Stadium was opened nearby for the 1994‚Äì95 season. It was the home of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. from 1908 to 1994 and was also the base for Huddersfield RLFC from 1992 to 1994. History The ground was opened in September 1908 with a friendly against Bradford Park Avenue. The record attendance was 67,037 in a 1‚Äì0 FA Cup 6th Round defeat against Arsenal on 27 February 1932. Bradford City also played six home games at Leeds Road during the 1985‚Äì86 season, while its Valley Parade home was rebuilt following the Bradford City stadium fire. Manchester United also played a home match at Leeds Road in the 1948 FA Cup run while Old Trafford was being rebuilt following damage from German bombers in the Second World War. A single international match took place at the ground, when England defeated the Netherlands 8-2 in a friendly on 27 November 1946. This was England's second home international match after World War II, the first having been held at Maine Road, Manchester two weeks earlier. In January 1990, the Taylor Report required all clubs in the top two divisions of English football to have an all-seater stadium by the 1994-95 season. Huddersfield were in the Third Division at this stage, but were aiming for promotion - finally achieving it in 1995. The club's board decided to replace Leeds Road with a new all-seater stadium at a different location, and quickly settled on a new site opposite the original stadium. Huddersfield Town played their 1,554th and final League game at the Leeds Road ground on 30 April 1994, beating Blackpool 2‚Äì1, watched by a near capacity crowd of 16,195. Town's oldest-surviving ex-player, Joe Walter, was guest of honour at the match. The ground was demolished soon afterwards and the site was redeveloped as a retail park. The point once occupied by the centre spot is now marked by a plaque in the car park, outside B&Q.; Meanwhile, Huddersfield settled into its new stadium - the Alfred McAlpine Stadium.

Peabody, 212 U.S. 78 (1909), is a decision by the United States Supreme Court which held that the governor and officers of a state National Guard, acting in good faith and under authority of law, may imprison without probable cause a citizen of the United States in a time of insurrection and deny that citizen the right of habeas corpus. Background The case arose out of a wave of labor disputes, known as the Colorado Labor Wars, in the mining industry in the state of Colorado. In August 1902, the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) organized mill workers in Colorado City, Colorado. The employers planted a spy in the union, and the evidence of union activity gathered by the mole led to the dismissal of 42 union members. Union-employer negotiations over the dismissals began almost immediately, and dragged on into 1903. With the negotiations at a standstill, the WFM struck on February 14, 1903. After the number of miners walking the picket lines grew in March and April, the mine owners decided to seek state aid. Governor James Peabody was strongly anti-union, and the employers worked with him to craft a response that would break the strike and the union. Although Colorado City was quiet and no public disorders of any magnitude had occurred, the employers and local authorities claimed extensive rioting had occurred and that local and county law enforcement were unable to handle the mobs. Governor Peabody called out the Colorado militia, investing them around Colorado City. Outraged miners in nearby Cripple Creek and the western city of Telluride also walked off the job, and the militia was deployed in those cities as well. Mass arrests began in September 1903, breaking the strike.Suggs, Colorado's War on Militant Unionism: James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners, 1972.Dubofsky, We Shall Be All: A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, 2000.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 3, 1964. One of those arrested was Charles Moyer. Moyer had traveled to Telluride to protest the mass arrests and deportation of miners. He lent his signature to a WFM poster (see right) denouncing the arrests. Moyer was arrested on March 28, 1904, for desecrating the American flag. He was released on bail, but re-arrested the following day on the orders of the Adjutant General of the state militia on the grounds of \\"military necessity.\\" Moyer's predicament was not unusual. The state militia had detained hundreds of striking workers and union leaders for many weeks in bullpens and had disregarded hundreds of habeas corpus petitions.Forbath, \\"The Shaping of the American Labor Movement,\\" Harvard Law Review, April 1989. Moyer petitioned a Colorado state court for a writ of habeas corpus, which was granted. However, the Colorado State Attorney General and the local district attorney refused to honor the writ. Moyer appealed to the Colorado Supreme Court. On June 6, 1904, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled in In re Moyer, that Moyer's constitutional right to due process and habeas corpus had not been violated. The court held that the governor had acted under color of state law and that the courts had no jurisdiction to review the governor's finding that a state of insurrection existed in Colorado. Moyer appealed to the U.S. District Court in Missouri, and obtained a writ of habeas corpus on July 5, 1904.. Alarmed by the writ, Governor Peabody revoked the finding of insurrection the same day and ordered Moyer released by 3:45 p.m. before the federal writ could be served. Moyer was released but continued to press his case. The U.S. Supreme Court accepted certiorari, and oral argument occurred on January 5 and January 6, 1909.Historians see Peabody's actions as evidence that the governor knew that no state of insurrection existed and that the \\"military necessity\\" of imprisoning Moyer was lacking. See, for example, Suggs, Colorado's War on Militant Unionism: James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners, 1972. Decision  The poster \\"Is Colorado in America?\\" with its American flag, with signature by Charles Moyer (bottom, left), which led to Moyer's arrest in 1904 and the Supreme Court case of Moyer v. Peabody. Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. delivered the opinion for a unanimous court. The decision was a mere seven paragraphs long. The first three paragraphs were devoted to determining the jurisdiction of the court. Holmes began by refusing to question whether a state of insurrection actually existed in Colorado. \\"It is admitted, as it must be, that the Governor's declaration that a state of insurrection existed is conclusive of that fact,\\" Holmes wrote.Moyer v. Peabody, 212 U.S. 78, 83; emphasis added. \\"The facts that we are to assume are that a state of insurrection existed and that the Governor, without sufficient reason but in good faith, in the course of putting the insurrection down held the plaintiff until he thought that he safely could release him.Moyer v. Peabody, 212 U.S. 78, 84; emphasis added. Holmes then made what is considered a famous statement about due process: \\"But it is familiar that what is due process of law depends on circumstances. It varies with the subject-matter and the necessities of the situation.\\"Moyer v. Peabody, 212 U.S. 78, 84. The existence of the state of insurrection was, therefore, critical. Both the state constitution and the statutes gave the governor the power to call out the militia, put down rebellion, and hold rebels without providing for relief. Holmes incorporated the findings of the Colorado Supreme Court in his opinion andonce more refused to entertain any arguments to the contrary: \\"In such a situation we must assume that he had a right under the state constitution and laws to call out troops, as was held by the Supreme Court of the State.\\" But Holmes' assumptions were not ironclad. He left open the door for plaintiffs to challenge whether or not a state of insurrection did, in fact, exist. In this case, however, the plaintiff did not do so.\\"It is not alleged that his judgment was not honest, if that be material, or that the plaintiff was detained after fears of the insurrection were at an end.... But there is nothing... in the allegations of the complaint that would warrant submitting the judgment of the Governor to revision by a jury.\\" Moyer v. Peabody, 212 U.S. 78, 85. Absent any such challenge by the plaintiff to the factual situation, Holmes concluded that plaintiffs have no recourse under law. Holmes placed his faith utterly in the democratic process and a citizenry's ability to elect leaders of \\"good faith:\\" :So long as such arrests are made in good faith and in the honest belief that they are needed in order to head the insurrection off, the Governor is the final judge and cannot be subjected to an action after he is out of office on the ground that he had not reasonable ground for his belief.Moyer v. Peabody, 212 U.S. 78, 85. The judgment left plaintiffs one straw to cling to. Holmes suggested in dicta that plaintiffs might have grounds if their imprisonment were lengthy: \\"If we suppose a Governor with a very long term of office,\\" Holmes hypothesized, \\"it may be that a case could be imagined in which the length of the imprisonment would raise a different question. However, since Moyer's incarceration had lasted only four months, it was implied that the line had not been crossed.Chertoff, \\"Judicial Review of the President's Decisions as Commander in Chief,\\" Rutgers Law Review, Summer 2003. Aftermath Moyer v. Peabody was long moot by the time the case reached the Supreme Court, which accepted the case only because it arose under demurrer, which challenged the legal sufficiency of the government's action. Oddly, although the case was accepted on demurrer, the Court refused to acknowledge that Moyer had in fact contested Peabody's finding that a state of insurrection existed in Colorado in 1904. =Effect on the labor movement= Historians argue that the case radicalized a significant portion of the American labor movement. Moyer himself concluded that the state's use of military power to crush unions could be countered only by a syndicalist union linked to a potent political party. Subsequently, Moyer and the WFM helped found the radical Industrial Workers of the World in 1905. While Samuel Gompers and the American Federation of Labor sought an accommodation with capitalism and the status quo, a large minority of American workers did not, and another three decades of labor unrest was caused, in part, by desperate workers who felt that the courts were closed to them.Fink, Biographical Dictionary of American Labor, 1984. =Legal analysis= Moyer v. Peabody had its foundation in previous court rulings in the United States and spawned a number of subsequent decisions. It was one in a long line of cases extending back through Ex parte Merryman, 17 F. Cas. 144 (1861),Where the president had suspended the writ of habeas corpus \\"within the vicinity of the military line\\" during war, held neither the president nor authorize a military officer could suspend the write of habeas corpus absent congressional authority. Ex parte Benedict, 3 F. Cas. 159 (N.D.N.Y. 1862),Where pacifist is arrested and imprisoned during time of war by military officer, held writ of habeas corpus may not be suspended absent statutory authority. and Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. 2 (1866).Where, in time of war, plaintiff was accused of planning to steal weapons, liberate prisoners of war, and take over state government, held that suspension of habeas corpus was lawful but military tribunals did not apply to citizens in states that had upheld the authority of the Constitution and where civilian courts were still operating.Vladeck, \\"The Detention Power,\\" Yale Law & Policy Review, Winter 2004. In this regard, it has a lengthy legal pedigree. But the case also spawned a new line of legal analysis. For example, one Supreme Court justice called Moyer the foundation of the \\"'good-faith' analysis‚Ä¶of our modern doctrine of qualified immunity.\\", Scalia, dissenting, at 572, Footnote 4. Despite the firm grounding Moyer v. Peabody has in US constitutional law, the case is considered to be controversial. In Luther v. Borden, 48 U.S. 1 (1849), the US Supreme Court had established the \\"political question\\" test in which a court may refuse to rule because the issue is political, rather than judicial. Moyer is controversial in part because Justice Holmes took much of the dicta in Luther and made it binding law. The decision is controversial also because despite the analysis in Ex parte Benedict, Moyer allowed states to implement martial law without judicial review.Weida, \\"A Republic of Emergencies: Martial Law in American Jurisprudence,\\" Connecticut Law Review, Summer 2004. Although Moyer focused on the immediacy of war, the aspect of the ruling has proven troublesome to the courts. Earlier Supreme Court decisions had emphasized the importance of the existence of open conflict. For example, in Mitchell v. Harmony, 54 U.S. (13 How.) 115 (1851),Where military officer had seized weapons believed to be headed for enemy hands during war but in a peaceful locale, held seizure of weapons must be with probable cause and subject to due process. the Supreme Court upheld the power of military officials to seize property to prevent violence. But the Court limited that power by requiring the danger to be immediate. In some ways, Moyer retreats from the court's ruling in Mitchell: Holmes accepted the case under demurrer, but then refused to consider Moyer's challenge to the finding of a state of emergency. Moyer nevertheless stands in the tradition of Mitchell because the Moyer court recognized that only immediate violence was grounds for suspending the writ. The vexing problem of immediacy would cause the Supreme Court to later back away from Holmes' ruling in Moyer. Just a quarter of a century later, in Sterling v. Constantin, 287 U.S. 378 (1932), the Court held (contra Moyer) that executive findings of a state of insurrection must be subject to judicial review. In Sterling, the governor of Texas had restricted production of oil from certain wells by claiming that a state of insurrection existed in some areas of his state. The Supreme Court concluded that such claims of insurrection were subject to judicial review, and after review, the Court actually rejected the governor's finding. Citing Mitchell v. Harmony, the Court endorsed \\"the argument that without judicial review, the boundaries setting apart real emergencies will break down. Chief Justice Hughes explicitly articulated the fear that if emergency powers are beyond court scrutiny then soon all government action will be characterized as an emergency.\\" For most of the 20th century, Supreme Court jurisprudence ignored Moyer. Prior to 2004, the last decision to rely heavily on Moyer was Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232 in 1973. In Scheuer v. Rhodes, survivors of the victims of the Kent State shootings of 1970 sued the Ohio Army National Guard for damages. A lower court rejected the suit, using the rationale provided in Moyer. The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously reversed, \\"emptying the Moyer precedent of most of its residual authority.\\"Quoted in Rostow, McDougal and Reisman, Power and Policy in Quest of the Law: Essays in Honor of Eugene Victor Rostow, 1985. After the 9/11 attacks, however, Moyer took on new significance. In 2004, the case was thoroughly discussed in the Supreme Court's \\"illegal enemy combatant\\" decision, Hamdi v. Rumsfeld.. The Moyer case may take on increasing significance in the future as the \\"War on Terror\\" continues: \\"The ruling's appeal to present-day government lawyers is obvious. The administration has taken pains to emphasize that the Padilla detention order‚Äîlike the order establishing the ground rules for military commissions‚Äîwas signed by President Bush in the exercise of his authority as commander-in-chief. And if a state governor playing commander-in-chief can persuade the courts to rubber-stamp his abusive actions, surely a President can, too.\\" See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 212 Notes References * Chertoff, Michael. \\"Judicial Review of the President's Decisions as Commander in Chief.\\" Rutgers Law Review. 55:1289 (Summer 2003). * Dubofsky, Melvyn.

The district boundary then follows Avalon Street to Court Avenue. The district boundary then follows Court Avenue westward until its intersection with Stonewall Avenue. The district boundary then continues North on Stonewall until its intersection with Poplar, at which point in the west direction Poplar is again the Southern boundary until its intersection with Cleveland. The Evergreen Historic District is bounded on the East by East Parkway, from the West by Cleveland Avenue, and from the North by North Parkway. Properties on the North adjacent North Parkway, on the South adjacent Court Avenue between Avalon Street and McNeil Street, and properties on the South side of Poplar Avenue between Kenilworth Place and Cleveland are also included within the boundaries of Evergreen Historic District. Evergreen is located in the area of Memphis known as Midtown. This area of the city includes Overton Park, which is one of the largest urban parks in the nation; it also includes the Memphis Zoo. Community Evergreen is unique to Midtown because there is a mix of old and new homes, due to the attempt to split the neighborhood, and Overton Park, in half to make way for Interstate 40 (see Sam Cooper Boulevard). The neighborhood was able to fight the interstate, and the case eventually went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the neighborhood. Many of the homes were demolished, but in the early 90s, bids started and builders repatched the holes in Evergreen. Today, the neighborhood is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is probably the best value for the Midtown area. Evergreen is sometimes referred to as Stonewall, after the street which has some of the neighborhood's nicest homes.

By the time of the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943, he was a first lieutenant commanding the 3rd Reconnaissance Troop, 3rd Infantry Division. On the night of July 17, 1943, one week after the invasion of Sicily began, Waybur volunteered to lead a reconnaissance patrol into enemy territory near Agrigento in order to locate a missing Ranger unit. The patrol, consisting of three Jeeps, was cut off and attacked by four Italian tanks. In the ensuing firefight, Waybur and three of his men were wounded, Waybur seriously so. When the patrol's three machine guns ran out of ammunition, he ordered his men to take cover and single-handedly disabled one tank by standing in the open and killing its crew with a Thompson submachine gun. After sending one patrol member to get help, Waybur continued to lead his men in holding off the three remaining tanks through the night. American reinforcements arrived in the morning, and the Italian tanks withdrew. Three months later, on October 21, Waybur was issued the Medal of Honor for his actions during the battle. The medal was formally presented to him by Lieutenant General Mark Wayne Clark, commander of the Fifth Army, during a ceremony in North Africa later that year. Waybur was sent back to the United States to work on war bond tours, but he eventually asked to be returned to combat duty. He was killed in action in Germany on March 28, 1945‚Äîtwo years after earning the Medal of Honor. Waybur was buried at the Lorraine American Cemetery and Memorial in Saint-Avold, France. In addition to the Medal of Honor, he had also received the Silver Star and a Purple Heart. Medal of Honor citation Waybur chats with Mark W. Clark, who presented him with the Medal of Honor. First Lieutenant Waybur's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and > beyond the call of duty in action involving actual conflict with the enemy. > Commander of a reconnaissance platoon, 1st Lt. Waybur volunteered to lead a > 3-vehicle patrol into enemy-held territory to locate an isolated Ranger > unit.

Spinal Cord Injury BC has three core services through which it serves the BC Spinal Cord Injury community, the Peer program, Information Services and SCI Information Database. Spinal Cord Injury BC works in close partnership with the Vancouver General Hospital, GF Strong Rehabilitation Centre, International Collaboration On Repair Discoveries (ICORD), Rick Hansen Institute, Neil Squire Foundation, BC Wheelchair Sports (BCWCS) and The Disability Foundation.  History  Spinal Cord Injury BC ( formerly the BC Paraplegic Association) is a branch of the Canadian Paraplegic Association(CPA). The CPA was founded in 1945 by veterans who sustained spinal cord injuries in WW II; its mandate was to minimize social barriers faced by persons with disabilities so that they could benefit from an improved quality of life. The Canadian Paraplegic Association, BC Division (now known as Spinal Cord Injury BC) was formed in 1957, led by executive director Doug Mowat, who held this position until his death in 1992. The first unit of the Western Society for Physical Rehabilitation opened in 1947 and was renamed the GF Strong Rehabilitation Centre in 1957. In 1959, the association's first employee was hired as a rehabilitation consultant. That same year, the BC Paraplegic Association celebrated its first job placement. During the 1960s, scholarships were made available to assist individuals with physical disabilities in reaching their post-secondary education goals. The BC Paraplegic Association also helped contributed to worldwide disability education and development in 1969 with its donation of equipment to people with disabilities in developing countries. Strong promotion by the BC Paraplegic Association to revise the BC Building Code and eliminate stairs as the only means of access to public buildings proved successful in 1973, when the City of Vancouver introduced its new accessibility by-laws. These standards were expanded throughout the province under the BC Building Code in 1979. The BC Paraplegic Foundation was established in 1975 to support the BC Paraplegic Association and individuals with spinal cord injuries and other mobility-related impairments. The BC Paraplegic Association also extensively consulted in the planning of Vancouver's Expo '86 which was lauded as a showcase for accessibility and high-tech innovations for people with disabilities. In the 1990s, the association worked with BC Transit and were instrumental in the development of the accessible bus program in the Lower Mainland ‚Äì the first of its kind in Canada. Staff Doug Mowat, the organization's longtime executive director, was also the first wheelchair user ever elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia as an MLA. The organization's most recent director of marketing and development, Stephanie Cadieux, was elected to the Legislative Assembly as a BC Liberal MLA in the 2009 provincial election, becoming the second wheelchair user ever elected to the legislature.\\"More than a quarter of MLAs new\\".

Band members are: Jo√£o Lu√≠s (bass), Rui David (vocals/acoustic guitar) and S√©rgio Mendes (lead guitars).  Career  In early 1996 the band's vocalist, Rui David, was playing acoustic guitar and singing on a beach in the Algarve (south of Portugal) when a DJ from a national radio station heard him. He enjoyed the songs and invited Rui to play them live on his late night program. After that, and for the next 3 years, the band did the usual circuit of live performances, music festivals and making demos. In 1999 Universal/PolyGram signed up the band. The band‚Äôs debut album, called Blown, was released in March, 1999 and sold just below platinum. The first single to be taken from the album was My Wonder Moon and it remained in first place of the Portuguese airplay charts for almost two months. In 2004 this song was still on the top 20 airplay. The second single, Silent Speech, which had a considerable airplay as well, was the opening track of the album. The band was 1999's revelation in the Portuguese music scene and toured intensively, playing 90 concerts in the first 8 months after the release of the album. A Brazilian edition of Blown was released, with an extra CD recorded live. November 2000 saw the release of their second album, Moving Spirits, which gathered substantial airplay (first single was The Endless Road) and took the band to the road for another series of well recognized performances around the country. This time, another musician joined them, (well established composer/keyboard player, Hugo Novo). Both records were recorded and produced by Darren Allison, who has also worked with Skunk Anansie, Spiritualized and The Divine Comedy. After 4 years of recording and touring, the band felt prepared for bigger challenges. That led them to leave Universal for an independent label, Metrosonic Records. With the company's full support and commitment to the band's goal of becoming an international act, Hands on Approach started working, in October 2002, on their third album which took them 5 months of hiding on the luxurious surroundings of S√£o Pedro do Sul, where the label's own studio is situated. The album Groovin' on Monster's eye-balls was released in September 2005 and the first single to come out was A chance, a song that conquered the hearts of many new fans by appearing on the soundtrack of an audience-leader TV show series called Morangos com A√ßucar. After the release of the album, the band was confident that they had done a good job, but the massive hit that turned their second single, If you give up the most played song of the year in Portuguese radio, was beyond their dreams. The song is a powerful ballad sang in duet with singer Treana Morris. The song remained in the top 20 for an amazing 6 months and as confirmed Hands on Approach as an established and one of the most prolific acts in the Portuguese music scene. Last year the band was on the road for 3 months and finished recording an acoustic DVD that marks their 10th anniversary.

The first stage of the rocket was a stretched Thor variant named \\"Long Tank Thrust Augmented Thor\\". The Long Tank Thor first stage was later adopted by NASA's Delta program for its \\"Thrust Augmented Improved Delta\\", which first flew in 1968. The second stage was the Agena-D, which had already been used in conjunction with the standard configuration Thor, as the Thor-Agena. Three Castor rockets would be used as boosters. Most launches carried Corona (KeyHole) reconnaissance satellites, particularly spacecraft of the KH-4 series, however some scientific and technology development satellites were also flown, mostly towards the end of the program. 43 launches took place from 1966-72 with two complete failures and one partial. The launch of a KH-4A photoreconnaissance satellite on May 9, 1967, malfunctioned when the Thor's first stage failed to cut off on schedule and continued burning until LOX depletion, thus putting the satellite into an incorrect orbit that seriously reduced its image quality. The first total failure was the launch of a Nimbus weather satellite on May 5, 1968, when control of the Thor failed during launch and it was destroyed by Range Safety action at T+120 seconds. This mission was noteworthy because the satellite carried a pair of isotopic power generators known as SNAP (Systems For Nuclear Auxiliary Power). As the possibility of a launch failure had been considered during their design, the power generators were equipped with a very sturdy casing to prevent their radioactive contents from escaping into the environment. After the destruction of Nimbus-B's launch vehicle, Navy crews began an extensive search for the SNAP generators. On September 27, the Nimbus satellite was located in 300 feet of water near the Santa Barbara Islands with the SNAP units nearby. They were successfully fished out of the ocean two weeks later and their protective casings found to be intact. The fuel inside them was taken out and reused in a subsequent Nimbus launch. As part of the investigation, parts of the Thor were recovered and examined. It was discovered that the yaw gyro was installed improperly and had missing alignment pins, apparently because a pad technician had mistakenly broken them off during installation. Without the pins, the gyro rotated out of position with the effect that the booster lost control almost as soon as the pitch and roll sequence started. The other total failure was the attempted launch of a KH-4B photo-reconnaissance satellite on February 17, 1971. A technician mistakenly added too much lubricant to the Thor's fuel system, the result being that the excess fluid formed a frozen plug in a section of plumbing. The booster lifted and flew normally until the start of the pitch and roll program about 20 seconds after liftoff at which point the turbopump gearbox disintegrated due to loss of lubricant. Flying debris tore up the Thor's thrust section, causing total loss of thrust. With the main engine being the only source of attitude control, the launch vehicle tumbled uncontrollably and exploded 30 seconds after launch, the debris impacting in Bear Creek Canyon a quarter mile from the launch complex. The Thorad-Agena was flown in two different configurations, the SLV-2G, and the SLV-2H. These differed in that the SLV-2G used Castor 1 strap-on boosters, whereas the 2H used Castor 2s.

A legal dispute followed, and after running out of money for the struggle, creators David Lawrence and Ron Lim surrendered: the title returned to Eternity and was later published in a revamped version by Malibu. Eternity's 1989 publication of The Uncensored Mouse, which reprinted Mickey Mouse comics from the 1930s ‚Äî without Disney's permission ‚Äî led to a run-in with Walt Disney Productions. Eternity printed The Uncensored Mouse with totally black covers, bagged (to prevent casual buyers from flipping through the comic), and the inside of the comic had a printed notice: \\"Mickey Mouse is a registered trademark of Walt Disney Productions\\" so as not to confuse the market that it was an authorized Disney production.

Guy Cecere headed the Sculpture displays and placements. Robert, son of the mentioned below, placed many posters, signage around town to announce the Exhibition days and hours. In the mid 1960s Harriett Cotterill and Matilda Grech joined the original committee along with Cynthia Van Lierde. It was decided to become officially chartered in 1971. From that year on, they met as a board of directors at the homes/studio on Christian Hill of Ada and Gaetano Cecere, Georgie Kiger and Tilly Brice. During the 1960s The Cecere's had assistance from Rose Cioffi and her husband Al Cioffi, son Robert Cioffi, sculptor and mentored by Gaetano known as \\"Guy\\" retired professor from Univ. of Virginia, Mary Washington College.

He was a member of Jiny, a militant nationalist group formed in southern Madagascar in the 1940s that sided with MDRM during the ultimately unsuccessful Malagasy Uprising of 1947 against French rule. The colonial government imprisoned him from 1946 to 1950 for his affiliation with Jiny. He formed the Madagascar for the Malagasy (MONIMA) party in 1958 and successfully campaigned for the seat of mayor in Toliara, a position he held from 1959 to 1961. He came to view president Philibert Tsiranana and his Social Democratic Party (PSD) supporters as unduly favorable to continued French interests on the island after independence in 1960. Jaona instigated the 1971-72 rotaka farmer and student protests that successfully forced Tsiranana's resignation. By the late 1970s he had become disillusioned with Tsiranana's socialist successor, Didier Ratsiraka, and transferred his political loyalties to the opposition. He ran in the presidential election against Ratsiraka in 1982 and lost by a large margin, but claimed the results were falsified and demanded a recount. He was placed under house arrest and then medical detention, while his lawyer was expelled to France. He unsuccessfully ran again in 1989. He was a leading figure in protests from 1989 to 1992 that forced Ratsiraka's resignation and the first free multiparty election in Madagascar, resulting in the election of Albert Zafy.

Frederick William Newton Whitehead, 1853 ‚Äì 1938 (Oct, 2007 - Doc file). was an English landscape artist and illustrator. Life and work Leicester's Hospital, Warwick (from \\"Warwickshire, the land of Shakespeare\\") Whitehead was born in Leamington Spa in 1853, the eldest child of William and Hannah Whitehead. The Whitehead family had lived in Leamington from the late eighteenth century and were bricklayers or farmers. William Whitehead, however, carried out an apprenticeship and set up business as a ‚ÄòCarver & Gilder, Picture Dealer, Restorer and Artists‚Äô Colourman‚Äô. The Whitehead‚Äôs family home at 5 Lansdowne Terrace was also the business premises and studio. Well established Leamington artists, including Thomas Baker (1808‚Äì1864), sold their work through the studio. Frederick grew up surrounded by strong artistic influences. When he was still a child the Irish artist Richard Rothwell (1800‚Äì1868) came to stay at Lansdowne Terrace and gave Frederick his first lessons in drawing and painting. Later he received tuition from John Burgess (1813‚Äì1874), one of the town‚Äôs foremost artists. Despite these lessons with Burgess, Whitehead‚Äôs early work was more noticeably influenced by Thomas Baker in both subject matter and style. Salford Priors (from \\"Warwickshire, the land of Shakespeare\\") Frederick attended the Leamington School of Art, with his sister Elizabeth Whitehead, before they both travelled to France in 1880. There studied at the Acad√©mie Julian in the Saint-Denis district of Paris for three years under Jules Joseph Lefebvre (1836‚Äì1911) and Gustave Boulanger (1824‚Äì1888). Classes were only held in the winter. During the summer months, Frederick and his sister would travel and paint together in the French countryside. It is thought that his time in France established in him the importance of painting in the open air and observing all the changes in nature. On returning to England, Whitehead he continued to travel but settled for a time in Dorset. It was here that he met and began a lifelong friendship with the writer, Thomas Hardy. He also met his future wife Beatrice Case who was a local celebrity in her own right, well known for her singing voice and expertise on the piano. Through their long and happy marriage they spent winters in London and returned to Dorset in the summer months. Frederick and his sister Elizabeth became well known in the Dorset countryside, travelling with their two dogs and their caravan \\"The Rambler\\". Living in this way meant that Frederick could immerse himself in nature. He painted close by the caravan or travelled further a-field with a small portable studio called \\"the Baby Elephant\\". He painted using watercolours and oils and etched \\"on the spot\\". Dunchurch (from \\"Warwickshire, the land of Shakespeare\\") Whitehead seems to be best known for his paintings of the Dorset countryside. He rarely visited Leamington after his marriage, though, between 1881 and 1916, he illustrated three books on Warwickshire, and Leamington Art Gallery and Museum holds eleven paintings and twelve prints of locations in Warwickshire by the artist as well as paintings and prints from locations in France, Wales and Devon. Whitehead was a member of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists and exhibited his first painting there in 1870 at the age of eighteen. He also exhibited with the Royal Academy (London) from 1881 to 1893. His work appeared in the exhibitions of leading galleries in Britain and he held a number of successful private exhibitions in London. He was a great admirer of Constable and has been likened to him in his choice of subject. Although he predominantly painted landscapes, he also concentrated occasionally on religious architecture, such as St Mary‚Äôs, Warwick, and Gloucester Cathedral. Whitehead died in February 1938. He was a true lover of the English countryside who lived alongside nature in order to observe and immortalise it for future generations. References Bibliography *Holland, Clive.

The list includes all commonly accepted genera, but also genera that are now considered invalid, doubtful (nomina dubia), or were not formally published (nomina nuda), as well as junior synonyms of more established names, and genera that are no longer considered agnathans. Modern forms are excluded from this list. Naming conventions and terminology Naming conventions and terminology follow the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Technical terms used include: * Junior synonym: A name which describes the same taxon as a previously published name. If two or more genera are formally designated and the type specimens are later assigned to the same genus, the first to be published (in chronological order) is the senior synonym, and all other instances are junior synonyms. Senior synonyms are generally used, except by special decision of the ICZN, but junior synonyms cannot be used again, even if deprecated. Junior synonymy is often subjective, unless the genera described were both based on the same type specimen. *Nomen nudum (Latin for \\"naked name\\"): A name that has appeared in print but has not yet been formally published by the standards of the ICZN. Nomina nuda (the plural form) are invalid, and are therefore not italicized as a proper generic name would be. If the name is later formally published, that name is no longer a nomen nudum and will be italicized on this list. Often, the formally published name will differ from any nomina nuda that describe the same specimen. *Nomen oblitum (Latin for \\"forgotten name\\"): A name that has not been used in the scientific community for more than fifty years after its original proposal. *Preoccupied name: A name that is formally published, but which has already been used for another taxon. This second use is invalid (as are all subsequent uses) and the name must be replaced. As preoccupied names are not valid generic names, they will also go unitalicized on this list. *Nomen dubium (Latin for \\"dubious name\\"): A name describing a fossil with no unique diagnostic features. As this can be an extremely subjective and controversial designation, this term is not used on this list.

Biography Waugh joined the Army from Augusta, Maine, and by May 11, 1944 was serving as a first lieutenant in the 339th Infantry Regiment, 85th Infantry Division. On that day, during an attack on a hill near Tremensucli, Italy, Waugh single-handedly captured six enemy bunkers. Three days later, as the battle for the hill continued, he captured two more enemy emplacements. He was killed in action the next week and, on October 4, 1944, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Waugh was buried at the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery and Memorial in Nettuno, Italy. Medal of Honor citation First Lieutenant Waugh's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond > the call of duty in action with the enemy.

The book was the winner of the 2007 Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize for comic writing and was serialised on BBC Radio 4. It won the Waverton Good Read Award in 2008. It was made into a popular movie in 2011, starring Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt. Life Born in 1946 in Croxdale, County Durham, and educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle and Pembroke College, Oxford, Torday turned to fiction writing only later in life, and his first novel was published at the age of 59. Prior to that he was a successful businessman living in Northumberland. The inspiration for the novel stemmed from Torday's interest in both fly fishing and the Middle East. From these two strands, he weaves a political satire that centres on the world of political spin management. His second novel is entitled The Irresistible Inheritance of Wilberforce (titled Bordeaux in the United States) and is about a man who drinks himself to death. In 2008, he was nominated for Best Newcomer at the Galaxy British Book Awards. Torday's third book The Girl on the Landing was published in 2009.

While not one of the largest fires of the 2007 California wildfire season, only burning , it was one of the most destructive, with 248 structures being destroyed. As the fire grew, it caused major evacuations and the closure of Interstate 15. The California Public Utilities Commission ruled that in the Rice fire, San Diego Gas and Electric had not trimmed back trees as state law requires. It was also at fault, the commission said, in the Witch and Guejito fires. The power line that caused the Witch fires shorted three times in three hours, but the utility didn't cut power to it for six hours. In August 2017, administrative law judges S. Pat Tsen and Sasha Goldberg ruled that the utility did not reasonably manage its facilities and that the wildfires were not outside of its control. Therefore, they ruled, the utility could not pass its uninsured costs along to its ratepayers. The PUC agreed in early December in a 5-0 vote. The Rice fire began when a dead tree limb fell across power lines. It burned 9472 acres and destroyed 206 homes. The Witch and Guejito fires combined to burn 197,000 acres, killed two people, injured 40 firefighters and destroyed 1141 homes and 239 vehicles. Legal claims after the fires totalled $5.6 billion, $2.4 billion after the utility settled 2500 lawsuits for damages. The $379 million it had sought to pass along to customers represented uninsured costs.

The list includes all commonly accepted genera, but also genera that are now considered invalid, doubtful (nomina dubia), or were not formally published (nomina nuda), as well as junior synonyms of more established names, and genera that are no longer considered members of osteichthyes. This list includes 1,386 generic names. *Extinct genera are marked with a dagger (‚Ä†). *Extant genera are bolded. Naming conventions and terminology Naming conventions and terminology follow the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Technical terms used include: * Junior synonym: A name which describes the same taxon as a previously published name. If two or more genera are formally designated and the type specimens are later assigned to the same genus, the first to be published (in chronological order) is the senior synonym, and all other instances are junior synonyms. Senior synonyms are generally used, except by special decision of the ICZN, but junior synonyms cannot be used again, even if deprecated. Junior synonymy is often subjective, unless the genera described were both based on the same type specimen. *Nomen nudum (Latin for \\"naked name\\"): A name that has appeared in print but has not yet been formally published by the standards of the ICZN. Nomina nuda (the plural form) are invalid, and are therefore not italicized as a proper generic name would be. If the name is later formally published, that name is no longer a nomen nudum and will be italicized on this list. Often, the formally published name will differ from any nomina nuda that describe the same specimen. *Nomen oblitum (Latin for \\"forgotten name\\"): A name that has not been used in the scientific community for more than fifty years after its original proposal. *Preoccupied name: A name that is formally published, but which has already been used for another taxon. This second use is invalid (as are all subsequent uses) and the name must be replaced. As preoccupied names are not valid generic names, they will also go unitalicized on this list. *Nomen dubium (Latin for \\"dubious name\\"): A name describing a fossil with no unique diagnostic features. As this can be an extremely subjective and controversial designation, this term is not used on this list.

It inaugurated the Frog and Toad series, whose four books completed by Lobel comprise five easy-to-read short stories each. It was a Caldecott Honor Book, or runner-up for the American Library Association Caldecott Medal, which recognizes the year's best illustration in an American children's picture book.  Spring  Frog rushes over to Toad's house one fine spring morning in April, but Toad is not eager to get up. Frog eventually gets Toad up out of bed and no sooner does he explain about the whole new year they will have together than Toad decides to go back to bed. Since Toad has slept since November, he asks Frog to come back to wake him up when it is half past May. Not wanting to be lonely until that time, Frog takes advantage of the fact that Toad has not changed his calendar since November and rips off the month pages until he reaches April, but rips off the April page as well and manages to get Toad out of bed to admire the beauty of spring.  The Story  One summer day, Toad notices that Frog is not feeling well and helps him to bed. Frog requests a story, but Toad has difficulty trying to come up with one to tell his friend. In his attempt to think of a story, Toad tries walking up and down the porch, standing on his head, pouring water over his head, and banging his head against the wall, none of which accomplishes anything, but make poor Toad unwell himself. However, by this time, Frog feels better and no longer needs a story. So he allows the sickly Toad to get in bed so he can tell him a story. Frog tells a story detailing what Toad did for him throughout the chapter, but by the time Frog finishes, Toad is already fast asleep.  A Lost Button  After Frog and Toad return from a long walk, Toad notices a button has fallen off his jacket. Retracing their steps, the friends return to the meadow, the woods, and the stream where they had walked. Along the way, they (with help from a sparrow and a raccoon) find five buttons, none of which match the description of Toad's missing button, which was a big round thick white button with four holes. Eventually, Toad, now angry over finding every button, but his, runs home, and discovers his missing button had fallen off before the walk. To make it up to Frog for the wild goose chase, not only does Toad sew his button back on his jacket, but sews on the other buttons they found as well and gives it to Frog the next day.  A Swim  Frog and Toad go down to the stream to go swimming. While Frog doesn't wear a bathing suit to swim, Toad prefers to wear one, but tells Frog not to look at him until he's in the water because he's sensitive about how he looks in his bathing suit. Frog agrees, and they go for their swim. A turtle comes by, prompting Toad to ask Frog to tell the turtle to leave. Frog does tell the turtle to leave, explaining that Toad is insecure about his bathing suit, but several other creatures overhear, and they all become interested to see Toad's bathing suit. Toad decides to stay in the water until everybody leaves, but despite Frog's pleas, no one will. Toad eventually begins to sneeze, and decides he has to get out of the water. As soon as he does, everyone (including Frog) laughs at him, as they think Toad does look funny in his bathing suit. Toad bluntly agrees, and goes home.  The Letter  While coming by Toad's house for a friendly visit, Frog notices Toad looking sad. Toad explains that it is the time when he has to wait for the mail because he never gets any mail. Feeling sad for his friend, Frog goes home, writes a letter addressed to Toad, and asks a snail to deliver the letter to Toad's house. Returning to Toad's house, Frog tries to convince Toad to try again at waiting for the mail, but ends up waiting for it himself. When Toad asks why, Frog mentions the letter and describes what he wrote in it, which cheers up Toad enough to wait for the letter. It takes four days for the snail to reach Toad's house, but he eventually arrives with Toad's letter, and Toad is very happy to know the wait was worth it.

The film stars Frank Ram√≠rez, Florina Lemaitre, Humberto Dorado, Fausto Cabrera and Carlos Vives. The film is a winner of the Berlin International Film Festival and the Biarritz Film Cinema Festival of Latin America. The film deals with the hardships of lower income families in Bogot√°, the breach between rich and poor, and their interactions in a highly stratified social system. The film was selected as the Colombian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 67th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee. Plot The film starts with news reporter Jose Antonio Pupo (played by Carlos Vives) interviewing a man after events have taken place. The man, part of a community of squatters who have taken over a house in Bogot√° which was left derelict, reveals to the journalist that when the absentee landlord reappeared, the very house itself was moved to another location by ingenious means. The man's story is interwoven with the depiction of the events. The building is an old mansion and it has become home to a diverse community of people. After years of occupation, they are suddenly ordered to leave by the owner, a rich, obnoxious man called Dr. Holguin. The inhabitants are confronted by the authorities attempting to perform an eviction, but they lock the doors and shoot at the policemen. After this confrontation, the inhabitants are given more time to find a new place to live. They are legally represented by 'Perro' Romero (Frank Ram√≠rez). Holguin pressures Romero by having him kidnapped and beaten up. Meanwhile, Jacinto (Fausto Cabrera), an intellectual and rebellious Spaniard, devises a way to remove everything inside the house (walls, windows, bathtubs, kitchens, toilets, roofs and so on) and to transport all of it to another location. Jacinto shows Romero how it can be done by using a rope and pulley, using the stage of the Col√≥n theater. Jacinto is able to convince the rest of the inhabitants to help. As the house is being dismantled, Misia Triana (Delfina Guido) accidentally finds the silhouette of the virgin Mary on a wall, which persuades her to help. The squatters are eventually able to remove all the interior of the house, but in order to gain more time, Romero tells Holguin's lawyer Victor Honorio Mosquera (Humberto Dorado) that the tenants wanted to paint the house before they leave. By the time the lawyers, policemen and Dr. Holguin eagerly approach the house to confirm that the tenants have actually left, they are surprised by a huge explosion and the collapse of the house's facade. After the dust and debris have settled, they find a wall painted with the slogan \\"Here's your motherfucking painted house.\\" The movie ends by returning to the journalist Jose interviewing the squatter and finally the former inhabitants are shown gathered on a hill with a panoramic view of Bogot√°.

By focusing upon the inhabitants and their teamwork in moving the house and outwitting the owner, the film exposes the corruption of officials such as judges, police, lawyers and politicians in Colombia.  Production  The film was originally envisioned by Ramon Jimeno as an inspiration based on a story he had read in a newspaper, about the removal of tenants in a house whose legal procedure had taken such a long time that by the time the authorities had to intervene they realized that the house no longer existed. Although Jimeno had envisioned the movie several years before it was screenwriter and actor Humberto Dorado who finally shaped it into a dense 400 pages screenplay, that eventually became the original screenplay and a blueprint for the film. Later after the majority of it was filmed, screenwriter Jorge Goldemberg came as an editing consultant and restructured the film, but it was not only until Nobel Prize Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez saw the pilot of the film and encouraged Sergio Cabrera to continue with the making of the film. Because of budget problems and the lack of support of the Colombian government the film took four years to be fully completed . In fact by the time the Colombian government was actually shutting down the cultural organizations that supported filmmakers such as Focine. The film was shot in Bogot√°'s downtown with several scenes filmed in the depressed areas of the eastern hills. Release The film was released in Colombia on December 23, 1993. The film has won several prizes, it was the winner of the Golden Spike in Valladolid's Film Festival and several others. As of 1994, the film was Colombia‚Äôs largest domestic hit. The film was selected as the Colombian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 67th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  Critical response  The film has been praised by critics. The New York Times called the film \\"a gripping human drama, with ample humor.\\" Variety stated that Cabrera \\"manages to infuse this complex microcosm of Colombian society with dramatic life\\". Looking back in 2015, the Bogot√° Post wrote that the film \\"is considered Cabrera‚Äôs masterpiece and has become one of the shining examples of Colombian cinema\\", classing it as a must-see.

Mosquitos are a vector for several diseases, most notably malaria. In epidemiology, a disease vector is any agent which carries and transmits an infectious pathogen into another living organism; agents regarded as vectors are organisms, such as intermediate parasites or microbes. Arthropods deer tick, a vector for Lyme disease pathogens. Arthropods form a major group of pathogen vectors with mosquitoes, flies, sand flies, lice, fleas, ticks, and mites transmitting a huge number of pathogens. Many such vectors are haematophagous, which feed on blood at some or all stages of their lives. When the insects blood feed, the pathogen enters the blood stream of the host. This can happen in different ways. The Anopheles mosquito, a vector for malaria, filariasis, and various arthropod-borne-viruses (arboviruses), inserts its delicate mouthpart under the skin and feeds on its host's blood. The parasites the mosquito carries are usually located in its salivary glands (used by mosquitoes to anaesthetise the host). Therefore, the parasites are transmitted directly into the host's blood stream. Pool feeders such as the sand fly and black fly, vectors for pathogens causing leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis respectively, will chew a well in the host's skin, forming a small pool of blood from which they feed. Leishmania parasites then infect the host through the saliva of the sand fly. Onchocerca force their own way out of the insect's head into the pool of blood. Triatomine bugs are responsible for the transmission of a trypanosome, Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas Disease. The Triatomine bugs defecate during feeding and the excrement contains the parasites which are accidentally smeared into the open wound by the host responding to pain and irritation from the bite. Plants and fungi Some plants and fungi act as vectors for various pathogens. For example, the big- vein disease of lettuce was long thought to be caused by a member of the fungal division Chytridiomycota, namely Olpidium brassicae. Eventually however, the disease was shown to be viral. Later it transpired that the virus was transmitted by the zoospores of the fungus and also survived in the resting spores. Since then, many other fungi in the Chytridiomycota have been shown to vector plant viruses. Many plant pests that seriously damage important crops depend on other plants, often weeds, to harbour or vector them; the distinction is not always clear. In the case of Puccinia graminis for example, Berberis and related genera act as alternate hosts in a cycle of infection of grain. More directly, when they twine from one plant to another, parasitic plants such as Cuscuta and Cassytha have been shown to convey phytoplasmal and viral diseases between plants.Haynes, A R. et al. Comparison of two parasitic vines: Dodder (Cuscuta) and Woe vine(Cassytha). Florida Dept Agric & Consumer Services. Division of Plant Industry. Botany Circular No. 30. January/February 1996  World Health Organization and vector-borne disease  The World Health Organization (WHO) states that control and prevention of vector-borne diseases are emphasizing \\"Integrated Vector Management (IVM)\\", which is an approach that looks at the links between health and environment, optimizing benefits to both. In April 2014, WHO launched a campaign called ‚ÄúSmall bite, big threat‚Äù to educate people about vector-borne illnesses. WHO issued reports indicating that vector-borne illnesses affect poor people, especially people living in areas that do not have adequate levels of sanitation, drinking water and housing. Vector-borne zoonotic disease and human activity Figure 1. This figure shows how the Flavivirus is carried by mosquitos in the West Nile Virus and Dengue fever. The mosquito would be considered a disease vector. Several articles, recent to early 2014, warn that human activities are spreading vector-borne zoonotic diseases. Several articles were published in the medical journal The Lancet, and discuss how rapid changes in land use, trade globalization, and \\"social upheaval\\" are causing a resurgence in zoonotic disease across the world. Examples of vector- borne zoonotic diseases include: * Lyme disease * Plague * West Nile virus Many factors affect the incidence of vector-borne diseases. These factors include animals hosting the disease, vectors, and people.

An assault gun variant was also proposed. By the end of the war, a single prototype chassis of the E-100 had been produced, and it was only partially completed. After the war, the prototype was shipped to the United Kingdom for trials, but was later scrapped. Development E-100 Chassis The basic design was ordered by the Waffenamt as a parallel development to the Porsche Maus in June 1943. It was the heaviest of the Entwicklung (E) series of vehicles, meant to standardize as many components as possible. The proposed designs were the E-10, E-25, E-50, E-75 and finally the E-100. In March 1944, the Adler company in Frankfurt submitted blueprint 021A38300 for a super-heavy tank called E-100, after the tank was proposed in April 1943 along with the other Entwicklung series vehicles.Merriam Press, World War 2 In Review: German Fighting Vehicles, Issue 2, October 2019, , hyperlink According to the blueprints, the tank would be armed with a both a 150 mm gun and a 75 mm gun. Two types of engines were proposed: one was a 700 hp Maybach HL230, with a transmission and turning mechanism borrowed from the Tiger II. The estimated top speed was 23 km/h. The second variant would have a new 1200 hp Maybach engine and a top speed estimated at 40 km/h. The design had removable side skirts and narrow transport tracks to make rail transport more viable. This design was very similar to the original 'Tiger-Maus' proposal, but had larger 900 mm diameter road wheels and a new spring based suspension rather than the original torsion bars. A new turret was designed; intended to be simpler and lighter than the Maus turret. Permission was given to produce the tank based on the potential use of the E-100 as a tank destroyer (Jagdpanzer) with either a 15 cm StuK L/63 or 17 cm StuK L/53 gun. In July 1944 Hitler ordered the development of super heavy tanks to stop. Work on the E-100 continued at a very low priority, with only three Adler employees available to assemble the prototype. The first prototype was never fully completed and was found by the 751st Field Artillery Battalion of the American forces in April 1945. The partially completed vehicle was taken by the British Army for evaluation and then scrapped in the 1950s. File:E-100a.jpgBritish forces captured the prototype in 1945, shown here on a trailer.

The Bracci-Cambini family represents many centuries of Italian history (IX¬∞ Sec.). The archives of the family have provided historians and professors with an example of the heredity rules in the high nobility in the 18th and 19th centuries. Therefore, several academic books and articles have been written about the family, including In famiglia: Storie di interessi e affetti nell‚ÄôItalia moderna by Roberto Bizzocchi and Il Casino dei Nobili: Famiglie illustri, viaggiatori, mondanit√† a Pisa tra Sette e Ottecent by Alessandro Panajia with Giovanni Benvenuti. The family coat of arms can still be seen in the Florentine Basilica of Santa Maria Novella near the altar of Saint Antonino. The Bracci Cambini family still live in Tuscany and Lazio. One member of the family was Atanasio Bracci-Cambini dei marchesi Pigliu, who joined the troops of Garibaldi in the 1860 war against the King while he was a student at the University of Pisa. The response of the family was not supportive. Sister Zoe, a nun by the name of Maddelena Luisa, wrote: \\"This blow has hit me hard; I knew that the poor devil was a hothead, but I never imagined he would go this far\\". Even a Cardinal, on January 4, 1861, wrote: \\"It will not be the last tidying up of the corrupt, the madman coming to his senses\\" (translated from Bizzocchi). An earlier member of the family was Leonardo. His epitaph (1742) read: > To Leonardo Bracci Cambini, citizen of Florence and Pisa, who after having > travelled in many countries by land and by sea, finally returned home, > subsequently showered with various offices in Pisa, he was finally put in > charge of the Naval Consulate.

It was commissioned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Arts for Transit program for US$200,000 ‚Äî one percent of the station's reconstruction budget. This program has commissioned more than 170 permanent works of art for public transportation facilities the MTA owns and operates. This work is one of the most popular artworks in the subway system. Description and history The installation is a series of whimsical miniature bronze sculptures depicting cartoon like characters showing people and animals in various situations, and additional abstract sculptures, which are dispersed throughout the station platforms and passageways. Otterness said the subject of the work is \\"the impossibility of understanding life in New York\\" and describes the arrangement of the individual pieces as being ‚Äúscattered in little surprises.‚Äù Art critic Olympia Lambert wrote that \\"the lovable bronze characters installed there are joined together by a common theme of implied criminality mixed with an undercurrent of social anarchy,\\" but labeled them as \\"too cute\\", saying that this \\"undercuts the work's more critical edge.\\" Many of the figures have moneybag heads, and Otterness credits 19th century political cartoonist Thomas Nast's depiction of Boss Tweed and the corruption of Tammany Hall that was ongoing at the time of the subway's initial construction as his inspiration for these. One of the larger pieces depicts a sewer alligator, as described by reporter Michael Rundle: \\"There is a bronze alligator on the Eighth Avenue and 14th Street subway platform, wearing a suit and tie. A -high bronze man ‚Äî also wearing a suit and tie ‚Äî is struggling to escape his powerful jaws. Watching the scene, aside from throngs of L train riders, is another figure. He stands beside his stricken friend, hands clasped behind his back, as if to say: 'I told you not to get so close'.‚Äù Otterness' sculpture has been praised for its appeal to all ages. The New York Times published a 2003 account describing the interaction of a 4-year old boy with the sewer alligator. After jumping on the alligator's head and trying to wrestle the little man from his bronze jaws, the observer notes that the boy, \\"about to give up, he kicked the alligator, his foot connecting solidly with the bronze head. Surprise spread across his face as he ran away, crying, 'Mom, it tried to bite me!'.\\" Otterness became so obsessed with this project, that he delivered more than four times the amount of artwork he was originally commissioned to produce. His wife finally made him end expansion of the collection by imploring him to stop \\"giving away our daughter's whole inheritance\\". The complete series encompasses more than 100 individual pieces. Some of the individual pieces were put on public display in 1996 on the southeast corner of Central Park at Grand Army Plaza, and then in Battery Park City in Lower Manhattan in 1997, to get public reaction prior to its installation originally scheduled for 1998. Approximately 25 of the pieces were finally installed at the end of 2000. with the balance installed in the following years. The entire project took 10 years from commissioning to the final completion of the installation.

Chichester bought himself out of his record deal with Columbia Records and his wife, Laura, founded PopFly Records and signed Chichester as her first artist. In 2001, the label released its first CD, Howlin' Maggie's Hyde. Chichester recruited guitarist Lance Ellison, former Royal Crescent Mob drummer Carlton Smith, and bassist Christian Hurd. After two US tours in support of the album, Happy decided to take a solo approach and disbanded Howlin' Maggie. Although they played their last shows in the summer of 2002,The AllMusic Guide Howlin' Maggie reunited for a single show in Columbus, Ohio on November 24, 2010. Proceeds for the show was to benefit a children's charities and memorial fund established after the passing of a local DJ, CD101's Andy \\"Andyman\\" Davis. = Solo = After Howlin' Maggie, Chichester continued to write songs and play live. In 2002 Shawn Smith invited Happy to support his band Brad on their national tour and open all the shows. The experience was inspiring, and Chichester began to periodically hit the road to see how audiences reacted to his new songs, while spending his days off the road in his studio to record his first solo album. A performance at the Aladdin Theater in Portland, Oregon, on March 28, 2003 (which was recorded for the price of a pint of beer) became an underground hit. He had recorded and produced a limited, numbered pressing of the show in Portland, copies of which were eventually selling on eBay for $50. Eventually, the live album was officially released through PopFly Music. Lovers Come Back, Happy's first full-length studio solo album, was released by PopFly Music on February 14, 2007. In support of the album, he headed out on an extensive tour of the United States and Europe (while opening for RJD2) to promote the album. He continues to tour and record as a solo artist to a growing and cultish underground following.

Biography Warner joined the Army from his birth city in January 1943,WWII Army Enlistment Records and by December 20, 1944 was serving as a Corporal in the Antitank Company of the 2nd Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division. During a battle on that day, near B√ºtgenbach, Belgium, Warner continued to man his anti-tank gun through the night and into the next morning, despite intense fire from the approaching German tanks. He successfully disabled several enemy tanks before being killed in action. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor six months later, on June 23, 1945. The now defunct Warner Barracks complex was appropriated in 1950 by U.S. forces and renamed in honor of Cpl. Henry F. Warner.

She is most notable for her position as principal flutist of the New York Philharmonic for over 15 years, she decided to play the flute when she was only nine years old, as an author (Orchestral Excerpts for Flute with Piano Accompaniment), and as a professor and master teacher. Previous positions include professor of flute at the Juilliard School, Manhattan School of Music, New England conservatory and Carnegie Mellon University. She received the National Flute Association's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006. She has been credited with \\"upholding an increasingly higher standard of artistic excellence for the flute.\\" Biography Jeanne Baxtresser was born August 2, 1947 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania to Earl and Margaret (Barthel) Baxtresser. The eldest of six children, Baxtresser was surrounded by music in her childhood as her mother was an award-winning concert pianist. She began piano lessons from an early age but called her piano debut \\"a disaster.\\" She began playing the flute at age 10 and quickly realized it was the instrument for her. By this time, the family had moved to Minneapolis where a family friend began giving her flute lessons. She quickly progressed in these lessons and began studying with Emil Opava, then of the Minnesota Orchestra. During these years, Baxtresser also attended the Interlochen National Music Camp and Academy. She made her orchestral debut at age 14 with the Minnesota Orchestra. Baxtresser auditioned and was accepted into the Juilliard School of Music in New York City, starting in 1965. She studied with Julius Baker for four years, working with many of the influential composers and colleagues of the time, including conductor Leonard Slatkin, and pianists Emanuel Ax, Garrick Ohlsson, and Jeffrey Siegle. During her final year at Juilliard, Baxtresser won the position of Principal Flutist of the Montreal Symphony in 1969, and shortly after was hired as professor of flute at McGill University in Montreal. She was subsequently appointed Principal Flute of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in 1976, before being invited by Music Director Zubin Mehta to join the New York Philharmonic in 1981. The first female principal flute of the New York Philharmonic, Baxtresser appeared as soloist with the New York Philharmonic on more than fifty occasions, and has been featured as a soloist across North America and Europe. She retired from the New York Philharmonic in 1998, to focus on full time teaching. While in New York, Baxtresser served on the faculties of the Juilliard School from 1985-2011 and the Manhattan School of Music from 1990-2001. In 1998, she was appointed the Vira I. Heinz Professor of Flute at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. In all of these positions, she has attracted many outstanding flute students from around the world. Baxtresser's exceptional career as a recitalist, concerto soloist, and chamber musician has produced numerous recordings, including New York Legends - Jeanne Baxtresser (Cala), Jeanne Baxtresser‚ÄîA Collection of My Favorites (MSR Classics), and Chamber Music for Flute (Cala), featuring her performances with principal players of the New York Philharmonic. She has recorded works under the baton of such legendary conductors as Leonard Bernstein, Zubin Mehta and Kurt Masur. In addition to performing and teaching, Baxtresser has released an immensely important work entitled Orchestral Excerpts for Flute with Piano Accompaniment (Theodore Presser), with a companion CD, Orchestral Excerpts for Flute with Spoken Commentary (Summit Records). This work has become a vital part of flute pedagogy, as her narration of the excerpts make it possible for students of all levels to receive her coaching. A subsequent book, Great Flute Duos from the Orchestral Repertoire, was named the 2004 winner of the National Flute Association‚Äôs Newly Published Music Competition and has quickly become a part of standard pedagogical repertoire. Recipient of the National Flute Association‚Äôs Lifetime Achievement Award for significant, lasting contributions to the flute world, Baxtresser was also awarded the National Medal of Arts from the Interlochen Center for the Arts and at Carnegie Mellon was named \\"University Professor,\\" the University‚Äôs most distinguished professorial position. It is awarded to those individuals who have achieved exceptional international recognition. She is recognized internationally as a leading recording artist, author, and lecturer.  Personal life  Baxtresser is married to bassoonist David H. Carroll in 1976, after the two met while working together in the Montreal Symphony Orchestra.

A putter is a club used in the sport of golf to make relatively short and low-speed strokes with the intention of rolling the ball into the hole from a short distance away. It is differentiated from the other clubs (typically, irons and woods) by a clubhead with a very flat, low- profile, low-loft striking face, and by other features which are only allowed on putters, such as bent shafts, non-circular grips, and positional guides. Putters are generally used from very close distances to the cup, generally on the putting green, though certain courses have fringes and roughs near the green which are also suitable for putting. While no club in a player's bag is absolutely indispensable nor required to be carried by strict rules, the putter comes closest. It is a highly specialized tool for a specific job, and virtually no golfer is without one. Design Stacy Lewis putting at the 2010 British Open. Putting is the most precise aspect of the game of golf. The putter must be designed to give the golfer every technical advantage including smooth stroke, good glide, sweet impact, and bounce-less topspin ball launch as well as every technique advantage including perfect fit as to shaft angle and length. The striking face of a putter is usually not perpendicular to the ground: putters have a small amount of loft, intended to \\"lift\\" the ball out of any depression it has made or settled into on the green, which reduces bouncing. This loft is typically 5‚Äì6¬∞, and by strict rules cannot be more than 10¬∞. The putter is the only club that may have a grip that is not perfectly round; \\"shield\\"-like cross-sections with a flat top and curved underside are most common. The putter is also the only club allowed to have a bent shaft; often, club-makers will attach the shaft to the club-head on the near edge for visibility, but to increase stability, the shaft is bent near the clubhead mounting so that its lie and the resulting clubhead position places the line of the straight part of the shaft at the sweet spot of the subhead, where the ball should be for the best putt. This increases accuracy as the golfer can direct their swing through the ball, without feeling like they are slightly behind it. Many putters also have an offset hosel, which places the shaft of the club in line with the center of the ball at impact, again to improve stability and feel as, combined with the vertical bend, the shaft will point directly into the center of the ball at impact. Historically putters were known as \\"putting cleeks\\" and were made entirely from woods such as beech, ash and hazel. In the 1900s putters heads evolved, with iron club heads becoming a more popular design. The design of the putter's club head has undergone radical changes since the late 1950s. Putters were originally a forged iron piece very similar in shape to the irons of the day. One of the first to apply scientific principles to golf club design was engineer Karsten Solheim. In 1959 instead of attaching the shaft at the heel of the blade, Solheim attached it in the center, transferring much of the weight of the club head to the perimeter. Previously club design had been based largely on trial and error. Through attempts to lower the center of gravity of the club head, it evolved into a shorter, thicker head slightly curved from front to rear (the so-called \\"hot dog\\" putter). The introduction of investment casting for club heads allowed drastically different shapes to be made far more easily and cheaply than with forging, resulting in several design improvements. First of all, the majority of mass behind the clubface was placed as low as possible, resulting in an L-shaped side profile with a thin, flat club face and another thin block along the bottom of the club behind the face. Additionally, peripheral weighting, or the placing of mass as far away from the center of the clubface as possible, increases the moment of inertia of the club head, reducing twisting if the club contacts the ball slightly off-center and thus giving the club a larger \\"sweet spot\\" with which to contact the ball. Newer innovations include replacing the metal at the \\"sweet spot\\" with a softer metal or polymer compound that will give and rebound at impact, which increases the peak impulse (force \\\\times time) imparted to the ball for better distance. Putters are subdivided into mallet, peripheral weighted and blade styles. Power instability and practice/play convertibility are features embodied in the latest putter design technology. Variations =Long-shaft putters= Though most putters have a shaft (slightly shorter for most ladies and juniors, longer for most men), putters are also made with longer shaft lengths and grips, and are designed to reduce the \\"degrees of freedom\\" allowed a player when he or she putts. Simply, the more joints that can easily bend or twist during the putting motion, the more degrees of freedom a player has when putting, which gives more flexibility and feel but can result in more inconsistent putts. With a normal putter, the player has six degrees of freedom: hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, waist and knees, all of which can be moved just slightly to affect the path of the ball and likely prevent a putt from falling in the cup. Such motions, especially nervous uncontrollable motions, are called \\"yips\\", and having a chronic case of the \\"yips\\" can ruin a golfer's short game. German professional golfer Bernhard Langer is famous for having such a severe case that he once needed four putts to hole out from within three feet of the cup. A belly putter is typically about longer than a normal putter and is designed to be \\"anchored\\" against the abdomen of the player. This design reduces or removes the importance of the hands, wrists, elbows, and shoulders. A long putter is even longer and is designed to be anchored from the chest or even the chin and similarly reduces the impact of the hands, wrists, elbows and shoulders. The disadvantages are decreased feel and control over putting power, especially with the long putter. Their use in professional tournaments is hotly contested; Jim Furyk and others on the pro tours including Langer and Vijay Singh have used belly putters at some point with a marked improvement of their short game, while players like Tiger Woods and officials like former USGA technical director Frank Thomas have condemned it as conferring an unfair advantage on users. In November 2012, a proposed change for the 2016 edition of the rules of golf was announced, which would forbid players from anchoring a club against their body in any way. This rule change will affect the use of long and belly putters by players. Notable players affected include Adam Scott, Tim Clark, Kevin Stadler, Keegan Bradley, Webb Simpson, Carl Pettersson and Ernie Els. This new rule (14-1b Anchoring the Club) was approved in May 2013 and took effect on January 1, 2016. This new rule prohibits \\"anchoring\\" a putter when making a stroke. It does not ban long-shafted putters, rather, it bans the method by which they were originally designed to be used. =Fetch Mallet= Called a fetch putter because it can be used to retrieve the golf ball out of the cup. In November of 2018 Lee Westwood won the Nedbank Golf Challenge using a PING Sigma 2 Fetch putter.

The text is about Vlad II Dracul, the father of Dracula. \\"We Came to Take Your Souls\\" tells about a war between Romania and the Ottoman Empire under Vlad III Dracula. \\"Kiss of the Cobra King\\" tells a story about a wolf, which fights against a snake. The story is about the war between Romania and the Ottoman Empire that was already being dealt with in We Came to Take Your Souls. According to older interviews, this is an old Romanian legend; the biography of The History of Heresy I, on the other hand, claims that the idea arose during a rehearsal session when Attila Dorn ordered a pop-up pop group to be quiet, otherwise they would be \\"bitten by the Cobra King.\\" \\"Demons & Diamonds\\" criticizes the impact of the pursuit of power and wealth. \\"Montecore\\" is about the white tiger, who in 2003 had seriously injured the magician Roy Horn. \\"The Evil Made Me Do It\\" and \\"Lucifer in Starlight\\" have strong influences of the doom metal and are a tribute to Black Sabbath. \\"Lucifer in Starlight\\" deals with the fascination for the devil. \\"Son of the Morning Star\\" does not include guitar, drums or bass unlike the rest of the album.

It provided compulsory services at a price affordable to poorer people to enable them to travel to find work. It is one of the Railway Regulation Acts 1840 to 1893.The Short Titles Act 1896, section 2(1) and Schedule 2 The prior situation Until that time there were three or more classes of carriage, third class usually an open goods wagon, often without seats, sometimes referred to sarcastically as \\"Stanhopes\\", a corruption of \\"Stand-ups\\". During that year, a select committee had produced six reports on the railways, at the behest of the Board of Trade under its president, W. E. Gladstone. These led to An Act to attach certain Conditions to the construction of future Railways authorised by any Act of the present or succeeding sessions of Parliament; and for other Purposes in relation to Railways, referred to as \\"Gladstone's Act\\" or the \\"1844 Railway Regulation Act\\". The original bill introduced into Parliament by W. E. Gladstone had been far-reaching for its time - even proposing state ownership of the railways and telegraph. Although nothing so revolutionary passed into law, his Act is remembered for provisions that: * One train with provision for carrying third-class passengers, should run on every line, every week day, in each direction, stopping at every station. (These are what were originally known as \\"Parliamentary Trains.\\") * The fare should be 1d. per mile. * Its average speed should not be less than . * Third-class passengers should be protected from the weather and be provided with seats. In return the railway operator was exempted from duty on third class passengers. The price was not cheap for working people. An additional requirement was that they should be allowed to carry of luggage free. It helped those in search of work thus, as Smith Smith, D.N., (1988) The Railway and its Passengers: A Social History Newton Abbott: David and Charles points out, its benefit was to improve labour supply. Rail company reaction The reaction of many railway companies was grudging acceptance of the letter, if not the spirit of the legislation, and they provided the minimum one train per day with facilities for third class passengers at an unpopular time such as early morning or late at night. These were the original Parliamentary trains. The reason for the reluctance was to avoid losing revenue if passengers who could afford to travel second class switched to third if facilities there became bearable.Ellis, Hamilton., (1965) Railway Carriages In The British Isles From 1830-1914 Some companies continued to run inferior third or fourth class trains in addition to the minimum standard parliamentary train. The Midland Railway broke ranks by providing three compartments, glazed windows and an oil lamp in the roof, causing resentment among competitors. Finally in 1875 the standard of third class was upgraded and second class was abolished - by relabelling the coaches. It caused scandal now difficult to imagine. In the 1800s there was rigid distinction between social classes and the belief was that the railway would bring \\"the 'lower orders' nearer to equality with their 'betters' \\" Vaughan, A., (1997) Railwaymen, Politics and Money, London: John Murray Sir James Allport, general manager of the Midland Railway, in a speech said \\"If there is one part of my public life on which I look back with more satisfaction, it is with reference to the boon we conferred on third-class travellers...\\" Other railways followed, and because they were obliged to provide third class, the oddity of first and third, but no second ‚Äî except on boat trains - persisted into the 20th century, when third class was rebranded in 1956, and then further rebranded as 'standard' to remove negative associations.

The festival takes place on a location that emulates a historical 16th century village (Albright) in England during the 1565 fall harvest festival. Renaissance fairs began in the 1960s in California. The Louisiana Renaissance Festival started in 2000 and explores Subcultural movements in Renaissance art, crafts, music, and theatre. Cast members are dressed as people would have been dressed during the 1560s. The local cast at LARF is composed of enthusiasts from all over southeast Louisiana. The cast members regularly interact with the patrons of the fair and have been known to try to marry them, dance with them, bring patrons into random shows, and other mischief. The cast members dress in renaissance inspired clothing. Females wear an underskirt or petticoat with an outer skirt and accessories such as collars. Males wear knee length trousers, stockings, and a shirt. LARF features seven stages with day-long interactive entertainment. There are over 100 merchants offering hand crafted wares. These merchants also provide renaissance clothing, perfumes, ceramic horns, jewelry, and other distinct 16th century gift options. The festival includes much food, drink, treats and spirits‚Äîboth modern and historical. Foods such as jester chips, bread bowls, turkey legs, and gourmet mushrooms are served. There is also a large \\"living village\\" reenactment with live cast members ready to show visitors a glimpse of pre-industrial life. While still small in comparison to other older renaissance festivals including the neighboring giant Texas Renaissance Festival whose open season partly overlaps LARF, LARF enjoys a reputation of hospitality that has built a strong base of loyal visitors from all over the country. LARF was opened in 2000 to become Louisiana's first public annual renaissance festival. It opens the first weekend in November and runs for the following six weeks, including the Friday after Thanksgiving. LARF is also the last renaissance festival of the year-long season and ends the season with a closing gate jam and firework display over the lake. In 2002 LARF received an award for best New Event of the Year Division,http://www.la-renfest.com/ and it has been selected twice as one of the Southeast Tourism Society's TOP 20 Events in the Southeast.

It was re-released in November 2007 under the title Blink of an Eye, featuring new content and a more expedient storyline. It follows two main characters from a 3rd person perspective. Blink is set in the modern-day United States and in the Middle East, and features a Christian fiction perspective. Plot summary Protagonist Seth Border is a college student who has one of the world's highest IQs. One day he begins developing a tremendous skill: the ability to see multiple possible futures. This ability first manifests itself for a few seconds at a time, and gradually exponentiates into an ability to see millions of possibilities that could happen hours and days later. Little does Seth know that when he is thrown together with a Saudi princess, Miriam Al-Asamm, who flees her country to escape oppression, he will soon have the adventure of his life as they explore the truth about Christianity and Seth's gift of precognition while running for their lives. Link to Christianity The initial reference to Christianity in the novel occurs near the beginning, when Seth proves to his professor that God does not exist by using logic. Controversy emerges when Seth comes to believe that his visions of multiple possibilities prove there is no all-knowing God. Throughout the story, Seth struggles with the truth of God's existence and eventually finds that because God exists outside of time, there can logically be multiple futures. Sequel Dekker once stated that a sequel was brewing, but in February 2010, Erin Healy, Ted's editor and co-author, mentioned that the book has been put on hold. In 2011, Healy stated in a fan interview that the probability of a sequel ever being finished is slim to none.Reuben Horst's Blog: An Interview with Erin Healy. Retrieved 01/27/2011.

It is the first book in the Circle Series, and is a part of the Books of History Chronicles. The book was published in 2004 by Thomas Nelson. Plot This book is about a man named Thomas Hunter in Denver, Colorado, 2010, who, after being knocked unconscious from a bullet wound to the head, wakes up to find himself in a strange world full of black, twisted trees. After being attacked by evil bats called Shataiki and led out of the Black Forest by a white bat, he is rendered unconscious again due to blood loss. He wakes up to find himself back in Denver. Startled at the sudden change, he can‚Äôt figure out which world is real. He soon discovers that every time he falls asleep, he wakes up in the other world, until he falls asleep there. Outside of the Black Forest is the Colored Forest, a paradise inhabited by a civilization of immortal-yet innocent-human beings who are watched over by Elyon, a God-like being, along with white, bat-like Roush, who are opposites of the Shataiki and act as servants of Elyon. Thomas eventually finds out that this other world is our own thousands of years in the future, and that a virus, mutated from the Raison vaccine, would wipe out his present-day Earth later that year. Thomas is forced to fight evil in both worlds, a difficult prospect, for while evil is portrayed differently in each reality, it is equally as potent, and Thomas quickly finds that putting a stop to an event of apocalyptic proportions is no easy task.http://allreaders.com/book-review-summary/black-22576 Characters * Thomas Hunter: a 20-year-old man living in Denver, Colorado.

Symbolism The tale in Black represents the story of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden, although there are many more than two people living in the paradise on Other Earth. Elyon represents God (\\"Elyon\\" is one of the various names of God), Teeleh represents Satan, the Shataiki represent Demons, the Roush represent Angels (particularly Michael and Gabriel), and the character Tanis represents Adam. The healing water represents the Holy Spirit. The title, \\"Black\\", refers to the color of the Shataiki and the \\"Black Forest\\", in contrast to the luminescent colored forest, but more importantly black is the color commonly associated with sinners' hearts in the Christian tradition, and of the world before Jesus Christ came to heal the curse of Adam. Genesis: The Birth of an Idea As part of a promotional campaign called \\"Share the Love\\" in which participants would preorder three or more copies of Dekker's then-newest book, The Priest's Graveyard, he offered various incentives.

It is the second book in the Circle Series, and is a part of the Books of History Chronicles. Plot summary In Red: The Heroic Rescue, Thomas has spent fifteen years in the \\"dream world,\\" having been persuaded by his wife Rachelle to eat the \\"Rhambutan\\" fruit which will prevent him from dreaming. Only seven hours have passed in the world of Earth, but the plague has been released in several cities. Followers of Elyon live in the seven forests. The deserts outside of the forests are home to the Horde, with a much larger population than the forests. Members of the Horde (individually referred to as \\"Scabs\\") are subject to the degenerative skin disease of the fallen world and are constantly trying to conquer and destroy the inhabitants of the forest. They worship Teeleh, carrying banners with images of the Shataiki. Thomas is referred to as \\"General Thomas of Hunter\\" and is commander of the Forest Guard, and a legendary figure among the Forest Dwellers and the Horde alike. However, as the story unfolds, it is revealed that the Horde also have a legendary General emerging known as Martyn. One whose strategies are bolder and cleverer, and have yet to be seen by the Forest Guard. In the forests, the people keep Elyon's seven rules but have added to them, scrupulously trying to make it as difficult as possible to violate the actual rules. Interpretation of the rules is vested in a priest-like figure named Ciphus, from the Southern Forest. Members of the Horde are allowed to come and become part of the forest dwellers, but this is actively discouraged as Ciphus has determined there is not enough water in the lakes to support a much larger population. This is generally not an issue, as the skin disease of the Horde makes any contact with water agonizingly painful, and the Horde view themselves as \\"normal\\" and the forest dwellers as \\"defective.\\" Occasionally, however, a Horde member will be washed, as is the case with a wise village elder named Jeremiah. Also, forest dwellers who go too long without bathing in Elyon's water begin to develop the skin disease, eventually losing the ability to think rationally and becoming members of the Horde. The Forest Guard has developed extensive procedures for carrying bathing water with them while on patrol in order to try to prevent this. Justin is a former member of the Forest Guard under Thomas. When Thomas offered him the rank of second in command, Justin declined and left the Forest Guard entirely. The young woman Mikil become Thomas' second in command. Justin begins to anger the leadership of the forest dwellers by his unorthodox ideas. It is revealed that Justin always seems to be clean of the disease even when he seems to have been unable to bathe. Justin attempts to broker a peace between the Horde and the forest dwellers, on one occasion speaking with Martyn in the middle of a battle to secure the safety of the Southern Forests Guard and their leader Jamous, (who is in love with Mikil) and to encourage good will between the two cultures. However, Justin is betrayed and sentenced to death by the leadership under Ciphus. Initially he is forced into a Gladiator-style face off against Thomas of Hunter. Justin exhibits equal if not superior skills in sword and hand-to-hand combat though he never harms Thomas. As Justin emerges the victor he leaves the arena and greets a waiting Martyn at the crest of the arena to a shocked audience. As Thomas signals his guard to move in on Justin and Martyn, Thomas himself confronts them face-to-face. When he draws his sword on Martyn he is horrified to discover Martyn to be the once innocent Johan, Thomas' brother- in-law. Johan had once been part of the guard under Thomas' command and was assumed to have been killed in battle when in fact he became stranded and the disease took him. Later, it is shown that Justin is Elyon in an adult form. Thomas doesn't makes a deal with Johan to pretend that Justin had betrayed both the Forest and the Horde, so that they can have him killed. A Horde Army is encroaching on the Forest, and demands the right to carry out the execution as they consider Justin to have betrayed them, too. Justin is sentenced to death with the Horde's most feared form of execution: drowning in water. He is first hung over the lake and beaten until his bones are broken and he is severely disfigured. Mysteriously, during his drowning, Justin's body begins to be covered with the Horde skin disease. Upon his death, Johan in a fit of rage attacks Justin and thrusts his sword into him. Justin's blood pours into the lake, violating Elyon's prohibition about blood entering the water. The next day, the water itself has turned blood red and the forest dwellers are all completely infected with the skin disease. Yet Justin's dead body cannot be found in the depths of the lake. Thomas's wife Rachelle remembers a command Justin had once given her to \\"follow me\\". First she, Thomas, Johan, and then others including both forest dwellers and members of the Horde, give up their lives in the red water, finding that they, too, are returned to life and completely cleansed of the skin disease. In fact, these new followers of Elyon through Justin discover that they need never be cleansed again: they are immune to the skin disease. Meanwhile, the leadership of the former forest dwellers have been corrupted by the disease and merge the religions of Elyon and Teeleh, inviting the Horde to come dwell in the forest. The sacrifice of drowning in the red water is unthinkable to those infected with the disease, and they view the cleansed people as defective \\"albinos.\\" The \\"albinos\\" flee for their lives into the desert. On the way, however, Rachelle is shot with three arrows and dies. There, Justin himself meets them and excitedly proclaims his happiness over them. He proclaims the new group to be his \\"Circle\\" (a symbol of marriage dating back to the days of the colored forest) and to be his \\"bride,\\" and ecstatically thanks his father for what he calls his \\"beautiful bride,\\" referring to God as his \\"father.\\" Justin reveals to the Circle that they will find more red pools hidden in the desert and that for the rest of their lives they will be his and will be charged with the mission of saving as many members of the Horde as possible by inviting them to drown in the pools. The title \\"Red\\" thus refers to the color of the blood shed by Justin to redeem his followers from the Fall, and to the blood-red pools in which his followers give up their lives in order to be reborn as Justin's people.  Themes  Major themes that are included in red are much like C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia and in the Christian Bible in the following ways: Good v. Evil: Followers of Elyon must deal with and combat against the Horde. Sacrifice of Messianic Image: Justin is much like Jesus from the New Testament of the Christian Holy Bible. Jesus is killed and betrayed by the ones he has come to save, but after dying to their own desires and following Him, people are able to obtain true freedom and eternal life in heaven. He is also similar to Aslan and similar to Aslan's sacrifice in The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, Justin's sacrifice is indicative that he is out to redeem the entire other earth. Freedom from Law: The adding to the seven commandments is much like the Jewish practicing. In this case it becomes incredibly hard to do what is said, because of all other interpretations. Justin's drowning dissolves this.

It is the third book of four in the Circle series. Plot The Circle resides in the deserts, able to survive by the aid of Johan (formerly Martyn). During a council meeting, the new commander of the Horde armies, Woref, orchestrates an invasion on Thomas' tribe. Thomas, Suzan, William and the brothers Stephen and Cain ride towards the army, leading their capture. Qurong, the Horde leader, takes his prisoners before his wife Patricia and daughter Chelise. Qurong announces that Chelise is to be wed to Woref. Thomas appeals to Qurong and Chelise's desire to learn the Books of Histories, knowing that the Horde cannot read them while members of The Circle can. Chelise pleads for Thomas to be spared on the basis that it would be more humiliating to be made her servant. The group is returned to their tribe and greeted by William, who informs them that the Horde has attacked. They have killed ten members of the Circle, wounded others, and taken 24 prisoners. In Ancient Earth. Thomas has turned Carlos by allowing him to sleep while in contact with his blood, where Carlos dreams of the other reality as Johan. He decides to join with Thomas in an effort to stop Svensson and Fortier from executing their plans: Only releasing the antivirus to a small list of people they deemed worthy. America has turned its naval fleet, airforce and nuclear arsenal over to the French, as a last-ditch effort to resist Thomas and high-ranking U.S., British and Israeli officials order the USS Nimitz to sink the fleet. When Thomas returns to Washington D.C., he meets with President Blair, Monique and his sister Kara at Genetrix Labs to check on the antivirus progress, but the only feasible cure is through his blood. It instantly eradicates the virus, and Monique and Kara believe it to be because he swam in Elyon's lake and breathed the water in effectively making his blood immune. He mounts his horse and rides around them with his sword in the sand symbolically carving a circle. He leaves them with the Roshuim in pursuit. In the few days since Chelise drowned in the red water, 5,000 Scabs followed in pursuit of Elyons gift through Justin.  Thematic Elements  Eschatological Implications: The return of Justin is an analogy of the return of Christ, similar to Aslan and Aslan's How, only in this case being in the desert of the other earth. True Love: Between Thomas and Chelise, it is shown what actual love looks like and how that works itself out. Their relationship also symbolizes Christ's/God's love for humanity.

Originally a series of reservoirs built by the West India Dock Company and completed in 1828, Poplar Dock was converted into a railway dock, in the days before any of London's enclosed dock systems were connected to the railway network. The dock was built by the East & West India Docks and Birmingham Junction Railway Company (later the North London Railway Company) and connected to the company's goods yard at Chalk Farm. It was alone among the docks to remain outside the control of the Port of London Authority in 1909, and remained in the ownership of British Rail until closure in 1981. Because of its lack of a direct connection to the river, its operators needed the agreement of the owners of the West India Docks for uses which did not compete directly with their interests. In its early years the dock was used mainly to import coal from the Northeast of England.'Poplar Dock: Historical development', Survey of London: volumes 43 and 44: Poplar, Blackwall and Isle of Dogs (1994), pp. 336-341.

This is why, when we wish communication to be genuinely human  because it begins from one man and is addressed to other men  the word that is communicated must be nourished by silence to be more meaningful, to be more true. Because it is in silence that I hear, it is in silence that I understand more attentively what are the needs, the sufferings, the search for the good and true that is in the heart of other men\\". In September 2014 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples.

Etymology The name Amecameca comes from Nahuatl. It has been interpreted to mean ‚Äúplace where the papers signal or mark,‚Äù or ‚Äúpaper used ceremoniously.‚Äù The paper is called amatl, which is a bark paper used to dress images of gods and is still made as a craft. ‚Äúde Ju√°rez‚Äù was added to the name in 1887 by the government of the state of Mexico in honor of Benito Ju√°rez. Economy =Tourism= The area is a traditional weekend getaway for Mexico City, Puebla state and Morelos state residents. Tourists come here to enjoy the scenery, eat barbacoa, rabbit and other foods in a traditional tianguis or municipal market. It is also a local pilgrimage site to the sanctuary of the Se√±or del Sacromonte. The traditional entrance to the historic center of the town is a colonial era arch, which was built in 1731 and located on the southeast corner of the main plaza next to the municipal palace. It contains a medallion with an image of Christ as the \\"Humilladero\\" (humbled), which colonial travelers worshipped. The arch is made of sandstone in Baroque style with geometric fretwork. At the very top is a small column on which used to sit a statue of San Sebastian de Aparcicio. In the 1970s, a bus hit the arch and toppled the statue, which was never replaced. The main plaza has a 1950s era kiosk and contains two small stores in its base selling regional candies. The upper portion has a jukebox. The plaza also contains monuments to Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla and Benito Ju√°rez as well as a ring from a Mesoamerican ball court of the 13th century. The pavement of the plaza was replaced in 1999 from paving stone to patterned concrete. In 2003, a hemicycle dedicated to Benito Ju√°rez was added. While it is considered to be a park, the plaza is often filled with stands on market days and during festivals, but most cultural events take place at the esplanade of the municipal palace. The green areas of the plaza contain sculptures of lions made of iron, but unlike real lions, these are shown with nopal plants, with a boa constrictor and other poses and were donated by the former owners of the Hacienda of Chapingo. For this reason the plaza is also called the Jardin de Leones (Lion Garden). Parish of La Asunci√≥n Main plaza Facing the plaza on the east side is the Parish of the Asunci√≥n, which was originally a Dominican monastery, founded in 1553. The main portal is made of pink stone and still in good condition. This architectural style is very austere. On the facade of La Asuncion there is only sculpture of the Virgin Mary with the faces of angels at her feet and a window cornice, which has decorations in the form of raindrops. Inside, the main altar is Neoclassical. One of the side altars is Baroque with Biblical images surrounded by Solomonic columns. The sacristy has two altars, another Baroque one with Solomonic columns and one dedicated to the Se√±or del Sacromonte. The most noteworthy painting here is The Angel of the Annuniciation done by Echave Orio. The two story cloister is one of the most primitive in the Americas and has four segmental arches resting on octagonal columns on each side. There are two other important chapels in the town; the Chapel of San Juan and the Chapel of the Virgen del Rosario which have functioned as points of reference for travelers since they were built. They were built for the common people of adobe and wood. Also near the main plaza is the municipal market, which is a traditional place to enjoy local culinary specialties. It contains central Mexican staples such carnitas and barbacoa, but the local signature dish is rabbit. Rabbit is a signature dish of the region. It is prepared as mixote, in moles, wrapped in corn husks and steamed, or simply covered in chili pepper and roasted. Like in other parts of Mexico, atole is popular here but there is a variation seasoned with chili pepper and epazote. The municipal market offers dishes and products made from local nuts such a walnuts such as chiles en nogada, chicken in a nut sauce, mixiotes with rabbit and nuts as well as a walnut liquor. In front of this market is a crafts market which sells clay items, photographs of the volcanos, local breads and turnovers filled with apple or pineapple. The market also sells a liquor from walnuts year round but it is especially during the annual Walnut Festival, which takes place in August. This permanent market is supplemented by the tianguis, or traditional outdoor market, held each Sunday. On this day, traders and craftsmen come from as far as Puebla to sell. The town has one pulqueria which serves the pulque straight or flavored. Common flavors such as strawberry, mango, guava and nut are available, but the owner also has original recipes for flavors such as tomato, celery, carrot and others which the owner says are \\"secret.\\" Education The state university of UAEM (Universidad Aut√≥noma del Estado de Mexico) has a local campus here. A major charity is the Cottolengo Mexicano, which is a project of the Obra Don Orione religious foundation. This group was founded in Italy in 1905 and has expanded to over thirty countries to offer charity, education and evangelization. The group established itself here and in Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl in the mid 1990s. The Cottolengo serves homeless children and those who are disabled.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 5, 2008. Bart becomes jealous of his friends and their cell phones. Working at a golf course, Bart takes the cell phone of Denis Leary after the star comedian throws it away in anger. Marge, per Leary's advice, activates the GPS system on the phone to track down Bart's every move; catching on, Bart attaches the GPS chip to a bird that migrates to Machu Picchu, Peru. Leary and Brian Grazer (who also appeared in \\"When You Dish Upon a Star\\" as himself) both guest star as themselves. It was directed by Raymond S. Persi and written by John Frink. Plot When Principal Skinner makes a fool of himself on a freeway, Milhouse manages to catch the scene on his phone. He calls most of his friends to see Skinner getting beaten up by a drunken-(as-always) Barney, but cannot call Bart. When Nelson asks why, Milhouse explains that Bart does not have a cell phone, and Bart is immediately taunted for missing out on laughing at Skinner. Bart asks Marge for a phone; Marge explains that, because Mr. Burns has gotten rid of Homer's pay, forcing him to work for free, she cannot afford it (or a dream trip for Lisa to Machu Picchu). A depressed Bart takes a walk past the Springfield Glen Country Club, and is hit by a golf ball. He angrily runs onto the golf course to find who hit him, and finds it was Dr. Julius Hibbert. Hibbert pays Bart a dollar for the ball. Bart realizes he can earn enough money for a cell phone by retrieving golf balls. Bart's glee is cut short when Groundskeeper Willie accuses Bart of cutting in on his job, and confiscates all the golf balls. Nearby, a celebrity golf tournament is underway. Celebrity Denis Leary (guest starring as himself) prepares to swing, but misses when his cell phone rings at the same time. Leary throws away his phone, which lands beside Bart. While going to inform Milhouse of his new cell, Bart receives a call from producer Brian Grazer (also guest starring as himself), who asks Leary to star in the film adaption of Everyone Poops. Bart, realizing the phone belongs to Leary, pretends to be him. He makes prank calls to bartenders all over the world, and has all of Boston native Leary's money spent on New York Yankees hats and uniforms. Marge overhears Bart and Milhouse's mischievousness, and when Milhouse confesses that it belongs to Leary, confiscates and prepares to return Bart's phone to Leary. Leary calls his cell, and Marge answers, apologizing for her son's behavior. Leary, still angry with Bart's tricks, suggests Marge activate the GPS and web filter on the phone and return it to Bart, allowing her to track down Bart's every move and block certain websites. He says that this is how he tracked rival actors who \\"stole\\" film roles he wanted. Somewhat guiltily, Marge activates the GPS and returns the phone to Bart. Marge is able to prevent Bart from watching an R-rated movie, gambling at a horse race, digging out a grave, and skating down steps and hurting himself. Bart realizes that as long as Marge and Homer have him under constant surveillance, he cannot have any fun, and decides to meditate with the rest of the family. Lisa discovers her parents spying on Bart and shocked by Marge's injustice, confronts her for it. When Marge refuses to acknowledge she is abusing Bart's privacy, Lisa decides to tell Bart what is going on. Bart, wanting to get revenge, uninstalls the parental control software from the phone and ties the GPS chip to the leg of a scarlet tanager, which flies away. Marge, thinking the bird is Bart, assumes that Bart is running away from home. While Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie conduct a nationwide search for Bart, Lisa realizes that the bird is what they had been chasing. After checking research on her laptop, she discovers the bird is migrating to Machu Picchu, her dream trip they could not afford. Knowing this, Lisa deliberately lets the bird go free so the family can chase it to Machu Picchu. Bart relishes his newfound freedom during the daytime, but quickly becomes frightened of being alone at night. When the Simpsons arrive in Machu Picchu, they continue the search for Bart. Marge, despite being exhausted, swears to be more over-protective with Bart, but Lisa convinces her to rest on an ancient sculpture, below the statue of the ancient Peruvian God of the Sky. Marge quickly falls asleep, and is instantaneously pulled into a dream world where the God of the Sky shows her ancient Peru. He teaches her how throughout history, parents who over-parented their children could never set them free, which was how they were conquered by the Conquistadors and Inca renegades (although historical-wise, Machu Picchu was never actually discovered or conquered by the Conquistadors). Upon waking, Marge learns that she must let Bart learn how to take care of himself. Homer discovers that the family has been following a bird the whole time, making Marge to realize where Bart is. Upon returning to Springfield, Marge asks Bart if he missed her. Bart says he did not notice they were gone (for two weeks), so Marge, depressed, goes upstairs. However, upon reaching the stairs, she is stopped by Bart, who quickly begs her to never leave again. The episode ends with Lisa asking Homer, \\"Where's Maggie?\\" As it turns out, the family had left her in Machu Picchu, where she is being worshipped. Production During the table read of the script, a role meant for Matt Damon was included, but he did not appear in the final version of the episode. The episode is dedicated to Paul Newman, who guest starred in \\"The Blunder Years\\" and died nine days before the episode aired. Cultural references The Swedish and Australian bars which Bart prank calls feature numerous references. The Swedish bar is named the \\"Inga- Bar Beerman\\" in reference to filmmaker Ingmar Bergman. The image of the barman in profile and another person in the background looking directly into the camera is a visual reference to Bergman's 1966 film Persona. The Australian barman resembles Michael \\"Crocodile\\" Dundee, and his bar is called the \\"Crocodile Drunkee's\\", both referencing the 1986 film \\"Crocodile\\" Dundee. In his bar window, a partial sticker for the band INXS is seen, as well as the album Business as Usual by Men at Work. The zoom-in places the Australian bar at Fox Studios Australia. Additionally, Skinner plays a human version of the arcade game Frogger when trying to cross the interstate for gas. Marge receives a collection notice from Allied Peas whose corporate mascot bears a striking resemblance to the Jolly Green Giant while paying for frozen peas on installment, while Bart, Milhouse, and Nelson grill Twizzlers licorice. Bart suggests to Leary's manager that he order New York Yankees hats and Derek Jeter jerseys. Leary is a real life Boston Red Sox fan, a large rival of the Yankees. Leary was born in Massachusetts and went to college at Emerson College in Boston. The episode features two musical montages. During the montage of Homer and Marge tracking Bart the Elvis Costello song \\"Watch Your Step\\" is playing, while Bart's golf ball recovery montage is set to Merle Haggard's \\"Workin' Man Blues\\". The title is also a reference to the telecommunications company Verizon Communications, and the novel and film Lost Horizon. Reception In its original airing, the episode garnered 7.43 million viewers, a 3.6 rating and a 10 share. Robert Canning of IGN said, \\"This wasn't a terrible episode, but it just was not funny enough for such a serpentine storyline. Throw in a wasted Denis Leary, and you really start to think that 'Lost Verizon' could have been so much more\\". He gave the episode a final rating of 6.7/10. Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict said, \\"it is a mostly solid episode, it feels like a missed opportunity for a show that garners more grumbles than acclaim these days\\".

The site is on the southern margin of the Mississippian cultural advance down the Mississippi River and on the northern edge of that of the Cole's Creek and Plaquemine cultures of the South.\\" The site was first excavated by Clarence Bloomfield Moore in 1908 and tested by Philip Phillips, Paul Gebhard and Nick Zeigler in 1949. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. Location One of the half dozen really big sites in the State of Mississippi, the Holly Bluff Site is located on the south bank of George Lake, or Lake George as it is sometimes known, a half mile east of its confluence with the Sunflower River and a mile and a half southeast of the village of Holly Bluff, Yazoo County. Today the site is bisected by a county road and is used as a plantation headquarters but still clearly visible are the numerous large mounds and the remains of a surrounding wall. Prehistoric Timeline Early Mississippian influence on the Yazoo Basin area The sites occupation begins with a Jaketown Phase occupation evidenced by a scattering of Poverty Point objects in the lowest levels of excavations. This is followed, after a hiatus evidenced by a complete lack of Tuscola Phase materials, by an early Marksville period component tentatively assigned an early Anderson Landing Phase that may have lasted into an early Issaquena times. The succeeding late 'Issaquena Phase and Deasonville Phases are virtually unrepresented at Holly Bluff. The site was again occupied from the lower half of the Baytown period up to the late prehistoric times. All phases of the local sequence from the Bayland on through the Lake George Phase (1350-1500)(of which the site is the type site for the Lower Yazoo Basin Plaquemine chronology) are abundantly documented. Materials of the Crippen Point Phase of the Late Coles Creek appear to be most widely spread, and it may have been at this time that the settlement attained its greatest size. In the final Lake George Phase additions were made to some of the mounds, especially Mound A, and the enclosing embankment was built, but the total area occupied was perhaps not as large as in the preceding period. Site Description Mound A is almost the exact center of the site, a most unusual location for the dominant mound in ceremonial centers of the Coles Creek and Mississippi periods. In the case of centers the plaza is normally the central feature with the principal \\"temple mound\\" located on one side, usually but not always the west, its principal ramp giving access from the plaza on the east side of the mound. In the case of Holly Bluff there seems to have been two plazas to the east and west of the Mound A respectively. Sampling evidence supports the theory that Mound A was originally part of a group (including mounds B, C, D, E, and F) surrounding the western plaza possibly as early as the Bayland phase (but more likely the Aden phase), and certainly established by the Kings Crossing phase. Mound A may or may not have been the principal structure at this time. This plan may have carried on into the Crippen Point phase, but the evidence strongly suggests that either then or in the succeeding Mayersville phase site reorientation took place. Mound A becoming the principle feature of an east plaza assemblage (with mounds F', G, G', H, U, and V) which remained the ritual center of the site throughout the remainder of its history. The twenty- five mounds that are now recognized range from barely noticeable rises to the massive Mound A, which is high and covers nearly two acres. It is believed that the lower rises were used as house substructures and repeatedly reconstructed. The larger mounds were most likely used for ceremonial purposes rather than residential. Until recent erosion, earthen ramps could be seen climbing to the summits of these large mounds. Seven of the mounds are situated along the bank of George Lake and six more are located within the embankment. The remaining twelve mounds are positioned around the two plazas situated to the east and west of Mound A. This design is unusual and extremely large for the area; the closest in size and layout being the Winterville Site. The final major feature of the site is the earthen wall and the trench that surrounds it on three sides. In the earliest survey of the site, C. B. Moore reported that the wall was four to high and still reached this height although large sections have now been destroyed. It is likely that the ditch, which was filled with water from George Lake, supplied the dirt for the wall. The one side that was not protected by the wall was the lake side of the site, the lake bank creating a steep enough boundary on this northern side to provide protection. Besides topographical settings, the environment of the Lake George site was extremely favorable for occupation. In prehistoric times the rich soils and the varying ecologies supported a vast array of plant and animal species. The natural levees created by deposits from the Mississippi were made of rich sandy and silty loams which allowed the common Southeastern deciduous hardwoods, such as hickory, elm, ash, cottonwood, maple, pecan, hackberry, honey locust, sycamore, and even gums and oaks to flourish. The swamps surrounding the site supported an entirely different ecosystem including alligators, small reptiles and aquatic plants. The streams and rivers also provided fish, shellfish, and other aquatic fauna, which can be seen from excavations of shell middens and deposits of the site. These waterways also provided a major form of communication. This abundant region was obviously utilized by many different peoples over the course of prehistory as the Holly Bluff Site shows. Excavations Looting, erosion and cultivation have extensively damaged the Holy Bluff site over the years. This has caused some debate over the form and degree of some of the earthworks. Clarence B. Moore noted in 1908, following a visit, that some thirty rises and mounds, small and large, could be counted within the enclosure. Nine years later Calvin S. Brown visited and counted only twenty-five or so mounds within the wall. In 1928 and again in 1936 James A. Ford recorded only twenty-two mounds. In a site report in January 1941, Jesse D. Jennings described twenty-seven mounds and some questionable rises. C. B. Moore's original estimate is believed to most accurately reflect the situation; many of the smaller earthworks have been lost to recent and intense cultivation. In January and February 1908, Clarence Bloomfield Moore received permission from the then owner Judge William Andrew Henry of Yazoo City to excavate the sites along the Yazoo River and its tributary the Sunflower River in his steamboat, The Gopher. On his excavation Moore recorded eleven sites and partially excavated eight, including Holly Bluff: \\"with a large force to dig, including May who had been in our service before, we go directly to work on such mounds\\". Moore commented on the physical appearance of the site: \\"Strewn over the enclosed area, among the mounds and on them‚Ä¶are chert pebbles; fragments of chert; bits of mussel shell; and small parts of earthenware vessels\\" Most of the earthenware was undecorated, he recorded, and mostly shell-tempered with some stone tempering which is common in the Yazoo-Sunflower region. C. B. Moore's excavations produced various small artifacts including projectile points, a pebble ax of fossilized wood, a chert hammerstone, and a zoomorphic effigy pipe of shell- tempered pottery. He was disappointed, however, in finding nothing of great importance other than two disturbed burials in a mound on the lake front. Moore's disappointment was evident in his failing to map the site and his statement, \\"it having become evident to us that our search was inadequately rewarded\\". Numerous other archaeologists with varying degrees of success followed up Moore's excavations. Each of the later excavations found an extremely different system of mounds. In the 1920s the site was damaged by the then-plantation owner Mr. Charles W. Perry who pastured cattle on the large mounds and cultivated the smaller mounds. The cattle foraged the cover of the larger mounds and their trampling eroded much of the site, erasing the ramps described by Moore. In 1949 Philip Phillips, Paul Gebhard and Nick Zeigler began performing test excavations of the Holly Bluff site. These were the first truly scientific excavations carried out at the site. The interpretations of the data provided the first reliable conclusions of the culture history. These tests finally provided evidence that the Holly Bluff site had been occupied for approximately one millennium. The conclusions proved that the Holly Bluff site was an important phase of the Coles Creek culture. From 1958 to 1960, \\"hundreds of skeletons were removed\\" from Mound C.

A navigable waterway leads to the central lagoon, which has an area of 359 km¬≤. The population as of the 2012 census was 233. The town of Garumaoa is the main settlement. Raroians live principally on fishing, copra cultivation, and pearl farming. History Raroia and Takume were called Napaite, \\"the Twins\\" (-ite, two), by the ancient Paumotu people. The first recorded Europeans to reach Raroia were those of the Spanish expedition led by the Portuguese explorer Pedro Fernandes de Queir√≥s on 14 February 1606.

Later, one of the crew members, Bengt Danielsson, lived thereDanielssons awarded the Alternative Peace Prize and studied the economy and the society. He wrote some books about Raroia, notably his thesis Work and Life on Raroia (Uppsala, 1955). In his 1952 book Raroia: Happy Island of the South Seas, he observes, \\"The Raroian peace stems from the fact that the people have no material anxieties and no other object in life than just to live\\" (Danielsson, 294). In April 2006 Raroia Airport began serving the air transportation needs of the atoll, with irregular visits by Air Tahiti flights.Official site - photos of the airport People right The languages spoken on Raroia are Pa'umotu and French. Pa'umotu is the local language, and French is taught in the elementary school in the island's village of Garumaoa. To attend secondary school the children go to the larger island Makemo. To attend university they can go to Tahiti, 748 km away. The Raroians are, like most Polynesians, known for their hospitality, and although there are no available accommodations to rent on the island, locals will often share their lodgings with travelers. The Raroian diet consists mainly of local seafood, imported bread, rice and canned goods. The island's main industries are pearl farming and copra cultivation.

In his later years he became the subject of an investigation after being accused of a series of casting-couch rapes. He was indicted in 2009, but killed him self on May 22, 2011, before his trial. Early life and singing career Brooks was born Joseph Kaplan on March 11, 1938 in Manhattan, and grew up in Manhattan and Lawrence, Long Island, New York. In later interviews, he claimed to have started playing piano at age 3 and writing plays at age 5, following his parents' divorce. As a child, he also developed a stutter that, according to his production partner Robert K. Lifton, would disappear when Brooks sang or acted. He later attended five different colleges, including Juilliard, but did not graduate from any. In the late 1950s, Brooks pursued a career as a singer- songwriter, adopting the name \\"Joey Brooks\\" (later changed to \\"Joe Brooks\\" or \\"Joseph Brooks\\") He released several records on the Canadian-American label as \\"Joey Brooks\\", and on Decca as \\"Joey Brooks and the Baroque Folk\\".

He received numerous Clio Awards for his work, as well as a People's Choice Award. Credited as \\"Joey Brooks\\", he also wrote the song \\"My Ship Is Comin' In\\", a Top Ten UK hit in 1966 for the Walker Brothers. \\"Joseph Brooks, Composer of 'Metropolis'\\". Retrieved 31 March 2015. In the 1970s, Brooks, who had become wealthy from his advertising work (at one point claiming to have 150 commercials on the air), began composing for films. He wrote music for the American release of The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (1970), Marjoe (1972), and The Lords of Flatbush (1974) in which he was also an investor. He wrote \\"Blue Balloon (The Hourglass Song)\\" which was sung by Robby Benson as the theme song for the film Jeremy (1973), and further claimed to have written, cast and directed most of Jeremy, although Arthur Barron was the sole writer and director of record. Brooks' claim was recognized by New York Times film critic Roger Greenspun, who wrote that \\"it seems fair to suggest that, in whatever proportion, both men were involved in the authorship of the film.\\" Brooks next developed his own film project, You Light Up My Life, which he wrote, produced, directed and scored on a budget of approximately $1 million. The romantic drama about an aspiring singer, starring Didi Conn, became a box office success despite poor reviews. The title song Brooks composed for the film was an even bigger success; a cover version by Debby Boone reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and held the top position for 10 consecutive weeks, at that time the longest Number One reign in the chart's history. With sales of over five million copies, the song ultimately became the biggest hit of the 1970s, and earned Brooks a Grammy Award for Song of the Year, an Academy Award for Best Original Song, a Golden Globe Award and an American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) award. Brooks attempted to follow up his success with a similar romantic drama, If Ever I See You Again (1978), for which Brooks not only co-wrote, produced, directed and scored, but also played the leading role (a successful composer of TV commercial jingles, much like himself in real life), despite having no significant prior acting experience. Although the title song became a moderate hit for Roberta Flack, peaking at #24 on the Hot 100 chart, the movie received sharply negative reviews and was a box-office bomb. Brooks was subsequently involved in several other films, including directing and scoring Invitation to the Wedding (1983) in which Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud appeared, and co-producing Eddie and the Cruisers (1983) (which Brooks did not score). In the late 1990s, he and his then-wife Christina Bone began developing a film entitled Sara's Life Before It Became a Movie, which was never released. Brooks also worked on stage productions, composing and writing for the 1989 West End musical adaptation of Metropolis and writing, directing and producing the Broadway musical In My Life (2005), a love story about a female Village Voice personals editor with obsessive-compulsive disorder and a musician with Tourette's syndrome who are brought together by a jingle-singing God. Robert Simonson later wrote in Brooks' Playbill obituary that In My Life was \\"generally regarded as one of the strangest shows ever to have graced a Broadway stage.\\" When In My Life was panned by critics including Ben Brantley of The New York Times, who called it \\"jaw-dropping moments of whimsy run amok\\", Brooks spent $1.5 million on ads saying that the critics were wrong. Many sources have described Brooks as an egomaniac. His career was curtailed in 2008 by a stroke. Sexual assault indictment In June 2009, Brooks was arrested on charges of raping or sexually assaulting eleven women lured to his East Side apartment from 2005 to 2008. His female assistant, Shawni Lucier, was charged with helping him. \\"She picked the victims, set up travel arrangements and reassured them,‚Äù said Lisa Friel, chief of the district attorney's sex crimes unit. At times, she said, Ms. Lucier also reassured mothers worried about sending their daughters alone to New York on flights paid for by Mr. Brooks. And, she said, Ms. Lucier was sometimes present in the apartment when the women arrived, but left before the assaults. At least four of the women accused him of sexual assault. He allegedly lured the women to his apartment to audition for movie roles. According to Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, the women responded to a notice that Brooks had posted on Craigslist seeking attractive women to star in movie roles, and flew to New York from Pacific Coast states or Florida, usually at Brooks' expense. He was indicted on June 23, 2009. He was to be tried in the state Supreme Court for Manhattan (a trial-level court) on 91 counts of rape, sexual abuse, criminal sexual act, assault, and other charges. In December 2009, prosecutors indicated that they would ask the grand jury to consider adding even more charges, in part because \\"additional victims\\" had come forward. However, Brooks died by suicide on May 22, 2011, before he could be tried.https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/nyregion/joseph-brooks-found-dead- won-songwriting-oscar.html Three days after Brooks' death, Shawni Lucier pleaded guilty to ten counts of criminal facilitation. Personal life Brooks was the older brother of Gilbert Kaplan, the founder of Institutional Investor magazine, aficionado of Gustav Mahler, and amateur conductor. In 2008, Brooks suffered a stroke, which left him unable to play the piano and thus negatively affected his ability to compose. It was reported that he may have had a second stroke shortly before his death. Brooks was married four times, but was single at the time of his death. A 1978 news article noted that he was married with 7-year-old twins, a boy and a girl. In the late 1970s, Brooks married Susan Paul, an English model and actress who appeared in the films All That Jazz (1979) and Invitation to the Wedding (1983). They had two children during the 1980s and were divorced in the early 1990s. Brooks later married Christina Bone. In 1975, Brooks had a relationship with actress Cindy Williams, who was, at the time, starring in the movie, The First Nudie Musical, written and co-directed by her friend Bruce Kimmel - Brooks became an investor in the film. Brooks originally planned for her to star in You Light Up My Life,Kimmel, p. 172. but he and Williams were already having relationship issues and he asked Kimmel to direct You Light Up My Life, stating he couldn't control Williams. He broke up with Williams before the film was made, and the role went to Didi Conn.Kimmel, p. 183. In 2009, Brooks sued a 22-year-old ex-fianc√©e, claiming that he had spent $2 million on her before learning she was already married. Brooks had four children: Amanda (born 1981) and Nicholas (born 1986) (both from his marriage to Susan Paul), Gabrielle, and Jeffrey. Brooks' daughter Amanda has said that Brooks abused her as a child and that she and Nicholas had a difficult relationship with their father. At the time of Brooks' death, Nicholas, a former student at the University of Colorado, was awaiting trial in New York City, charged with the murder of his girlfriend, swimwear designer Sylvie Cachay, in a Soho House hotel room on December 9, 2010. On July 11, 2013, Nicholas was convicted of Cachay's murder. He was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison in September of that year. Death Police reported that on May 22, 2011, Brooks was found dead in his Upper East Side condominium apartment. Brooks was found with a plastic bag over his head near a hose attached to a helium tank, with a suicide note found nearby. According to a law enforcement source, in the note Brooks claimed he would be exonerated of the charges pending against him, but complained about his failing health and a woman who he claimed had abused him and taken his money. Shortly before Brooks' death, a former friend had also filed suit to seize his condominium to pay off an outstanding $3.2 million debt, alleging that Brooks had put up his longtime home as collateral for a $2.4 million loan in 2006. On May 23, 2011, the medical examiner ruled that Brooks had killed himself, citing asphyxia by helium.

Built in 1798, it is the oldest surviving building in Natchez from its early territorial period. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974 and and a Mississippi Landmark in 2001. History The House on Ellicott Hill is a National Historic Landmark and important as a grand and rare surviving example of an early vernacular building form once typical of the Lower Mississippi Valley. Built between 1798 and 1801, the house is also one of the first buildings in the Mississippi Territory to exhibit the definitive characteristics of the Federal style. The house features a distinctive roof shape created by surrounding shed roofs attached high on a central gable. This Anglo-American roof shape differs from the French Louisiana vernacular where shed roofs extend from a central hipped roof. The Anglo House on Ellicott Hill relates to its French vernacular contemporaries in Louisiana in the use of bousillage, composed of mud and Spanish moss, in the exterior walls of the frame upper story. Construction details also document the early expansion of the house to the north and south and the early enclosure of a rear loggia. Built into the side of a hill, the fa√ßade of the house is two-stories including a raised brick basement. On the rear elevation, where the basement is beneath ground level, the house reads as a single story. A dry moat across the rear provides light and ventilation for the basement rooms. Eliza Baker in an 1805 letter home to New Jersey describes Natchez as having a number of houses that are similar in form, if not in scale, to the House on Ellicott Hill: ‚Ä¶the style which prevails‚Ä¶ namely one- story, with this differencethat there is a lower story dug out of the side of the hill presenting two stories in front and but one in the rear‚Ä¶[with] a long gallery or piazza, partly enclosed by Venetian blinds‚Ä¶ Buildings that were similar in form to the House on Ellicott Hill probably inspired English travel writer Fortescue Cuming, in Sketches of a Tour to the Western County, 1807-1809, to write that he was ‚Äúmuch struck with the similarity of Natchez to many of the smaller West Indian towns, particularly St. Johns Antigua‚Ä¶the houses all with balconies and pizzas.‚Äù He was not the only writer to relate the early architectural character of Natchez to the West Indies. This similarity is understandable since Natchez and the West Indies shared the same mixture of national influences, similar climate, and common trade interests. The House on Ellicott Hill stands on property acquired as a Spanish grant in 1797 by Natchez merchant James Moore. Construction probably began after January 1798, when the site hosted an encampment of soldiers led by Major Isaac Guion, commander of the United States forces ordered to take possession of the Spanish posts east of the Mississippi. A notice in Green‚Äôs Impartial Observer [Natchez], February 21, 1801, indicates that James Moore, by that date, is living on the property. An 1805 city tax roll documents the house as having a tax valuation of $8,000, second in value only to Texada, which was built ca. 1798, documented as the city's first brick house, and valued at $12,000. The architectural integrity of the House on Ellicott Hill is outstanding, with few changes made after the 1820s. The house retains most of its original millwork, including the fan-lighted doorways of the front and rear elevations, which are arguably the earliest Mississippi expression of this common hallmark of the federal style. The interior millwork of the principal room is finely executed and includes a gouged-carved cornice and a matching pair of gouge-carved mantel pieces, one of which is original and the other a matching reproduction dating to the restoration. The room includes a regionally unique ceiling dome that provided extra height for a lighting fixture and was probably lined with tin to reflect light. Restoration The house was purchased in 1934 by the Natchez Garden Club and restored, since it was in a dilapidated condition. Architect Richard Koch worked to restore the house, rebuilding collapsing masonry, repairing carpentry and plasterwork, and restoring wood trim, among other things. At the time of the restoration, the house was believed to be a former tavern owned by Patrick Connelly, but later research by the Natchez Garden club revealed that the tavern was actually located one block southeast of the house on Ellicott's Hill.Descendants of George Killian (1740-1830) Alterations to the house are primarily associated with the 1930s restoration and include the redesign of the gallery staircase and the removal of the extension of the masonry basement wall that enclosed the northern end of the lower gallery to partially shelter the gallery staircase. Also, in typical Natchez fashion, the first flight of the dog-leg staircase originally abutted the front wall and extended across a window. The colonnettes on pedestals supporting the upper gallery and the slender turned columns of the lower gallery also date to the mid-1930s restoration. Pre- restoration photographs document crude replacements of both the gallery posts and balustrade. The House on Ellicott Hill is open to the public as a house museum operated by the Natchez Garden Club, whose mid-1930s restoration marked the first time that an organization acquired and restored a historic building in Mississippi. In popular culture Opening screens of the 1951 film Show Boat were filmed at the home.

During his extensive career he played almost exclusively for Betis, retiring well past his 30s. He represented Spain in one World Cup and one European Championship. Club career Born in Valladolid, Castile and Le√≥n, Carde√±osa arrived at Real Betis from local Real Valladolid in 1974, and remained there until his retirement. Left-footed, he possessed great technical ability which belied his thin physical build, and amassed 412 overall appearances for the Andalusians (307 in ten La Liga seasons), helping the club lift the Copa del Rey in 1977. Carde√±osa retired at almost 36, then took up coaching mainly in the region. He started as a youth manager at Betis, and had two meaningless stints with the first team, including in 1990‚Äì91's top flight ‚Äì seven matches, with eventual relegation. Carde√±osa returned to Betis in 2010, as part of newly appointed manager Pepe Mel's coaching staff. International career Carde√±osa earned eight caps for Spain. His debut came on 30 November 1977 in a 1978 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Yugoslavia, playing the full 90 minutes in the decisive 1‚Äì0 away win. Carde√±osa was subsequently picked for the final stages in Argentina. There, he notoriously missed an open goal chance in the group stage against Brazil in an eventual 0‚Äì0 draw, with Spain being eliminated precisely by the South Americans; he also represented the nation at UEFA Euro 1980.

Education and career  Shapiro received his BA at Brandeis University and his PhD at Harvard University, where he was the last PhD student of Professor Isadore Twersky. He received rabbinical ordination from Rabbi Ephraim Greenblatt. Shapiro's father is Edward S. Shapiro, who has published books on American history and American Jewish history. Shapiro holds the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Chair in Judaic Studies at the University of Scranton. Shapiro is an on-line lecturer for Torah in Motion, for which he also leads Jewish history tours to Europe and Morocco. He often writes for the Seforim Blog. Shapiro has been a resident of West Orange, New Jersey.Ginsberg, Johanna. \\"Local scholar organizes conference on history of Modern Orthodoxy\\" , New Jersey Jewish News, June 1, 2006. Accessed June 28, 2018. \\"A West Orange scholar is the co-organizer of the first-ever conference in America on the history of Modern Orthodoxy, to be held June 13‚Äì15 in Scranton, Pa. Marc B. Shapiro, who holds the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Chair in Jewish Studies at the University of Scranton, said the conference will take a historical view of the movement in order to explore its meaning for today.\\"  Writing  Shapiro's writings often challenge the bounds of the conventional Orthodox understanding of Judaism, using academic methodology while adhering to Modern Orthodox sensibilities. His publications have had mixed reception, ranging from criticism within the American Hareidi publication Jewish Action, to support throughout the spectrum of Conservative Judaism, Reform Judaism, and the scholastic discipline of scriptural reasoning. Shapiro's book, Between the Yeshiva World and Modern Orthodoxy: The Life and Works of Rabbi Jehiel Jacob Weinberg, a biography of Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg, was a National Jewish Book Award finalist. His second book, The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides' Thirteen Principles Reappraised, also a National Jewish Book Award finalist, argued against the conventional Orthodox belief that Maimonides Thirteen Principles of Faith are unquestionable dogma. Gidon Rothstein, writing in the Association for Jewish Studies Review, called the book's collection of sources \\"remarkable.\\" In 2015, Shapiro's book Changing the Immutable: How Orthodox Judaism Rewrites Its History, was released, documenting the phenomenon of internal censorship in Orthodoxy; where Adam Ferziger said the book \\"is the outstanding product of a master of rabbinic literature and an extraordinarily sharp-eyed and meticulous scholar.\\"http://marginalia.lareviewofbooks.org/the-sagacious-scholar-and-the- censor-by-adam-ferziger/ Yair Hoffman, writing in the Hareidi online website Yeshiva World News, criticized the book, saying that \\"there is a plethora of material that simply should not have been included in the book because it does not back up his thesis.\\" Ezra Glinter, writing in The Forward, praised Shapiro's \\"evenhanded, evidence-heavy approach\\" and that he was not a \\"polemicist,\\" but said \\"his argument could also have benefited from a more critical thrust.\\" Continual discussion regarding criticism and associated defenses can be found under his author tag, on The Seforim Blog, of which Marc B.

It lies directly north of Mexico City in the northeastern part of the State of Mexico, making it part of the Greater Mexico City urban area. The name comes from N√°huatl meaning 'hill of the 'tule'. The census of 2005 reported a population of 57,586 for the city and 110,145 for the municipality as a whole. The city Parade of toritos on the streets of the historic center for the feast of John of God The area was first settled by the Chichimecas, followed by the Otomis in the seventh century. After the Spanish Conquest, Tultepec was given to the conquistador Alonso √Åvila along with the current municipalities of Zumpango, Xaltoc√°n, Huehuetoca, Coyotepec, Teoloyucan and others, as part of the Encomienda de Cuautitl√°n. The modern town of Tultepec began to take shape around 1610 in the valley next to a small elevation called San Mart√≠n. Franciscans came to evangelize the new community, dedicating it to the Nativity of Holy Mary and constructing a temple in 1618. This temple, later a parish, was renovated between 1948 and 1955. The town and municipality boast of a number of musicians and painters including Hernesto Urb√°n Rodr√≠guez (1894), Ricardo V√°zquez Pineda (1894), Victor Manuel Urb√°n Silva (1894), Andr√©s Urb√°n (1870) and Prudenciano Garc√≠a (1880), as well as modern composers such as Victor Urb√°n Velasco, Gerardo Urb√°n Vel√°sco, Francisco V√°zquez Garc√≠a, Francisco Romero Linares, and J. Isabel V√°zquez Solano. Better-known painters include Miguel Hern√°ndez Urb√°n, Joaqu√≠n Gonz√°lez Romero, Margarito Gonz√°lez Solano, Gregorio Gonz√°lez Solano, and Albino Luna S√°nchez.

Fireworks industry Castillos at the National Fireworks Festival In the past, when the town was still rural, the economy was based on products such as pulque, animal feed, salt and tequesquite as well as domestic fowl and other small animals, mostly to be sold in Mexico City. Nowadays, the pyrotechnics industry is the major industry in Tultepec. Every year, the town throws a weeklong festival with fireworks competitions among various producers. Many pioneers in pyrotechnics came from Tultepec, including Agust√≠n, Miguel and Gregorio Fiesco (1880); Jos√© Solano Urb√°n (1900‚Äì1920), who revolutionized firework sets and castles; Felipe Reyes, who worked on the colors red and yellow around 1920; √Ångel Guadalupe Flores, who around 1920 invented star fireworks and sparklers as well as several types of rockets; Cirilo S√°nchez (1920), who worked on aerostatic balloons; as well as Tom√°s Romero, √Ångel Urb√°n Rivero, Marcos Romero, and Felipe Fiesco, who innovated such items as the electric target, the spider bomb, and two-figure wheels between 1930 and 1934. The city and municipality hosts the annual National Pyrotechnic Festival. =2016 fireworks explosion= On 20 December 2016, at least 36 people were killed and 59 were injured when fireworks exploded at the San Pablito Market.

Background  Chang Jo-ri's origins or ancestry is not mentioned in historical records. It can be inferred that Prime Minister Chang Jo-ri came from a notable noble family because he served in high government positions such as Daesaja and Daejubu.  Life  = Reign of King Bongsang = Chang Jo-ri is first mentioned to have served as Daesaja of the South Province, and later as Daejubu. He rose to the position of Prime Minister in the year 294, succeeding Prime Minister Sang-nu. In 296, Emperor You of the Xianbei Former Yan Kingdom, invaded Goguryeo. With this invasion, Chang Jo-ri urged the King to assign Daehyeong general Go Noja to the position of Castlelord of Shin Fortress. The Former Yan forces were defeated due to this assignment. When King Bongsang became corrupt and violent, Chang Jo-ri resigned from the position of Prime Minister and planned a coup to overthrow the tyrant and place Go Eul-bul, the King's nephew, on the throne. Chang Jo-ri staged the coup in the year 300, and overthrew King Bongsang, who committed suicide upon being banished. = Reign of King Micheon = Chang Jo-ri was reinstated to the position of Prime Minister under King Micheon.

Montgomery House is a historic house on West Main Street in Mound Bayou, Mississippi, United States. Built in 1910, it was the home of Isaiah Montgomery (1847‚Äì1924), a former slave of Jefferson Davis who was instrumental in founding Mound Bayou, one of the first economically successful towns established by freed slaves. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976, and and a Mississippi Landmark in 2003. Description and history The I.T. Montgomery House is located in an residential area south of the Mound Bayou town center, on the west side of South Main Avenue midway between Green Street West and West South Street. It is a two-story brick building, with a hip roof and an elevated brick foundation. It has a single-story porch extending across its front, with a hip roof supported by sloped square Doric columns set on brick piers. The porch is reached by a long stair with a right- angle turn. Sections project from several of the house's sides, capped by gables with deep eaves. Isaiah Thomas Montgomery was a leading figure in the founding of Mound Bayou, one of Mississippi's most successful communities established by slaves freed by the American Civil War. He and a cousin, both former slaves from the plantation of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, had been part of an unsuccessful attempt to establish such a community at one corner of Davis's plantation. After a railroad line was built through Bolivar County in the 1880s, this land, granted to the railroad, was considered a more suitable site for such a settlement. Montgomery was instrumental in recruiting settlers and helping to build the new community, which was given a town charter by the state in 1912. This house was built for Montgomery in 1910, and was his home until his death. After Montgomery's death in 1924 the home was used for nursers, teachers, and a private residence.

He is considered one of the founders of computational neuroscience, and was a pioneer in establishing the integrative functions of neuronal dendrites. Rall developed the use of cable theory in neuroscience, as well as passive and active compartmental modeling of the neuron. Rall studied physics at Yale University, from which he graduated with highest honors in 1943, and where he was Chairman of the Yale Political Union's Labor Party.The History of Neuroscience in Autobiography. Ed. Squire, Larry R. Volume 5. Academic Press, 1996. 553. He was involved with the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago during the war, and subsequently worked with K.S. Cole at Woods Hole. He then moved to the University of Otago in Dunedin to work with John Carew Eccles for his PhD, and remained there after Eccles' departure for Australia. In 1954 he spent a sabbatical year at University College London in the Biophysics Department headed by Bernard Katz, and after a final year in Dunedin (where he was Acting Head of Department) he then moved to Bethesda, Maryland and the National Institutes of Health, where he remained until his retirement in 1994.  Scientific focus  Wilfrid Rall's scientific achievements concern the electrical properties of neurons, and in particular the excitability of dendrites. Rall's work has led to a number of major conceptual breakthroughs, including the following: # the application of cable theory to single neurons (Rall 1957, 1959, 1960) # the first theoretical exploration of active dendrites (Rall and Shepherd, 1968) # the first theoretical exploration of active spines (Rall 1974; Miller, Rall and Rinzel, 1985)''  See also  * Cable theory Notes  References  * Rall W.

Life He was born at Moritzburg Castle in the Wettin residence of Zeitz, the eldest son of Duke Maurice of Saxe-Zeitz (1619‚Äì1681) and his second wife, Dorothea Maria (1641‚Äì1675), a younger daughter of the Wettin duke Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar. Duke Maurice had received the secundogeniture of Saxe-Zeitz from the hands of his father, Elector John George I of Saxony in 1652 and had Moritzburg Castle erected as his residence. He had two sons from his first marriage, but both died in infancy long before Moritz Wilhelm's birth. Moritz Wilhelm received a comprehensive education, mainly in ancient languages and theology; in 1681 he met with Philipp Spener during his Grand Tour in Frankfurt and in his later years kept up a fruitful correspondence with the philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The sixteen- year-old succeeded as duke of Saxe-Zeitz upon the death of his father on 4 December 1681. However, he had to accept the guardianship of his Wettin cousin Elector John George III until 1684. The relationship with the Saxon electors remained tense, similar to the other Wettin secundogenitures of Saxe- Weissenfels and Saxe-Merseburg. Suspiciously eyed by his cousins, Moritz Wilhelm sought support at the Imperial court in Vienna as well as by the Electors of Brandenburg, leading to his marriage with Princess Marie Amalie, a daughter of the \\"Great Elector\\" Frederick William and devout promoter of the Calvinist faith. It was due to his published defense of this marriage that philosopher Christian Thomasius was forced to leave the strongly Lutheran Leipzig to settle in Halle, where he was involved in the creation of the university there, under the patronage of Frederick William. Moritz Wilhelm tried to reach the acknowledgement of his Saxe-Zeitz lands as a sovereign Imperial State, referring to the princely Hochstift rights of the former Bishops of Naumburg-Zeitz; however, his attempts failed due to the veto of the Saxon electors. When he even tried to gain Swedish support during the Great Northern War, Saxon troops temporarily occupied his country in 1709. After Moritz Wilhelm's only son and heir, Frederick August, died in 1710 at the age of nine, the duke finally reconciled with the Saxon electors and waived all claims to Imperial immediacy. Already in 1699, he had given the towns of Pegau and Neustadt as appanages to his youngest brother Frederick Henry. Chosen as being the heir of Saxe-Zeitz, Frederick Henry, nevertheless, died in 1713. As Moritz Wilhelm's brother Christian August had chosen an ecclesiastical career, the secundogeniture would fell back to the main line of Wettin electors. Shortly before his death in 1717, the duke converted from Calvinism to Catholicism in order to please his brother Christian August, who was a Prince of that Church as Archbishop of Esztergom and Primate of Hungary. Forced out of his Zeitz residence, he shifted the seat of his government to Weida and retired to Osterburg Castle. Urged by his consort and the Halle pietist August Hermann Francke, he revoked his conversion a few weeks before his death. Marriage and issue In Potsdam on 25 June 1689, Moritz Wilhelm married Marie Amalie of Brandenburg (1670-1739). They had five children: #Frederick William (b. Moritzburg, 26 March 1690 ‚Äì d. Moritzburg, 15 May 1690). #Dorothea Wilhelmine (b. Moritzburg, 20 March 1691 ‚Äì d.

Moritzburg, 5 September 1694). #Sophie Charlotte (b. Moritzburg, 25 April 1695 ‚Äì d. Moritzburg, 18 June 1696). #Frederick Augustus (b. Moritzburg, 12 August 1700 ‚Äì d. Halle, 17 February 1710). Moritz Wilhelm's monogramHe died at Weida without surviving male issue. Because his two remaining heirs, his brother Christian August and his nephew Maurice Adolf, were ordained priests, Zeitz was merged back to the Electorate of Saxony.

His attempts at writing trashy/journalistic pieces is to not avail, and he gets dismissed from his job for it. He is writing another novel entitled The Major Key - although it is said to be a good book it won't sell much, not enough for him to get married on.

The narrator comes across a good review on his latest book from an American newspaper. Yet, as Mrs Highmore tells the narrator, Ralph gets dismissed again after having an argument with his editor over his elitist writings, the narrator's nagging advice, and comedian Minnie Meadows. The narrator reflects that Limbert is not capable of appealing to the masses. Ralph then moves to the countryside, poor and humiliated as he is. He writes The Hidden Heart, which again is no success.

Fr√©mont and commander of his bodyguard at the rank of major, effective September 19, 1861. Hungarian Revolution Charles Zagonyi served originally as a first lieutenant in the Hungarian Revolutionary Army during the 1848-1849 revolt. General Josef Bem assigned him to lead a picked company of cavalry. In such capacity he saved Bem's life, was captured, and imprisoned for two years by the Austrians. American Civil War On July 2, 1851 Zagonyi arrived in the United States. He worked in New York and Philadelphia as a house painter. He served as a riding master in a Boston school operated by a fellow Hungarian emigre. Here he met and married a German-American lady by the name of Amanda Schweiger. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Zagonyi offered his services to New York, but was rejected. He was invited to Missouri by Alexander Asboth where he was introduced to General John C. Fremont. Fremont assigned him to create and command his personal bodyguard. Zagonyi's force was modeled on the well disciplined Polish Hussars. Zagonyi \\"personally selected the matched bay mounts\\" and designed the dark blue uniforms and hats of Hussar style. The men carried themselves proudly. They were equipped with German cavalry sabers and revolvers. First Battle of Springfield or Zagonyi's Charge on October 25, 1861 On October 25, 1861, during the First Battle of Springfield, Zagonyi with 300 mounted men rashly charged into Springfield, Missouri, routing the Confederates. The charges proved costly in terms of casualties and the major lacked the forces to hold the city of the Union after dark. He withdrew, abandoning the city and his wounded to the secessionist forces. Zagonyi's charge would become famous, but his refusal to give credit to other attached forces alienated many fellow officers. Fremont's army would regain control of the town on October 27, and it would remain under Union control for the rest of the war. Zagonyi was sidelined after Fremont was removed from command. Fremont's Bodyguard was mustered out of service in November 1861 despite being three year volunteers. Fremont was restored to command in the Shenandoah Valley as commander of the Mountain District encompassing West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, and East Tennessee. Fremont again utilized Zagonyi as his cavalry commander, promoting him to colonel. Stonewall Jackson and his Confederates outmaneuvered and outfought Fremont's much larger force during the Valley Campaign. Following this final Fremont debacle, General John Pope was assigned to command all of the U.S. troops in northern Virginia. Fremont resigned rather than serve under Pope, and Zagonyi withdrew from service. Postwar Zagonyi returned to New York after the war and served as temporary president of the Hungarian Society there. In 1867 he attempted to return to Hungary, but lacked the money for the trip. A disputed 1871 article indicates he was the owner of a tobacco shop in Pest, Hungary. Another says he was never heard from again after 1867. Zagonyi Park in Springfield, Missouri, is named for Zagonyi and his famous charge there.

It is owned by Taylor Communications, Inc. KFRM has studios and offices in Clay Center. On weekdays, KFRM carries mostly news and agricultural information shows for farming communities. Nights and weekends it plays classic country music. Due to its low position on the dial, KFRM enjoys a wide coverage area during the day. The transmitter is off U.S. Route 81 (140th Road) in Concordia.Radio-Locator.com/KFRM KFRM is powered at 5,000 watts by day, using a directional antenna aimed toward the southeast. It puts a high quality signal over most of Central Kansas, including Wichita. And a fair signal is delivered to Oklahoma City. But it is hard to hear in Kansas City. To avoid interfering with other stations on AM 550, KFRM drops its power to 110 watts at night, when radio waves travel further. After sunset, the station's signal is restricted to communities in and around Salina.  History  A History of Radio Station KFRM, By Charles Frodsham, February 16, 2015, KFRM was founded by Arthur B. Church, a prominent broadcaster and the president of Midland Broadcasting company, operators of KMBC radio station. He had founded Midland Broadcasting in 1927 and over the years built KMBC into a high-quality full service radio station. KFRM maintained a fully staffed farm news department, complete with an 800-acre service farm, a multi-reporter local and regional news operation, home economics department, and comprehensive sports reporting. The station staff, including 30 full-time musicians and vocalists, sometimes numbered up to 130. The Federal Communications Commission issued a construction permit on August 19, 1946, for a 5000-watt daytimer radio station with the transmitter located in Cloud County, Kansas. The FCC permit was issued to Midland Broadcasting Company, which would plan to extend KMBC programming into central and western Kansas with a satellite station on 550 kc. broadcasting from North Central Kansas. KMBC would plan to feed its programming audio over telephone lines 175 miles west to the KFRM transmitter site. KFRM signed on the air on Sunday, December 7, 1947. For the next fourteen years, the KMBC-KFRM team would bring high quality broadcasting to rural Kansas. The programming would emanate from the KMBC studios, on the 10th and 11th floors of the Pickwick Hotel, at 10th and McGee streets in downtown Kansas City, Missouri. In June 1954, KFRM was sold to Cook Paint & Varnish Company. In January 1961, it was announced that KFRM would be sold to Norman E. Kightlinger and Associates, a furniture dealer and real estate and insurance agent. His major partner was investor C.B. McNeil of Tulsa. The sale to the new owners, KFRM, Inc., was approved by the FCC in August 1961. In 1965, there would be both an ownership change, and a format change for KFRM. There had been four partners in KFRM, Inc., but in September of that year, the FCC approved the sale of the station to C.B. McNeil himself, as he bought out the interests of the other partners. At the time of the ownership change, it was announced that the format of the station would change to that of country music. However, a tragic accident one week later would significantly affect the KFRM ownership and programming plans. On October 7, the 47-year-old McNeil would be killed in a crash of his light airplane near Tulsa, OK. In May 1966, the executor of the McNeil estate filed an application with the FCC to sell the stock of KFRM, Inc. to JACO, Inc., whose major stockholders were M. Crawford Clark and James C. Treat. They were executives at radio station KOOO in Omaha, Nebraska, which was owned by broadcaster John Bozeman, better known by his on-air stage name, Mack Sanders. *The following portion of this KFRM history was written by Jerry Venable, original manager of \\"The Plainsmen\\" *The story goes that in the mid-'50s, Mack Sanders came to Wichita with less than $100 in his pocket and said: \\"I'm going to own me a radio station.\\" He was affiliated with KFDI for a while, and he had a successful TV show called \\" Mack.\\" In 1965, Sanders owned an AM station in Wichita, one in Omaha, and one in Lincoln. He had a \\"silent partner\\" by the name of Port Early, a respected lawyer in Wichita. He handled the legal business, while Sanders handled the broadcasting. *The take-over of KFRM came in approximately 1967. Sanders kept it \\"close to the belt\\" for the first year or so. He did have the Ranch Boys Band, which consisted of himself, his wife Jeannie, Wayne Pollard and Gene Morris. He also had Lee Nichols and The Minshall Trio. Jerry Minshall was news director, and Maxine Egbert became head of accounting. Then he brought in The Plainsmen, who had recorded \\"North to \\" with Johnny Horton. It was the title song to the John Wayne Movie by that name. They had experienced some poor management and were almost in a bankrupt situation when he took them into his company. '' *In 1968, Sanders began to work with Roy Clark, who had been fired from the \\"Jimmy Dean Show\\" for tardiness. He paid Roy an average of $300 per date in those days. Then, Roy had a couple of hit songs, before joining \\"Hee Haw\\" in 1969. By 1972, Roy was making $50,000.00 per night. '' *In time, Sanders made the entertainment part a separate corporation, \\"Mack Sanders Productions\\", owned by \\"The Plainsmen\\", with Jerry Venable as manager. '' *Entertainment always made the difference with KFRM. Each new studio built had a full sized broadcast studio, and \\"The Ranch Boys\\", \\"The Plainsmen\\", Lee Nichols, Mack Sanders, and the whole gang did a live broadcast during the noon hour called the \\"Dinner Bell Jamboree.\\" The show lasted long after all others had ceased from this format, and it worked very well, both in revenues and audience. '' *Promotional shows were always a part of the picture. In 1972, the annual \\"Singathon\\" was held in Hutchinson, Kansas. Abram Burnett, who hosted \\"Gospel Down South\\" on Sunday mornings, served as host of the show, and it featured some of the outstanding groups on Gospel Music. \\"The Statesmen\\", \\"The Boys\\", \\"The Cathedrals\\", Jimmy Davis, etc. It never had a bad turn-out. *The big KFRM Radio Road Show had some 23 people in it. \\"The Ranch Boys Band\\", \\"The Plainsmen\\", \\"The Marshall Trio\\", Juanita Rose, Lee Nichols, among others. Mack Sanders served as host. '' Kansas agri-business broadcaster Larry Steckline, who would later become one of Kansas' most prominent and influential broadcasters, began his radio career with KFRM, for several years. In 1977, following an abrupt dismissal from KFRM (due to sale of the station), Steckline created his own \\"Mid America Ag Network\\" (Wichita, Kansas), a syndication of his \\"ag-news\\" shows state-wide, and beyond‚Äîand eventually acquired dozens of radio stations throughout Kansas.\\"Kansas FFA and Steckline partner to build chapter success,\\", August 12, 2015, High Plains Journal, retrieved July 27, 2020Oberly, Mindy, \\"Larry Steckline: A Half Century as the Voice of Kansas Agriculture,\\", August 3rd, 2015, Airing on the Side of Agriculture, re-posted at National Association of Farm Broadcasters, retrieved July 26, 2020 In 1977, Mack Sanders purchased a radio station in Nashville, where he also owned a home. He announced that he had sold both KFRM and his Wichita FM station, KICT-FM, to Great Plains Radio, Inc., a subsidiary of the Peoria Journal-Star newspaper that also owned other radio properties. In March 1985, the sale of KFRM was announced to the general partner of Compass Communications, a California organization. The sale was approved by the FCC in December 1985, and in that same month, Compass applied for the call letters of KNNN to replace the nearly forty-year-old KFRM call sign. Later, in 1986, Compass again changed call letters, this time to KICT. Compass then announced they were selling all their stations, and KICT-AM 550 was sold in July 1987, to HRH Broadcasting Corp., Herb and Ruby Hoeflicker, who immediately applied to the FCC to change the call letters back to KFRM. On Wednesday, October 21, 1987, KFRM 550 AM returned to the air. Then next sale of KFRM came on February 15, 1991, when the FCC approved the sale from HRH Broadcasting Co to Great American Broadcasting, Inc., of Kansas, headed by Mack and Sherry Sanders. Sanders had, of course, operated KFRM before, from 1967-1978. Two years later, Sanders filed for bankruptcy protection for Great American, and on May 3, 1993, he sought to assign the KFRM license back to HRH Broadcasting. Sanders died later that year at the age of 80. In August 1996, HRH Broadcasting announced the sale of KFRM to Taylor Communications, Inc. of Clay Center, Kansas. The studios and offices were moved to in September 1996, where Taylor Communications also operated KCLY-FM. Kyle Bauer was named general manager of both stations. Taylor Communications continues to operate KFRM today, making them the longest term owner of the station.

The first album it appeared on was The Birthday Party. It was later included as track two on the 1992 compilation Hits. The release of the single was part of the band's rebranding of themselves as The Birthday Party before their relocation to London. It is notable for several reasons. The mundanity of the song's lyrical subject matter, an eleven-year-old boy's birthday party, contrasts strongly to the discordance of the music. The song is also a showcase for the sub- vocalisations that marked Nick Cave's early singing style, including grunts, wordless shrieks and on two separate occasions an impersonation of a barking dog. The song also displays the band's innovative use of two lead guitarists playing two separate riffs.

L. No. 96-499, 94 Stat. 2599, 2682 (Dec. 5, 1980), is a United States tax law that imposes income tax on foreign persons disposing of US real property interests. Tax is imposed at regular tax rates for the taxpayer on the amount of gain considered recognized. Purchasers of real property interests are required to withhold tax on payment for the property. Withholding may be reduced from the standard 15% to an amount that will cover the tax liability, upon application in advance of sale to the Internal Revenue Service. FIRPTA overrides most nonrecognition provisions as well as those remaining tax treaties that provide exemption from tax for such gains. The 2015 omnibus spending bill significantly altered the FIRPTA.Ropes&Gray; ‚Äì Omnibus Bill Includes Significant Changes to Tax Law Regarding FIRPTA, REITs, and RICs Overview The United States tax law requires all people, whether foreign or domestic, to pay income tax on dispositions of interests in U.S. real estate (U.S. real property interests). Domestic persons are subject to this tax as part of their regular income tax.Domestic taxable persons (individuals, corporations, estates and trusts) are subject to income tax on taxable income. Taxable income is gross income, with adjustments, less allowable deductions. 26 USC 61 defines gross income as income from all sources, including specifically gains on dealings in property. Internal Revenue Code sections 897 and 6039C were enacted in FIRPTA;With respect to sections 897 and 6039C, see FIRPTA sections 1122 and 1123, respectively. the Act also made conforming amendments to other various provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Foreign people are taxed only on certain items of income, including effectively connected income and certain U.S. source income. Foreign persons, however, are not taxed on most capital gains. Internal Revenue Code section 897, as enacted by FIRPTA,26 USC 897, 26 CFR 1.897-1 through -9T. treats the gain on a disposition of an interest in US real property as effectively connected income subject to regular federal income tax. To ensure tax collection from foreign taxpayers, FIRPTA requires U.S. real property interest buyers to withhold 15% of the sales price. The seller may apply to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to reduce this 15% to the amount of tax estimated to be due. The IRS routinely and quickly approves such seller applications. FIRPTA applies in virtually all cases where a foreign owner of a U.S. real property interest disposes of that interest. Provisions of the law preventing recognition of gain generally do not apply unless the seller receives a U.S. real property interest in a qualifying nonrecognition exchange. History Before 1981, foreign people (nonresident, non citizen individuals, and non-U.S. corporations) often were exempt from U.S. tax on sale of real estate in the nation. Congress passed FIRPTA to require all foreign people to pay tax on dispositions of any interests in U.S. real estate. The law specifically provided that its provisions took precedence over any existing tax treaties that provided otherwise.Under the U.S. Constitution, laws and treaties have equal priority. All treaties were amended since FIRPTA was first considered have specifically permitted U.S. tax on dispositions of real property. Persons and property subject to tax Foreign persons are generally exempt from U.S. tax on capital gains.Foreign persons includes individuals who are not U.S. citizens or resident aliens, corporations organized outside the United States, and nonresident estates and trusts. See 26 USC 7701. Note that partners, not partnerships, are subject to tax, so foreign status is determined at the partner level. See, however, withholding tax for an overview of exceptions regarding foreign partnerships. Under FIRPTA, however, foreign persons are subject to tax on gains from disposition of U.S. real property interests (USRPIs). *An interest in property is any direct equity interest in the property, such as a fee simple ownership, but does not include interests solely as a creditor. Thus, co-owners of property each hold an interest in the property, but a bank holding a mortgage does not.26 USC 897(c), 26 CFR 1.897-1(c). *Real property is land, buildings, and land improvements.26 CFR 1.897-1(b). Generally, whether property is or is not real property is determined under U.S. tax law concepts, not state law. Thus, gas pumps and awnings at gas stations are not real property under U.S. Federal tax law, even though they may be realty under state law. For FIRPTA purposes, real property also includes unsevered natural products of the land (e.g., oil and gas in place in the ground, uncut timber, unharvested crops) and personal property associated with the use of real property.The regulations imply that for personal property to be associated with the use of real property the property must fall into one of four specific categories. The categories relate to natural resource extraction (wells, mines, etc.), construction, providing lodging, and providing office space. See 26 CFR 1.897-1(b)(4). *A United States real property interest (USRPI) includes shares of a U.S. real property holding corporation (USRPHC). A USRPHC includes any U.S. corporation if more than 50% of such corporation's assets were USRPIs at any testing date.For a definition of USRPHC, see 26 USC 897(c)(2) and 26 CFR 1.897-2. Disposition of an interest in a USRPHC is subject to the FIRPTA tax and withholding but is not subject to state income tax. This may be compared with the disposition of a USRPI owned directly, which is subject to the lower federal capital gains rate but is also subject to the state income tax. Gain recognition Taxpayers generally must recognize gain upon disposing property. Where the proceeds are received in more than one year, the gain is recognized proportionately over the years received.Under 26 CFR 1.897-1(d)(2)(ii), an installment obligation on sale of a USRPI is treated as a USRPI if the seller does not elect out of the installment gain rules of 26 USC 453. Thus, installment sale treatment applies to foreign persons selling USRPIs. Taxpayers exchanging property may not be required to recognize gain on certain transactions, such as like-kind exchanges,26 USC 1031 corporate formations,26 USC 351 contributions to or distributions from partnerships,26 USC 721 and 26 USC 731 certain corporate reorganizations,26 USC 354 through 358 and certain other transactions. FIRPTA provides that such nonrecognition provisions generally do not apply, and gain must be recognized. Two exceptions apply. First, gain is not recognized if the property received in the exchange is a USRPI which, if disposed of immediately after the exchange, would be subject to FIRPTA. Second, the IRS may provide other exceptions in regulations. Temporary regulations providing very limited exceptions have expired.26 CFR 1.897-6T. Regulations provide limited exceptions treating certain partnership interests as USRPIs, and thus nonrecognition. Amount of gain Under general U.S. tax principles applicable to FIRPTA, gain is equal to the excess of the amount of money or fair market value of property received over the amount of adjusted basis of the property exchanged.26 USC 1001. Where the amount received is subject to a contingency, the amount is not recognized until the contingency is resolved. Tax imposed FIRPTA gain is subject to tax as effectively connected income.See 26 USC 872 and, which excludes most income except effectively connected income from the gross income of nonresident, noncitizen individuals. The non-excluded amounts are subject to the same tax imposed on domestic persons. See note above. See 26 USC 882, which explicitly imposes tax on income of a foreign corporation connected with a U.S. trade or business. Nonresident alien individuals are subject to tax on such income at regular graduated tax rates for U.S. individuals. The deduction for personal exemptions, certain adjustments to gross income, and most itemized deductions are not allowed. Foreign corporations are subject to tax on such income at regular corporate income tax rates. The branch profits tax under Internal Revenue Code section 884 may apply, subject to the branch termination exception. The alternative minimum tax may also apply. Withholding As of February 17, 2016, buyers of U.S. real property interests are required to withhold 15% of the full sales price on any purchase of a USRPI; an increase from the previous 10% rate. However, the 10% withholding rate does remain in effect for personal residences valued above $300,000 and below $1 million. This is subject to only four exceptions.26 USC 1445. Withholding is not required: *By a purchaser for use as a residence for a price $300,000 or less, OR *Where the purchaser receives a statement from the seller that the seller is a not a foreign person.The statement must be provided under penalties of perjury. For text of the statement, see 26 CFR 1.1445-2(b)(2)(i) . *Upon acquisition of an interest in a nonpublicly traded domestic corporation where the corporation provides the required affidavit. *Upon acquisition of shares of a publicly traded corporation. To the extent withholding is required, the amount of withholding may be reduced below 10% of the full price only upon certification by the IRS that a reduced amount applies. Such certification is permitted only if the seller applies to the IRS for reduced withholding by filing Form 8288-B no later than the closing date of the sale.The IRS generally provides such certification within 30 days when the application contains all required information. The certification will specify the proper amount of withholding, subject to the stated closing price.Where the seller has applied for but not received such certification, prudent buyers will have the full 10% held in escrow at closing. Amounts so held in escrow are not subject to penalties if remitted to the government within 20 days of IRS notice of required withholding. Penalties apply to a purchaser who fails to withhold, file Form 8288 with the IRS,For filing requirement, see 26 USC 6039C. or pay the required withholding within 20 days of the sale.For payment requirements, see 26 USC 1461 and 26 CFR 1.1461-1. Treaties Many U.S. tax treaties formerly provided exemption from tax for gains on dispositions of many sorts of U.S. real property. FIRPTA specifically provided that such treaty provisions would not apply after a particular date. Most U.S. tax treaties have subsequently been amended to conform with FIRPTA treatment.

He was the fourth (but third surviving) son of Maurice, Duke of Saxe-Zeitz, and his second wife, Dorothea Maria of Saxe-Weimar. Life In √ñls on 23 April 1699, Frederick Henry married Sophie Angelika of W√ºrttemberg- Oels. Shortly after, his older brother, Duke Moritz Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe- Zeitz, gave him the towns of Pegau and Neustadt as appanage. From then on, he assumed the title duke of Saxe-Zeitz-Pegau-Neustadt (Herzog von Sachsen-Zeitz- Pegau-Neustadt). His wife Sophie died after only nineteen months of marriage on 11 November 1700. In Moritzburg on 27 February 1702, Frederick married for a second time to Anna Fredericka Philippine of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg- Wiesenburg. They had two children: #Maurice Adolph Charles (b. Moritzburg, 1 December 1702 - d.

Moritzburg, 20 May 1708 - d. Moritzburg, 8 November 1708). The death of his nephew, the Hereditary Duke Frederick August, on 17 February 1710, made him the heir apparent of the duchy of Saxe-Zeitz, because his immediate older brother Christian August was a priest. Nevertheless, he died three years later, five before his brother Maurice Wilhelm. His only son, Maurice Adolf Karl, succeeded him in Pegau-Neustadt, but, still a minor, he was placed under the custody of his uncle Maurice Wilhelm and became the new heir apparent of Saxe- Zeitz. However, soon afterwards (1718) the young Maurice Adolf himself became a priest and renounced his claims to the duchy, which made the extinction of the Saxe-Zeitz line inevitable. Without other male heirs, Zeitz was finally merged into the Electorate of Saxony after the death of Maurice Wilhelm.

While the mounds have not been excavated, distinctive pottery sherds found in the area lead scholars to date the mounds' construction and use to the Mississippian culture period, roughly 1100 CE to 1500 CE. The site was a complex regional trade center that developed and was inhabited much earlier, from 2000-600 BCE, during the Poverty Point culture within the Late Archaic period of the United States. This culture is seen in more than 100 sites on both sides of the Mississippi River, from present-day Louisiana to Mississippi; it also was linked to more distant areas through a trading network. The site has evidence of trade in raw materials and manufacture of finished items that were distributed through the network throughout the Eastern United States. The largest and most elaborate earthwork complex of the period is at Poverty Point, Louisiana. The mounds were constructed as part of a later, succeeding culture, built to mark the political and religious center of a chiefdom. There would have been numerous elite residences nearby, as well as structures to support certain crafts. Because of its importance of a regional trade center of the Poverty Point culture in the Archaic period, and long human occupation, the site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1990. It is managed by the state of Mississippi. Mississippi Highway 7 is routed near the site, which is approximately seven miles north of Belzoni. Artifacts found in the area near the site are featured on display in the Jaketown Museum in Belzoni.

This condition has been recognized in preterm neonates, in which it is associated with severe lung pathology, after vigorous resuscitation, or in the presence of assisted ventilation. This is a serious complication, which if untreated may lead to cardiac tamponade and death. Pneumomediastinum, which is the presence of air in the mediastinum, may mimic and also coexist with pneumopericardium. It can be congenital, or introduced by a wound.  Presentation  The symptomatic patient may present with dyspnea, cyanosis, chest pain, pulsus paradoxus, bradycardia or tachycardia.  Pathophysiology  The mechanism responsible for pneumopericardium is the ‚ÄòMacklin effect‚Äô ‚Äì There is initially an increased pressure gradient between the alveoli and the interstitial space. Increased pressure leads to alveolar rupture, resulting in air getting through to the pericapillary interstitial pulmonary space. This space is continuous with the peribronchial and pulmonary perivascular sheaths. From here, the air tracks to the hilum of the lung and then to the mediastinum. In case of a pericardial tear, this air enters the pericardial cavity and pneumopericardium develops. The condition may remain asymptomatic or may progress to life-threatening conditions like tension pneumopericardium or cardiac tamponade. Diagnosis On physical examination, the patient may have the classic ‚ÄúBeck‚Äôs triad‚Äù ‚Äì hypotension, raised JVP and distant heart sounds, when complicated by cardiac tamponade. Extension of the mediastinal air to the subcutaneous tissues via the fascial planes may lead to subcutaneous emphysema. When air and fluid mix together in the pericardial sac, a tinkling sound superimposed over a succussion splash is heard. This is known as a ‚ÄúBruit de Moulin‚Äù, which is French for ‚ÄúMill‚Äìwheel‚Äù murmur. Air between the anterior parietal pericardium and the thoracic cage may also give rise to the ‚ÄúHamman‚Äôs Sign‚Äù ‚Äì which is a crunching sound typically heard on auscultation of the chest, but may sometimes be heard even with the unaided ear.

In Haiti, there are a sizable number of Haitians that are either of Middle-Eastern ancestry or who trace their origins to Arab descendants. Hadrami and Levantine Arabic ancestry can be found within the Arab Haitian community known in Arabic as Bilad al- Sham, primarily Lebanon, Syria and Palestine. History The first Arab immigrants to arrive in Haiti reached the shores of the Caribbean country during the middle to late 19th century. During the time, Haiti's business sector was dominated by German and Italian immigrants. Many of them migrated to the countryside where they peddled and were very informal economically speaking. World War I, which took place when Lebanon was part of the Germany- allied Ottoman Empire, triggered a Lebanese migration to the Americas, with Haiti receiving a large number of Lebanese immigrants. Haiti received a score of Palestinian refugees during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. The country was estimated to have about 257,000 residents of Arab heritage, about 68% of them are mixed-race, mainly mixing with the Haitian mulatto elite. Social relations Arab Haitians are commonly considered as part of the upper class within Haitian society, yet they maintain their own unique presence separate from the very influential and much larger mixed-race and white Haitian populace. For years, they were shunned by the elite mulatto Haitians because of amicable interaction with the poor masses, their willingness to do business with masses and their inability to speak French. This relationship changed gradually over the years as their prominence grew in Haiti's business sector and consequently, a large percentage of them reside and do business in the capital of Port-au-Prince.

The estate is now part of Natchez National Historical Park and is open to the public by guided tours. The house is furnished for the period just before the Civil War. Melrose was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974. and History John T. McMurran, a successful lawyer and planter, had come to Natchez in 1824 or 1825 from Pennsylvania, and became a law partner of future Governor of Mississippi, John A. Quitman. McMurran married in 1831, Mary Louisa Turner, daughter of Edward Turner, a prominent Mississippi Supreme Court justice and first cousin to John Quitman's wife Eliza. After a tornado ravaged Natchez in 1840, John McMurran began planning a grand mansion on the outskirts of town, and hired Maryland architect, Jacob Byers, to design the house the McMurrans named \\"Melrose,\\" after Melrose Abbey in Scotland, that they had visited previously. Melrose is the only building that can be definitely attributed to Byers. The McMurrans spared no expense as the windows, doors, cornice moldings, stairways and floors are made out of the finest woods.http://nookstowersandturrets.blogspot.com/2011/01/melrose-in-natchez- mississippi.html Melrose in Natchez, Jan 31, 2011 In 1865, John McMurran, hurting financially due to the American Civil War, and grieving from the deaths of their daughter and two grandchildren, sold Melrose to Elizabeth Davis, the wife of attorney and planter George Malin Davis. The couple planned on moving to Maryland, but John McMurran died in a steamboat accident in 1866.http://www.nps.gov/natc/historyculture/mcmurran.htm Meet the McMurrans of Melroseaccessdate=2014-03-08 Elizabeth and George Davis purchased Melrose in 1865 as a result of Union soldiers occupying their town home, Choctaw, during the Civil War. The Davis family rarely used Melrose and it remained unoccupied for most of the next four decades. The 1883 death of George Davis as well as his daughter, Julia, as a young woman left her six-year-old son, George Malin Davis Kelly, as heir to Melrose, Choctaw and the rest of the Davis property holdings in Natchez and Louisiana. Young George was sent to New York City to be raised by his maternal grandmother. Former Davis slaves, Alice Sims and Jane Johnson are credited with being the caretakers of Melrose during this time. George Kelly married Ethel Moore in 1900 and the following year they returned to Natchez. They selected Melrose as their primary home and restored the home after its extended time of closure. Instead of remodeling, the couple decided to keep the house intact. Ethel Kelly also brought in furnishing from Choctaw to add to the furniture already existing at Melrose. The Kelly's resided in Melrose until 1975 when Ethel died. John and Betty Callon purchased the property in 1976 as their personal home, and as a venue for lavish entertainment for their company, Callon Petroleum Company. The Callons retained the integrity of the house and grounds as they took preservation issues as part of their restoration process. As a result, hundreds of photographs were taken of the property and material samples were saved that are invaluable sources of information to curators today. Mansion and grounds The interior of the first floor is arranged around a central hall and consists of a dining room, drawing room, parlor, library, back hall, storage, and service rooms. The central and back hall provide a fine example of painted floor cloth that is original to the house, and another feature is the punkah found in the dining room. Interior doorways are framed by Ionic columns and sunburst-type woodwork above. The rooms also feature plaster ceiling medallions and solid pocket doors. Bedrooms, many with original furnishings, are found on the second floor. Above, Melrose possesses an unusually large widows walk.http://misspreservation.com/101-mississippi- places-to-see-before-you-die/melrose-natchez/Melrose, Accessed Mar 9, 2014 The rear of the mansion is flanked by the former dairy building (left) and the kitchen building (right).

Plot summary Frank Saltram is a man who apparently has a towering intellect, but one that manifests itself only in sparkling table-talk. He has a real and powerful gift to delight with his conversation, particularly when intoxicated, but other than conversation he produces nothing. Saltram also recognises no obligations or duties, is ungrateful and utterly unreliable, and is apparently prone to immoral acts. He lives off others, particularly the Mulvilles, who, convinced of Saltram's genius and genuinely enjoying his talk, host him for months at a time. In the opinion of the unnamed narrator, Saltram is not a deliberate conman; he simply suffers from \\"a want of dignity\\". The story revolves around Saltram and a group of people who are fascinated by him. Ruth Anvoy, a young American woman with a wealthy father, comes to Britain to visit her widowed aunt Lady Coxon. There she meets George Gravener, a man with a real intellect and a future in politics, and the two become engaged. She also meets Saltram, and is fascinated and impressed by his talk and intellect, though aware that he has shortcomings of character. Having made a promise to her now-deceased husband, Lady Coxon has for years been seeking to bestow a sum of 13,000 pounds upon a talented intellectual whose potential has been hampered by lack of money. Having failed to find such a person, Lady Coxon tells Anvoy that upon her death the money will be left to her, and she must carry on the quest. Anvoy's father suffers heavy financial losses and loses most of what he has. He dies, and shortly afterwards Lady Coxon dies. Anvoy, having lost nearly all her wealth, has only the 13,000 pounds from Lady Coxon, with a moral but not legal obligation to give it away. Gravener urges her to keep the money, as it could be used to buy them a house once they are married. She refuses, and their relationship becomes strained. Later, she entertains the idea of giving the money to Saltram, who Gravener despises as a fraud and \\"not a gentleman.\\" Eventually their engagement is broken off. Finally, the unnamed narrator is given a sealed letter and asked to give it to Anvoy. The letter is understood to contain a denunciation of Saltram's most immoral acts. The narrator must decide whether to blight Saltram's prospects by delivering the letter. He is willing to do so if it will save his friend Gravener's engagement with Anvoy, but Gravener is unable to assure him of this. Eventually he does offer the letter to Anvoy, but Anvoy declines to read it. She awards the Coxon Fund to Saltram, who lives off it exactly as he lived off his friends, producing nothing of intellectual value. Thus the only result of the award is the Mulvilles and others lose the pleasure of Saltram's conversation.

History The earliest written reference to Aarsele dates from 1038 when it appears as Arcela, a Germanic word joining arda (= meadow) and sali (= chamber, house). In earlier times Aarsele was under the rule of the Kortrijk who had holdings divided into several fiefdoms such as Donsegem and Hogenhove. Some fiefdoms also belonged to ecclesiastical orders including the abbeys of Lobbes and of Baudelo and Saint-Baafs in Ghent. The main fiefdom however was Gruuthuse, which had 12 achterlenen (lords who are subject to another landlord). The achterlenen did not have title, which resided with the wealthy Lewis de Bruges, famous for hosting Edward IV of England at his Bruges home after the king was exiled in 1471. Lewis was also a well known bibliophile whose collection of illuminated manuscripts was given, but for a few exceptions, to Louis XII of France. \\"Vrije Basisschool Aarsele- Kanegem\\" (primary school) in Aarsele. Jan of Bruges was the last male descendant from the Gruuthuse line. After his death at the end of the 16th century, the fiefdom passed to Jakob II of Luxembourg. And by the marriage of his daughter to Jan van Egmont, the fiefdom was later transferred to the house of Egmont. In 1568, the son of Jan van Egmont, Lamoral, was decapitated on orders from Philip II of Spain in Brussels. After his death successively two childless sons came into possession of Gruuthuse. In 1617, and for the next two generations, the fiefdom was held by the Richardot family. Finally, the marriage of Guillaume to Carla-Eugenia brought an end to the feudal system, or Ancien R√©gime. As Aarsele was situated on the road between Ghent and Tielt it was not immune to plunder. Thus the municipality was devastated by the geuzen, a confederacy of nobles and malcontents, in 1580. Later during the 17th century French armies laid waste to the town in 1646 and 1690. Between those infamous dates, in 1666 Aarsele was visited by the plague. Attractions The Delmerens Mill, also called Termote Mill, is a registered grain and oil mill dating from 1897, which ceased to operate in 1956. Saint Martins Church is a nationally registered structure, with an interesting interior, a pulpit dating from about 1200 and splendid glass windows. On the south side two bas relief sculptures are a memorial to the battle which was fought in Aarsele in May 1940. In 1909, the building was rebuilt in field stone in early Gothic style and rectangular steeple. Nearby is Hooge Crater, site of a former village destroyed during World War I and a memorial to fallen soldiers who died in the area.

He served in the state legislature as a representative and in the senate for over 30 years. His son, Bezaleel Taft Jr, would also serve in the Massachusetts General Court, and in the state Senate. He also served on various state commissions, Boards and the executive council. Bazaleel Taft's 1794 \\"Georgian\\" architectural style home, is today a fine eating establishment south of Uxbridge center. A Hessian sword is embedded in the wall of this home, as partial evidence that British \\"Hessian\\" Forces, once passed through the historic Blackstone River Valley during the American Revolutionary War. The famous Taft family in America descended from a common ancestor, Robert Taft Sr, Bazaleel Taft Sr.'s great grandfather. Robert Taft Sr.'s first homestead was in Mendon, in what later became the town of Uxbridge. The Taft family is a dynasty in American politics in a number of states, throughout the USA, but especially in Ohio. William Howard Taft, President of the United States, was from this same family. Hon. Bezaleel Taft Sr. died at the age of 89 on June 21, 1839, at Uxbridge after a long and distinguished career in public service. See also *Hon.

Hnatiuk focused primarily on West Ukraine, gathering information about folk songs, legends, customs and dialects. He was a close companion of Mykhailo Hrushevsky and Ivan Franko. Member of Russian Academy of Arts (1902), the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (1905). In 1899 he became the secretary of Shevchenko Scientific Society. Editor of the Shevchenko\\"s Scientific Society publication and ‚ÄúThe Ukrainian Historical Journal‚Äù. He was the director of the Ukrainian Union of publishing.  Biography  Volodymyr Hnatiuk was born on May 9, 1871 in Velesniv, Buchach powiat, Galicia (now located in Ternopil Oblast, Ukraine). He studied in the Buchach and Stanislavska high school and Ivan Franko National University of Lviv. Even in the years of training he to study seriously folklore and ethnography. His first scientific works were published in the magazine \\"Life and Word\\", \\"The Nation\\", and other, in those period. He studied folk art in close contact with the socio-economic conditions of workers. Hnatiuk systematically made a note of folklore in Eastern Galicia from 1893 to 1902. In 1859-1903 he investigated six folklore and ethnographic expeditions to Transcarpathian Ukraine. He wrote down about 1500 folk songs, composed a few selected works such as ‚ÄúKolomiyka‚Äù (Ukrainian dance and song) in 3 parts, 1905-1907, \\"Hayivka\\" (1909), and \\"Carols and songs\\" (1914). Hnatiuk died in Lviv on October 6, 1926. He was buried at the Lychakiv Cemetery in Lviv.  Research activities  When he was a freshman at Ivan Franko National University of Lviv he took an interest in the folklore of residents of the southern slopes of the Carpathians. The first study \\"Lyrists: lyrist, prayers, words, news and others facts about lyrists of Buchach district\\" was published in 1896. Personally conducted by Ivan Franko he edited the ethnographic collection \\"Materials for Ukrainian Ethnology\\". He published a number of scientific publications about residents of Transcarpathian areas who are called lemky and also about residents of Yugoslavia who are called Ruthenians. There were further works such as: * ¬´Ruski in Bachtsya¬ª (1898), * ¬´Ruthenians in Hungary¬ª (1899), * ¬´Ruthenians of the Pryashiv eparchy and their dialect¬ª (1900), * ¬´Slovaks or Ruthenians¬ª (1901). He edited the works of the Ukrainian and foreign authors, translated into Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Polish, Russian, Serbian, Czech, Swedish and other literatures. The collected materials are celebrated for accuracy of record and have great importance for the further study of culture and life of Ukrainian, especially of Carpathian residents. A regular network for the collection of ethnographic and folkloristic materials was created by him. Numerous works on comparative ethnography, linguistics, literary criticism, organizing and publishing folkloristic materials, were also created by Volodymyr Hnatiuk. He actively corresponded with I. Franko, B.Hrinchenko, M. Voronyi, B. Lepkyi, M. Pavlik, A. Krushelnytskyi I.Nechuy- Levitsky, and others. In 30 years of researching and publishing, Volodymyr Hnatiuk published about a thousand different works. He was the first to push the Ukrainian folklore on the wide path of European science. I. Franko named Volodymyr Hnatiuk a \\"phenomenally lucky collector of all ethnographic material in which, among our older collectors, apparently, no one did believe.\\"  Works  Among the works of Hnatiuk are: * \\"Ethnographic material from Hungarian Ruthenia\\" * \\"Galician-Ruthenian folk legend\\" * \\"Kolomyyky\\" * \\"Hayivkas\\" * \\"People's stories about opryshky¬ª * \\"Carols and songs\\" * \\"Ukrainian folk tales\\" * \\"National revival of Austro-Hungarian Ukrainian\\" * \\"People's stories\\" * \\"Folk tales\\" * \\"How the world was BC.

Birth and early life in France A member of one of the oldest families of Auxonne, located on the border between Burgundy and Franche-Comt√©, Margeret was probably born ca 1565. He grew up in the turbulent period known as the French Wars of Religion, in a Protestant family. Becoming a soldier, he fought for the Protestant King Henri IV of France against the Catholic League, serving the king until Henri‚Äôs conversion to Catholicism in 1593. Mercenary service After leaving Henri‚Äôs service Margeret joined the crusade against the Turks in south east Europe. He first served with the Prince of Transylvania and then with the Holy Roman Emperor in Hungary. Next, he commanded a company of foot soldiers in Poland. He returned then to Austria where a Muscovite ambassador invited him to Moscow in 1600. Mercenary service in Russia Margeret received command of a company of foreign mercenaries (cavalry) from Boris Godunov. For his service he received an annual pay 80 rubles and nearly of land. After several years service, Margeret rose to the rank of overall commander of the Tsar‚Äôs foreign troops. He was a part of the army that was sent to repel the Pretender Dmitrii Ivanovich‚Äôs invasion of Muscovy in 1604‚Äì05. In fact, his actions at the battle of Dobrynichi were decisive in the defeat of Dmitrii‚Äôs forces. When, after Boris‚Äô death in 1605, the Tsar‚Äôs army submitted to the rule of the Pretender Dmitrii, Margeret and his foreign mercenaries had little choice but to also serve Dmitrii. In Jan 1606, Margeret was appointed commander of Palace Guards. In May of that year Dmitirii was assassinated. Although his successor Vasilii Shuskii dismissed most of the foreign mercenaries, Margeret was asked to remain. He did so until the summer of 1606 at which time he asked permission to leave, departing from Archangel for France in September 1606. Return to France - Printing of his book When Margeret returned to France he presented himself as an offering to King Henri, telling the king his adventures. Henri refused to have such a noble man killed hence he ordered Margeret to write about his experiences. Margeret spent the winter of 1606‚Äì07 writing, thankful that he was alive. The book \\"Estat de l‚Äôempire de Russie et Grande Duche de Moscovie\\" was fully sponsored by the King and printed in Paris in 1607. This book was reprinted in France several times, including in 1859 with improved notes by Henri Chevreul and the French author Prosper M√©rim√©e. It was last published in 1983 by Editions La D√©couverte/Masp√©ro (Paris) under the title 'Un mousquetaire √£ Moscou - M√©moires sur la premi√®re r√©volution russe, 1604-1614', with a large historical introduction, as well as notes and a bibliography by the French historian and Russian expert Alexandre Bennigsen. Further Mercenary Service In 1609 he joined the forces of the man claiming to be the Tsar Dmitrii, revived miraculously from his assassination in 1606. In 1610 he joined the Polish army and distinguished himself at the battle of Klushino (1611) and the march on Moscow that followed. Margeret left Moscow when he was recalled to Poland by King Sigismund. The king made him a member of the royal council but Margeret did not stay in Poland. By January 1612 he wrote to John Merrick of the English Muscovy Company from Hamburg and is thought to have settled in the Palatinate in Germany. There is no trace of Margeret after 1619.

The name is a portmanteau of 'virtual' and 'autopsy' and is a trademark registered to Prof. Richard Dirnhofer (de), the former head of the Institute of Forensic Medicine of the University of Bern, Switzerland. The term ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù in this context apparently is meant in both the modern and original senses. Virtual's Latin root word ‚Äúvirtus‚Äù (virtue) implies the qualities of capability, efficiency, effectiveness and objectivity. However, some proponents propose to replace traditional autopsy with this approach. \\"Virtual\\" also has the sense of \\"digital\\" or refers to virtual reality respectively. Dirnhofer claimed that Virtopsy fully satisfies the requirement that medical forensic findings provide ‚Äúa complete and true picture of the object examined‚Äù.E. von Hofmann Furthermore, Virtopsy also achieves the objective ‚Äúthat the pathologist‚Äôs report should ‚Äòphotograph‚Äô with words so that the reader is able to follow his thoughts visually‚Äù.Schwarzacher Concept Forensic pathology is a field within which physicians are mainly preoccupied with examining what initially are victims of possible, suspected or obvious violence that ultimately die. Clinical forensic medicine essentially does the same but with living victims; traffic medicine and age determination are applications that are not, strictly speaking, restricted to clinical forensic medicine in that general practitioners, pediatricians and other specialists also provide services for such requests. As examinations typically are performed under the legal and task restraints of investigative authorities such as courts, prosecutors, district attorneys or police, there are constraints as to cost, time, objectivity and task specification depending on local law. The most relevant step is adequately documenting findings. Virtopsy employs imaging methods that are also used in clinical medicine such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Also, 3D surface scanning typically used in automotive industry is being employed to integrate body surface documentation with 3D scene or tool scans. The choice of methods is further supplemented with 3D imaging guided biopsy systems and post mortem angiography. CT is well suited to show foreign objects, bone and air or gas distribution throughout the body, whereas MRI sequences are strong in detailing organ and soft tissue findings. A comprehensive analysis of both surface and deep tissue findings may require fusion of CT, MRI and 3D surface data. Resulting data can be archived and reproduced without loss, analysed elsewhere, or distributed to specialists for technically demanding analysis. Autopsy still produces both different and ancillary findings compared to Virtopsy results so that currently, Virtopsy is not a generally accepted method to entirely replace autopsies. In fact, the first scientific study detailing the results of comparing postmortem CT scanning with conventional autopsies was conducted by a team from Israel and was published 1994. Their conclusion already had been that single methods were not as useful to maximize on yielding as many findings as possible as the combination of scanning and autopsy were. Terms The term ‚ÄúVirtobot‚Äù is a trademark also registered to Prof. R. Dirnhofer. It describes a multi-functional robotic system. The Virtangio machine is a device that is trademarked to Prof. R. Dirnhofer and manufactured by FUMEDICA . Usage of Greek words in the context of examining deaths may not withstand the test of falsification that spearheaded the Virtopsy idea to begin with, but, in fact, usage of existing and creation of new neologisms may have to be reconsidered. Operative aspects The Virtopsy project started as a research project that was initiated at the end of the twentieth century by Prof. Richard Dirnhofer, and now covers both applied methods and research. Virtopsy contains applied research into various methods of high-tech imaging with the goal to introduce them into the practice of forensic pathology. With Prof. Michael Thali as operative head of the group, the Virtopsy research team operates out of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University of Zurich, Switzerland since early 2011. =Examination of death= The idea to conduct virtual autopsy is not new. In 2003, the British Museum contacted the University of Bern's Institute of Forensic Medicine in Switzerland for their Virtopsy to do autopsy on a 3000-year-old mummy named Nesperennub without compromising the body. While manner of death, cause of death, time of death, identification of deceased and a range of practical and reconstructive applications are obviously related to medicolegal investigation of death, Virtopsy methods were ground breaking in that they have established a new high-tech toolbox into both research and practice morphological investigation aspects of modern forensic pathology. Since virtopsy is non- invasive, it is less traumatic for surviving family members and may not violate religious taboos against violating bodily integrity. =Examination of the living= Non-invasive imaging is also conducted in living or surviving subjects, but as that has been the main clinical application of CT and MR imaging to begin with, their use in medicolegal investigation of the living is not as ground breaking as using them for investigation of death. Nevertheless, a number of applications that may be regarded as specific for medicolegal imaging applications in the living have found attraction for Virtopsy-derived methods: * Matching weapon or injury-causing agent and injury. The application of 3D surface documentation of injuries for the benefit of medicolegal reconstruction must be accredited to Brueschweiler et al. (2003). * Strangulation and estimation of risk of death. The first paper documenting systematic application of MRI to survivors of strangulation for the benefit of forensic medicine was published by Yen et al. in 2005. * Body packing. According to a paper of the Virtopsy group, CT scanning may be more suitable to body packer identification than conventional or plain abdominal X-rays.  Technology  The technology currently used for conducting a ‚Äúvirtual autopsy‚Äù comprises: * Robot-guided surface scanning for three-dimensional documentation of the surface of the body, to scale and in color. This supplements the external postmortem examination of the body\\" that is done in a conventional autopsy; * Multislice spiral CT and MRI for visualising the body in 3D. This supplements the internal postmortem examination of the body in an autopsy; * Post mortem angiography, which visualises the cardiovascular system of the deceased with the aid of a peristaltic pump and contrast medium; * Image- and robot-guided, contamination-free sampling for a wide range of supplementary forensic analyses, such as histology, bacteriology, virology, toxicology and diatomology. This procedure replaces the usual collection and storage of sample material from the body.  Virtopsy objectives  The Virtopsy idea was generated to yield results along a comprehensive number of performance indicators: * The practical objective of both research and application of Virtopsy methods are to improve the objectivity of findings made in forensic autopsies. * The academic objective of Virtopsy research is to publish original and validation type research. * Last but not the least, financial gains are also a relevant aspect of new technology particularly in the private industry sector whereas saving cost is an aspect for public institutes or offices. =Success= Virtopsy methods have helped to solve a range of cases that would have been difficult or impossible to solve otherwise. While academically, case-reports tend to be looked down on by medical faculty, they can expand the existing experience by significant contributions.  Advantages  This method offers the following advantages: * Preservation of the body in a virtual form. * Observer-independent documentation of the evidence ‚Äì \\"delegation of seeing to the machine\\". * Complete, non-destructive gathering of findings from head to toe * Data acquisition in parts of the body that otherwise would not be examined out of respect for the deceased (e.g. the face). * Data acquisition in regions that are difficult to dissect and access (e.g. atlanto-occipital joints), and in cases of advanced decomposition. * Visualization of the cardiovascular system. * Replacement of manual dexterity by the \\"virtual knife\\" of the automatic sectional imaging technique. * Standardized data acquisition procedure. * High-precision, contamination-free sampling (poisons, infections, tissue, etc.) accurate to the millimeter. * True-to-scale 3D documentation for precise forensic reconstructions. * Clean, bloodless visualization of the documentation. * Improvement in the quality of forensic reports ‚Äì simultaneous examination by different experts via tele- forensics. * Simplification of the assessment of evidence by improved comprehensibility of the visual 3D findings. * Acceptance by relatives and religious communities over conventional autopsies. * The complete saved data- set can be re-examined at any time if a second expert opinion is required, even after burial or cremation of the body. * Rapid and complete data acquisition as part of analyses following disasters (terrorist attacks, plane crashes, etc.).  Disadvantages  * High equipment costs * The limitations for radiology apply:  Metal foreign objects  One cannot determine the color of internal organs and color changes  One cannot determine all the pathological conditions (e.g. inflammation)  One cannot determine the infection status of tissue  It is difficult to differentiate antemortem from postmortem wounds and postmortem artifacts  Small tissue injuries may be overlooked * The limitations for surface scanning apply:  Recording concave features, out of view  Turning the body over for total body recording can alter the body shape due to gravity (e.g. stomach) which may disturb the merging of recorded surfaces  Recording reflective or transparent surfaces (e.g. the eye) * Merging data from multiple techniques will always result in some loss of precision * A reliance on imagery alone may lead to omissions (e.g. bruising under the scalp not visible with surface scanning) * Validity  No proper validation of the method has been made using closely prepared prospective studies  No error rate available  No juridical validity (yet)  As applicable to all simulated evidence presented in the court room, there are concerns of suggestiveness * Objectivity  It has not been investigated whether experts are consistent in their judgment  Context effects (e.g. post-hoc target shifting in cases in which injury patterns are compared to possible injury-causing objects)  Best Practice  It is for this reason that the National Research Council in the USA, as part of its proposals for reforms in the forensic sciences, has proposed Virtopsy as ‚ÄúBest Practice‚Äù for the gathering of forensic evidence [www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/228091.pdf]. In addition, the International Society of Forensic Radiology and Imaging was founded in 2012 with the aim of enabling a continuous exchange of research results among its members and developing quality standards for the techniques employed . A TWGFIM (Technical Working Group Forensic Imaging Methods) was founded in 2005 by Michael Thali and Richard Dirnhofer. It aims to promote an increasingly internationally standardised approach. Furthermore, a TWGPAM (Technical Working Group Postmortem Angiography Methods) was founded in 2012 to promote best practice. Under the direction of the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV) in Lausanne (Dr. Silke Grabherr), the TWGPAM (made up of nine European institutes of forensic medicine) is developing reliable, standardized methods and guidelines for conducting and assessing postmortem angiographic examinations [www.postmortem-angio.ch].

He attended Mainland Preparatory School for elementary education and Igbobi College in 1973 for secondary education. Subsequently he enrolled at King William's College on the Isle of Man, United Kingdom for his A-Level. He was accepted into the University of Lagos, Nigeria. He graduated from Bachelor of Law (LL.B.) with honors in 1983 and was called to the Nigerian bar in 1984. He first worked for the law firm, Bentley Edu & Co., in Lagos, and then established his own law firm, Femi Gbaja & Co. He then earned his Juris Doctor from Atlanta's John Marshall Law School in Georgia, USA, passed the Georgian bar exam in 2001, and set up a law firm in Atlanta. While in the USA, he actively participated in the election of Bill Campbell who later went on to become Mayor of Atlanta.

He represents the Surulere I constituency of Lagos State (see Nigerian National Assembly delegation from Lagos) in the House of Representatives. He is the Speaker of the House of Representation. Gbaja Biamila has criticized members of Congress for switching parties.

Labour migration from Mongolia to Taiwan began in 2004. Migration from Inner Mongolia There were a few ethnic Mongols from Inner Mongolia ‚Äì citizens of the Republic of China, not of Mongolia ‚Äì who came with the Kuomintang during their 1949 retreat from Mainland China after losing the Chinese Civil War. According to 1959 statistics from the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, there were 139 Mongol households with a total of 431 people in Taiwan, most of them belonging to Josotu, Jirem, and Ju Ud leagues. One of the most prominent such people to flee with the KMT was the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, Lobsang Pelden Tenpe Dronme, who fled mainland China in 1949 and lived in Taipei until 1957. Others were Wu Heling and Serengdongrub. Migrant workers However, there was little contact between Mongolia and Taiwan until the 21st century. Authorities on Taiwan began laying the groundwork for the importation of migrant labourers from Mongolia as early as 2002, with the establishment of a Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar and implementation of a system for checking the criminal records of prospective migrants. The plan initially faced opposition; a former chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission criticised it as \\"diplomatic pork barrel\\" and a covert attempt by the Democratic Progressive Party to push their platform of desinicisation by expanding bilateral ties with Mongolia, which the Republic of China government had previously considered to be Chinese territory and not an independent country. Taiwan's Council of Labor Affairs finally gave their approval for the recruitment of Mongolian workers in January 2004. The initial response in Mongolia was strong, with Mongolia's Central Employment Office reporting that over 20,000 people had expressed interest in a professional skills and Chinese-language training course for workers headed to Taiwan. 7,000 people were eventually admitted to the programme; 90% of applicants were between 20 and 35 years of age, and 45% were female. One Mongolian official said that Taiwan offered better employment conditions for migrant workers than traditional destinations such as Japan, South Korea, or Eastern European countries, including higher wages (five times those offered in Mongolia) and the provision of health insurance. The first workers recruited under the programme, a group of eleven female nurses between the ages of 25 and 40, arrived in mid-May 2004; the second batch was scheduled to arrive the following month. By September of that same year, a total of 77 Mongolians had come to Taiwan for work. However, the Mongolian workers had trouble adjusting to life in Taiwan; by January 2005, out of the 100 who had arrived so far, over 30 had chosen the option of early return to Mongolia. Difficulties cited included long working hours and objections from employers that female employees wore clothing considered too revealing when the weather was hot. Students Aside from migrant workers, there were also a total of 100 Mongolian students studying at universities in Taiwan; a total of 1,700 Mongolians had gone to Taiwan for professional training, especially in the legal field.

The Toledo, Lake Erie and Western operates the Bluebird passenger train, however operations were temporarily shut down due to track improvements needing to be completed in 2009, but due to vandalism, the railroad failed to reopen for the 2010 season. In 2013, the Museum's ALCO S4, #5109, was painted back into its original Chesapeake and Ohio colors in September 2013; another theft occurred soon after the 5109's repaint, the rare Nathan M5 horn that was planned to be used on 5109, was stolen off site and has yet to be found. An additional setback following the vandalism, was a failed attempt at creating a for-profit freight/non-profit passenger partnership in 2011. Following the premature termination of the for-profit's lease on December 31, 2014, Museum members returned on the rails, working on the passenger equipment, locomotives, and track in order to restore it all back into running order. On February 14, 2014, the TLEW acquired the Waterfront Electric Railway Museum at 17475 Saylor Lane in Grand Rapids, OH. A car barn, shop and a 256 square foot brick building that will be used as a gift shop and to present photographs and historic displays. Also included in this acquisition, was a former CTA Elevated Car and a PTC Snow Sweeper. Due to the for-profit's control of the mainline, TLEW volunteers focused almost all of their effort in rehabilitating the new acquisition in order to make it a feasible work space and revenue generator. By May 10, 2014 the Museum had their first open house on property, which proved to be a success. In addition to the Museum, the TLEW has a static \\"Museum Train\\" located closer to Downtown Grand Rapids with Locomotives #1 and #202, a tool car, a caboose and passenger coach. Due to the acquisition of the property, this train is now mostly reserved for special events and meetings. Ever since shutting down in 2009, the Bluebird Passenger Train hasn't made any revenue runs. However, volunteers have been working hard and made attempts for a return of their passenger train. Donations to help fund the restoration are currently being accepted at TLEW.ORG.

As an architectural type example, it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970. and Description and history The Anza House is located in the downtown area of San Juan Bautista, at the southwest corner of Franklin and Third Streets. It is a single-story adobe structure, built out of vertically placed wooden poles and mud bricks, with exterior and interior finishes of lime plaster. It is covered by a low-pitch gabled roof with redwood shingles, which extends across an open veranda extending the width of the building, supported by simple square wooden posts. It has four bays on the front, three of which are occupied by doors or full- height windows. A wood-frame addition extends across the full width of the rear, covered by a shed roof. The interior has five rooms, some of which have 19th-century redwood floors. The house was probably built about 1835, during the period when California was part of Mexico, and after the Mission San Juan Bautista was secularized. Its construction methods clearly predate developments in the late 1830s, when American methods of frame construction began to be merged into the Mexican vernacular adobe style. In the 1870s Francisco Bravo adapted the building for commercial use as a cantina, and it has generally been used for commercial purposes since then.

Biography His father, the Honorable Tazewell Taylor, was the bursar of The College of William and Mary until his death in 1850. Taylor grew up in and around Norfolk, Virginia. Tradition states that he served in the Confederate Army, but no permanent record exists within his family. After receiving his A.B. degree from William and Mary, Taylor entered the University of Virginia in the Autumn of 1867. Taylor stayed at 47 West Range (part of The Range) until 1869, studying pre-law. On Sunday evening March 1, 1868, at 47 West Range, Pi Kappa Alpha was founded by Frederick Southgate Taylor, his cousin and roommate Littleton Waller Tazewell Bradford, two of Tazewell's fellow Virginia Military Institute cadets then studying medicine at Virginia, James Benjamin Sclater Jr. and Julian Edward Wood, another medical student Robertson Howard, and finally business student William C. Alexander. It is generally indicated and accepted that Taylor was the inspiration behind the founding of Pi Kappa Alpha. He gave the fraternity its name and motto. Upon graduation Taylor continued to study law but never practiced it as a profession. He devoted himself primarily to commercial enterprises and politics, amassing a small fortune through real estate. He married Anna Brooke; they had a daughter and four sons. Taylor represented Norfolk as a Democratic member of the Virginia House of Delegates for two separate terms, 1874-1875 and 1890-1891. Taylor also served as President of the Common Council of Norfolk, a position similar to the office of mayor. Always thought of as an outstanding philanthropist and citizen, Taylor made this reputation through using his fortune generously for community service initiatives. On February 16, 1896, Taylor dropped dead on the streets of Norfolk while talking with an associate. Taylor was forty-eight years old, and most of his children were still young. Taylor was buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Norfolk along with his cousin and fellow founder Littleton Waller Tazewell Bradford. A Norfolk newspaper wrote the following upon Taylor's death: > \\"quiet and unostentatious in his manner\\" whose \\"friends appreciate his true > worth, while the city at large felt the benefits of his interest at all > times and all circumstances.\\" He was called a \\"gentleman in every sense of > the word\\" and characterized as \\"devotedly attached to his wife and family.\\" > His business associates esteemed him for \\"his earnest character, his > intelligence, and faithfulness to duty\\" and they saw in him a man \\"whose > services in public offices were distinguished by zeal, integrity, and > success, while his private life was adorned by the highest social virtues.\\" Notes References *Hart and Blount.

Roark Centennial Professor of Biology at the University of Texas at Austin. He is best known for his studies of molecular evolution, phylogeny, and vertebrate systematics. He created the popular Hillis Plot depiction of the evolutionary tree of life. Early life David Hillis was born in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1958, the son of William Hillis, an epidemiologist, and Aryge Briggs Hillis, a biostatistician. Hillis lived his early years in Denmark, Belgian Congo, India, and the United States, where he developed his interests in biology and biodiversity. He has two sons, Erec and Jonathan. His younger son, Jonathan Hillis, served in 2011 as the National Chief of the Order of the Arrow, the Honor Society of the Boy Scouts of America. His brother is computer scientist W. Daniel Hillis, and his sister is Argye E. Hillis, a professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University. Education and research In 1980 Hillis graduated from Baylor University with a B.S. degree in biology, followed in 1983, 1984, and 1985 with M.S., Ph.M., and Ph.D. degrees in Biological Science from the University of Kansas, specializing in molecular evolution and systematics. During this time Hillis developed molecular approaches for reconstructing the evolutionary history of organisms, or phylogeny, with a particular emphasis on the relationships of amphibians. He also made significant contributions to the understanding of hybridization, molecular processes of evolutionary change, and statistical analysis of biological phylogenies. He continued this research as an Assistant Professor at the University of Miami from 1985‚Äì1987, and then moved to the faculty of the University of Texas at Austin in 1987. Hillis received a Presidential Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation that same year, and was named to the Alfred W. Roark Centennial Professorship in Natural Sciences by the University of Texas in 1992. His co-authored book Molecular Systematics was instrumental in developing the field of phylogenetic analysis, and he is a co-author of two of the leading college textbooks on biology (Life: The Science of Biology , and Principles of Life ). Dr. Hillis was the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship in 1999. In 2000, Hillis was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 2008, he was elected a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences. He has served as President of the Society for the Study of Evolution, and President of the Society of Systematic Biologists. At the University of Texas, he has served as Director of the School of Biological Sciences, Director of the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Director of the Dean's Scholars Honors Program of the College of Natural Sciences, and as Chair of the Faculty Council. Hillis also owns and operates the Double Helix Ranch, where he raises Texas Longhorn Cattle.

For a portion of their careers, the 1645-57 period, they were partners in a family business.Henry Robert Plomer, A Dictionary of the Booksellers and Printers Who Were at Work in England, Scotland and Ireland from 1641 to 1667, London, The Bibliographical Society/Blades, East & Blades, 1907; p. 122. John Marriot John Marriot maintained his London business from 1616 to 1657; his shop was at the sign of the \\"White Flower de Luce\\" in St. Dunstan's Churchyard in Fleet Street. Marriot published a wide range of books on many subjects, including the religious works that were a dominant feature of his era; John Meredith's The Sin of Blasphemy Against the Holy Ghost (1622) is only one of various possible examples. In 1618 Marriot became the publisher of the Royal College of Physicians, and published their Pharmacopoeia (1618, 1619)  though his relationship with the College would prove difficult and contentious.Benjamin Woolley, Heal Thyself: Nicholas Culpeper and the Seventeenth-Century Struggle to Bring Medicine to the People, New York, HarperCollins, 2004; pp. 56-8, 288. He published Barnabe Rich's The Irish Hubbub, or the English Hue and Cry in 1617, and John Murrell's A New Book of Cookery in 1631. Yet the elder Marriot is most strongly associated with the publication of poetry and literary prose. He produced the first (defective) edition of the collected Poems of John Donne in 1633,David Lawrence Edwards, John Donne: Man of Flesh and Spirit, New York, Continuum, 2001; p. 195. plus subsequent (improved) editions in 1635, 1639, and down to 1650; he also issued volumes of Donne's sermons and other prose works. Marriot also published works of Michael Drayton, Nicholas Breton, Francis Quarles, John Davies of Hereford, George Wither, and others, some of them figures now deeply obscure (like the Poems of Robert Gomersall, in 1633). John Marriot normally operated independently, though occasionally he joined in partnerships with other stationers to produce volumes that were unusually expensive or challenging. Partnered with colleague John Grismand, Marriot published the first edition of Lady Mary Wroth's controversial roman √† clef The Countess of Montgomery's Urania in 1621. Marriot published relatively little of English Renaissance drama, though he did issue Philip Massinger's The Great Duke of Florence in 1636. In 1645, John Marriot's son Richard joined in partnership with his father; books published by their firm after that date are generally assigned to both men. The title page of their first edition of Quarles's The Shepherds' Oracles (1646) credits the publication to \\"John Marriot and Thomas Marriot.\\" The title page of the 1650 edition of Donne's Poems reads \\"Printed for John Marriot, and are to be sold by Richard Marriot....\\" On 3 May 1651 John Marriot transferred many of his copyrights to his son; he appears to have entered a semi-retirement after that date. Richard Marriot Richard Marriot actually began his career prior to his partnership with his father; he issued several works before 1645, including, in partnership with Richard Royston, a volume of Donne's Sermons in 1640.Kevin Pask, The Emergence of the Author: Scripting the Life of the Poet in Early Modern England, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1996; p. 192. He remained in business past his father's retirement and death; his shop was located at the sign of the King's Head, \\"over against the Inner Temple gate\\" in Fleet Street near Chancery Lane. (The King's Head was a tavern, located upstairs over Marriot's shop.) He continued his father's brand of publishing, with some religious works, like Edward Sparke's Scintillula Altaris, or A Pious Reflection on Primitive Religion (1652)  yet he also concentrated on literary works. He published Donne's Letters (1651), and the first authorized edition Samuel Butler's Hudibras, Part 1 (1963). He also published the first edition of the poetry of Katherine Philips in 1664  a highly controversial move. \\"In a letter published in the 1667 edition of her poems, Katherine Philips used the metaphor of rape to describe the pirated manuscript published by Richard Marriot in 1664.\\"Carol Barash, English Women's Poetry, 1649-1714: Politics, Community, and Linguistic Authority, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1996; p. 55. Philips died of smallpox in the year Marriot's edition appeared; the book inspired a debate on whether Philips intended her work to appear in print, and on the propriety of publishing women's writing. (Apparently Marriot was not shy about publishing without an author's permission. With sometime partner Henry Herringman, he issued a pirated collection of the poetry of Henry King, Bishop of Chichester, in 1657.)Ronald Berman, Henry King & the Seventeenth Century, London, Chatto & Windus, 1964; p. 19. In prose, the younger Marriot was notable as the publisher of Izaak Walton. He published the first edition of Walton's The Compleat Angler in 1653, plus subsequent editions (1655, 1661, 1668, 1676); he issued a number of Walton's other works too, in first and later editions. Walton called Marriot \\"my old friend\\" in his last will and testament, and left him ¬£10; in the same document, Walton requested his son and namesake to \\"shew kindness to him [Marriot] if he shall need, and my son can spare it.\\"Stapleton Martin, Izaak Walton and His Friends, London, Chapman & Hall, 1903; p. 186. Marriot issued other books on fishing, like Barker's Delight, or the Art of Angling, by Thomas Barker (1657), and Robert Venables' The Experienced Angler (1662). In partnership with Henry Brome, Marriot published Charles Cotton's continuation of Walton's Compleat Angler, sometimes called Cotton's Angler, in 1676. Marriot also published books by Sir Henry Wotton, Sir Thomas Overbury, and others including Nathaniel Ingelo's Bentivolio and Urania, 1660. He was responsible for some striking literary curiosities. In 1646 he published Thomas Blount's The Art of Making Devices. Treating of Hieroglyphics, Symbols, Emblems, √Ünigmas, Sentences, Parables, Reverses of Medals, Arms, Blazons, Cimiers, Cyphers, and Rebus. In 1656 he issued the second volume of an adventurer's memoirs, lushly titled The Legend of Captain Jones: continued from his first part to the end: wherein is delivered his incredible adventures and achievements by sea and land. Particularly his miraculous deliverance from a wrack at Sea by the support of a Dolphin. His several desperate duels. His combat with Bahader Cham a giant of the race of Og. His loves. His deep employments and happy success in business of State. All which, and more, is but the tithe of his own relation, which he continued until he grew speechless, and died. Richard Marriot published more drama than his father had. He issued The Spanish Gypsy in 1653, and both Revenge for Honour and Webster's Appius and Virginia in 1654. (Each of these involved inaccurate attributions, The Spanish Gypsy to Thomas Middleton and William Rowley, and Revenge for Honour to George Chapman. In the third case, Heywood likely collaborated with Webster on Appius and Virginia.) In partnership with Humphrey Moseley and Thomas Dring, Marriot published Five New Plays by Richard Brome (1653), an important collection of first imprints of Brome works.Clarence Edward Andrews, Richard Brome: A Study of His Life and Works, New York, Henry Holt, 1913; p. 41. And he partnered with Henry Herringman and John Martyn in the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679.

About Santini's birthdate by Markus Engelhardt. was an Italian priest, composer and music collector.  Life  Santini was born in Rome and raised in an orphanage, where he studied counterpoint with Giuseppe Jannacconi. Later on he took organ lessons with G. Giudi. Between 1798 and 1801 he studied theology and philosophy and was ordained a priest in 1801. In those years he already started to copy and collect music manuscripts of the Roman School. He believed that he would only fully understand these old scores if he were able to copy them. Even in the 19th century it was not easy to understand the complicated handwritten scores of the 16th century. These first copies he made, set up the base for his collection which soon became more and more important. To copy musical compositions, Santini went to look for the originals in the different libraries and archives of Rome's churches and monasteries. Thanks to cardinal Carlo Odescalchi, who quartered Santini's collection in his private palace in Rome, Santini had access to private archives held by the Roman nobility, like the Ruspoli family. In 1820 Santini published a catalog of about a thousand musical scores in his growing collection.Catalogo della musica esistente presso Fortunato Santini in Roma nel palazzo de' principi Odescalchi incontro la chiesa de SS. XII Apostoli, Roma: Paolo Salviucci e figlio, 1820 This catalog was soon recognized throughout Europe and Santini established contacts with an international range of musicologists, musicians and collectors: Karl Proske, Raphael Georg Kiesewetter, Carl von Winterfeld, Carl Friedrich Zelter and Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy. In 1835, through cardinal Odescalchi, Santini became a member of the Congregazione e Accademia di Santa Cecilia; in 1837 of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin, in 1845 of the Mozarteum in Salzburg and in 1840 of the French Comit√© historique des arts et monuments du Minist√©re de l'Instruction Publique. When in 1838 cardinal Odescalchi decided to give up his title of Cardinal to become a simple member of the Jesuits, Santini moved with his library to an apartement close to the church of Santa Maria dell'Anima, the national church of the whole Holy Roman Empire in Rome and henceforth the national church of Germany and hospice of German-speaking people in Rome. There, Santini started to organize weekly private music soir√©es where pieces from his precious collection were executed. Mainly vocal sacred music in German by Bach, H√§ndel and Graun who were mostly unknown in Italy in those days. To make German texts more comprehensible he translated them into Italian or into latin. Between 1830 and 1840 Santini's economic condition became difficult and he considered for the first time selling his collection which then numbered 4.500 handwritten and 1.200 printed scores. All important libraries in Europe, Berlin, Paris, Brussels and Saint Petersburg were interested. But only in 1855, did Santini convey it to the Roman Catholic Diocese of M√ºnster. The exact amount paid is something of a mystery. The only thing certain is that Santini received, in addition to the amount of the sale, an annuity of 465 scudi paid quarterly. At first, the music collection was deposited in rooms at the Campo Santo Teutonico, the German cemetery in Rome. Only a year after Santini's death on 14 September 1861, was his library transported, piece by piece, by donkey cart to M√ºnster. View of the library's west wing, the tower of the √úberwasserkirche in the background In M√ºnster the collection was deposited in the Episcopal Museum of Christian antiquities and fell into disuse and was forgotten for many years. Only in the beginning of the 20th century Santini's library was rediscovered by the English musicologist Edward Dent. In 1923 the Bishop loaned Santini's library to the University of M√ºnster, where the collection could be properly catalogued and analyzed. During World War II two-thirds of the University library were destroyed and the card catalogues were burned. Santini's library however escaped damage. After the first bombardments ‚Äì as a safety measure ‚Äì the collection had been moved to a Bishop's country residence. Today the Santini Collection is in the new library of the diocese of M√ºnster. Here the precious manuscripts are deposited in a proper manner and can be consulted by all. Santini composed sacred music which till today is unpublished. Some of his handwritten letters and scores are also kept in the library of the Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini  liceo musicale di Bologna¬´Santini, Fortunato¬ª, Enciclopedia Treccani on-line  Literature  * Fortunato Santini: Catalogo della musica esistente presso Fortunato Santini in Roma.

Dominion also has generation facilities in Indiana, Illinois, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. The company acquired Questar gas in the Western United States, including parts of Utah and Wyoming, in September 2016. In January 2019, Dominion Energy completed its acquisition of SCANA Corporation. Overview The company's asset portfolio includes 27,000 megawatts of power generation, of electric transmission lines, of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipeline, and equivalent of natural gas and oil reserves. Dominion also operates the nation's largest natural gas storage facility, amounting to more than of storage capacity. The company's Cove Point liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal on the Chesapeake Bay is one of the nation's largest and busiest facilities of its kind. Dominion serves more than 5 million retail energy customers in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions of the U.S. In 2017, Dominion was listed at #238 on the Fortune 500. A book about the company's 100-year history, Dominion‚Äôs First Century: A Legacy of Service, was published in 2010.Dominion‚Äôs First Century: A Legacy of Service , =Generation statistics= In 2015, 18 percent of Dominion's total electric production came from coal, 22 percent from nuclear power, 32 percent from natural gas, 9 percent from oil, 12 percent from Hydro and other renewables, and 7 percent from other sources. A strategy is being developed for renewable energy sources, primarily wind and biomass, and conservation and efficiency programs to play an increasingly important role in meeting future energy needs and minimizing the company's environmental footprint. History Dominion's corporate roots reach back to the Colonial era through predecessor companies that operated canal and river barging, street lighting, railways, and electric trolleys. In 1787, the Virginia General Assembly created the Appomattox Trustees to promote navigation along the Appomattox River. In 1795, the trustees formed the Upper Appomattox Company to build dams along the river for industrial use, beginning Dominion's history. In 1901, the water rights passed to the newly formed Virginia Passenger & Power Company. Dominion's closest direct corporate ancestor, Virginia Railway & Power Company, was founded by Frank Jay Gould on June 29, 1909. It bought Virginia Passenger & Power soon afterward. In 1925, the name was changed to the Virginia Electric and Power Company (VEPCO), a regulated monopoly. In 1940, VEPCO doubled its service territory by merging with the Virginia Public Service Company. The transit operations were sold in 1944. In 1980, VEPCO began branding itself as \\"Virginia Power,\\" while branding its North Carolina operations as \\"North Carolina Power.\\" Three years later, VEPCO reorganized as a holding company, Dominion Resources. By 1985, Dominion split its distribution operations among three operating companies: Virginia Power, North Carolina Power, and West Virginia Power. In 1986, Dominion gained territory by expanding in Northern Virginia after purchasing the Virginia distribution territory of Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO). In 1987, the West Virginia Power division was later sold to Utilicorp United, but Dominion retained ownership of the Mount Storm Power Station in West Virginia. (In 1999, West Virginia Power would be sold to Allegheny Energy and folded into its Monongahela Power subsidiary; it and other Allegheny Energy subsidiaries have since been acquired in 2010 by FirstEnergy.) Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Dominion initiated a series of expansions into regulated and non-regulated energy businesses, both domestically and internationally. During that era, the company also established itself as a world-class operator of nuclear power stations. In 2000, Dominion bought Consolidated Natural Gas Company (CNG) of Pittsburgh, and added natural gas service to its energy delivery network in the energy- intensive markets in the Northeastern quadrant of the U.S. In 2001, Dominion bought Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Company, adding to its natural gas delivery network. Dominion re-branded all of its operations in 2000 to Dominion from Virginia and North Carolina Power as well as Consolidated Gas in order to create a more unified energy company. In 2007, as part of another effort to refocus on core electric and gas operations, Dominion sold most of its Houston-based natural gas and oil exploration and production business for pre- tax proceeds of nearly $14 billion. Its onshore US oil and gas reserves were sold in separate deals to Loews Corporation and to XTO Energy, while its Gulf of Mexico reserves were sold to Eni, and its Canadian reserves were sold to two Canadian trusts. Dominion still retains some production areas in Appalachia, however.Mufson, Steven, \\"Dominion sells more of its oil and gas assets\\", Washington Post (June 5, 2007) p D04 In February 2016, Dominion Resources announced that they would be acquiring Questar Corporation. The acquisition was completed in September 2016. In 2017, Dominion Resources rebranded itself to Dominion Energy, following with a new logo. In January 2018, Reuters reported that Dominion Energy would be buying SCANA Corporation for $7.9 billion.; the acquisition was completed in January 2019. In the summer of 2018, Dominion Energy launched a \\"grid transformation program.\\" The program's aim was to build 3,000 megawatts worth of new solar and wind energy by the year 2022. The program was launched under the authority of the Grid Transformation & Security Act, a state law signed by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam. \\"The law paves the way for expanded investments in renewable energy, smart grid technology, a stronger, more secure grid and energy efficiency programs . . .\\" In July 2020, Dominion announced plants to sell natural gas transmission and storage assets to Berkshire Hathaway; the size of the deal is estimated at $10 billion. Operations Dominion's Chesterfield Power Station Dominion has three operating businesses: =Dominion Generation= Dominion generates electricity for both regulated sale in its Virginia and North Carolina markets, and also for wholesale in other markets in the Northeast and Midwest United States. Electricity generation is the largest unit of Dominion. =Dominion Virginia and North Carolina Power= Dominion is a regulated electric utility that transmits, and distributes electricity from its power plants in Virginia, North Carolina, Connecticut, and West Virginia to customers. =Dominion Energy= :*Natural gas distribution :*Natural gas transmission and storage :*Producer services :*Solar Funding - Tredegar Solar Fund I, LLC =Dominion Exploration and Production= Dominion Exploration and Production was the natural gas and oil exploration and production subsidiary of Dominion, and by 2007 was one of the largest independent natural gas and oil operators. During 2007, Dominion sold the majority of its oil and natural gas exploration and production assets to put additional focus on growing its electric generation and energy distribution, transmission, storage and retail businesses mainly in Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina. Expansion plans Dominion was a partner in a joint venture that planned to build the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, a natural gas pipeline to run between West Virginia and North Carolina. Though the project had faced stiff opposition from environmental and community heritage groups along its route, ground was broken on the pipeline in Lewis County, West Virginia, in May 2018. Dominion and Duke Energy canceled the pipeline in July 2020, citing cost increases due to lawsuits, largely from environmental groups opposed to the project. Contributions =Political= The Dominion Political Action Committee (PAC) has been very active in donating to Virginia candidates. In 2009, the Dominion PAC donated a total of $814,885 with 56% going to Republicans and 41% to Democrats. In 2008, the PAC donated $539,038 with 50% going to Republicans and 47% to Democrats. In the 2016 election cycle, the PAC contributed $1,276,016.17 to various political candidates and committees. =Charitable= Dominion's social investment program is carried out primarily through the Dominion Foundation, which gives about $20 million each year to charities in the states in which Dominion does business. Dominion also has the Benjamin J. Lambert, III, Volunteer of the Year Program. 2017 was the thirty-third year of the program recognizing top company volunteers. Dominion honors the volunteers by paying $1000 to the charity of the individual's choice. In 2016, twelve employees from Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia were selected. In 2020, Dominion responded to the coronavirus pandemic by stopping service disconnects for non-payment and helping customers who had been disconnected for not making payments to reconnect to its service. It is also waiving late and reconnection fees. The company has also directed its charitable foundation to provide $1 million in aid to help individuals and organizations fighting COVID-19. The $1 million will be offered to national groups like the American Red Cross and local organizations the company identifies.  Controversies  =High voltage lines= A number of controversies have surrounded the company's decisions to develop new routes for its electric power transmission lines. On February 13, 2007, The Washington Post reported that the power company was planning to change the route of one 500 kV transmission line to appease critics in Northern Virginia from a route that would cut through protected forest and farmland to a southern route that would bypass nature preserves and Civil War sites by running adjacent to existing power lines. However, U.S. Congressional Representative Frank Wolf (R - VA) and Governor Tim Kaine (D) remained opposed to the line, saying that there was no real need, and that Dominion was trying to bring cheap electricity from the Midwest. Dominion contested, saying that the line would bring needed electricity to growing Northern Virginia. The proposal was accepted by the State Corporation Commission (SCC) on October 7, 2008. On February 15, 2008, the SCC approved a controversial proposal for a 230 kV Dominion Virginia transmission line that would travel above ground for along a wooded portion of the Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Trail between Leesburg and Clarks Gap in Loudoun County, which Dominion again claimed was necessary for power reliability.Section of W&OD; Railroad Regional Park approved for transmission line route: From W&OD; Trail Mile 36.2 at coordinates to Trail Mile 38.0 at coordinates . Less than three weeks later, on March 4 and March 5, 2008, the Senate and the House of Delegates of the Virginia General Assembly unanimously passed emergency legislation that ordered the SCC to approve the underground construction of the line along that section of the trail as part of a four- part statewide pilot program for the development of underground transmission lines. Sponsored by Delegate Joe T. May (R - Loudoun), the legislation exempted the project from any requirements for further SCC analyses relating to the impacts of the route, including environmental impacts and impacts upon historical resources. The legislation went into effect when Virginia Governor Tim Kaine approved it on April 2, 2008.Legislative history of HB 1319: \\"Underground transmission lines; pilot program established\\" and Text of H 1319 (2008 Virginia Acts of Assembly  Chapter 799): \\"An Act to establish a pilot program to place certain transmission lines underground.\\" The Virginia General Assembly. Accessed 2008-04-21. =Wise County power plant= The company began constructing a 605 MWe coal fired power station in Wise County, Virginia in June 2008. , the construction had reached the halfway point, with the plant scheduled to be fully operational in mid-2012. Dominion calls the plant the \\"Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center,\\" which has been criticized by environmentalists as a way to make the plant sound environmentally friendly. The plant does however have the most stringent air permit for any coal fired power plant in the nation currently. The plant will burn up to 20% biomass along with coal and a small amount of waste coal known as gob. The plant's carbon dioxide emissions are currently projected to be 5.4 million tons per year. High levels of mercury emitted from the plant, which is controlled by activated carbon injection to reduce the emissions, as well as a fly ash dump near the Clinch River (a source of drinking water) are also of concern. The plant would also continue to support mountaintop removal coal mining. Supporters, including Governor Tim Kaine, stated that as one of the largest importers of electricity, Virginia could become less dependent on importing electricity from other states with a new power plant. The plant brought 1000 workers to build, and will employ 130 full-time, as well as pay 4 to 7 million dollars of tax revenue yearly to economically depressed Wise County. In September 2008, the site was blockaded by activists from the Rainforest Action Network. =Cove Point LNG import facility= In 2001 when Dominion's Dominion Cove Point LNG, LP subsidiary was scheduled to reopen, many local residents were concerned about the proximity (only 3 miles) to the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, and the damage that could be caused by an attack or an explosion at the plant. Residents thought that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission did not consider the risks before opening the plant. In 2005, Washington Gas claimed that the natural gas imported at the plant was too \\"hot,\\" meaning that it contained fewer heavy hydrocarbons and burned hotter. Washington Gas said that the hot gas caused problems for its customers and caused many of its mains to break. Dominion denied that the imported gas was the cause of the breaks and stated that expanding the area serviced by the imported gas would not cause additional leaks in the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia suburbs. =Environmental record= Somerset, Mass In 2010, the Political Economy Research Institute ranked Dominion Resources 51st among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. Dominion's Toxic Score of 16,656 (pounds released x toxicity x population exposure) represents a significant improvement from both the 2008 report (Dominion ranked 27th with a Toxic Score of 58,642) and the 2005 report (Dominion ranked 19th with a Toxic Score of 117,712)\\\\- Political Economy Research Institute: Toxic 100 Table In December 2007, a settlement between the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Dominion Energy of Brayton Point called for the company's power generating plant to install new closed cycle cooling towers that provided significant protection to aquatic organisms in Mount Hope Bay, which flows into Narragansett Bay. The 2007 settlement resolved an ongoing dispute that began in 2003. The EPA issued a final discharge permit called a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) for the Brayton Point Power Station requiring significant reductions in thermal discharges to, and water intake from, Mount Hope Bay.Settlement Will Spur Major Environmental Improvements at Brayton Point Power Plant In 2002, Dominion was responsible for 1,110,703 pounds of gastrointestinal or liver toxicant emissions, 1,440,000 pounds of musculoskeletal toxicant emissions, and 1,489,763 pounds of suspected respiratory toxicant emissions, and 1,478,383 pounds of suspected skin or sense organ toxicant emissions among other emissions that are suspected to be hazardous.Environmental Releases for DOMINION RESOURCES INC.

Kowalski, 434 U.S. 77 (1977), is a decision of the United States Supreme Court relating to taxation of meals furnished by an employer. In this case, the Court interpreted Internal Revenue Code ¬ß119(a)-(b)(4) and (d) and Treas. Reg. ¬ß1.119-1.US CODE: Title 26,119. Meals or lodging furnished for the convenience of the employerTaxAlmanac - Treasury Regulations, Subchapter A, Sec. 1.119-1 Most notably, the Court held that: *¬ß119 was intended to exclude meals received \\"in kind,\\" and so does not exclude cash reimbursements for meals like the one in question. Facts The State of New Jersey instituted a cash meal allowance for its state police officers in July 1949. Before that, troopers were provided a mid-shift meal at one of several meal stations located throughout the State. The State had decided that this system was unsatisfactory, as it required troopers to leave their patrol areas unattended for extended periods of time. The new system provided troopers with a cash allowance, which troopers could use to purchase a meal at a location within their patrol area, thus making it unnecessary for them to leave the area unmonitored. The meal allowance was paid bi-weekly in advance and was included, although separately, with a troopers salary. The money was also separately accounted for in the State's accounting system, and funds from the meal allowance account were never mixed with the salary accounts. Troopers were not required to spend the allowance on mid-shift meals, nor were they required to account for the manner in which the money was spent. This meant that troopers were allowed to eat at home if their home was within their patrol area, or to bring a meal with them to eat in or near their patrol cars. Kowalski, a state trooper, reported wages for 1970 that included only a portion of his meal allowances (he included $326.45, which omitted $1,371.09 in allowances). The Commissioner believed that this amount should have been included in income, and determined a tax deficiency. Kowalski argued that the cash meal allowance was not compensatory, but was furnished for the convenience of the employer and therefore wasn't income under I.R.C. ¬ß61(a), and that alternatively, it was excluded under I.R.C. ¬ß119. Issue When Kowalski's employer designated a cash payment as a meal allowance: *Is that payment excludable from gross income under ¬ß61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. ¬ß61(a)? *If not, is it excludable under ¬ß119 of the Code, 26 U.S.C. ¬ß119? Holding Justice Brennan, writing for the majority, first swiftly ruled out the possibility that the meal allowances payments are not \\"income\\" under ¬ß61(a): Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co. defines income as all clearly realized accessions to wealth except where expressly excluded. The Court then rejected Kowalski's two arguments for why I.R.C. ¬ß119 would expressly exclude the cash meal allowance. =Reasoning= ¬ß119 was intended to exclude only meals in kind. The Court found that Congress intended the exclusion to refer only to meals furnished in-kind. *By its own terms, the text of this section applied only to \\"meals\\"‚Äînot \\"cash\\" reimbursements for meals. (The statute excludes \\"the value of any meals ... furnished to [an employee] by his employer for the convenience of the employer, but only if ... the meals are furnished on the business premises of the employer.\\") *According to Senate Report No. 1622 (1954), \\"Section 119 applies only to meals ... in kind ... Any cash allowances for meals ... received by an employee will continue to be includable to the extent that such allowances constitute compensation.\\"Samuel A. Donaldson, Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems & Materials 81, Thomson West 2d ed (2007). ¬ß119 was intended to end the confusion of the common law \\"Convenience of the Employer\\" doctrine. The Court rejected the argument that ¬ß119 incorporated the doctrinal exclusion for benefits that were noncompensatory (or for the convenience of the employer) under lower court and administrative rulings.Id.at 80. According to the Court, the drafting process of ¬ß119 shows that Congress intended to \\"end the confusion as to the tax status of meals and lodging furnished an employee by his employer\\" under prior law.Id.at 82. Section 119 \\"must therefore be construed as its draftsmen obviously intended it to beas a replacement for the prior law, designed to \\"end its confusion.\\" Dissent Justice Blackmun, joined by Chief Justice Burger, disagreed with the Court's conclusion that the payments did not fall under the exception in I.R.C. ¬ß119. Specifically, Blackmun disputed that the statute was as clear and distinct as the majority's opinion suggested. Furthermore, Blackmun argued that the trooper's employer was the State of New Jersey, and therefore his business premise was \\"wherever the trooper is on duty in that State.\\" He concluded, > I fear that state troopers the country over, not handsomely paid to begin > with, will never understand today's decision. And I doubt that their reading > of the Court's opinion ‚Äì if indeed, a layman can be expected to understand > its technical wording ‚Äì will convince them that the situation is as clear as > the Court purports to find it.

Located in the heart of the city, Santa Maria High School is the oldest school in the Santa Maria Valley and is part of the oldest high school district in California. The Santa Maria Joint Union High School District was founded on June 6, 1893. In 1996, Santa Maria High was recognized as a California Distinguished School. History Built originally on the corner of Broadway and Morrison in 1892, the original school house sat on what is now the Ethel Pope Auditorium. In 1920, the present day school was built. The administration building and Ethel Pope Auditorium were connected and featured a bell tower. However, due to strict earthquake codes enforced after the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, portions of the school was condemned and demolished. The only original structures that remain are the Administration offices, the Auditorium, and the Choir, Science, Journalism, and English hall. One former SMHS faculty member of note is Dean of Girls Ethel Pope. The teacher started the school newspaper, The Breeze, which first published in 1924 and is still active today. In 2007, Santa Maria High School became a closed campus, meaning that students are not allowed outside of school grounds for lunch. The only exception to this rule is for seniors in good academic and financial standing with the school; i.e., those with passing grades and no outstanding fee obligations. The school's new cafeteria now serves meals and is a gathering place for students at lunch. Santa Maria High School has remodeled and added on sections in recent years including a new library, pool, health center, and cafeteria. Dave Boyd Field has also been renovated with a new synthetic turf and track, home stands and press box. The new stadium has been dedicated to longtime athletic director Ralph Baldiviez. On May 28, 2016, presidential candidate Bernie Sanders held a campaign rally on campus at Dave Boyd Field. Athletics Santa Maria High School athletic teams are nicknamed the Saints, and its mascot is Sammy the Saint. Since 2018, the school has competed in the Central Coast Athletic Conference, a conference affiliated with the CIF Central Section. Previously, SMHS was a long-time member of the CIF Southern Section (CIF-SS) and the Los Padres League. Santa Maria has earned CIF-SS championships in football, boys' and girls' basketball, boys' water polo (1991), boys soccer (2005 Division IV), and boys baseball (2017 Division VI).

Clayton Homes is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Clayton's corporate headquarters are in Maryville, Tennessee. Its subsidiaries include Vanderbilt Mortgage, 21st Mortgage, the nation's largest manufactured home lender, and insurance company HomeFirst Agency. History Clayton Homes was founded in 1956 by Jim Clayton. In 1974, Clayton Homes established its own mortgage company, and added a manufacturing division in 1975. The company went public in 1983, trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Each year from 1989 through 1992, Clayton Homes was named on the Forbes list of the best small companies in America. Kevin Clayton, Jim Clayton's son, took over the company in 1999. In 2002, Clayton earned a revenue of $1.2 billion. It was acquired by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in 2003 for $1.7 billion. Cerberus Capital Management also expressed interest in bidding for the company. The certificate of merger was filed in Delaware, and Clayton stock was removed from the New York Stock Exchange. In 2007, Clayton Homes' revenue was $3.66 billion. Clayton Homes sold its land-lease communities business to Denver- based Yes Companies LLC in 2008. The deal involved 65 properties in 11 states. The i-house brand was introduced in May 2008 as a green, energy efficient home.Clayton's I-House: Prefab Green Homes Get Affordable. Popular Mechanics. January 15, 2009. accessed Jan 5, 2013. By 2009, Clayton Homes had sold over 1.5 million homes. In 2009, Clayton launched the eHome as a more affordable version of the i-house. In 2015, Clayton worked with Oak Ridge National Library and architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to produce a 3D printed house and car which share a single energy unit. Clayton Homes expanded into the traditional home building market with the acquisition of Georgia- based homebuilder Chafin Communities in 2015, and Tennessee-based Goodall Homes in 2016. Clayton acquired River Birch Homes, based in Hackleburg, Alabama, in April 2016. The following month, Clayton hosted its first Birmingham-based home show. The show had 492 attendees and featured 27 homes from 27 facilities. That same month, Clayton announced that it would partner with nonprofit Next Step to build a modular duplex in Waco, Texas on a lot owned by NeighborWorks Waco in order to create affordable housing in the Greater Waco area. In 2016, Clayton Homes was recognized as number 292 on Forbes' list of America's Best Employers. The company introduced a line of tiny homes during fall 2016 with the debut of its \\"Low Country\\" prototype in North Carolina. The designer series received media acclaim from USA Today, The Post and Courier, among others. On July 10, 2017, Clayton Properties Group announced the purchase of home building operator, Birmingham, Alabama-based Harris Doyle Homes. With this purchase, Berkshire Hathaway's Clayton unit lands its fifth site-build purchase, showing emerging synergies among Warren Buffett's housing ecosystem of companies.

Plot summary The narrator suggests writing an article on Neil Paraday an author; his new editor agrees. The former spends a week with Neil and writes the article whilst there, alongside reading Paraday's latest book. His editor rejects the article however; he decides to write an article for another newspaper, but it goes unnoticed. Neil Paraday gets excited about writing another book, despite the fact that he doesn't seem successful still. However the narrator comes across a praiseful review in The Empire. Mr Morrow, a journalist suddenly interested in writing about Neil Paraday's life now that he is successful, comes round and ends up scaring the writer; the narrator manages to see him off. He tells Mr Morrow all there is to know about Paraday is in his work; the journalist is not amused. Later, he publishes an article on Neil's house in the Tatler. Embracing his fame, Paraday takes to going to London luncheons with women. The narrator meets Miss Hurter, an American admirer of the writer's, in his house. As the writer is again busy with Mrs Wimbush, he explains to the girl that the best thing she can do is not to bother Paraday and only admire him from afar, so as not to interfere with his writings. Nevertheless, he keeps her autograph album to show it to him. Later, he meets with her to read passages from Paraday; once while they are at the opera he points Paraday out to her. The narrator is annoyed with Mrs Wimbush for inviting Paraday to a party at Prestidge. Subsequently, he quotes from a letter sent to Miss Hunter while he was at the party. In this mise en abyme, he describes the way the other guests have not read Paraday's works; worse still, Lady Augusta confesses to having mislaid the text is expected to read out the next day - there is no extra copy. Paraday falls gravely ill; the guests, enhanced by the Princess, are merry since the party seems to be a success. Dora Forbes joins them - later to become Mrs Wimbrush's next 'henpecked' writer. The party is called off on doctors order; the Princess lets him pass away in one of her houses. Before his death, Paraday had asked the narrator to publish an unfinished text by him. Although the one lost by Lady Augusta has not been found again, the narrator and Miss Hurter, who eventually marry, shall keep Paraday's memory alive through their dedication to his texts.

The subject was close to his personal experience, as he emphasized in the first lines of the notebook entry: \\"Could not something be done with the idea of the great (the distinguished, the celebrated) artist - man of letters he must, in the case, be - who is tremendously made up to, feted, written to for his autograph, portrait, etc., and yet with whose work, in this age of advertisement and newspaperism, this age of interviewing, not one of the persons concerned has the smallest acquaintance? It would have the merit, at least, of corresponding to an immense reality - a reality that strikes me every day of my life.\\" James goes on to imagine plot details that correspond closely to the finished story - \\"They must kill him\\" - and to sketch some of the characters who would later become the narrator, Mrs. Wimbush, Guy Walshingham and Dora Forbes. He emphasizes that the style of the story must be \\"admirably satiric, ironic\\" to avoid any hint of mawkishness or self-pity.Leon Edel and Lyall Powers, editors (1987). The Complete Notebooks of Henry James, p. 87-88. Oxford University Press, New York. . The story appeared in James' New York Edition. In his preface James recalled how happy he was that the editors of The Yellow Book, where The Death of the Lion was first published, allowed him to expand the tale beyond the rigid length limitations often imposed on short story writers. He then discusses the tale's plot, noting how society often cares little for the subjects of its fawning attention, even to the point of literally killing them with overdone consideration. In a wryly humorous note James says of the lion, Neil Paraday: \\"I yet had met him - though in a preserve not perhaps known in all its extent to geographers.\\"Leon Edel and Mark Wilson, editors (1984). Henry James: French Writers, Other European Writers, The Prefaces to the New York Edition, p. 1225-33. Library of America. . Criticism The Death of the Lion has enjoyed generally favorable criticism over the decades. Reviewers have admired the tale's sardonic, tartly comic view of literary \\"lionization\\" by unknowing and careless admirers, who may have only the slightest (if any) acquaintance with the lionized author's works. Frank Kermode, for instance, in his introduction to a Penguin collection which includes the story, appreciated James' \\"achievement of rendering a tragic donn√©e in the mode of irony and even, at moments, of farce.\\"Frank Kermode, editor (1988). Henry James: The Figure in the Carpet and Other Stories, p. 21-23. Penguin Books. . The story clearly has autobiographical resonance, as James himself states in the Notebook entry. But the story's style eliminates any hint of self-pity, as Robert Gale pointed out: \\"James must have seen himself as lionizable; so the story has an autobiographical touch, although totally without self-pity and although James would never have submitted to social exploitation the way Paraday foolishly does...The story is saved from being sad not only by its pervasive ironic and comic tone, but also by its unique ending: two young people marry and pursue an impossible dream, symbolized by a sought-for but never-to-be-found literary treasure.\\"Robert Gale (1989).

She received her Master of Fine Arts from the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University in 1995 and is currently an Associate Professor at Michigan State University in East Lansing, where she teaches Foundation Courses and Senior Seminar. She hand-builds porcelain and uses other materials such as paper and hair. Much of Lee's work is derived from an isolation that is created by her trans-cultural identity of both Korea and the United States. Lee's works serve as a means to express and internally reconcile her two dichotomous cultural worlds. Being Korean, but living in the US, she finds that neither place is her home. Lee says that her ‚Äú‚Ä¶sense of ‚Äòhome‚Äô is a spectrum of emotions...of yearning for belonging, wholeness, and rootedness.‚Äù The possibility that these two worlds might coexist is embedded deeply in her work. To her, ‚Äú...art is a reflection of the human experience.‚Äù Lee‚Äôs work is meditative in both the ways it is made and conceived. Her journal is an essential part of her creative process. For her, writing is a solitary act of contemplation that distills her ideas to the most essential forms. The same applies in her studio life; working is a solitary act. The obsessive nature of her work, especially with making multiples, creates a meditative space that is vital in her work. The effect is forms like hundreds of bundles of tiny needleslike porcelain coils or a row of wafer-thin porcelain discs. Her forms are reduced to the ‚Äúultimate necessities‚Äù and hark back to minimalist and formalist work. The reductive nature of her work makes important every undulation, the subtle variation, and the ‚Äúslightest twitch in the nervous system.\\"Craig, Gerry, ‚ÄúIntangible Landscape‚Äù Sculpture v 25 (January/February 2006) 50-51 References  Bibliography  *Craig, Gerry, Intangible Landscape Sculpture v 25 (January/February 2006) 50-51 *Jae Won Lee, Jae Won Lee The Studio Potter v 34(December 2005) 15-17 *Lee, J W [Jane Hartsook Gallery, Greenwich House Pottery, New Your; exhibit].

Alexander (1848‚Äì1937) was an author of over ten works, over sixty- five year employee of The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, and a founder of Pi Kappa Alpha. Biography Alexander was born to theologian James Waddel Alexander on September 5, 1848. His paternal grandfather was Archibald Alexander, a preacher and theologian, President of Hampden-Sydney College and founder of Princeton Theological Seminary. William's mother was a member of the prestigious Cabell family who assisted Thomas Jefferson in the founding of the University of Virginia. Although Alexander was born in New York, much of his childhood schooling was at a Virginia school. During the American Civil War he lived in England with his mother, as his father died in 1859. While attending The University of Virginia he became the youngest of the six founders of Pi Kappa Alpha. Sunday evening March 1, 1868, William Alexander, Frederick Southgate Taylor, Littleton Waller Tazewell (Bradford), James Benjamin Sclater Jr., Julian Edward Wood, and Robertson Howard founded Pi Kappa Alpha at 47 West Range. Despite close contact with his uncle and three fellow fraternity founders all involved in medicine, Alexander sought to pursue the realm of business with Taylor and Tazewell. Shortly after leaving the University of Virginia, Alexander was offered a temporary position with The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, where his uncle, William Cowper Alexander, had served as first president. However the position became good for over sixty-five years once Alexander's drive and business capacity were realized. He gained positions of assistant secretary, and then company secretary. For over fifty years he oversaw the company as supervisor of publications, editor of periodicals, and the advertising in general. He wrote several histories of the company and was honored on many occasions for services rendered. He published over ten books, most of which dealt with life insurance, sales, or both. The youngest and eldest of the original founders, Alexander preserved his interest of Pi Kappa Alpha, including its massive growth and success. He stayed involved with the fraternity, its founding, ritual, history, and current affairs. He published articles in the fraternity quarterly newsletter quite regularly. Alexander married Frances Gordon Paddock in 1887 and they had a daughter. Frances died in 1931. He died at nearly ninety years old in 1937 and is buried in the Princeton Cemetery, Princeton, New Jersey. References *Hart and Blount. (Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity 1968). A History of Pi Kappa Alpha.

Although olive oil is well known for its flavor and possible health benefits, the leaf and its extracts remain under preliminary research with unknown effects on human health.  Leaf characteristics  The silvery green leaves are oblong, measuring long and wide. When consumed, leaves have an astringent bitter taste.  Chemical compounds  Olive phenolics are much more concentrated in the leaves compared with olive fruit or olive oil: 1450 mg total phenolics/100 g fresh leaf vs. 110 mg/100 g fruit and 23 mg/100 ml extra virgin olive oil. Chemical compounds in unprocessed olive leaf are oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol, as well as polyphenols and flavonoids, including luteolin, rutin, caffeic acid, catechin and apigenin. Elenolic acid is a component of olive oil and olive leaf extract. It can be considered as a marker for maturation of olives. Oleuropein, together with other closely related compounds such as 10-hydroxyoleuropein, ligstroside and 10-hydroxyligstroside, are tyrosol esters of elenolic acid. The phenolic composition of olive leaf extract varies according to plant variety, harvesting season and method, leaf maturity, storage conditions and extraction method.  Historical uses  Historically the benefits of olive leaves have been used in traditional medicine practices as folk remedies for the treatment of various illnesses. However, scientific evidence for health effects of using olive leaf extract has been deemed insufficient by the European Food Safety Authority to prove any cause-and-effect relationship.

It was built in 1872 at the junction of the Housatonic Railroad and the Connecticut Western Railroad which was acquired by the Central New England Railway. . Architecture The station was located at the level junction between the two rail lines, making a right angle right at the crossover. The angle of the building was a 3-story tower, at the top of which sat the electric telegraph operator. The two 90-foot (27-meter) wings of the building were occupied by the two railroad companies. The first floor of the station had a large restaurant that was especially important before the development of the dining car. Eventually, both the Central New England and the Housatonic Railroad became a part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The New Haven was later merged into the Penn Central Transportation. Decline The station had been a junction and transfer point for passengers shifting from north-south NYNHH trains (Berkshire Division) to east-west CNE trains (mainline: Campbell Hall to Springfield and Hartford). Passenger service on the CNE line through the station ended in 1927 when the NYNHH acquired the CNE.Karr, Ronald Dale (1995). The Rail Lines of Southern New England. Branch Line Press. p. 117 The station was no longer used for passenger service after 1971 when the Penn Central ended its unnamed successor to the Berkshire train, and regular freight service on the line ended in 1974. The station then became a retail location, with a restaurant in the southeastern wing. When the railroad was reopened as the new Housatonic Railroad in 1980, the station was not repurchased, though the new company did maintain offices there for many years. The station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was also included in the Canaan Village Historic District in 1990. More than half of the station ‚Äî namely the southeast half ‚Äî was destroyed by arson late in the evening of October 12, 2001.

It is located at 32.1¬∞S, 101.2¬∞W, south of the crater Dinorwic and southeast of the crater Virrat. It is named after a town in Saskatchewan, Canada, and its name was approved by the International Astronomical Union in 1991.NASA World Wind 1.4. NASA Ames Research Center, 2007. According to a surface age map of Mars based on US Geological Survey data, the area around Tugaske is from the Noachian epoch, which places the area's age at 3.8 to 3.5 billion years ago. The elevation around the rim averages about 6700 meters above zero altitude, and the deepest part of the crater floor, in the central pit, measures 5,100 meters above zero altitude. The crater is therefore about 1.6 kilometers deep.

It is based on the surviving letters of Galileo Galilei's daughter, the nun Suor Maria Celeste, and explores the relationship between Galileo and his daughter. It was nominated for the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography.  Historical background  Virginia Galilei (1600‚Äì1634) was Galileo's first child, born in Padua, Italy. Galileo never married the mother of his three children, meaning they were all born illegitimate. With little prospect of marriage for his two daughters due to their illegitimacy, Galileo sent Virginia and her sister, at the age of thirteen and twelve respectively, to live in the San Matteo Convent, Arcetri, for the rest of their lives. Virginia adopted the veil in 1616, changing her name to Suor Maria Celeste. Maria Celeste maintained contact with her father throughout her entire life through letters. Although none of Galileo's letters are known to have survived, 120 of Maria Celeste's exist. These letters, written from 1623 to 1634, depict a woman with incredible brilliance, industry, sensibility and a deep love for her father. Maria Celeste died of dysentery in 1634.  Storyline  Galileo's Daughter takes place in the late 16th and 17th century in Italy and through their letters to each other, details the close relationship between Galileo and his daughter Suor Maria Celeste. Written in endearing tones and using complimentary titles to address him, Maria Celeste's letters show the great love and respect she had for her father. Furthermore, contact with her father allowed her news of the outside world, as she herself was isolated within the convent. But the letters between Maria Celeste and Galileo served more than to maintain contact ‚Äì she also had a genuine interest in her father's scientific work, sometimes even offering her own opinion on an issue. Additionally, Galileo's personal life is glimpsed as he and his daughter discuss various details regarding the running of the household, remedies for health and other family matters. Additionally, the book chronicles some of Galileo's scientific work. Galileo's astronomical discoveries, Dava Sobel claims, led him to adopt the Copernican system, in which the Sun is the center of the Solar System with all the planets orbiting it. However, according to the standard cosmology at that time, as developed by Aristotle and Ptolemy the Earth was the center of the universe and was stationary. When Galileo wished to publish a book which argued for the Copernican system, he attained the required stamp of approval from the religious authority (a requirement for all books published in Italy at the time). The work, the Dialogue of the Chief World Systems, was denounced to the Roman Inquisition. Following inquisitorial hearings, Galileo's work was condemned for violating conditions on the original permission to publish and for proposing heliocentrism as reality rather than as hypothesis. The Inquisition required him to renounce heliocentrism and promise to neither teach or write about it any longer. Galileo returned to Florence and continued to lead a pious life as a Catholic. He continued his research but now on matters only indirectly related to heliocentrism, which in fact were quite necessary for a full scientific revision of the cosmos to heliocentrism. While the state of research by the middle of the seventeenth century did not absolutely prove the heliocentric system, the Ptolemaic system had lost all credibility, and more traditional astronomers looked to alternatives such as that provided by Tycho Brahe as a more rational blend of old and new models. Besides being a biography of Galileo and his daughter, the book describes Galileo's scientific work. In addition to Galileo's well-known enhancements and use of the telescope and his conviction of the correctness of the Copernican system, he had many other scientific achievements. Dava Sobel claims he discovered and investigated sunspots, which again did not bring him much favor with the Church, which, she claims, held the Aristotelian beliefs of the heavens containing only perfect unchanging celestial spheres. He improved the compass and developed a rudimentary thermometer. He devoted the last ten years of his life to the study of bodies in motion, laying the groundwork for Isaac Newton's laws of motion formalized in the next decades. Perhaps his greatest achievement was his promulgation of experimental science, the cornerstone of the scientific method, as his Aristotelian predecessors in science claimed something is true simply because it is obvious.

History =1988‚Äì2000: Early years= Dresden's zeal for dance music and culture developed early in high school where he frequented local Connecticut dance clubs and befriended The Caf√©'s DJ Moby, a local disc jockey. His early experiences at the Caf√© fueled his passion to immerse himself in the culture that would become his career and lifelong obsession. From there, he purchased a pair of Technics SP-1300 pitch controlled CD players and got to work. Dresden quickly cultivated a following due to his simple but effective music policy; play the right track at the right time and only play great songs. His ambitions did not stop with spinning. While he continued to play in the clubs sometimes five nights a week, he became a dance music journalist by day. Dresden was named a reporter to the Billboard dance chart, and he began writing reviews and features for national magazines such as Dance Music Authority, DJ Times and Mixer. Dresden profiled Daft Punk, Paul Oakenfold, Moby, Masters at Work, Todd Terry, Sasha & Digweed, Puff Daddy, BT, Crystal Method, Keoki, Josh Wink, Chemical Brothers, Deep Dish amongst many others. Many of these artists' first American press came through Dresden's journalism efforts. Dresden's affiliation with respected publications gave him easier access to obscure and unreleased tunes upfront, giving him an edge. He regularly contributed his A&R; skills to Promo Only CD's and its \\"Mainstream Club\\" \\"Import Club\\" and \\"Alternative Club\\" series. In addition, he scouted new music for Pete Tong's highly influential Essential Selection radio show on the BBC Radio 1. Through his efforts there, Dresden hipped Pete to some rather large records, many of which became \\"Essential New Tunes\\", Tong's method of gauging a guaranteed hit. Dresden's wide knowledge of dance music led to the opportunity to help select songs for Nettwerk Records' popular \\"Plastic Compilation\\" series. Dresden has also had a hand in producing compilation CD's and single releases with other independent labels such as Strictly Rhythm, Strictly Hype, 4 Play and Max Music. In addition, he's accredited by his own releases for Strictly Hype's trance offshoot Sunrise; \\"Trancendence: The First Wave\\", and the hit packed \\"Transit\\". His radio career began with the long running, highly rated \\"Electro Circus,\\" which aired on Hartford, Connecticut's modern rock station WMRQ-FM from 1996 until 2000. Dresden's radio career continued as music director and on-air personality for grooveradio.com, an internet radio station during the year 2000. =2001‚Äì2008: Gabriel & Dresden= In 2000 Dave became the Music Director of Swedish Egil's grooveradio.com where he met Pete Tong, who asked him to help find music for the Essential Selection. They met at a party being hosted by grooveradio.com at the Miami Winter Music Conference in March 2001. Josh Gabriel gave Leon Alexander a record, the record was \\"Wave 3\\", which Dave then gave to Pete Tong, and he played it on the Essential Selection and also used it for his compilation that same year. Pete gave Dave the opportunity to do a remix of New Order Someone Like You and Dave asked Josh to work on it with him. The two joined forces in 2001 and made a name for themselves by creating numerous remixes for artists as diverse as Ti√´sto, Paul Oakenfold, Sarah Mclachlan, Way Out West, Annie Lennox, Duncan Sheik, and Jewel (singer). In 2002 Gabriel & Dresden released their first single \\"Lament\\" on Saw Recordings in the United States. The duo released numerous singles and number one Billboard hits like \\"As the Rush Comes\\" (as Motorcycle, \\"Tracking Treasure Down\\" and \\"Dangerous Power\\"; they also released one self-titled studio album together, Gabriel & Dresden which was named as the \\"2006 Album of the Year\\" by M8 magazine. The duo won the 2007 and 2008 IDMA award for \\"America's Best DJ\\". He has achieved 21 Billboard Dance Chart #1 tracks (remixes and originals) as \\"Gabriel & Dresden\\", composed music that has appeared on Fox, HBO, NBC and CBS TV shows. Gabriel & Dresden have their own record label, Organized Nature which is distributed by Armada Music. =2009‚Äì2010: Solo years= After the break-up of Gabriel & Dresden, Dave collaborated with Chris Cox on a track called \\"Whole Wide World\\", which was played on Pete Tong's Essential Selection on April 4, 2008. Dave also worked with Trent Cantrelle on a remix for Serge Devant's cover of the Beloved's \\"Sweet Harmony\\". On June 22, Dave opened a set for Ti√´sto's In Search of Sunrise: North American Summer Tour 2008 in Connecticut. He also co-wrote and co-produced \\"I've Had Friends\\" with Morgan Page which was the 4th single from his album Believe (Morgan Page album) In December 2008, Dresden teamed up with longtime friend and Mephisto Odyssey founder Mikael Johnston to remix Lily Allen's \\"The Fear\\" under the new moniker Dresden and Johnston. The new production duo went on to remix a number of artists including Nadia Ali's \\"Love Story\\" and Enrique Iglesias's \\"Tonight (I'm Fuckin' You)\\", all of which hit the #1 position in Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs Chart. Dresden and Johnston's first original single called \\"Keep Faith\\" Featuring Mezo Riccio followed in early 2010 and went to #10 in Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart and top 5 on Sirius radio's BPM (Sirius XM) and Club Phusion. The single featured remixes by fellow producers Morgan Page and Harry Romero. A forthcoming full-length album by the duo featuring guest vocalists Nadia Ali, Jan Burton and Skylar Grey was planned but is yet to be released. = Gabriel & Dresden reunion (2011‚Äìpresent)= On December 31, 2010, Gabriel & Dresden reunited for special one off New Year's Eve celebration alongside ATB and Francis Preve at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. Shortly afterward, the duo were booked on the Anjunabeats WMC Miami party at the Ice Palace as a special guest. Since this event, Gabriel & Dresden have officially announced themselves as reunited. Since the reunion, Gabriel & Dresden have performed at many clubs and festivals around the world including Electric Daisy Carnival (Las Vegas, Dallas, Chicago & Orlando), Tomorrowland in Belgium, Electric Zoo Festival in New York, Sunburn Festival in India, Escape From Wonderland, Nocturnal Wonderland, Paradiso Festival, Creamfields Australia, ASOT 550: Invasion, Ministry of Sound, London, Zouk and a monthly residency at the Marquee Las Vegas in Las Vegas. In 2011 they signed an artist deal with Armada Music which brought forth their mix compilation \\"Mixed for Feet, Volume 1\\" as well as numerous singles including 2012'a \\"Play it Back\\" featuring Betsie Larkin, \\"Tomorrow Comes\\" with Neil Ormandy (2013), \\"Shatter\\" (with D-Wayne) and a re-working of Tracking Treasure Down Revisited. On February 3, 2014, they restarted their monthly radio show \\"Gabriel & Dresden present Organized Nature\\" on Digitally Imported's progressive channel.

History Glenshire was built from 1972 to 1976. In the 1960s, prior to the development of Glenshire, the State of Texas had acquired the right of way to construct Beltway 8 in the area. In 1989 residents of Glenshire said they would sue the State of Texas over the construction of Beltway 8. Bill Hill, the Glenshire Community Association president, threatened to file an injunction if the state did not address the concerns that Glenshire residents had. The residents wanted better access between the two halves of the subdivision that the Beltway would form. In 1990 Glenshire obtained a court order that halted the construction of a portion of West Airport Boulevard between Riceville School Road and a Beltway 8 path. The residents feared that noise and volume of high speed traffic could affect the neighborhood, and they said that there was inadequate notice was given for public input.

Clayton, Sr. (born 1934) is an American businessman, investor, and philanthropist. He founded Clayton Homes in 1966 and built it into the United States' largest producer and seller of manufactured housing, a publicly traded company that was sold to Berkshire Hathaway in 2003 for $1.7 billion. Early life James L. Clayton was born March 2, 1934 in Finger, Tennessee. His father was a sharecropper. As a child, he aspired to become a country music singer. After high school, he went to Memphis to attend college and perform in honky tonks. After becoming ill at the end of the first year, he transferred to the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, where he was a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and received an engineering degree in 1957. He received a law degree from the University of Tennessee College of Law in 1964. Career While a student, Clayton started an informal business of fixing and reselling used cars, establishing a used-car business in 1956. That business grew into a group of Knoxville-area automobile dealerships operated by Jim Clayton and his brother Joe; Jim Clayton sold his interest in the business to Joe in 1981. Clayton branched into the mobile home business in 1966. Clayton published an autobiography, First a Dream (FSB Press, ), in 2002, cowritten with Bill Retherford. Reportedly, the book motivated Warren Buffett to buy Clayton's company, but a 2004 article in Fast Company magazine suggested that the story was not as simple as was widely reported. Philanthropy Clayton has made many charitable contributions in the Knoxville area, including a $3.25 million donation for construction of the Knoxville Museum of Art; a $1 million donation to the University of Tennessee College of Law for its Center for Entrepreneurial Law; and a $1 million donation to East Tennessee Baptist Hospital to establish the Clayton Birthing Center. With his wife, Clayton also made two $1 million donations to Freed-Hardeman University in Henderson, Tennessee, which is near his home town. 2020 helicopter crash On August 3, 2020, Clayton, along with his brother Joe, Clayton Holdings VP Flynt Griffin, and developer John McBride, were onboard Clayton‚Äôs Eurocopter EC130 when it crashed into the Tennessee River near the Sequoyah Hills neighborhood of Knoxville around 7:45 p.m. Clayton, Griffin, and McBride resurfaced soon after the crash near to the wreckage, and were rescued by a nearby pontoon boat.

It includes components shared jointly with the military. It is one of the most complex aviation systems in the world, and services air travel in the United States and over large portions of the world's oceans.  Organization  A flight through the NAS typically begins and ends at an airport which may be controlled (by a tower) or uncontrolled. On departure, the aircraft is in one of five of the six classes of airspace administered by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and different flight rules apply to each class. Depending on the class of airspace and flight conditions, communication with controllers may or may not be required. Operation of each flight is always the responsibility of the pilot in command, but air traffic controllers give instructions for sequencing and safety as needed. When a controlled flight is airborne, control passes from the tower controller who authorized the takeoff, if the airport is controlled. The next step is typically Terminal Radar Approach Control or TRACON which may be identified as \\"approach\\" or \\"departure\\". Between the sectors administered by TRACONs are 20 contiguous areas of US airspace above 18,000 feet, each managed by an Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) typically referred to on the radio as \\"Center\\". A flight is handed off from one Center to another until it descends near its destination, when control is transferred to the TRACON serving the destination, and ultimately to the tower controller serving the airport. Some airports have no TRACON around them, so control goes directly to or from a Center, and some flights are low enough and short enough that control is kept within one or more TRACONs without ever being passed to Center. Approximately 14,500 air traffic controllers, 4,500 aviation safety inspectors, and 5,800 technicians operate and maintain services for the NAS. It has more than 19,000 airports and 600 air traffic control facilities. In all, there are 41,000 NAS operational facilities. In addition, there are over 71,000 pieces of equipment, ranging from radar systems to communication relay stations. On average, about 50,000 flights use NAS services each day.  Developments  NASA‚Äôs remotely-piloted Ikhana prepared for its public airspace flight the NAS is transitioning to a new system known as NextGen, which applies non-radar surveillance of aircraft equipped with GPS satellite-based navigation systems continuously reporting their location. Aircraft also receive the broadcast location of others nearby, which improves safety. The system also allows pilots to use more precise and efficient landing paths, saving time and fuel. NextGen is being phased in piece by piece. In June 2018, NASA flew a 36 feet long by 66-foot (11 by 20-meter) demilitarised MQ-9 Predator for the first time through the NAS with no chase aircraft and controlled from Armstrong Flight Research Center, towards unmanned aircraft operations in civil airspace.  Airspace classification  In the U.S., airspace consists of classes A, B, C, D, E, and G. The NAS includes both controlled and uncontrolled airspace. Class A begins and includes 18,000 ft. MSL and continues up to 60,000 ft. MSL. It is the most controlled airspace and requires a pilot to carry an Instrument Flight Rating and proper clearance no matter what type of aircraft is being flown. Pilots are also required to change their altimeter settings to 29.92 in. to ensure all pilots within the airspace have the same readings in order to ensure proper altitude separation. Class B airspace extends from the surface up to 10,000 ft. AGL and is the area above and around the busiest airports (e.g., LAX, MIA, CVG) and is also heavily controlled. A side view of Class B airspace resembles an upside-down wedding cake with three layers becoming bigger toward the top. Class B's layers are designed individually to meet the needs of the airport they overlay. Pilots must also receive clearance to enter the Class B airspace but Visual Flight Rules may be used, unlike in Class A airspace. Class B airspace corresponds to the area formerly known as a Terminal Control Area or TCA. Class C airspace reaches from the surface to 4,000 ft. AGL above the airport which it surrounds. Class C airspace only exists over airports which have an operational control tower, are serviced by a radar approach control, and have a certain number of instrument flight operations. Class C is also individually designed for airports but usually covers a surface area of about 5 nautical miles around the airport up to 1,200 ft AGL. At 1,200 ft. the airspace extends to 10 nautical miles in diameter which continues to 4,000 ft. Pilots are required to establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic control service to the area before entering the airspace. Within Class C, Visual and Instrument pilots are separated. Class D airspace exists from the surface to 2,500 ft. AGL above an airport. Class D airspace only surrounds airports with an operational control tower. Class D airspace is also tailored to meet the needs of the airport. Pilots are required to establish and maintain two-way radio communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic control services prior to entering the airspace. Pilots using Visual Flight Reference must be vigilant for traffic as there is no positive separation service in the airspace. This airspace roughly corresponds to the former Airport Traffic Area. Class E airspace is the airspace that lies between Classes A, B, C, and D. Class E extends from either the surface or the roof of the underlying airspace and ends at the floor of the controlled airspace above. Class E exists for those planes transitioning from the terminal to en route state. It also exists as an area for instrument pilots to remain under ATC control without flying in a controlled airspace. Under visual flight conditions, Class E can be considered uncontrolled airspace. Airports without operational control towers are uncontrolled airfields. Pilots in these areas are responsible for position and separation and may use a specified Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) or UNICOM for that airport, although no-radio flight is also permitted. Class G airspace is uncontrolled airspace which extends from the surface to either 700 or 1,200 ft.

Club career =Youth years= Allan Wanga started playing while at primary school. As a youth he also played at various age levels for now defunct Kisumu based football club known as FIFA Kingdom. He then went to St Paul's High School, Shikunga in Butere District and continued playing there, although the school did not have a famous football team.Kenyafootball.com, 3 July 2008: Allan Wanga; The Kenyan Wonder =Early career= In 2005, he joined Kisumu-based Lolwe FC, then playing in Nationwide League, the second tier football league in Kenya. He only stayed three months though, because the Nationwide was being revamped and thus closed. He was set to join Agro-Chemical, but the move did not happen as he was threatened by Agro players fearing for their place in the team, according to Wanga. He then went home and was persuaded by his mother Noel, to join the army. He failed the army test, and got a chance at Sher Karuturi, another Kenyan top-flight club. After waiting for a contract offer, his brother Richard called him over a job offer in Canada, and Allan joined his brother in Nairobi but it did not materialise. After almost a year without a club, Lowle contacted him in late 2006 and he returned, but was picked up by Premier League club Tusker F.C., in early 2007. He played for Tusker until the end of 2007 season, when his club won the league. He managed to score 13 goals in his nine last matches for Tusker FC and 21 in total. =Petro Atl√©tico= At the end of 2007, he moved to Angolan club Petro Atl√©tico, turning down trial offers from Swedish clubs.

Mead. As with some other omega-9 polyunsaturated fatty acids, animals can make Mead acid de novo. Its elevated presence in the blood is an indication of essential fatty acid deficiency. Mead acid is found in large quantities in cartilage.  Chemistry  Mead acid, also referred to as eicosatrienoic acid, is chemically a carboxylic acid with a 20-carbon chain and three methylene-interrupted cis double bonds, as is typical for polyunsaturated fatty acids. The first double bond is located at the ninth carbon from the omega end. In physiological literature, it is given the name 20:3 (n-9). (See Fatty Acid#Nomenclature for an explanation of the naming system.) In the presence of lipoxygenase, cytochrome p450, or cyclooxygenase, mead acid can form various hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and hydroperoxy (HpETE) products.  Physiology  Two fatty acids, linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid, are considered essential fatty acids (EFAs) in humans and other mammals. Both are 18 carbon fatty acids unlike mead acid, which has 20 carbons. Linoleic is an œâ-6 fatty acid whereas linolenic is œâ-3 and mead is œâ-9. One study examined patients with intestinal fat malabsorption and suspected EFA deficiency; they were found to have blood-levels of mead acid 1,263% higher than reference subjects. Under severe conditions of essential fatty acid deprivation, mammals will elongate and desaturate oleic acid to make mead acid, (20:3, n‚àí9). This has been documented to a lesser extent in vegetarians and semi-vegetarians following an unbalanced diet. Mead acid has been found to decrease osteoblastic activity. This may be important in treating conditions where inhibition of bone formation is desired.  Role in inflammation  Cyclooxygenases are enzymes known to play a large role in inflammatory processes through oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, most notably, the formation of prostaglandin H2 from arachidonic acid (AA). AA has the same chain length as Mead acid but an additional œâ-6 double bond. When physiological levels of arachidonic acid are low, other unsaturated fatty acids including mead and linoleic acid are oxidized by COX. Cyclooxygenase breaks the bisallylic C-H bond of AA to synthesize prostaglandin H2, but breaks a stronger allylic C-H bond when it encounters Mead acid instead. Mead acid is also converted to leukotrienes C3 and D3. Mead acid is metabolized by 5-lipoxygenase to 5-hydroxyeicosatrieonic acid (5-HETrE) and then by 5-Hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase to 5-oxoeicosatrienoic acid (5-oxo-ETrE). 5-Oxo-ETrE is as potent as its arachidonic acid-derived analog, 5-oxo- eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE), in stimulating human blood eosinophils and neutrophils; it presumably does so by binding to the 5-oxo-ETE receptor (OXER1) and therefore may be, like 5-oxo-ETE, a mediator of human allergic and inflammatory reactions.

Description They are vivid blue to dark grey in colour along their backs and flanks and fade to a silvery blue-grey on the belly. Spanish mackerel have scores of narrow, vertical lines down their sides. Spanish mackerel are the largest of all Australian mackerels, growing to about 200 cm and up to 70 kg. Distribution and habitat It is found in a wide area centering in Southeast Asia, but as far west as the east coast of Africa and from the Persian Gulf and along the northern coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, and as far east as Fiji in the South West Pacific ocean. They are common down both sides of Australia as far south as Perth on the west coast and Sydney on the east coast. They are also found as far north as China and even Japan.http://www.fishnet.com.au/default.aspx?id=225&fishid;=101 It has colonised the Mediterranean as a Lessepsian migrant from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal, being first recorded off Palestine in the 1930s and it is now common in the eastern Mediterranean, having become an important quarry species for local fisheries. Lifecycle Spanish mackerel spawn in oceanic conditions on reef edges. Eggs have a large oil droplet that aids in buoyancy and keeps them at the top of the water column which is warmer, well oxygenated, and has an abundant planktonic food supply for the larvae once they are hatched. When in the larval stage, Spanish mackerel are believed to stay in their own species-specific groups and are not normally found with other species of the same genus, such as S. semifasciatus and S. queenslandicus. This is not always the case with adult mackerel, where occasional mixing of different species within the same genus can occur. Spawning is seasonal, but it is protracted in the warmer waters of the tropics. Many of the fisheries that target this species are based on prespawning feeding aggregations. A significant proportion of the female fish caught in NT waters between July and December have either recently spawned or are close to spawning.Buckworth and Clark 2001 In general, spawning times for Spanish mackerel tend to be associated with higher water temperatures that promote optimal food availability for the rapid growth and development of the larvae.Jenkins et al. 1985 As the young larvae grow, they move from the offshore spawning grounds to inshore and estuarine habitats, where they are frequently found in the juvenile phase of their growth cycle. In the inshore environments, they feed mostly on the larvae and juveniles of small fish and crustaceans until they become large enough to eat small fish and squid.McPherson 1988 Australian studies of this species suggest females are larger than males.McPherson 1992Buckworth 1998Mackie et al. 2003 Female Spanish mackerel mature at about two years of age or around 80 cm in length.http://www.nt.gov.au/d/Content/File/p/Fishnote/FN40.pdf Feeding habits Spanish mackerel are voracious, opportunistic carnivores. As with other members of the genus, food consists mainly of small fishes with lesser quantities of shrimp and squid. Fisheries, fishing gear and methods Commercial capture of narrow-barred Spanish mackerel in tonnes from 1950 to 2009 Spanish mackerel are highly valued fish throughout their range in the Indo-West Pacific. Recreational anglers catch them from boats while trolling or drifting and from boats, piers, jetties, and beaches by casting spoons and jigs, and live-bait fishing. Commercial methods are primarily run-around gill netting, and rarely, by trolling lures similar to those used by recreational anglers. Parasites thumbCysts of the trypanorhynch Callitetrarhynchus gracilis in the body cavity As with most fish, the narrow-barred Spanish mackerel is infected by a variety of parasites. Spectacular parasites are the cysts of the larvae of the trypanorhynch cestode Callitetrarhynchus gracilis, often found in great numbers in the body cavity. These parasites are not appetizing, but represent no danger to humans.

Its building formerly housed the Woolworth's, the site of a non-violent protest in the civil rights movement. Four students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NC A&T;) started the Greensboro sit-ins at a \\"whites only\\" lunch counter on February 1, 1960. The four students were Franklin McCain, Joseph McNeil, Ezell Blair, Jr. (now Jibreel Khazan), and David Richmond. The next day there were twenty students. The aim of the museum's founders is to ensure that history remembers the actions of the A&T; Four, those who joined them in the daily Woolworth's sit-ins, and others around the country who took part in sit-ins and in the civil rights movement. The Museum is currently supported by earned admissions and Museum Store revenues. The project also receives donations from private donors as a means of continuing its operations. The museum was founded in 1993 and officially opened its doors just fifty years to the day after the sit-in movements in Greensboro NC. Saving the building In 1993, the Woolworth's downtown Greensboro store, which had been open since 1939, closed, and the company announced plans to tear down the building. Greensboro radio station 102 JAMZ (WJMH), began a petition drive to save the location. Morning radio personality Dr. Michael Lynn broadcast in front of the closed store day and night to save the historic building. Eighteen thousand signatures were gathered on a petition. Rev. Jesse Jackson, Jr. visited the location, endorsed the effort, and joined the live broadcast. After three days, the F.W. Woolworth company announced an agreement to maintain the location while financing could be arranged to buy the store. (The Woolworth chain went out of business in 1997, a few years later; the company owning the chain became Venator and is now named Foot Locker.) County Commissioner Melvin \\"Skip\\" Alston and City Councilman Earl Jones proposed buying the site and turning it into a museum. The two founded Sit-in Movement, Inc., a nonprofit organization dedicated to realizing this dream. The group succeeded in purchasing and renovating the property. In 2001, Sit-in Movement Inc. and NC A&T; announced a partnership to facilitate the museum's becoming a reality. Financial difficulties The building in 2008, before opening as the ICRCM A section of the lunch counter now appears in the display of the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History. The museum project suffered financial difficulties for a number of years, despite millions of dollars in donations. These included more than $1 million from the State of North Carolina, a contribution from the Bryan Foundation, more than $200,000 each from the City of Greensboro and Guilford County, and $148,152 from the U.S. Department of Interior through the National Park Service Agency's Save America's Treasures program in 2005. In fall 2007, Sit-in Movement, Inc. requested an additional $1.5 million from the City of Greensboro; the request was rejected. Greensboro residents twice voted down bond referenda to provide money for the project. In 2013, the city agreed to a $1.5 million loan, with the condition that an amount equal to money raised \\"outside the normal course of business\\" by the museum from September 2013 to July 2015 would be forgiven. A June 24, 2016 memo from City Manager Jim Westmoreland and Mayor Nancy Vaughn said the museum raised $612,510 and owed $933,155, with the first $145,000 payment due June 30, and the remainder by February 2018. The museum claimed it owed $281,805. On August 1, the city council voted not to forgive $800,000 of the debt; using the museum building as collateral was an option. Two weeks later, the city council gave the museum until February 2018 to raise more money, with an amount equal to money raised to be subtracted from the debt. Fundraising and opening As the 50th anniversary of the sit-ins grew closer, efforts increased to complete the project. Over $9 million in donations and grants were raised. In addition, the museum qualified for historic preservation tax credits, which were sold for $14 million. Work on the project proceeded and was completed in time for the 50th-anniversary opening. The ICRCM opened on February 1, 2010, on the 50th anniversary of the original sit-in, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. A religious invocation was spoken by Rev. Jesse Jackson, Jr.. The three surviving members of the Greensboro Four (McCain, McNeil, and Khazan) were guests of honor. Assistant Attorney Thomas Perez represented the White House. Speakers included Perez, U.S. Senator Kay Hagan and N.C. Governor Beverly Perdue. Annual events Since 2007 the museum organization has held an annual Black and White Ball. The 2010 theme was \\"Commemorating Five Decades of Civil Rights Activism.\\" The 2011 theme was \\"Make a Change, Make a Difference.\\" The 2013 theme was \\"Celebrating Our Victories as We Honor Our Past.\\" Awards The museum organization awards an Alston-Jones International Civil and Human Rights Award. The award is given to someone whose life's work has contributed to the expansion of civil and human rights. This is the museum's highest citation. The author Maya Angelou was the winner in 1998.See List of honors received by Maya Angelou. The 2013 Alston- Jones award was presented to Dr. Johnnnetta Betsch Cole, director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African Art. Dr. Cole is a distinguished educator, cultural anthropologist and humanitarian. She is a former president of Bennett College and of Spelman College. The Museum gave Dr. Joe Dudley Sr., co-founder of Dudley Products, the 2013 Trailblazer Award. Gladys Shipman, proprietor of Shipman Family Care, received the 2013 Unsung Hero Award. For their courageous actions in the wake of the Feb. 1, 1960 sit- in protest, ICRCM gave Sit-In Participant Awards to Roslyn Cheagle of Lynchburg, Virginia; Raphael Glover of Charlotte, North Carolina; and Mary Lou Blakeney and Andrew Dennis McBride of High Point, North Carolina.  Proposed Trump visit  In October 2016, the museum denied a request by US presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign to close the museum for five hours for a proposed visit by Trump. Exhibits Architect Charles Hartmann designed the building in an art deco style. Completed in 1929, the building in the 100 South block of Elm Street was then known as the Whelan Building because Whelan Drug Co. rented most of the space. Woolworth moved into the site in 1939. The building is part of the Downtown Greensboro Historic District. The International Civil Rights Center and Museum was designed by Freelon Group of Durham, North Carolina, and exhibits were designed by Eisterhold Associates of Kansas City, Missouri. It has of exhibit space occupying the ground floor and basement, and office space on the top floor. Docent-led and self-guided tours are available for a fee. Tours begin in the lower level where visitors are introduced to the segregated society of the 1960s through video presentations and continues with a graphic \\"Hall of Shame\\" display of the violence against civil rights protesters of all colors throughout the United States. Visitors are introduced to the four students through a reenactment of the planning session set against the original furniture from their dorm room at A&T; College in 1960. Visitors are led into the main floor of the museum where the massive lunch counter, in the original 1960 L-shaped configuration, occupies nearly the whole width and half the length of the building. Original signage from 1960 and dumbwaiters that delivered food from the upstairs kitchen are included, as is a reenactment of the sit-in on life-sized video screens. Visitors are then led through a reproduction of the \\"Colored Entrance\\" at the Greensboro Rail Depot where the roles of the church, schools, politics, and courts in the civil rights movement are explored. Artifacts include a pen used to sign the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the uniform of a Tuskegee Airman native to Greensboro, and a complete Ku Klux Klan robe and hood. See also * F. W.

After a journalism career, Hollingshead managed the Alhambra Theatre and was later the first manager of the Gaiety Theatre, London. Hollingshead also wrote several books during his life. An innovative producer, Hollingshead brought Gilbert and Sullivan together in 1871 to produce their first joint work, a musical extravaganza called Thespis. Among other theatrical works that he produced, he mounted a long series of popular Victorian burlesques at the Gaiety, engaging Meyer Lutz to compose original scores for them. He also produced operettas, plays and other works. These productions made stars of Nellie Farren and several others. At the Gaiety, in 1878, Hollingshead was the first theatre manager to light his auditorium with electric lights. Life and career Hollingshead in an 1870 cartoon Hollingshead was born in Hoxton, Greater London, the son of Henry Randall Hollingshead. He was educated at Homerton. He first worked as a bookkeeper for a soft goods company in London in the early 1850s while publishing political essays on finance and social reform.Hollingshead (1895), P. 73 He soon entered into a partnership as a clothing merchant. During this time, Hollingshead and his friend Moy Thomas began publishing a penny paper called The Mail that proved unsuccessful.Hollingshead (1895), P. 83 In 1854, he decided to close his clothing business and begin working as a writer full- time. By 1855, Hollingshead was married with two children.Hollingshead (1895), P. 93 He died in London on 9 October 1904 at the age of 77. =Journalist and author= Hollingshead started his journalism career in 1854 under the tutelage of Charles Dickens at Household Words magazine and then under W. M. Thackeray at Cornhill Magazine.Obituary in the New York Times In 1861, he acted as the \\"special correspondent\\" for The Morning Post during the London famine. He also wrote essays, short stories and dramatic criticism. Beginning in 1864, and for several years thereafter, he contributed to Punch magazine, mostly writing on political topics related to social reform.Spielmann, p. 368 He advocated the principles of Mill and Jeremy Bentham. One of his best-known essays was an 1857 piece called \\"The City of Unlimited Paper\\", which became famous during the monetary panic of 1857. In the 1860s he was on the staff of Good Words under Norman Macleod as editor. Hollingshead wrote a number of books from the 1850s into the 1860s, including On the canal: a narrative of a voyage from London to Birmingham (1858); Under Bow Bells (1860, a collection of some of his essays), Rubbing the Gilt Off (a collection of his early political essays (1860) Odd Journeys (1860, a collection of travels), Ways of Life (1861, a volume of humorous papers), Ragged London (1861, a collection of his reports for the Morning Post), and Underground London (1862). Other publications included a collection of humorous stories entitled Rough Diamonds and two volumes of miscellaneous essays called Today. He also wrote plays. Hollingshead in 1898 In the 1880s, Hollingshead returned to writing, producing books mostly about the theatre, including Plain English (1880), and Footlights (1883). Beginning in the 1890s, he wrote a number of memoirs and more books about the theatres that he had managed. In 1892, he also published The Story of Leicester Square, tracing the history, geography and architecture of the London neighbourhood from earliest times through the date of publication. His memoir entitled My Lifetime, published in 1895, explores his life and career through that date. =Producer and theatre manager= The Alhambra Theatre and theatrical innovations In the 1860s, Hollingshead turned to theatre management. He helped establish the Alhambra Theatre and was the stage manager there from 1865 to 1868, in addition to producing musical pieces and ballets there. He made it famous for its sumptuous staging, alluring corps de ballet and the notorious front-of-house Promenade bar, where the young ladies of the ballet hinted at more than terpsichorean pleasure.Stewart, Maurice. \\"The spark that lit the bonfire\\", in Gilbert and Sullivan News, The Gilbert and Sullivan Society, London, Spring 2003. During his tenure at the Alhambra, Hollingshead introduced London audiences to the Can-Can.Hollingshead (1895), p. 224 Hollingshead is also credited with inventing the practice of holding general matin√©es. Hollingshead was one of the first London theatre managers to eliminate fees for programmes and coat check. He left the Alhambra to manage the newly redesigned Gaiety Theatre. In addition, Hollingshead managed shows at the Opera Comique from time to time. He produced a revival of Gilbert's Princess Toto there in 1881, paired with Rutland Barrington's short play, Quid Pro Quo. The Gaiety Theatre In 1868, Hollingshead took over the Gaiety Theatre, which had been a large music hall. The auditorium was rebuilt and, under Hollingshead, it became a venue primarily for musical burlesque, variety, continental operetta, including several operettas by Jacques Offenbach, and light comedy, under Hollingshead's management, from 1868 to 1886. The theatre opened on 21 December 1868, with the successful Robert the Devil, by W. S. Gilbert, a burlesque of the opera Robert le Diable.Digital Guide to Gilbert & Sullivan accessed 1 March 2007 Gilbert also wrote An Old Score for the theatre in 1869. Another early production was Alfred Thompson's Columbus!, or the Original Pitch in a Merry Key (1869). Nellie Farren starred in both Columbus and Robert the Devil. She continued as \\"Principal Boy\\" at the Gaiety for the next 25 years, first under Hollingshead and then under George Edwardes. Other Gaiety stalwarts were Edward Terry, Kate Vaughan and Fred Leslie. The theatre's music director, Meyer Lutz, composed or arranged the music for many of its most successful burlesques. Illustration of Thespis, the first Gilbert and Sullivan work In 1870, Henry James Byron's Uncle Dick's Darling starred a young Henry Irving. This was the last play that theatre buff Charles Dickens saw before his death. Other pieces at Hollingshead's Gaiety in 1870 included Dot (Dion Boucicault's version of The Cricket on the Hearth); and The Princess of Trebizonde, based on the Jacques Offenbach operetta (1870). Thespis, the first collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan, played at the theatre in 1871, with Farren as Mercury and J. L. Toole in the title role. Offenbach's Les deux aveugles played in 1872, starring Fred Sullivan. This was followed by such works as Shilly-Shally (1872) by Anthony Trollope and Charles Reade; Antony and Cleopatra (1873); and The Battle of Life, (based on Charles Dickens's Christmas story of that title). Two other Dion Boucicault plays produced by Hollingshead's company in the early 1870s were Night and Morning and Led Astray. Boucicault's Don Caesar de Bazan was travestied in Byron's Little Don Caesar de Bazan.Includes a profile of the Gaiety and other Victorian theatres Sheet music from Monte Cristo, Jr. In the late 1870s, the theatre became the first to install electric lighting on its auditorium. Hollingshead's productions there included The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole (1877), Byron's farce Little Doctor Faust (1878)Information from Footlight Notes website Byron's Handsome Hernani, or The Fatal Penny-Whistle (1879);Information and images regarding Handsome Hernani, or The Fatal Penny-Whistle and Robbing Roy (1879). Meyer Lutz's Ali Baba and The Forty Thieves was performed in 1880 (Hollingshead had produced a highly successful charity production called The Forty Thieves at the Gaiety in 1878), and a burlesque of Aladdin, by Robert Reece, in 1881. These were followed by Little Robin Hood (1882), a burlesque by Reece, Blue Beard (1882), Ariel (1883, by F. C.

Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments by Edward Moxon, London.1891 title page of A Defense of Poetry by Ginn and Co., Boston \\"A Defence of Poetry\\" is an essay by the English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, written in 1821 and first published posthumously in 1840 in Essays, Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments by Edward Moxon in London.Sandy, Mark. \\"Defence of Poetry\\" by Percy Bysshe Shelley. 25 August 2004. The Literary Encyclopaedia It contains Shelley's famous claim that \\"poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world\\". Background The essay was written in response to his friend Thomas Love Peacock's article \\"The Four Ages of Poetry\\", which had been published in 1820.Eliot, Charles W., ed. English Essays: From Sir Philip Sidney to Macaulay. With Introductions and Notes. The Harvard Classics. Edited by Charles W. Eliot. New York: P.F. Collier and Son, 1909. Shelley wrote to the publishers Charles and James Ollier (who were also his own publishers): :I am enchanted with your Literary Miscellany, although the last article has excited my polemical faculties so violently that the moment I get rid of my ophthalmia, I mean to set about an answer to it.... It is very clever, but I think, very false. To Peacock, Shelley wrote: :Your anathemas against poetry itself excited me to a sacred rage. . . . I had the greatest possible desire to break a lance with you ... in honour of my mistress Urania. A Defence of Poetry was eventually published, with some edits by John Hunt, posthumously by Shelley's wife Mary Shelley in 1840 in Essays, Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments. Editorial introductions Shelley sought to show that poets make morality and establish the legal norms in a civil society thus creating the groundwork for the other branches in a community. In Gateway to the Great Books, Volume 5, Critical Essays, Robert M. Hutchins and Mortimer J. Adler wrote:Hutchins, Robert M., and Mortimer J. Adler, eds. Gateway to the Great Books, Volume 5, Critical Essays. Toronto: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc., 1963, p. 214. ::In A Defence of Poetry, [Shelley] attempts to prove that poets are philosophers; that they are the creators and protectors of moral and civil laws; and that if it were not for poets, scientists could not have developed either their theories or their inventions. Poets introduce and maintain morality. The mores so created are codified into laws. The social function or utility of poets is that they create and maintain the norms and mores of a society. In English Romantic Writers, David Perkins wrote:Perkins, David, ed. English Romantic Writers, 2nd edition. Toronto: Harcourt Brace College Publishers, 1995, p. 1131. . ::...Shelley was mainly concerned to explain the moral (and thus the social) function of poetry. In doing so, he produced one of the most penetrating general discussions on poetry that we have. Major themes Shelley‚Äôs argument for poetry in his critical essay is written within the context of Romanticism. In 1858, William Stigant, a poet, essayist, and translator, wrote in his essay \\"Sir Philip Sidney\\"Stigant, William. \\"Sir Philip Sidney\\", Cambridge Essays, 4, 1858. that Shelley's \\"beautifully written Defence of Poetry\\" is a work which \\"analyses the very inner essence of poetry and the reason of its existence, ‚Äì its development from, and operation on, the mind of man\\". Shelley writes in Defence that while \\"ethical science arranges the elements which poetry has created,\\" and leads to a moral civil life, poetry acts in a way that \\"awakens and enlarges the mind itself by rendering it the receptacle of a thousand unapprehended combinations of thought\\". In A Defence of Poetry, Shelley argued that the invention of language reveals a human impulse to reproduce the rhythmic and ordered, so that harmony and unity are delighted in wherever they are found and incorporated, instinctively, into creative activities: \\"Every man in the infancy of art, observes an order which approximates more or less closely to that from which highest delight results...\\" This \\"faculty of approximation\\" enables the observer to experience the beautiful, by establishing a \\"relation between the highest pleasure and its causes\\". Those who possess this faculty \\"in excess are poets\\" and their task is to communicate the \\"pleasure\\" of their experiences to the community. Shelley does not claim language is poetry on the grounds that language is the medium of poetry; rather he recognises in the creation of language an adherence to the poetic precepts of order, harmony, unity, and a desire to express delight in the beautiful. Aesthetic admiration of \\"the true and the beautiful\\" is provided with an important social aspect which extends beyond communication and precipitates self-awareness. Poetry and the various modes of art it incorporates are directly involved with the social activities of life. Shelley nominated unlikely figures such as Plato and Jesus in their excellent use of language to conceive the inconceivable. For Shelley, \\"poets ... are not only the authors of language and of music, of the dance, and architecture, and statuary, and painting; they are the institutors of laws, and the founders of civil society...\\" Social and linguistic order are not the sole products of the rational faculty, as language is \\"arbitrarily produced by the imagination\\" and reveals \\"the before unapprehended relations of things and perpetuates their apprehension\\" of a higher beauty and truth. Shelley's conclusive remark that \\"poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world\\" suggests his awareness of \\"the profound ambiguity inherent in linguistic means, which he considers at once as an instrument of intellectual freedom and a vehicle for political and social subjugation\\".Liberto, Fabio. \\"The Politics of Language in P.B.

He appears as a sentient, levitating human skull with intact eyeballs. Morte accompanies the protagonist, The Nameless One, from early in the game as a party member. He serves as comic relief as well as providing a significant section of backstory. His attack consists of both biting and relentlessly taunting his opponents. He has been overall very well received, and praised as one of the best sidekick characters in the PC gaming of that era. Character biography Morte is a \\"Chaotic good\\" floating human skull. Despite his lack of a body, he is a capable warrior in many respects, biting with his teeth and distracting foes with sarcastic taunts. His small size, lack of vital organs, and undead nature, protect him from attacks that would normally inflict serious wounds. It is shown that Morte and The Nameless One have something of a history together. His name is associated with the concept of \\"death\\" in the Latin language. Morte is included in the party from the beginning of the game. He can help The Nameless One learn much about his previous incarnations, unless the player first removes Morte from the party. His taunts are useful as they prevent a fleeing character from escaping, and can also silence spell-casting characters, forcing them into melee combat. However, his taunts do not work on the undead, creatures possessing low intelligence, or creatures lacking wills of their own. Morte provides much of the game's humor, not the least being the random conversations between himself and the Nameless One, whom he calls \\"Chief\\". Towards the end of the game, The Nameless One finds out where Morte came from; the Pillar of Skulls on the plane of Baator. Morte was pulled from the pillar by the Practical Incarnation. The pillar is composed of the skulls of all the people who died and have caused another to die through their lies. Morte is tormented by the fact that, prior to his death, he lied to the Good Incarnation that Ravel could make him immortal, and is thus responsible for The Nameless One's lamentable condition. If The Nameless One convinces Morte to reveal this history and forgives him, Morte becomes significantly stronger, his personal torment lessened. Gameplay Being a levitating skull, Morte is difficult to hit but actually packs strong bite attacks. He also has a useful ability to taunt magic-user foes into engaging in melee combat with him. The game's lead designer, Chris Avellone, described Morte as: \\"a smack-talkin' floating skull companion, who's kind of your compass, encyclopedia, friend, and resident jackass. His only real combat attack is his bite and the fact that he's gathered such a repertoire of insults over the centuries that he can literally taunt people to death.\\" Morte's weakness is female zombies. The game's initial project director Guido Henkel said: \\"Let's say you're trying to sneak out of an area, when all of a sudden there a female zombie shows up. Morte, our nice little sarcastic skull, has a total thing for female zombies. He just has to shack up with them. And although you are trying to sneak out somewhere, Morte will walk right up to the zombie and start talking her up. That, of course, destroys your whole plan because you have no control over his actions at that point.\\" Reception The character was critically acclaimed upon the game's release. IGN gave Morte the 1999 Memorable Character of the Year award, stating that as an \\"unusual-looking character with a quirky personality to match, as well as some completely unique attacks and special abilities, he is impossible to forget, and also plays an essential role in making the entire game a memorable.\\" Eurogamer gave him the Gaming Globes 2000 award in the category Male Supporting Character. In 2000, GameSpot included him on their list of top ten video game sidekicks for \\"his unique interpretations of friendship and loyalty, and the strange brand of comic relief.\\" In 2004, he barely \\"didn't make the cut\\" for a similar list by GameSpy, rejected for his awkward habit of \\"hitting it\\" on \\"other dead people.\\" In 2008, Computer and Video Games ranked him as the sixth best character overall in PC gaming, writing that \\"amongst a pack of memorable characters, Morte is the one you love Planescape for\\" and contrasting him with Tommy from Prey. In 2011, Maximum PC listed him as one of 25 of gaming's best sidekicks, writing that: \\"whether he's chomping on your nearest foe, making lame pick-up attempts at your female party-mates, or cracking wise about his life as floating skull, Morte is head and shoulders‚Äîerr, at least head, above other gaming sidekicks.\\" In 2012, Complex ranked him as fourth on their list of top \\"pervs in games\\" for his \\"insatiable lust for the ladies, living or not.\\" In a 2017 article, PC Gamer staff included Morte in their definitive list of the best RPG squad mates around.

For eighteen years, the Ouimetoscope was the venue for French and American cinema supplemented with local production, accompanied by live musicians. History Encouraged by his 1904 success at showing moving pictures with a projector of his devising, Electrical engineer L√©o-Ernest Ouimet invested his life savings of $75 into converting an ailing cabaret theatre in Montreal's downtown into the first theatre dedicated to showing moving pictures of Canada, the Ouimetoscope.The Cinema Show, Monique Corbeil, Feb. 2002 Despite the small screen, the theatre was an instant success, keeping its 500 seats filled at every showing. One year later, he reinvested his profits to construct a 1,200 seat amphitheatre with plush seating and air conditioning, a rarity at the time, making it one of the first movie palaces. Despite the large investment and the luxurious venue, admission ranging from ten to thirty cents allowed even the working-class man and woman to attend (in separated seating sections). Showing local productions, including his own, news movies, French and translated American movies, the theatre would remain open for eighteen years until, in 1922, Ouimet's financial difficulties forced him to sell the Ouimetoscope, which closed two years later. Revival In 1967, the theatre Le Canadien that occupied the same location would again take the name Ouimetoscope and show repertory cinema until 1992 when it was abandoned.

Coming out of California in 2010, Alualu was projected to be a first or second round pick. He received an invitation to the NFL combine and completed all of the required combine and positional drills. On March 10, 2010, he participated at California's pro day and opted to attempt the bench press (24),and short shuttle (4.28), achieving better numbers in both. Alualu was ranked the fourth best defensive end by NFLDraftScout.com. =Jacksonville Jaguars= The Jacksonville Jaguars selected Alualu in the first round (10th overall) of the 2010 NFL Draft.

It originally aired on October 22, 2007. Plot At the bar Ted introduces the gang to his newest girlfriend, whose name Future Ted can't remember and instead refers to as \\"Blah Blah\\". Embarrassed that she and Ted met online, she makes up a story about how she saw Ted across a crowded room at a cooking class. Before she had arrived, Ted had already told the rest of the group that they met online. Barney soon realizes that the girl is actually on the \\"Hot/Crazy Scale\\", saying that the only girls who meet other people online are crazy, hookers or men. It soon becomes clear that she is neurotic and paranoid when she feels threatened by Robin. In order to change the subject, everyone begins to reminisce about how they all met each other, and their stories are told through flashbacks. *How Marshall met Lily ‚Äì Marshall and Lily first met in August 1996 when Lily needed help with her stereo and she had a strange feeling about room Hewitt 110. She knocked on the door, Marshall answered, and it was love at first sight. *How Ted met Marshall ‚Äì Ted and Marshall first met when they became college roommates. Marshall was \\"eating a sandwich\\" (smoking marijuana) when he was told that the Dean was coming. When Ted arrived, Marshall attempted to conceal the \\"sandwich\\" and, believing Ted to be the Dean, became upset that Ted would be his roommate. The confusion was cleared up when Marshall walked in on Ted \\"eating a sandwich\\" of his own. *How Ted met Barney ‚Äì Ted and Barney met in the men's room of MacLaren's in 2001, after which Barney made Ted his new wingman and told a girl that Ted was deaf so that Barney could get the girl's phone number. When the girl mentioned she knew sign language, Ted signed to her that Barney was a great guy and recommended she give him her number. After telling the story, Barney comments that he knew from that moment that he and Ted would be wingmen forever, even though the girl gave him a fake number. Ted reveals that he actually instructed the girl in sign language to give Barney a fake number, which upsets Barney. Barney then reveals to Blah Blah that Ted had told the group how they really met, which upsets Blah Blah. *How Ted met Robin ‚Äì Ted provides a condensed version of how he first spotted Robin across the bar in 2005, and the two instantly felt a connection. Throughout the stories, Blah Blah becomes increasingly paranoid rather than mollified, particularly when she learns that Ted and Robin met and dated for a while. When she wishes that she and Ted had a wonderful first meeting story like Lily and Marshall, Ted reluctantly counters that the story isn't as great as it sounds and tells the story of how he met Lily. *How Ted met Lily ‚Äì During a freshman party at college, Ted and Lily met as Marshall chugged from a keg. Ted flirted with Lily and suggested that she come to his room, after which they began making out. Ted explains that Lily had come to his and Marshall's room the next day, saying that even though Lily was drunk, she still remembered Room 110, and that he and Lily have never spoken about their first meeting since. Blah Blah, keen to make Ted uncomfortable, vindictively orders Ted to confess to Marshall or she will. Returning to the table, Blah Blah asks Lily how she met Ted. However, Lily recounts the event differently. *How Lily met Ted ‚Äì When Lily went to Marshall and Ted's room, Ted was on the phone desperately apologizing to his long- distance girlfriend Karen for making out with another girl. After Marshall introduced her to Ted, Ted quickly rushed off upon seeing her to try sending Karen an e-mail. When Blah Blah presses for details, Ted takes Lily aside to discuss what happened at the party. Though Lily recalls kissing someone at the party, she can't remember who the guy was while Ted insists the guy was him. Meanwhile, Marshall and Barney talk about how they met. *How Barney met Marshall ‚Äì In 2001, Ted introduced Marshall to Barney, who attempted to persuade Marshall to forget his girlfriend and score with a random girl at MacLaren's. Marshall initially refused, but decided to play along when Barney unwittingly selected Lily as Marshall's target. Marshall walked up to her and kissed her, which impressed Barney until he learned that Lily was Marshall's girlfriend. Unimpressed, Blah Blah tells Marshall that Ted and Lily kissed. Marshall doesn't believe the story, because he remembers that Ted and Lily kissed two other people at the freshman party, not each other, which Lily easily accepts. A furious Blah Blah storms out, mad that Ted had kissed another woman, but not before revealing that she met Ted playing World of Warcraft. For the sake of Marshall and Lily's relationship, Ted accepts Marshall's story, though he is secretly unconvinced. At their college reunion in 2020, Ted is approached by a woman who tells him that she was the one he made out with at the freshman party, proving Marshall was correct. Later, Ted, Marshall and Lily all sit down for a \\"sandwich\\" that Marshall confiscated from some undergrads and get high when Ted suddenly realizes he can't find his wife.

Initially designated as a Navy Transport AP-80, Callaway was quickly re-designated as attack transport APA-35. The vessel was launched 10 October 1942 as Sea Mink by Western Pipe and Steel, San Francisco, California, under a Maritime Commission contract, acquired by the Navy 24 April 1943, and commissioned the same day, Captain D. C. McNeil, USCG, in command. Operational history =Kwajalein= Callaway sailed from Norfolk, Virginia on 23 October 1943 to San Diego, California and trained with United States Marine Corps to prepare for the first of her five assault landings. Joining Task Force (TF) 53 at Lahaina Roads, Hawaii, Callaway sailed for Kwajalein, where she landed troops in the assault that overwhelmed the defenders on 31 January 1944. =Emirau and Saipan= After staging at Guadalcanal, Callaway proceeded combat loaded for the occupation of Emirau where her troops landed on 20 March 1944. Transfers of troops and cargo in the Solomons and Ellices, and training at Pearl Harbor continued until 29 May, when Callaway got underway for her third assault invasion, Saipan on 15 June. Laden with casualties, Callaway returned to Pearl Harbor to embark army troops for rehearsal landings at Guadalcanal. =Guadalcanal= Callaway set out for Guadalcanal 12 August. On 17 September, the transport launched her troops in the assault on Angaur in the Palaus, then returned to Manus and New Guinea to prepare for her assignment to the first reinforcement echelon for the northern Leyte landings. =Leyte= Arriving in Leyte Gulf 22 October, Callaway landed her troops with the speed and ease born of experience, then retired through the raging Battle for Leyte Gulf for a month of operations supporting the Leyte campaign. These brought the transport back to Leyte 23 November, where she joined in driving off enemy air attacks as she disembarked her troops. =Battle damaged at Lingayen= Preparations in New Guinea preceded in the Lingayen assault, in which Callaway distinguished herself as a member of the Blue Beach Attack Group. As the invasion force sailed north, desperate Japanese kamikaze attacks were launched in a determined effort to break up the landings, and on 8 January 1945, a kamikaze broke through heavy antiaircraft fire to crash on the starboard wing of Callaways bridge. The resulting fires were contained, but 29 of Callaways crew were killed and 22 wounded. Despite this loss, the attack transport resumed active duty the following day. Temporary repairs at Ulithi put her back in action by early February, when she carried Marine reinforcements from Guam to Iwo Jima, and returned with wounded from that battle to Guam, arriving on 8 March. For the next three months, Callaway transported men and equipment between the bases and operating areas of the western Pacific, then embarked Japanese prisoners of war at Pearl Harbor, whom she carried to San Francisco, arriving 16 June 1945. =After hostilities= Following the Japanese surrender Callaway returned after an overhaul to Pearl Harbor on 27 August, loaded occupation troops, and sailed to disembark them at Wakayama, Japan. Two transpacific voyages carrying homeward bound veterans ended with Callaways own return to San Francisco on 12 March 1946. The transport then sailed to New York where she was decommissioned on 10 May 1946. For service in World War II, Callaway received six battle stars. Commercial service Callaway was sold to American President Lines in March 1949 who converted her back to a cargo ship but with facilities for also carrying up to a dozen passengers and renamed the vessel President Harrison. Her name was changed on 10 March 1966 to President Fillmore (IV). On 24 April 1968 she was acquired by the Waterman Steamship Company and renamed Hurricane. Like many of her former Bayfield-class sister ships, Hurricane was scrapped at Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 1974 Legacy In 2016 the United States Coast Guard accepted delivery of the , named after Rollin Arnold Fritch, a gunner who died shooting at 9 January 1945 kamikaze.

Editor: Stanislav Zvon√≠ƒçek, published in cooperation with the Czechoslovak Film Institute. ARTIA) is a 1963 film that became a key film in the development of Slovak and Czechoslovak cinema from the mandated Socialist-Realist filmmaking of the repressive 1950s towards the Czechoslovak/Czech New Wave and socially critical or experimental films of the 1960s marked by a gradual relaxation of communist control. The Sun in a Net received multiple votes in a wide survey of Czech and Slovak film academics and critics in the late 1990s asking them for their lists of the 10 best films in the history of filmmaking in the former Czechoslovakia. Plot Oldrich \\"Fajolo\\" Fajt√°k (Mari√°n Bielik), a student who directs quasi-existentialist verbal abuse at his girlfriend Bela Bla≈æejov√° (Jana Bel√°kov√°), takes off to a formally volunteer summer work camp at a farm, actually mandated by the authorities, which inspires both him and Bela to start a relationship with someone else. A parallel story peels layers off Bela's permanently tense home life marked by her blind mother's (Eli≈°ka Nos√°ƒæov√°) studied helplessness, and her father's (Andrej Vandl√≠k) revealed infidelity and past break with his father (Adam Janƒço) who happens to live in the village where Fajolo is finding some consolation in the arms of a fellow student-volunteer Jana (Oƒæga ≈†alagov√°). As Fajolo begins to pry into Bela's grandfather's secrets, she, in turn, allows her new boyfriend Pe≈•o (ƒΩubo Roman) to read and deride Fajolo's discursive and indirectly remorseful letters from the farm. The solar eclipse barely discerned by the main characters through thick clouds at the beginning of the film is echoed by summer and fall images of the sunJasmine Pogue, \\"≈†tefan Uher: The Sun in a Net (Slnko v sieti) 1963.\\" as they present themselves to all of them at various points in the film through a fisherman's net from his pontoon on the Danube beyond the city's suburbs, which Fajolo and Pe≈•o have discovered independently and use as a swimming deck, a place to ponder life, or to try to seduce Bela. When, however, Bela brings her mother and brother Milo (Peter Lobotka) to the pontoon after a series of subdued interpersonal crises, the pontoon is on dry land because the water level has dropped, and the film ends with Bela and Milo lying to their mother about what they can see as they did about the visibility of the eclipse during the opening sequences.

Only ƒΩubo Roman, a student of acting at that time, became a successful actor, theater administrator, and ultimately a politician. Jana Bel√°kov√° from a singer's family had marginal experience from several TV productions and followed her role in The Sun in a Net with a singing career.  Director  ≈†tefan Uher (1930, Prievidza ‚àí 1993, Bratislava) graduated from the FAMU (Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts) in Prague in 1955. Among his fellow students were future directors Martin Holl√Ω Jr. and Peter Solan who also began to work at the Koliba film studios (then called the Feature Film Studio and the Short Film Studio) in Bratislava after graduation. Uher first worked in the short film division. The Sun in a Net was his second feature film. His first one was We from Study Group 9-A (My z deviatej A, 1962) about the life of a group of 15-year-old students and their school. Uher followed The Sun in a Net by two more films with the same author-screenwriter Alfonz Bedn√°r and cameraman ‚àí Stanislav Szomol√°nyi, later professor of cinematography at the University of Performing Arts, Bratislava: The Organ (Organ, 1964),Peter Koneƒçn√Ω, \\"≈†tefan Uher: The Organ (Organ), 1964.\\" and Three Daughters (Tri dc√©ry, 1967). The original music score in The Sun in a Net is by the composer Ilja Zeljenka, who also worked with Uher on We from Study Group 9-A, and went on to work with him on six more films. Uher's and Szomol√°nyi's She Grazed Horses on Concrete (P√°sla kone na bet√≥ne, 1982) has remained one of Slovakia's most popular domestic productions through the 2000s.  Screenplay  The screenwriter, Alfonz Bedn√°r (1914, Neporadza ‚àí 1989, Bratislava), was already an established writer who published mildly nonconformist fiction somewhat earlier than most other authors. He studied Latin, Slovak, and Czech at universities in Prague and Bratislava. He was also familiar with American and British fiction and had translated Ernest Hemingway, Jack London, Howard Fast, and other authors. Bedn√°r joined the Koliba film studios, Bratislava, in 1960. His first screenplay was The Sun in a Net. He based it on his three short stories \\"Fajolo‚Äôs Contribution\\" (Fajolov pr√≠spevok), \\"Pontoon Day\\" (Pont√≥nov√Ω de≈à), and \\"Golden Gate\\" (Zlat√° br√°na). A highly likely source of the central theme was the 95% solar eclipse that occurred in Central Europe on Feb. 15, 1961.Martin Votruba, Footnote 19, in: \\"Historical and Cultural Background of Slovak Filmmaking.\\" Additional inspiration for the symbolic construction of the storyline may have come from ancient solar myths that have been available in Europe in increasingly numerous publications since at least 1865. A specific myth of the Sun in a net was brought from Polynesia, more general myths of catching the Sun have been attributed to the pre-Columbian Americas, some of the published solar myths may date back to Indo-European prehistory.Edward Burnett Tylor, Researches into the Early History of Mankind and the Development of Civilization. London, 1865 Associations with Sol Invictus and other solar myths are possible.  Significance  The early 1960s saw some relaxation of communism in Czechoslovakia. The Sun in a Net was the first film that took advantage of this new atmosphere.V√°clav Macek, \\"From Czechoslovak to Slovak and Czech Film.\\" It brought a number of hitherto unacceptable social and political themes: distant ‚Äî perhaps uncaring ‚Äî parents, a philandering husband, teenagers changing partners, an attempt at suicide, a poorly run collectivized farm, the fact that the students disdained the summer \\"voluntary\\" work camps. None of these issues are resolved in a \\"positive\\" manner. The core storyline ‚Äî the ups and downs in the relationship of two teenagers ‚Äî the realism and novelty of its urban setting, and the hints at some social and political taboos were not lost on the audience, and cannot have been lost on the censors. The Sun in a Net pushed the envelope and showed artists, and the audience at large, what the authorities could now be pressed to permit.Alex Golden, \\"≈†tefan Uher: The Sun in a Net (Slnko v sieti) 1963.\\" Besides ≈†tefan Uher‚Äôs effort to get past the strict requirements of Socialist Realism, the director was inspired by some of the trends current in (Western) European cinema and culture in the 1950s. Among them were traces of Italian neorealism, the film's low-key style, a hint of fashionable existentialism in the dialogues, and attempts at cin√©ma-v√©rit√© amplified in the beer-drinking scenes in a tavern by the employment of a background soundtrack with taped unscripted conversations of real villagers. That also motivated Uher's choice of unconversant actors or non-actors.Martin Votruba, \\"Historical and Cultural Background of Slovak Filmmaking.\\" Some of the film's traits inspired students at the FAMU, who soon followed with a series of films known as the Czechoslovak/Czech New Wave.

McEvilley died on March 2, 2013 of complications from cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 73. He is survived by his wife, the artist Joyce Burstein; two sons from a former marriage, Thomas and Monte; a sister, Ellen M. Griffin; and two grandchildren. His son Alexander predeceased him. He was married twice earlier; both marriages ended in divorce. Work McEvilley was an expert in the fields of Greek and Indian culture, history of religion and philosophy, and art. He published several books and hundreds of scholarly monographs, articles, catalog essays, and reviews on early Greek and Indian poetry, philosophy, and religion as well as on contemporary art and culture. McPherson & Company Publishers =Art and Otherness= In his 1992 book Art and Otherness: Crisis in Cultural Identity, McEvilley collected and revised twelve essays from the 1980s in the midst of the Culture Wars, the roiling debate regarding the predominance of white, male, Western culture in academia and visual art, and the need for that supremacy to be challenged and opened up to other points of view. McEvilley did this in pointed fashion in \\"Doctor, Lawyer, Indian Chief,\\" his influential jeremiad against the underlying assumptions that framed the Museum of Modern Art's 1984 exhibition Primitivism and Twentieth Century Art.http://brooklynrail.org/2013/05/artseen/art- criticism-that-made-a-difference =Toward a Redefinition of Painting for the Post-Modern Era= In his 1993 book The Exile‚Äôs Return: Toward a Redefinition of Painting for the Post-Modern Era, McEvilley made an important contribution to the late twentieth century \\"death of painting\\" debate. He noted that after two decades of decline in importance as a medium, painting revived around 1980. In its return from exile, painting assumed a new theoretical basis in postmodern cultural theory, together with a new kind of self-awareness and interest in its own limitations. =Heads It's Form, Tails It's Not Content= In the article \\"Heads it's Form, Tails it's not Content\\" McEvilley describes a theoretical framework for the formalist project presented by postwar critics such as Clement Greenberg, Michael Fried and Sheldon Nodelman.Thomas McEvilley (1996), \\"Heads It's Form, Tails It's Not Content\\", in: Artforum 21.3 ( Nov.1982) : 50-61. Later collected in: Capacity: The History, the World, and the Self in Contemporary Art and Criticism, by Thomas McEvilley and G. Roger Denson. Routledge: Taylor & Francis Group. . Page 22-44. He argued that formalist ideas are rooted in Neoplatonism and as such deal with the problem of content by claiming that content is embedded within form. Formalism is based on a linguistic model that Claude L√©vi-Strauss argued is given content through the unconscious. In adopting a formalist approach, a critic cannot ignore the content that accompanies every deployment of form. =Sculpture in the Age of Doubt= In the book Sculpture in the Age of Doubt (1999), McEvilley analyzes the intellectual issues surrounding the postmodern movement in the course of 20th-century sculpture. =The Shape of Ancient Thought= In The Shape of Ancient Thought, McEvilley explores the foundations of Western civilization. He argues that today's Western world must be considered the product of both Greek and Indian thought, both Western philosophy and Eastern philosophies. He shows how trade, imperialism and currents of migration allowed cultural philosophies to intermingle freely throughout India, Egypt, Greece and the ancient Near East.

Plot synopsis In the year AD 1981, British boy Simon meets his visiting American cousin Brad, but they do not get along, Simon finding Brad to be conceited, but knowledgeable enough to justify his conceit. The two boys are drawn towards a mysterious glowing ball instantly transports them to what appears to be more than a thousand years back in history. After some time they realise that they have travelled not to the past but to an alternative Earth also in the year 1981, but one with a different history - the Roman Empire under Flavius Claudius Julianus Augustus, aka Julian the Apostate or Julian the Philosopher, was successful in his AD 363 Persian Campaign. The victory led stability under Pax Romana, and in turn led to general stagnation of the civilised world, a subsequent absence of major technological development, as there was no motivation for change. The boys are separated to be sold as slaves. Brad is able to make use of his knowledge of Latin to persuade a Roman Christian to purchase his freedom. It is revealed that the Emperor Julian survived instead of dying on the Persian Campaign, Christianity never became the state religion. The religion was allowed, but it is still a small minority religion. By evidence of his modern wrist-watch, Brad convinces the Bishop that the boys come from a different and more technologically advanced world. The opportunistic Brad offers to help the Pope raise an army to overthrow the Roman authorities, ostensibly to cease oppression of the Christians, but mainly, in return for power, status and wealth for the cousins to rise in the new realms. Simon goes along with the plan because he wants to free the slaves and promote equal status for non-Romans, and because he has fallen in love with a high-born girl. Brad introduces to the Christian armed forces the stirrup and the longbow, which were never invented in that world. The Christian forces are victorious and the Bishop enters Rome riding on a donkey. However, Simon is quickly disillusioned when the new Church authorities begin forcing all people to convert to Christianity, or face death by the pendulum. Together with Bos, a gladiator, and the staunch pagan, Curtius, both formerly on the side of the rebellion, the boys sail off on a ship towards the New World.

A Tundra Buggy, originally invented & built by Leonard D. Smith in 1979, is an all-terrain vehicle used to view, photograph and study polar bears, in the Cape Churchill Wildlife Management Area, of Manitoba, Canada. Smith took his first trip on his Tundra Buggy to Cape Churchill in 1979 with a group of explorers and a 'National Geographic' film crew which created the movie \\"Polar Bear Alert\\". Smith also created a company he named \\"Tundra Buggy Tours\\" and went on to build 14 Tundra Buggies and The Tundra Buggy Lodge. The lodge consists of a diner, lounge, two bunkhouses, kitchen, muktuk saloon and utilities unit. It is towed from Churchill, Manitoba, behind the Tundra Buggy vehicles for several miles and connected together like units of a train, on the west shore of Hudson Bay. Polar bears congregate every year along the shores of the bay, waiting for the freeze up and to feed on ringed seals. Leonard D. Smith received the Manitoba Tourism Innovation Award in 1989, and the Order of Manitoba in 2004, celebrating 25 years of the operation of Tundra Buggy Tours. In the year 2000 Smith sold Tundra Buggy Tours to Frontiers North Adventures, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Frontiers North Adventures now operates Tundra Buggies as a wildlife viewing vehicle for photographing and observing polar bears and other sub-Arctic wildlife outside of Churchill, Manitoba in the Churchill Wildlife Management Area and Wapusk National Park in northern Canada. Churchill is known as the \\"Polar Bear Capital of the World\\". To date, 17 vehicles have been produced and are used by researchers and tourists. The term \\"Tundra Buggy\\" is a registered trademark of Frontiers North Adventures. Tundra Buggies are built very high off the ground to ensure guest safety. Before the autumn freeze, these vehicles only use an existing set of trails on the tundra that were built by the Canadian and American Armed Forces in the 1950s and 1960s. The high ground clearance of the Buggies also help navigate through difficult areas of the trail. The Tundra Buggy fleet is now custom built and manufactured by Frontiers North Adventures in Churchill, Manitoba. The average male polar bear is 8 to 10 feet (2.5 to 3 meters) tall when standing on its hind legs. The tires on each Tundra Buggy vehicle are 5.5 feet (1.7 meters) high and 3.6 feet (1.1 meters) wide, and sit on 25-inch rims. A wide-bodied enclosure sits on top of the wheels and provides even more height, security, comfort and ability for guests to move around to view and photograph wildlife. The engine in Tundra Buggies is an International DT 466, often found in highway semi-trailers. It is geared through the Allison Transmission, and then geared through the differentials and planetaries on the hubs. The buggies are full-time four-wheel drive and have the capability to lock the differentials if needed. The top speed of a Tundra Buggy is approximately 45 km/h (28 mph) on a smooth trail, but usually travels much slower. The Buggies are relatively self-sufficient with onboard air compressors, tool kits, extra fluids and oils, lavatories and propane heaters which are independent of the engine. As well Tundra Buggies include comfortable seats, windows that open and a large observation deck. Tundra Buggies can also tow additional modules containing bunks, showers, and dining facility for overnight stays on the tundra in a configuration the company calls a \\"Tundra Buggy Lodge\\".

The character was created by series creator Tim Kring and portrayed by actress Kristen Bell. Elle was created by Kring to act as a contrast to the rest of the characters, who had all recently found out they had abilities, whereas Elle had known her whole life. Bell, who had previously starred in the then recently cancelled series Veronica Mars, was a fan of the series and had met up with the writers that informed her they would love to have her on the show. While the character of Elle was created before Bell was cast, following her casting, the character was slightly altered to better resemble her. Elle was one of the new characters introduced in the second season and according to contract, would continue on the series for at least 13 episodes into season three. Elle is introduced in the episode \\"Fight or Flight\\" as an agent of the Company, an organization whose primary purpose is to identify, monitor and study those individuals with special abilities. The daughter of Company head Bob Bishop, she possesses the power to generate and manipulate electricity. Elle is portrayed as mentally unstable, which is attributed to extensive \\"testing\\" condoned by her father to research her abilities when she was young. During the third season, Elle's powers grow out of control but with Sylar's help she regains control of them and begins a relationship with him. After finding out that Elle played a role in his transformation into a \\"monster\\", Sylar killed her and stole her abilities. Critical reception towards both the character and Bell's performance has been positive. Praise was directed towards Elle's personality as well as her characterization and abilities. Her death in the third season was heavily criticized by reviewers and fans. Bell was nominated for both a Saturn Award and a Teen Choice Award for her performance. Development =Concept and creation= In 2007, following the cancellation of Veronica Mars, actress Kristen Bell had voiced interest in appearing on Heroes because she was a fan. In July 2007, during a train ride back from the San Diego Comic Con with Heroes actors Zachary Quinto and Masi Oka, and writers from the series, the writers had mentioned that if Bell \\"ever want[ed] to come on Heroes, give us [writers] a call\\", to which Bell said she would love to. Announced in August 2007, Bell was to portray Elle, a \\"mysterious young lady\\" with an \\"awesome power\\" for a total of thirteen episodes. Heroes creator Tim Kring and the writers had created the character of Elle with the idea that she was a \\"cautionary tale\\" of what could happen if the other characters had known of their abilities for the duration of their lives as Elle did. Kring pitched Bell the idea for the character \\"which she loved\\" and soon they were \\"off and running.\\" The casting of Bell, as Kring explains, \\"was not easy to pull off,\\" but because of the large ensemble cast of the series and multiple story arcs, \\"we found a way to jump into a small window in [Bell‚Äôs] schedule.\\" Originally, Elle was only meant to be Bob's stepdaughter and Meredith Gordon's daughter, making her Claire Bennet's sister, however this idea was dropped due to \\"lack of storyline and plot holes\\". The character Elle was created long before Bell was cast; however, Kring noted \\"when you do cast an actor ... you try to tailor that character a little closer to who the actor is. So it's hard to know when one starts to influence the other\\". =Characterization= When Kristen Bell was cast, she noted that with Elle it would be \\"unclear whether she's good or bad\\". In \\"Four Months Ago...\\", Elle admits to being diagnosed as a sociopath and previous to that, she had displayed sadistic behavior as a result of testing done to her as a child. Bell explains, \\"Bodies are not able to take that much electricity and pain, and so Elle's psychologically a little off her rocker.\\" She is able to kill without apparent remorse, although in one instance, she reacts defensively when Mohinder asks her how many have died by her hand. During an interview with The Scifi World, Tim Kring described Elle as \\"a little off\\", and Bell added that Elle is \\"a little messed up in the head\\" and a highly conflicted individual who does not have the ability to decipher between right and wrong. Because of that, Bell explains that Elle comes off as more of a victim. Bell also explains that Elle is one of the few characters with abilities that embrace their power and is almost on the verge of being addicted to her ability. Elle \\"enjoys the emotional power it gives her over other people\\". She is described as one who is \\"always out to get what she wants\\" and someone who \\"doesn‚Äôt have many boundaries\\". Bell describes Elle as a vixen who \\"feels like she has a romantic connection to everybody\\", and in a few episodes, Elle is shown displaying a great deal of affection to men and flirting with both Peter Petrelli and Mohinder Suresh. Bell noted the similarities between Elle and the character Claire Bennet, saying that they \\"relate to each other\\" and \\"are two sides of the same coin\\" because, while Elle's father sanctioned testing on her, supposedly causing her mental instability, Noah kept Claire hidden, preventing Claire from experiencing the same childhood that \\"really messed [Elle] up\\". Bell has said in interviews that in later episodes of Heroes, \\"You'll find out that Elle holds the key to Claire's future\\" and that Elle has \\"a [present] with Peter and a past with Claire's dad and a future with Claire\\". =Powers and abilities= Elle has the ability to generate and manipulate electricity, discharging and directing it as electrical arcs. She has been shown being able to weld a lock, blast objects, knock people unconscious, and even kill a man. She is not entirely immune to the electricity she produces, however, as shown when she is drenched in water and attempts to create electricity‚Äîshe gives herself an electric shock, causing great pain. Elle has endured a series of testing by the Company during her childhood that measured the extent of her power. Bob had stated that Elle was in a \\"different league\\" when comparing her to Claire. When inquiring about her abilities, Elle was able to learn from Noah Bennet that the Company had wanted to record the extent of her abilities (whether she could power a flashlight, a street lamp, or an entire city block) and Bob had often prompted to continue the tests further, even after Elle had passed out. Her ability is shown to respond to her emotions. After Bob's death, mourning Elle loses control over her ability and her body starts to produce electricity at any time (Sum Quod Sum graphic novels) ; this makes Elle unable to stay close to electrical devices such as computers and even a plane. She claims to live in constant pain (Eris Quod Sum). This ends when Sylar helps her forgive herself (It's Coming). Appearances =Heroes= Generations Elle's first chronological appearance is in \\"Four Months Ago...\\". During this time, the Company made Peter Petrelli their willing prisoner and in those months he was held, Elle seems to have developed a cute crush on him. Peter confesses that he likes the little jolts which Elle gives him as a tease and kisses her. She confides in Peter that she has lived in the Company's holding facility for 16 years. She also admits to being diagnosed as a sociopath; she explains at age six, she accidentally set her grandmother's house on fire and, at age eight, caused a major blackout in Ohio. She also says that she spent her ninth birthday in a glass room with an IV of lithium in her arm. She also explains that she has never been on a date and has never been swimming. When he escapes from the facility, Elle is upset and angry to the point that she blasts Peter, setting him ablaze during his escape. She then chases after Adam Monroe while the Haitian goes after Peter. Elle first appears in the episode \\"Fight or Flight\\" searching for Peter in Ireland. Peter has no recollection of his past and is staying with the owner of Wandering Rocks Pub, Ricky. Elle questions Rick about Peter's whereabouts and when he pretends not to know Peter, she kills him with a large bolt of electricity on her way out the door. Later on, during a telephone conversation with Bob Bishop, her father and Company head, she dismisses the murder as trivial and insists she can find Peter. However, she is pulled off the assignment, much to her frustration. In \\"Cautionary Tales\\", Elle comes back to the United States. Former Company employee Noah Bennet captures Elle for collateral, as Bob had captured his daughter, Claire. He ties Elle's hands to a chair and ties her bare feet together and puts them in a metal dog bath which is full with water. Elle tries to use her abilities while in the dog bath, but she shocks herself. During this time, Noah tells Elle that Bob allowed the Company to perform tests on her which had begun as early as the age of seven. This included subjecting her to high doses of electricity, which scarred her emotionally for life. Elle has no recollection of the tests, and Noah suggests the Haitian had a role in causing Elle to forget her experiences. After an agreement is made, she is reunited with Bob and Claire momentarily reunited with Noah. However, Elle attacks Claire and West as they leave. She tries to attack Noah, but he shoots Elle in the arm before she can hurt him or anyone else. As it seems Noah is going to kill Bob, Mohinder Suresh, a scientist working with Noah and the Company, shoots and kills Noah. Elle leaves with Bob and Mohinder, giving Bob a look of distrust. In the episode \\"Truth & Consequences\\", Bob chastises Elle for allowing West and Claire to escape. He then assigns Elle to perform surveillance on Claire and her family as they prepare to leave town. Claire, however, spots Elle from a distance, leading to a physical confrontation, which leads Claire to threaten to expose the Company Elle's last appearance in season two is in \\"Powerless\\". Her father reprimands her for her mistakes; to redeem herself, she attempts to re-capture the now powerless Sylar for the Company. She uses her ability to confront Sylar in Mohinder's research lab, but Sylar is armed with a gun and shoots at Elle. Sylar manages to slip away, leaving Elle unharmed. She comes out somewhat defeated, but is informed by Mohinder that if not for her arrival, Sylar would have killed him, Maya Herrera and Molly Walker. He says the three of them owe her their lives, to which she replies, \\"Cool\\". The episode marked Bell's previously expressed interest in performing in scenes with the character Sylar, as she and Zachary Quinto had been good friends for almost ten years. Bell had said that she \\"would love to see him and Elle face off one day\\". In November 2007, Bell and Quinto filmed scenes at a restaurant in Los Angeles, which was set as a \\"New Jersey Diner\\" and had involved police and paramedics. The filmed scenes are part of the untold stories which are a special feature of the season 2 DVD set. Villains Returning in the episode, \\"The Butterfly Effect\\", following her failure to stop Sylar, Elle seeks assistance from Noah Bennet. He is detained in Level 5, a high security ward for the Company's most dangerous prisoners. However, Sylar is already there, having killed her father. He attempts to take her ability, but the pain of being scalped causes her to involuntarily release a massive electrical surge. This knocks Sylar out, but also disables security for the entire facility, allowing the prisoners to escape. Elle is later fired by Angela Petrelli, the new head of the Company, who tells Elle that the only reason the Company kept her was because of her father's influence. In the episode \\"Eris Quod Sum\\", Elle makes her way to Claire's house to seek help from Noah, having lost control of her ability. She attacks Claire out of anger, but is subdued when Lyle throws water on her. She is told that an organization called Pinehearst could help her with her condition, so Claire agrees to escort her there. They reach Pinehearst just in time to see Peter Petrelli thrown from a seventh story window. Claire takes him away from the building, but Elle refuses to leave after learning from Peter that they can take her powers away. In the episode \\"Villains\\", Elle's life a year earlier is explored, revealing that she had been partnered with Noah Bennet at one point. The two are assigned to watch Sylar (still Gabriel Gray) in order to discover how he transfers abilities. Elle saves Gabriel after he attempts to kill himself out of guilt for killing his first victim. She is told to befriend him, and Gabriel develops an attraction to her that suppresses his hunger. Using a list of people with abilities Gabriel had compiled, Noah arranges to introduce Gabriel to one of them to see his power in action. However, Elle does not agree with the plan, revealing she has developed feelings for Gabriel. She reluctantly goes along with it when Noah threatens to fire her. They then introduce Gabriel to Trevor, an evolved human with a kinetic projection ability. Her repeated references to Trevor being \\"special\\" anger Gabriel, and he orders her to leave while he kills Trevor. Elle is left with guilt as she caused an event that helped to create \\"Sylar\\". In the following episode, \\"It's Coming\\", set in the present, Arthur Petrelli, head of Pinehearst, arranges for Sylar to speak with Elle. His aim is to have Sylar use his latent empathic abilities to take powers, rather than doing so through killing. Elle is chained to the floor in a metal room, still in pain from her ability. She repeatedly attacks him, furious at Sylar for her father's murder, eventually begging him to kill her so that her pain will go away. He forgives her for turning him into a monster and convinces her to forgive herself for her crimes, wanting to take away her pain without killing her. At that moment, Elle's pain disappears and she regains control of her ability. Likewise, Sylar is able to absorb her power. The two appear to rekindle their old feelings for each other as Elle teaches Sylar how to use her ability. In \\"The Eclipse Part I\\", she and Sylar are sent to retrieve Claire who is revealed to be the catalyst, the unknown part of the formula that would allow someone to produce abilities. On assignment, Elle challenges Sylar and he shows her that he can still be a killer, and not just a \\"daddy's boy\\" by killing a rental car assistant. Eventually, they find Claire and Noah, and a fight ensues, however, Elle and Sylar find themselves powerless; the result of the eclipse. Elle aims a gun at Noah but Claire jumps in and takes the bullet. Noah knocks Elle out and dislocates Sylar's arm, while he escapes with injured Claire. After awakening, Sylar explains to a shocked Elle that losing his abilities is a bit of a relief. She tells him that they can't just take what they want anymore, then Sylar retorts and grabs Elle, kissing her passionately. Outside, Noah aims a rifle at them. In \\"The Eclipse Part II\\", Sylar and Elle sleep together but then are confronted by Noah. Elle is shot in the thigh in the ensuing struggle. Both Elle and Sylar flee while Noah follows Elle's blood trail to a grocery store. There, Elle and Sylar plan to ambush Noah in the rear of the store. Sylar pushes Elle into a cargo elevator, in an attempt to hide her from Noah. Elle watches as Noah slits Sylar's throat with a box cutter. When the eclipse ends, their abilities are returned and Sylar is revived. He and Elle go to the Bennet residence and overcome Noah and Claire while holding Claire's mother, Sandra, hostage. Suddenly, Hiro teleports in and takes both Sylar and Elle to Costa Verde beach, leaving them there before disappearing. Sylar and Elle kiss, and he explains that he and Elle are \\"damaged goods\\" and that they will \\"never change\\". Sylar then begins to slice Elle's skull open. In the following episode \\"Our Father\\", Sylar, covered in Elle's blood, is shown pouring lighter fluid on Elle's body. He painfully says, \\"Goodbye Elle,\\" then sets her ablaze with the electric ability he inherited from her. Redemption In the episode \\"Tabula Rasa\\", Elle is seen in flashbacks as Sylar witnesses his real memories reflecting in the Hall of Mirrors. In \\"The Art of Deception\\", Matt reverts Sylar's memories of his kills, including the ones of Elle. =Literature= Echo DeMille. Elle also appears in the Heroes webcomics. Her appearances in the online series occur before her introduction on the television series. Elle's first webcomic appearance is in \\"Elle's First Assignment, Part 1\\", which reveals her first assignment for the Company. Elle monitors Claire Bennet, posing as a student at Union Wells High School. After following Claire home, Elle ends up confronting Eden McCain. The incident is broken up by Noah Bennet, who informs Elle that he doesn't \\"want [Elle] hanging around [his] daughter any more\\". In Part 2, she finds out about the tape of Claire testing her power and tries to take it from Zach. She is stopped by the Haitian and Mr Bennet, who find out about the tape as well. Elle also appears in \\"The Man With Too Much Brains\\" to recruit the original webcomic character Matt Neuenberg to the Company. She also was teamed up with Thompson Jr. to capture Donna Dunlap, a woman with enhanced vision in \\"Donna's Big Date, Part 1\\", and she was among the agents that try to capture Echo DeMille at Lake Arrowhead, where he managed to convert Elle's electricity into soundwaves, in \\"Going Postal\\". She is also referred in \\"Faces, Part 1\\" to have helped Thompson Jr. and Penny Logan taking down The Croatian. In \\"Sum Quod Sum\\", it is revealed that she has lost control of her ability since leaving the Company, so she has gone to London to find help from Claude. After she tracks him down, he confronts her but then runs away. It begins raining, and Elle decides to take advantage of it. She releases an electrical charge, which travels through the water on the ground and into Claude, but she, too, is knocked unconscious in the process. Claude and his friends, Abigail and Lee, carry her to his place and he begins to show Elle the source of her problem. Things get ugly when Elle accidentally shocks Abigail, which leads them to fight each other; Abigail's force field redirects Elle's lightning towards Lee, so Elle stops and then is asked to leave the place. Although Claude asks her to stay, she prefers to look for the help of Noah, so she goes to Costa Verde and attacks Lyle while waiting for his father. In \\"From the Files of Primatech: 1991\\", the childhood's background of Elle is further explained: how she started a blackout in Athens, Ohio that took out three other counties. Elle's mother sent her to her father, Bob, to New York City to deal with her. Bob asked the help of Charles Deveaux, who recommended taking a fatherly approach, but ended up taking Dr. Zimmerman's advice: treat Elle as any other posthuman and test her abilities. During one of these tests, Bob tried to calm the weeping Elle turning her drinking straw into gold, but this backfired as it allowed Elle to accidentally shock her father. After this, Elle escaped and Bob enlisted Noah Bennet to go after her. Noah eventually found Elle at an arcade and anticipating her attack, he wore latex gloves. Elle quickly electrified a machine making it toss balls at Noah, so she could escape. When Noah followed Elle through a mini-golf course, she electrified a mini- windmill, making it throw blades at Noah. Finally, Elle was cornered; Noah promised her Bob would be proud if she came back with him. Once back at Primatech, Bob locked Elle up while discussing the situation with Kaito and Noah. Angela brought a young Haitian to mind-wipe Elle to forget what just happened and enjoy her 9th birthday cake.  Reception  Bell's performance was highly anticipated as she had gained popularly within her starring show, Veronica Mars. Ultimately, Bell's performance was critically praised, along with the character of Elle, who became very popular among viewers. Elle was ranked #44 on IGN's \\"Top 50 Chicks Behaving Badly\\". With the cancellation of Veronica Mars, Variety reported that attaining Bell was a \\"major, major coup for NBC\\" because of how in-demand the actress was. Universal Media Studios' Katherine Pope noted that \\"many studios [were] chasing [Bell] in both film and TV\\" and that Pope was happy that Bell \\"chose to star in our show.\\" When Bell was cast, Tim Kring explained that because she had known several of the cast members for years as well as some of the writers, it \\"was already like part of the family by the time we cast her.\\" In an interview with Bell, Eric Goldman of IGN commented on Bell's \\"eagerly awaited debut\\" on the series. Matt Roush of TV Guide reported on Bell becoming a series regular on Heroes, and stated he \\"like[s] her more and more, especially as we see the tragic dimension of how Elle has been so cruelly used by her 'daddy,' Bob, and is much more than the flirty assassin we first met.\\" Bruce Fretts, also of TV Guide, said that Bell's portrayal of Elle was responsible for \\"sparking Heroes to life.\\" He explains that \\"[i]n just a few scenes... [Bell is able to] juice up the slumping sophomore drama\\" and her \\"live-wire performance turned Chapter 5 into this season's strongest episode yet.\\" However, because of the large ensemble cast, Matthew Gilbert of Slate.com commented that Season Two of Heroes was \\"even more overpopulated than the last, expanding from a rabble to a veritable global riot of Dubiously Gifted Ones.\\" Her death in the season three episode \\"The Eclipse Part II\\" was criticized by media outlets with E! writing that the show offered \\"the redemption of electric Elle, an Elle-Sylar romance, an Elle- Claire friendship, HRG mentoring Elle [only to take] it all away\\". =Accolades= In 2009, Bell was nominated a Saturn Award for Best Guest Starring Role on Television and a Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actress Action.

He distinguished himself during service with the Royal Navy and Royal Naval Air Service in World War I, before joining the Royal Air Force shortly after its creation in 1918. He is the namesake of Pink's War, which was the first campaign conducted by the RAF alone and the only campaign to be named after an RAF officer.  Early life and naval career  Richard Charles Montagu Pink was born on 30 November 1888 in Winchester, Hampshire to Charles Richard Pink, an architect, and Florence Anna, n√©e Browne. He was schooled at St Aubyns, Eastbourne, and Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, Devon, then in 1904 joined the Navy as a midshipman, before successive promotions to sub-lieutenant in 1908 and lieutenant in 1911. He married Marie Wrigley on 27 June 1912, while stationed with the torpedo ship HMS Vulcan in Dundee. During his time with the Royal Navy and then the Royal Naval Air Service, Pink worked first in submarine and then anti-submarine warfare, coming to command the Milford Haven Anti- Submarine Group in 1917, following postings as Commanding Officer of RNAS Longside and RNAS Pembroke.  Royal Air Force career  With the transfer of RNAS personnel into the new Royal Air Force on 1 April 1918, Pink was appointed to senior staff duties in the Marine Operations Section of the RAF's Directorate of Flying Operations. By January 1919 he was part of the British Delegation's Air Section to the Paris Peace Conference but was recalled to home duties later that year to take up post as the Director of Flying Operations and act as the Airship Advisor to the Chief of the Air Staff. He received a permanent commission as a lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Air Force on 1 August 1919, a rank later renamed to wing commander. From 1919 to 1921 Pink carried out executive roles at the RAF's Coastal Aircraft Depot, before being posted at the end of November 1919 as the Officer Commanding the Aircraft Depot in Egypt. = With the RAF in India and 'Pink's War' = In November 1923, Wing Commander Pink took command of Nos. 5, 27, and 60 Squadrons as No. 2 (Indian) Wing. Through the early 1920s, British forces in Waziristan had undertaken a number of operations to subdue elements of Mahsud tribes in southern Waziristan, including actions by mounted cavalry. By October 1924 almost of all the tribes had ceased actions against the British, except the Abdur Rahman Khel tribe, who with support from three other tribes continued to raid army outposts. Air Vice-Marshal Sir Edward Ellington, then Air Officer Commanding RAF India since November 1923, decided that the RAF would conduct operations alone, without ground support from the Army, the first time that the RAF had fought independently of other services. Pink formed his headquarters with No 5 Squadron and their Bristol F2Bs at Tank, before flying to the forward operations base at Miramshah to brief Nos. 27 and 60 Squadrons. Following the dropping of leaflets to warn the local population, operations commenced with the main aim not of causing casualties to the rebel forces, but to undermine morale and interrupt daily life. Sorties were flown during the day and by moonlight, both to villages and to prevent access to 'safe havens', with 2700 hours having been flown and 250 tons of bombs dropped by the end of the fifty-four days of operations. At the end of April, rebel leaders declared their intention to make peace with British forces, and on 1 May 1924 agreed to terms presented to them at Jandola. Following the campaign, the India General Service Medal was awarded with the Waziristan 1925 bar, the rarest clasp for the India medal, to the 46 officers and 214 men of the Royal Air Force who took part in what became known as Pink's War after the successful Wing Commander. Pink himself was mentioned in dispatches by Air Vice-Marshal Ellington during his report on the actions in the London Gazette, with the citation reading: Pink was soon after promoted to Group Captain in the 1926 New Year Honours list \\"in recognition of his services in the field of Waziristan\\", and was assigned to HQ, Air Defence of Great Britain. He went on to command the School of Technical Training at RAF Manston from July 1929 to July 1931, returning to ADGB as an Air Commodore in July 1931.  Death  Richard Pink died of cancer on 7 March 1932 at Princess Mary's RAF Hospital, RAF Halton. His death at the age of 43 had \\"in the opinion of many senior RAF officers, denied the service a potential future chief of air staff.\\" He had two sons by his wife Marie (n√©e Wrigley). One of his sons, Squadron Leader Charles Richard John Pink, was killed in an air training accident at Church Fenton airfield on 9 March 1941.

It was first published in 1983. Plot summary In the first novel, Fireball, Simon and Brad are cousins who are mysteriously transported to an alternate history Earth, where the Roman Empire did not break up and Europe remains in pre-Dark Ages technology. In an attempt to improve their status in the new realm, Simon and Brad aid the Christian Church, which is oppressed, to launch a coup by introducing the stirrup and the longbow. The coup succeeds, but the boys did not anticipate the Church as a state power would force everyone in the Empire to convert or die. At the end of the first book, they sail away to the New World, which in the realm, was not discovered yet by the Old World. At the beginning of this novel, they managed to reach the American continent safely. They are received warmly enough by the native tribes in North America, but soon find themselves yearning for more advanced civilizations. However, after they attempt to sail down the coast to warmer waters as winter sets on, they are captured by Vikings. In this parallel world the Vikings were introduced to the Latin language and instead of dying out, they have colonized the American continent. Brad, Simon, and their companions Bos and Curtius are greeted warmly by the Vikings and believe they can live here permanently, only to realize that they are to be sacrificed. They escape, but Curtius is killed in the fighting as they leave. Trekking across the continent, they head for the only civilization in America which has significant urban living - the Aztecs. As the Roman Empire has persisted in Europe of this realm until the 20th century due to unchanging conditions, the Aztec civilization too has continued without encounters from the Europeans' discovery of the New World. In order to quickly gain wealth and status to enjoy a comfortable living, they take part in the sacred games, which is a cross between squash, tennis and handball. Their aim though is to finish second, as the victors will be sacrificed to the gods. Unfortunately, they win. To escape the fate of the winners, they escape again, and this time, are captured by sailors from the Far East. Their story continues in the last book of the trilogy, Dragon Dance.

The glacier flows north, and glacial runoff supplies water to Grasshopper Creek, flowing eventually into the Wind River. The glacier shares a glacial margin with Klondike Glacier, located to the south. The glacier is named for grasshoppers that have been found entombed in the ice. Between September 6 and 10, 2003, a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) was recorded when the proglacial lake at the head of the glacier burst through a glacial dam, and water from the lake carved a trench down the center of the glacier for over a half-mile (.8 km). An estimated 650 million gallons of water were released in four days, raising the flow level of Dinwoody Creek from per second to per second, as recorded at a gauging station downstream. Debris from the flood was deposited more than downstream. The GLOF has been attributed to the rapid retreat of the glacier, which has been ongoing since the glacier was first accurately measured in the 1960s.

The last novel of the Fireball trilogy, it was first published in 1986. Plot summary At the end of New Found Land, Simon and Brad are in North America where they are captured by sailors from the Far East. When they awaken after losing consciousness during the capture, they find themselves aboard a Chinese junk crossing the Pacific Ocean. The junk is a paddle steamer that sails without human intervention. The crew have apparently put themselves into hibernation, indicating that they are accustomed to the trip and are expecting an uneventful journey. On their arrival in China they are taken to the Imperial Court, where the boys display their knowledge of modern technology. They are befriended by the young emperor, Cho-tsing, but sent away later at the command of the Dowager Regent. They are then taken in by Bei Pen, a follower of the laws of Bei-Kun. There, Brad becomes besotted with Bei Pen's companion Li Mei and becomes estranged from Simon. Unlike the other civilizations that they have encountered, which remain at a pre-Dark Ages technological level, the Chinese have continued their technological innovations and have come up with new inventions, even though their social development has stagnated. Simon is sent to the north to serve the general of the powerful Northern Army in charge of resisting nomadic barbarians. The arrival of the boys catalyses the ongoing court intrigue between the dowager regent and court officials. A series of bad news arrives in the north from the capital which implies that the young emperor is being held incommunicado, or has been secretly deposed and killed by Lord Yuan Chu, a courtier with designs on the throne. The general of the Northern Army, the most powerful army in the empire publicly declares that the dowager regent as an usurper, and mobilizes his army to rescue the emperor, whose fate is unknown. He candidly admits to Simon that should the emperor be dead, that he would be the most likely to succeed to the throne. Simon attempts to help the general by the introduction of armored tanks, but lacks detailed knowledge. Nonetheless Chinese engineers in the service of the general are able to build on the concept to produce some prototypes. The Chinese themselves use flying kites to give the appearance that dragons are aiding their military, adding to their knowledge of the workings of the mind in a form of subtle hypnosis. However, the expedition becomes a disaster at the gates of the capital. Simon discovers that Brad has introduced airplanes to the military forces. While the airplanes work, Simon's tanks do not. Lord Yuan emerges as emperor, kills the dowager regent and has the deposed emperor executed. His ascent has been aided by Li Mei, who used her hypnotic abilities to keep Brad under control. Brad eventually sees her for what she is when she refuses to intervene in Cho-Tsing's execution, but she has him imprisoned. The two boys manage to escape once again, staying with Bei-Pen. They discover that he is the original Bei-Kun, known in their home universe as Roger Bacon who escaped from Rome in the late 13th century to whet his knowledge with the Chinese and manages to live for seven hundred years, forming the Laws of Bei-Kun and a large following. He reveals that he has the knowledge to send them both home. Though he is given the option to go home, Simon follows Brad when the latter refuses to go home and instead decides to try for better luck in a new realm.

The Court of Audit is a collateral body of the Belgian Federal Parliament and exerts external control on the budgetary, accounting and financial operations of the Federal State, the Communities, the Regions, the public service institutions and the provinces. The task of the Court of Audit is defined in its organic law of 29 October 1846. This law gives the Court of Audit a large independence and a wide autonomy to perform its missions. The Court of Audit carries out its tasks at its own initiative. The principle of general independence is a guarantee of objectivity and impartiality. The legislative assemblies can charge to charge the Court of Audit with specific missions of management analysis. History The Court of Audit can trace its historical lineage to the Chamber of Accounts in the County of Flanders and Chamber of Accounts established in 1386 for Flanders and Burgundy by Philip the Bold. By letters of patent in 1406, Philip's second son Antoine of Burgundy set up a chamber of accounts for the Duchy of Brabant. The Chamber of Accounts was entrusted with the monitoring and the closing of the accounts of all paymasters of the duchy. These Chambers existed in various forms until the independence of Belgium in 1830. After the independence the National Congress voted on 30 December 1830 to establishing the Court of Audit of which the first members were appointed on 6 January 1831. Article 116 of the Constitution of 1831 enshrined the existence of this institution and defined its powers. In 1955 it hosted II INCOSAI, the second triennial convention of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions. Since January 1984, the Court of Audit is situated in Rue de la R√©gence 2, Brussels, in the former Palace of the Count of Flanders. Competences =Financial audit= The Federal State, the Communities, the Regions, the public service institutions depending on those entities and the 10 provinces have to report annually on their use of the public funds. These accounts are transmitted to the Court of Audit, which verifies the accuracy, the reliability and the completeness of the entries in the financial statements. The Court of Audit also checks the conformity of the recorded transactions with the accounting legislation. The Court also checks and closes the accounts of the public accounting officers who are in charge of the collection and/or payment of the public funds. The Court considers whether their accounts are in balance, whether the balance is in their favour or in the State's favour. In the two first cases, it draws up a discharge judgment. The third case gives rise to an administrative deficit judgment that might result in the carrying out of the jurisdictional task. =The legality audit= The Court of Audit performs a legality audit on the public expenditures and receipts by checking their conformity with the budgetary law. The Court of Audit ensures that the law rules applicable to the controlled operation are correctly implemented. The legality audit is carried out through prior approval of the payment orders relating to the expenditures. No payment can be made without the approval of the Court of Audit. If the Court of Audit withholds its approval, the Government can decide that payment should still take place. The Court of Audit then approves with reservation and immediately informs the concerned legislative assembly to which it explains its reasons for doing so. =Performance audit= As an institution linked to the Parliament, the Court of Audit is charged with the monitoring of the sound use of public funds according to the principles of economy, effectiveness and efficiency, so it can inform the Parliament about the way the public services are managed. * The economy audit assesses whether the implemented financial, human and material resources have qualitatively and quantitatively been acquired and used at the lowest cost and at the right moment. * The effectiveness audit assesses the extent to which the stated goals and objectives have been attained. * The efficiency audit assesses the output for a given amount of resources by ensuring that the financial human and material resources are implemented for optimal results. =Informational task= The Court of Audit informs the various legislative assemblies and the provincial councils of the results of its audit missions. The Court of Audit submits its audit reports to the assemblees and councils in the form of syntheses integrated into the annual Book of comments (the so-called \\"blunder book\\") or in the form of special publications. The Court of Audit informs the legislative assemblies of the commitments, authorizations or payments of expenditures exceeding the budget appropriations and comments on the budget drafts submitted to the legislative assemblies. =Jurisdictional task= The Belgian Constitution charges the Court of Audit with auditing and validating the accounts of the general administration and of all accounting officers answerable to the Treasury. The accounts of these officers are yearly sent to the Court or in the event of a deficit and when they leave office. The Court of Audit decides by administrative ruling whether these accounts are in balance, whether the balance is in their favour or in the State's favour. If the ruling shows a deficit the officer has to appear before the Court of Audit. After a public procedure the Court of Audit either exonerates the accounting officer or condemns him to make good that amount or part of it. The rulings can be appealed to the Court of Cassation. If the judgement is vacated, the case will be referred to an appropriate \\"ad hoc\\" committee, made up of members of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives who judge the case without the possibility of any subsequent appeal. The Court of Audit can require the authorizing officers delegated by the minister to repay the amounts if they have committed appropriations in violation of the legal provisions or incurred losses to be paid by the treasury. =Statements of offices held and declarations of assets= Certain categories of political representatives and senior officials are required to file a statement of offices, functions and occupations with the Court of Audit. They are also required to file a declaration of assets in accordance with a fixed schedule. The Court of Audit is in charge of controlling, storing and publishing these documents. Organization The Court of Audit consists of a college of 12 magistrates, assisted by civil servants. The Court of Audit is divided a French-speaking and a Dutch-speaking chamber. Each chamber consists of a president, four councilors and a registrar. The senior of the two presidents is designated First President and the senior of the two registrars is Chief Registrar. All members of the Court of Audit are elected by the Belgian Chamber of Representatives for terms of six years and can be reappointed.

She cleared Saipan with her task group 16 February, and 3 days later, took position off Iwo Jima for the initial assault. As naval and air bombardment pounded the island, her men skillfully played their part. Remaining off the hard-fought beaches, Cecil completed unloading troops, cargo, and vehicles, and embarked casualties, with whom she sailed 28 February to Saipan. =Okinawa= Cecil continued on to Tulagi and Espiritu Santo, where she loaded men and cargo of the 27th Infantry Division. On 9 April 1945, she landed these reinforcements through high surf on Okinawa. She remained for a week continuing her unloading under enemy air attacks, aiding in fighting them off as she loaded and landed her boats. On 16 April she got underway for Saipan and Ulithi, where she received minor repairs and replenished. =After hostilities= On 21 May, Cecil arrived in Subic Bay, P.I., for transport and training duty until 27 August, when she departed Luzon with troops and cargo of the 1st Cavalry Division, bound for occupation duty in Japan. Cecil called at Yokohama from 2 to 4 September 1945, then returned to the Philippines to load more occupation troops. On the return passage to Japan, she was ordered into Okinawa from 25 September to 3 October to avoid a threatening typhoon, then proceeded on to disembark her troops at Aki Nada. =Operation Magic Carpet= She sailed to San Pedro, California, for a minor overhaul in November, then made another voyage to the Philippines as part of Operation Magic Carpet, to return men and equipment to San Pedro, where she arrived on 22 January 1946. In March, she sailed to Norfolk, Virginia, where she was decommissioned on 24 May 1946, and returned to the Maritime Commission the next day. Cecil received two battle stars for World War II service. Commercial service In 1948, Cecil was purchased by the Isthmian Steamship Company which registered her in New York as Steel Admiral. Steel Admiral remained in service with Isthmian Steamship until 1973, when she was taken to Kaohsiung, Taiwan and scrapped in October of the same year.

The remaining Vank members, lead vocalist Cornel Ilie and drummer Nicu S√¢rghea, recruited bass player Bogdan Crucianu and guitarist Gabi Maga.  VUNK History  =Vank (1994‚Äì2009)= Vank had their first concert in Bucharest, at the Ion CreangƒÉ theatre. In 1996, they built their first studio in the basement of the apartment building their parents lived in. In 1999, the four released the single \\"Independent\\", which shortly thereafter became Atomic TV‚Äôs anthem. In November, they released their first album, \\"Voyeur\\", which contained 10 tracks. Not long after that, Vank entered mainstream Romanian radio and TV stations with the song \\"Noi O Scoatem La CapƒÉt\\". The track became a smash hit. The band‚Äôs second album, \\"6 Piese De 5 Stele\\", came out in 2001. The first song promoted from the album was \\"Regele soselelor\\". A year later, Vunk launched another album, \\"In Haine Noi\\". It included both the song \\"All Too Young\\", which earned Vank second place in the 2002 national Eurovision competition, and \\"N-am Noroc\\" a remake of an Anda Calugareanu song. In 2004, Vank made a comeback with \\"Best of Vank\\", which featured all the band's past hits such as \\"1000\\", \\"Balada Pentru O Minune\\", \\"Langa Inima Mea Vine Inima Ta\\", \\"Iubire Cu Imprumut\\", and others. However, the most famous Vank song remains \\"Prajitura Cu Jeleu\\"; its lyrics became an anthem for high school boys. =Vunk (2009‚Äìpresent (2015))= For 14 years the band‚Äôs members- Victor, Alex, Nicu and Cornel- performed under the name Vank. After ten years of activity and a four-year break, the band was reinvented under the name Vunk. In 2009, after Alex Belciu and Victor Cenusa quit, Bogdan Crucianu joined the band, followed by Gabi Maga in 2010. Today Vunk includes Cornel Ilie, Nicu Sarghea, Bogdan Crucianu, and Gabi Maga. Their first single together was \\"La Orice Ora\\". The music video for this song created a new meme for the band: a broken clock, inscribed with the band‚Äôs old name, that starts to work only after it receives a \\"letter transplant\\". Singles from the album include \\"Dau Alarma\\", \\"Prima Noapte\\", \\"Artificii Pe Tavan\\" and \\"Lacrimi De Coniac\\". In February 2010, Vunk launched the album \\"Ca Pe Vremuri\\", and at the end of the year they joined the campaign \\"Vreau O Tara Ca Afara\\". The latter was a social campaign that aimed to inspire a change in peoples' behavior with the purpose of making Romania a country with a more Western culture and values. Less than two weeks after its launch, the campaign was awarded the \\"Premiul De Excelenta\\" prize. Since 2010, Vunk has been the official ambassador of the Romanian Autism Organization. After receiving the title of best pop-rock Romanian band in 2011, the group released the single \\"Pleaca\\", a collaboration with singer Antonia. The song was #1 on the charts for several weeks. In November 2012, at Sala Polivalenta, the band had their biggest concert to date. Before a crowd of over 5,000 fans, they launch the album \\"Nimeni Nu Scapa (Fara Emotii)\\", which was then promoted in a tour of 12 Romanian cities. Their first show at Polivalenta brought to stage important guest singers such as: Andra, Smiley, Antonia, Eric Martin, Puya and Monica Anghel. For the first time on the Romanian scene, Vunk used bracelets with colored LEDs that lit simultaneously to create spectacular light effects. The idea of giving bracelets to the people present at the concert was also used by Coldplay. In 2013, Vunk launched several music videos: \\"Asa Si\\", \\"Doi Somnambuli\\", and \\"Pierderea Lor\\", the last being part of the campaign \\"Campania Respectului\\", initiated by Avon, which fights against domestic violence. In October, Vunk had its second big concert at Sala Polivalenta, entitled \\"#asasishow\\". This concert was awarded the prize of Best Romanian Concert. In February 2014, Vunk, in collaboration with Andra, launched the music video for \\"Numai La Doi\\". That year, the band registered two firsts: an acoustic concert, on 10 May, held in the suspended gardens of Promenada Mall Bucharest and a symphonic concert, on 22 June, during the Bucharest Music Film Festival in George Enescu Plaza in Bucharest. In the latter concert they were joined by the Royal Camerata and Bucharest Music Orchestra, conducted by bandmaster George Natsis.

Guts is a gambling game involving a series of deals of 2, 3, or 4 cards. Hand are ranked similarly to hands in poker. The betting during each deal is simple : all players decide whether they are \\"in\\" or \\"out\\", and announce this at the same time. Each deal has its own showdown, after which the losers match or increase the pot, which grows rapidly. A round of the game ends when only one person stays in and wins the pot.  Basic rules  In \\"Two-Card Guts\\", each player is dealt down, two hole-cards, at the beginning of a new deal. Two Card Poker rankings apply; Pairs are ranked over high cards; however there are no 'straights' or 'flushes' in two card guts (or two card poker). One variation of 2-card guts, ranks 23 (of any suits) as the highest ranking hand, trumping AA (pocket aces). Even though getting dealt 23 is more probable than AA (16 possible combinations of 23 compared to only 6 combinations of AA, or 1.2% vs 0.45% respectively), rather, it's the role reversal of the worst hand in heads-up, two-card poker. The name for the 23 hand, in this variation, is called the \\"Royal Crumpler\\", among other names. All players have a chance to say 'in' or 'out' at the same time by holding out one or two fingers, or holding a chip or nothing in their hands; those who are 'in' have a showdown. Each round starts with an ante. The players then play a series of deals; after each one, the winner takes the existing pot and the losers match it, so that the pot or some multiple of it carries over to the next deal. For example, if the pot is $5 and three people stay in, then one player will receive the $5 pot and two players will be forced to add $5 each to the next pot, escalating the size of the pot for the next deal. Then the hand is re-dealt, and all players (even those who were \\"out\\" in the last round) can participate again. The round ends when only a single player has the guts to stay \\"in\\", and thus the pot is taken without replenishment. Declaring \\"in\\" or \\"out\\" is similar to declaring high or low in high-low games. Each player takes a chip, places their hands under the table, and either places the chip in one fist or not. Each player then holds their closed fist above the table, and the players simultaneously open their hands to reveal their decision (a chip represents \\"in\\", an empty hand represents \\"out\\").  Rapid pot growth  One of the characteristics of guts is that the pot grows quickly. As it can double or more each round, pots of 50 or 100 times the original ante are possible. There are many variations. Sometimes only the single player with the worst hand (who stayed in) must add to the pot, but they must double the pot rather than match it. In one variation, nobody wins the pot unless nobody else stays in. One solution to the exponentially growing pots is to cap them at 50x or 100x the ante. That is, if there are 5 players with an ante of $1, the pot started at $5. If there were 3 doublings, the pot is now at $40. Suppose the \\"cap the pot at $50\\" rule were in force. Then, if another doubling occurred, each loser would pay $40, but the pot would now be at $50 and the extra $30 would be set aside as the ante once there's a hand with a winner and no loser.  Common variants  ;straights and flushes: In some variants, straights and flushes count for two-card guts (making them higher than other no-pair hands). In others, straights and flushes do not count for three-card guts. ;high three of a kind: Some variations for three-card guts rank three of a kind above a straight flush, but the latter occurs less frequently. ;partial hands: Each player receives all but one card face down, and if they are in, they receive their last card face up. ;dummy hands: Many variants include a dummy hand that must be beaten if only one person stays in. In some variants, rather than a dummy hand, you must have a pair or better. In others, the dummy hand always plays against the other hands, and may be called \\"Granny\\", \\"The Kitty\\", \\"Herb\\", or \\"The Pot\\". ;The Batey: one community card is flipped over from the top of the deck after all hands have been dealt which each player uses in making their hand. Named after its inventor, Justin Batey ;dealer option: In variants where players do not declare all at the same time, the dealer declares last; if no other player has stayed in, the other players sometimes have another chance to declare and challenge the dealer. With this variation, there is generally no dummy hand. ;chicken fee: If no one stays in for a hand (more common in variants where there is a dummy hand to beat), everyone has to pay another ante on the next deal. ;Henry Rule: Similar to the chicken fee. If no one stays in, the player with the hand that would have won must match the pot. ;One low \\"in\\" and wild: In this three card game, everyone is dealt one card face up. The player with the lowest card face up is automatically in, but that number is wild. ;Two low \\"in\\" and wild: In this three card game, everyone at one point is dealt a card face up. The people with the two lowest cards are automatically in but these card numbers are also wild.(If more than one person has the same number card, then more than two people can be in.) ;Hi-Lo: When deciding to stay in, each player also indicates high or low, usually by having a high-valued chip in hand for high, low-valued for low, or none for folding. If multiple players stay in, the best hand among those indicating high gets half the pot and the others have to match the pot. Similarly for low. Usually played with a dummy hand which has to be beaten in the appropriate direction to take the pot. If no dummy hand is played, a single player choosing high can take half of the pot uncontested even if other (low) players are in the game. Some games also allow \\"Hi-Lo\\" option, usually indicated by both a high-valued chip and a low-valued chip in hand at the reveal. The player going \\"Hi-Lo\\" competes amongst both the high players and the low-players, and is usually only a good idea with hands such as ace-deuce. ;No Peek: A pure gambling game, each player gets two (or three) cards, but cannot look at them before deciding to stay in. ;Winner Takes All: The winner of a round gets the pot and all the money matched by losers. This variant is usually played with a dummy hand and a chicken fee. The pot will only grow if there is a chicken fee and no players stay in, or if there is a dummy hand and the sole remaining player loses to it. = Nuts = There is a variant of Guts called Nuts. Each player is required to place a certain amount of money in the pot. For example, the bet starts with one dollar. With five players, there would be five dollars in the pot. Each player is dealt two cards, and the lowest cards win (Pairs are strong). If a player is \\"in\\" and no other players are, the player gets a \\"nut.\\" If two players go in, then neither gets a nut. These two players have to compete their cards against each other. The lower cards win, and the loser has to pay the winner money equivalent to the pot, in this case five dollars. When the third card is dealt, the best cards are the highest cards. Here the process of in and out is repeated. With the fourth card, the low cards are the best. Then with the fifth and last card, the higher the better. When a player gets three nuts, he or she will get the pot. If three nuts are not awarded within the first round, a second round is needed. With the second round, each player adds a dollar to the pot, so the pot doubles. This continues until someone gets three nuts, and thus the pot.  Similar games  There are a few other games which share the geometric pot growth and in/out betting of guts. = Toh = Toh is a high-card game in which players act in order to decide whether they are in or out, as in guts. There is a balance between the number of players and the number of points/cards needed to win; this number of points is announced before the game begins. The game is designed for 4 to 10 people. 4 players might play to 5 points, 8 or more players to only 3 points. The rules of the game are as follows: the pot is seeded with a penny. Each hand, every player is dealt one card face down. The deal rotates. After each deal, discards are kept in a separate discard pile; as long as there are enough cards in the remaining deck to deal the next hand, there is no reshuffling. (In a friendly game, the last hand before a reshuffle may be announced as such.) Each player in turn announces whether they are in or out. If only the dealer stays in, players have a second chance to stay in as well. At the showdown, the losers match the pot, and the winner keeps the high card face up next to her. High card wins; card value increases by suit, club-diamond-heart- spade. The first player to reach the declared number of points wins the game, and takes the pot.

Quitman Boulevard in Natchez, Mississippi on a lot. It was built in 1818 by John Hankinson, and renovated about 1853 by John A. Quitman, a former Governor of Mississippi and well-known figure in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. It is one of Natchez's grandest Greek Revival mansions. It was declared a Mississippi Landmark in 1986 and a National Historic Landmark in 1988. and It is now a small luxury hotel. History =John and Francing Hankinson= The home was built by John Hankinson, a postmaster, lawyer and steamboat entrepreneur, during the depression that followed the War of 1812, and named after his home, Monmouth County, New Jersey. The mansion was a brick two-story in the Federal style, with a wide central hall with four rooms located off the hall on both floors. There was also a detached brick kitchen behind it, a garden house, and several outhouses. Hankinson and his wife died soon after completing the house and the house was sold at a public auction to Calvin Smith, who one year later sold the property to John Anthony Quitman, the future Governor of Mississippi. =John and Eliza Quitman= John Quitman, originally of New York City, was a partner in a successful Natchez law firm and married Eliza Turner, a member of one of the most prominent families in the city, being the niece of Edward Turner, a Mississippi Supreme Court judge. Quitman purchased Monmouth in 1826 for his wife and growing family. The house was extensively renovated by the Quitmans in 1853 in the fashionable Greek Revival style. The original brick was covered by stucco, scored to look like stone, and the portico was added to the front, along with the four square columns supporting it. Quitman also added the rear gallery and southeast wing of the house, along with a second story for the detached kitchen. After Quitman died at Monmouth on July 17, 1858, and his wife died a year later, their five daughters and one son inherited the plantation. In 1862, when Natchez was attacked by the Union army during the American Civil War, most of the slaves fled. Most of Quitman's original possessions were either stolen in 1863, when the house was occupied by Union soldiers, or sold by Quitman's daughters in 1865 due to financial difficulty. The house was spared from further damage during the war, as the daughters befriended a Union general and pledged loyalty to the United States. In 1866, three of the daughters, Louisa, Annie Rosalie and Fredericka, purchased their siblings' share of the property, and by 1890, Annie Rosalie was the sole owner of Monmouth. In 1914, when she died, the house was left to her nieces, who later sold it in 1924. For the next half century, the house was severely neglected with the house and other surviving structures filled with litter and the grounds overgrown. =Ronald and Lani Riches= After several changes of ownership, Ronald and Lani Riches of Los Angeles, California, purchased the property in 1978 and restored it to its original condition. The restoration of the house and original brick kitchen took three years. In 1982, after archaeological research determined the location of two small houses used as slave quarters, the buildings were reconstructed on the original sites. Though most of John Quitman's original furnishings had been lost, the house still contained a few pieces such as a sofa, a carved settee, and several chairs. The Riches searched for other furniture and memorabilia from Quitman, and they were able to recover his desk, two four-poster beds, and the Quitman family Bible. Other memorabilia now include the gold sword presented to Quitman by James K. Polk and the United States Congress for his services in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, as well as the red handkerchief Quitman used to rally his troops. =Nancy and Warren Reuthter= Nancy and Warren Reuther are some of the current managing owners of Monmouth Historic Inn along with private investors. With extensive experience in the hotel and tourism industry, they continue to make sure every modern comfort has been provided in the 30 elegantly appointed spacious rooms and suites, yet carefully integrated as not to spoil the historic architectural virtue. Monmouth Historic Inn & Gardens Monmouth is now a small luxury hotel with 30 rooms and suites throughout the house and grounds. There is a fine-dining restaurant on site, Restaurant 1818, as well as a casual dining in The Quitman Lounge. Tours of the mansion are offered daily at 10 am and 2pm, and a gift shop in open to the public 7 days a week from 8am until 9pm. There have been a number of notable guests including President and Hillary Clinton, Michael Eisner, Alec Baldwin, Maya Angelou, Sela Ward, James Woods, Rob Reiner, Connie Chung, Morley Safer, Debbie Gibson, Ruby Dee and Michael Damian.

The Belum Caves have long passages, galleries, spacious caverns with fresh water and siphons. This cave system was formed over the course of tens of thousands of years by the constant flow of underground water from the now-disappeared river Chitravathi. The cave system reaches its deepest point ( from entrance level) at the point known as Pataalaganga. In Telugu language, it is called Belum Guhalu. Belum Caves have a length of , making them the second largest caves on the Indian Subcontinent after the Krem Liat Prah caves in Meghalaya. It is one of the centrally protected Monuments of National Importance. Belum came to scientific attention in 1884 by a British surveyor, Robert Bruce Foote and from 1982 to 1984, a team of German speleologists headed by H. Daniel Gebauer conducted a detailed exploration of the caves. Thereafter in 1988, the state government declared the site protected, and Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) developed the caves as a tourist attraction in February 2002. Today, of the caves have been successfully explored, though only is accessible to visitors. There are 16 different pathways, including the main entrance and there are deposits of quartz in the caves. The caves consist of black limestone.  The site  The Belum Caves are located near Belum Village in Kolimigundla Mandal of Kurnool District in the state of Andhra Pradesh. Kolimigundla is situated from Belum Caves.Reddy, K. Thimma (1976) Billasurgam: An Upper Palaeolithic Cave Site in South India The caves are an drive from Petnikota village.

Other caves include the Billasurgam caves, Sanyasula caves, Yaganti caves, Yerrajari caves, and the Muchchatla Chintamanu caves (caves are called gavi in the local language).  Discovery  Even though the Belum Caves were known to local people, the first records of site come from the expedition report of British geologist and archaeologist Robert Bruce Foote, in 1884. Thereafter, the Belum Caves remained unnoticed for almost a century until a German team headed by Herbert Daniel Gebauer conducted detailed exploration of the caves in 1982 and 1983. The German expedition was assisted by Mr Bacham Chalapathi Reddy (retd. Deputy superintendent of police), Mr Pothireddy Rama Subba Reddy (retd. Headmaster), Mr Ramaswami Reddy, Mr Boyu Madduleti, Mr K. Padmanabhaiah, Mr K. Chinnaiah and Mr A. Sunkanna.

There are indications that Jains and Buddhists monks occupied these caves centuries ago. Many Buddhists relics were found inside the caves. These relics are now housed in Museum at Ananthapur. Archaeological survey of India (ASI) also found remnants of vessels of the pre-Buddhist era and dated the remnants of these objects to 4500 years BCE. Show Caves of India: Belum Caves  Biological importance  A new and second Indian cavernicolous (inhabiting caves) species of the genus Andhracoides was discovered in the Pataalaganga chamber. The organism is named Andhracoides gebaueri in honor of Herbert Daniel Gebauer who documented and mapped the complete cave new species  Development  The caves were being used to dump wastes from nearby places until 1988. Local people of nearby settlements, notably Policemen and residents of Belum Village co-operated with the Government of Andhra Pradesh and developed the cave site as a tourist attraction. Finally, their almost two-decade long efforts resulted in the Government of Andhra Pradesh declaring the entire area to be a protected zone. Finally, in 1999, the Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation took over the task of beautifying and maintaining the caves. The APTDC who has since been in charge of management, sanctioned Rs. 7,5 million to develop the caves. The APTDC has also developed the pathways of around length in and outside of the caves, provided illumination and has created fresh-air-shafts at the site. Inside the cave, APTDC has installed bridges and staircases, and a canteen, bathrooms and toilet facilities at the entry point. APTDC also has built a Haritha Hotel for accommodation in the vicinity. There is a sizeable Buddha statue near on a hillock near the caves. One of the caverns at Belum is known as the \\"Meditation Hall\\", which was used by Buddhist monks. Relics of the Buddhist period were found here. These relics are now housed in a museum in Ananthapur.  Entrance to Caves  Map of Belum Caves engraved on a Board near entrance The tourists are charged an amount of Rs. 65.00 for entrance. Foreign Tourists are charged Rs. 300.00 per person for entrance. APTDC has installed electronic gates at entrance. After passing through the gates, one can reach the caves by a metal staircase installed by APTDC. The entrance pit was originally smaller than what one sees today. It has been broadened as part of development of the caves to install the staircase to allow visitors to descend and ascend easily. The entrance is like that of a Pit Cave. From the ground you can only see two pits side by side and third pit a little further away. After descending around 20 meters by the stairs from the entrance, the caves become horizontal. The first section one enters is called Gebauer Hall named after Speleologist Mr H. Daniel Gebauer, who had explored and mapped the caves in 1982-1983. The path to Gebauer Hall leads below the second opening, which lies next to the main entrance.  Main Sections of Belum Caves  Meditation Hall inside Belum Caves * pillidwaram ‚Äì pillidwaram means cats gate. It is a natural arch of stalactites formed in the shape of a lion's head; * Kotilingalu Chamber ‚Äì This section contains stalactite formations which are akin to Shiva lingams. This section has thousands of such stalactite giving it a surrealistic look. It has one huge pillar formed due to stalactite and stalagmite joining together. * Patalaganga ‚Äì It is a small perennial stream which disappears into the depths of the earth. This stream flows from the southeast to northwest. It disappears and is believed to be heading towards a well at the Belum village, located 2 km away from the caves. * Saptasvarala Guha or Musical Chamber ‚Äì Saptasvarala Guha means chamber of seven notes. The stalactite formations in this chamber reproduce musical sounds when these are struck with a wooden stick or knuckles. This section was opened to the public in 2006.Educationworldonline.net * Dhyan Mandir or Meditation Hall ‚Äì This section is near to the entrance. An interesting formation at Meditation hall looks like a bed with pillow to recline. The local legend has it that in ancient times many sages used to live here. This section was used by Buddhist Monks. Many relics of Buddhist period were found here which are now housed in museum at Ananthapur. * Thousand Hoods ‚Äì This section has amazing stalactite formations shaped like hood of Cobra.

It feeds upon heather. They are difficult to spot as they are camouflaged with a brownish colour, and are about long. They have a tendency to hide, and they drop into the undergrowth if they are disturbed. They are easier to see when in large numbers on the same plant. The adult beetle spends the winter in dormant diapause in moss or litter in the undergrowth of the heather plants, and they do this until the spring weather brings a rise in temperature, which stimulates them to emerge, feed, and reproduce. They are able to fly up to a range of several miles after spring emergence. They will generally do this after fire, when the surrounding heather is of poor quality, or if the heather has been browsed enough that it turns into grassland. They do however, have a level of resilience and are able to survive for some time in grassland such as Deschampsia flexuosa.

Popularly known as the Barrio Antiguo (Spanish old quarter) comprise what is preserved from the historical quarter of the city of Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico. Currently located next to the Government Palace and the Macroplaza, it originally covered a larger space from the Santa Catarina River to 5 de Mayo Street, south to north, and from Mina Street to Roble Street (nowadays Avenida Benito Ju√°rez), east to west. Most of the buildings now preserved are from the Spanish Colonial period and from the last years of the 19th century. Archaeologically speaking, the oldest Monterrey dates from the very founding of the city at the end of the sixteenth century. However, the buildings preserved today date mostly from the eighteenth century onwards. It used to be the commercial and cultural center of the city during the existence of the Viceroyalty of New Spain until recently the first half of the 20th century, when other parts of the city began to grow more to the detriment of the center. During the last decades of the 20th century there was a modern lifestyle in the Barrio Antiguo, characterized by the construction of hotels, museums, bars, discos and restaurants of international cuisine. Thus until depopulation and partial abandonment tended to decline from the 1990s to recent times, as currently there are projects under way for its restoration. Many houses of what used to be the Barrio Antiguo were demolished to give way to the construction of the Macroplaza (lit. big square) at the end of the past century. During the last decade of the twentieth century and recent years, Barrio Antiguo was well known as the center of the nightlife of Monterrey due to measures taken by the State in a failed attempt to create reforms that pushed the re-activation of the urban center. Since 2006, due to the insecurity that was rampant in the city of Monterrey, nightlife in the Barrio Antiguo almost ended, but since recent times due to the relative decline in violence many of the bars have managed to survive. From the year 2013 the government changed the way in which the Old Quarter was considered.

His father Hanns Eisler was a composer and his mother Charlotte Eisler, n√©e Demant a well-known singer and music teacher. His subject matter themes have included landscapes (often industrial featuring the north of England where he had lived after evacuating from Austria in 1936), group or crowd scenes (including jazz clubs and public transport) as well as nudes and still lifes. He returned to Vienna in 1946 where he died in 1998. Eisler lectured at various universities including the Berlin University of the Arts (Udk), HFBK Hamburg, Stanford University, the University of New Mexico, and the University of Southern California.  Life  Out of political reasons, his mother left Austria in 1936 and lived in with Georg for two years in Moscow. They then went to Prague and in 1939 to England, after the Nazi invasion of Austria. In Manchester, Georg attended Manchester Central High School for Boys and later became a student at the Stockport School of Art and Manchester Academy. He was introduced to Oskar Kokoschka in London, who agreed to give him lessons. In 1946, he returned to Vienna to continue his art studies but never lost touch with England. In 1970, Otto Klemperer commissioned Eisler to design the sets and costumes for Mozart's The Magic Flute at Covent Garden Royal Opera House. In 1968 he was elected President of the Vienna Secession, and served two terms. In this capacity he initiated the successful Secession show at London's Royal Academy. He also had several one-man shows in England. One was the show at the Manchester City Art Gallery in 1988 (which resulted in a BBC program) and at the Fisher Fine Art Gallery in London in 1989. He exhibited his work in numerous venues around Europe, including participation in the 1982 Venice Biennale. He also commenced his career as a major book illustrator. He taught regularly at the Salzburg Simmer Academy and several times at the German Summer School run by the University of New Mexico in Taos. A major retrospective of his work was presented at the Belvedere Museum in Vienna in 2001 and another at the Albertina museum in Vienna in 2001. His work is in the permanent collections of the Albertina, the Portrait Gallery of the British Museum in London, the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris and the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin. In 2003, the Leica Company celebrated his lifelong friendship with Henri Cartier-Bresson by presenting a joint show of their work in Vienna. Annually, the Georg Eisler Medal is awarded to the outstanding young artist in Austria. Georg Eisler died in 1998 and is survived by his wife Alice, who resides in Vienna.

Upon his return he built the steamboat Genoa and commanded it as captain until 1856. Throckmorton built at least two more steamboats during his lifetime, in 1857 the Florence and in 1864 the Montana. In 1868 he purchased another steamboat, the Columbia, and ran that boat on the St. Louis to Fort Benton trade route, eventually making trips along the Illinois trade route with the boat. He sold the Columbia to the Arkansas River Packet Company and worked for the United States government from 1870-72, the last two years of his life.

Although she is devoted to her father and supports his political aspirations, she longs for a life of her own. Believing she needs some excitement in her life, Mary's free-spirited Uncle Hannibal (Harry Davenport) takes her dancing at a nightclub, which the police raid for gambling. When Horace learns that press reporters have discovered Mary's name on the police report, he sends his daughter off to the family's Palm Beach, Florida mansion. For Mary, Palm Beach during the off season is a place of loneliness and boredom. She asks her two housemaids (Patsy Kelly and Mabel Todd) if she can go along with them on a blind date with some cowboys from a visiting rodeo. The two maids reluctantly agree. Feeling sorry for the inexperienced Mary, they coach her on their three-step \\"system\\" for getting a man interested: flatter him, get him talking about himself, and play on his sympathy with a hard-luck story. After the rodeo, the three women meet up with their dates at the Rodeo Cafeteria and pair off. Mary is immediately attracted to the tall, lanky, and unpretentious cowboy Stretch Willoughby (Gary Cooper) and arranges to be with him. After dinner, they continue their evening back at Mary's beachfront estate. Aware that the plain- spoken Stretch is suspicious of high society rich folk, Mary pretends to be a lady's maid whose \\"boss\\" is out of town. Mary attempts to get the shy cowboy interested by following the first two steps of the \\"system\\" but fails to attract his interest. Determined, she proceeds to the third step, inventing a hard-luck story about her drunken father and four younger sisters whom she alone must support. When she adds a tear or two to embellish her story, Stretch is won over, and the evening ends with the two kissing in the moonlight. The next morning, an enamoured Stretch appears at the mansion prepared to ask for Mary's hand in marriage. Unprepared for this turn of events, Mary casually dismisses his awkward proposal. Angered at the rejection, Stretch tosses Mary into the swimming pool and storms off. Completely fascinated by this man who is unlike any other she's met, Mary follows Stretch when he boards a ship for Galveston. Determined to apologize, Mary finally succeeds in getting the stubborn cowboy to listen to her, but she is unable to reveal her true identity. The days on board the ship bring the two closer together, and on the last night of the voyage, they are married by the ship's captain. When the newly married couple arrives at Galveston, they set up temporary home in a tent at a rodeo camp. Mary does her best to adapt to the dusty and primitive conditions, but she is having a difficult time. Stretch senses Mary's unease, but believes it stems from her worrying over her \\"family\\"‚Äîthe fictitious drunken father and four younger sisters she's supporting. He suggests she return to Palm Beach alone to settle her family obligations. Although she is ashamed of her continued deception, Mary fears Stretch will reject her if he learns the truth about her wealthy family. Stretch believes he's married a \\"work horse\\" who works hard to support her family, not a \\"show horse\\" like her fictitious boss. Confused and miserable, Mary agrees to go back home for a few days and later meet up with Stretch at his ranch in Montana. Back at her Palm Beach mansion, Mary learns that her father is on his way with all his committee members, plus an important congressman who holds the presidential nomination in his power. Her sympathetic Uncle Hannibal arrives early, and Mary tearfully confides her secret marriage to him. When Mary's father arrives, he assumes his daughter will serve as dutiful hostess and support his political plans. Feeling trapped again, Mary finally confesses to her father that she is married to a cowboy and plans to join him in Montana immediately. When she sees her father's disappointment, however, she agrees to stay until her father secures the presidential nomination. At his Montana ranch, Stretch is busy preparing for Mary's arrival and building a new house for his bride‚Äîbut Mary never arrives. Stretch heads back to the Palm Beach mansion and insists on talking to Mary's \\"employers\\". He bursts into the dining room, only to see his wife at the head of a dinner party table, surrounded by her father and his distinguished guests, who proceed to have a few laughs at the cowboy's expense. When asked for his opinion about Mary's father running for president, Stretch condemns the whole group for their behavior and leaves in anger. Seeing his daughter's distress, Horace realizes that he has not been a good father, and comforts Mary as they listen to the whistle of the train that is taking her husband out of her life. Back in Montana, a subdued Stretch arrives home only to find his father-in-law sitting on his front porch, wanting to chat about farming. Horace tells Stretch that he has quit the presidential race because he now knows that Mary's happiness is more important, acknowledging that Mary made sacrifices all her life, thinking only of her father, never herself. Upon entering the ranchhouse, the bewildered Stretch finds a party underway, Uncle Hannibal raiding the kitchen, and Mary herself baking a cake with Ma Hawkins. Soon after, the cowboy and the lady are seen kissing in Ma Hawkins kitchen.

It was derived from the chassis of the Soviet BMP-1 but possessing a lengthened hull, a 12.7√ó108mm DShK 1938/46 heavy machine gun mounted on the roof of the troop compartment and MLI-84M having Oerlikon KBA autocannon and new ATGMs. Development history In 1982 Romania purchased a license to produce 178 BMP-1 IFVs from USSR. At the same time it received permission to modify the construction in order to adapt it to its industry.http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/trade_register.php The decision of improving the old Soviet IFVs came in 1995. As a result of Romanian-Israeli cooperation project the new modernized MLI-84M variant was created. Since then, the Romanian Ministry of Defense spent over US$ 155 million to upgrade 99 vehicles. Description National Military Museum, Bucharest The most important improvement in the MLI-84 was the replacement of the Soviet UTD-20 (a 4-stroke V-shaped airless-injection water-cooled multifuel 15.8-litre diesel v6 engine) with the 8V-1240-DT-S 4-stroke liquid- cooled diesel V8 engine developed in Romania. The new engine is more powerful as it develops 355 hp (265 kW) but it is heavier and bigger and because of that the engine compartment had to be rebuilt in order to fit the new engine. The fuel capacity was increased to 600 liters. Because of these modifications the length of the hull of the vehicle was increased by 60 cm (7.335 m) which in turn resulted in wider gaps between the roadwheels. The vehicle is also wider (3.15 m) and higher (2.11 m). The ground clearance has increased from 370 mm to 400 mm. The new engine has increased vehicle's maximal road speed to 70 km/h. The armament wasn't modified but a 12.7 mm DShK 1938/46 heavy machine gun was placed on a rotatable mount fitted on the left rear troop compartment roof hatch. It is operated by the trooper sitting next to the left rear door of the troop compartment which makes operating it while the infantry is dismounting impossible. Because of the mentioned modifications and additions, the weight of the vehicle increased to 16.6 tonnes and although the vehicle can still travel across water with little preparation, the amphibious ability was weakened. Production history MLI-84 production began in 1985 and 178 vehicles were produced until 1991. Variants * MLI-84 ‚Äì Basic version, as described. * MLI-84M1 JDERUL ‚Äì MLI-84 modernization fitted with a new Israeli OWS-25R overhead mount turret armed with 25 mm Oerlikon KBA autocannon and two 9S415 ATGM launchers. It is also equipped with two banks of four 81 mm DLG 81 heat and smoke grenade launchers. Grenades leave a thermal curtain of fire around the vehicle for about five minutes, to confuse enemy missiles. MLI-84M1 vehicle also has a system that can disperse dense smoke over a radius of 360 degrees around the vehicle and at a distance between 300‚Äì400 m. Because mounting of the new turret increased the weight of the vehicle to 17.6 tonnes, a new more powerful engine had to be fitted. The new engine is the Caterpillar C9 engine developing 396 hp (295 kW) which is the same engine as the one found in MOWAG Piranha III IFVs recently acquired by the Romanian Land Forces. However the vehicle lost its ability to travel across water with little preparation and has to be specially prepared before entering water. The vehicle also became even wider (3.3 m) and higher (2.942 m) than its predecessor. Although the engine is more powerful, the weight of the new equipment has in fact decreased the vehicle's maximum road speed to 65 km/h.\\"JED The Military Equipment Directory\\" The 9S415 ATGM launcher capable of firing 9M14 \\"Malyutka\\" (NATO: AT-3A Sagger A), 9M14M \\"Malyutka-M\\" (NATO: AT-3B Sagger B) and 9M14P \\"Malyutka-P\\" (NATO: AT-3C Sagger C) ATGMs also has been replaced and there are two different variants, each with a different ATGM launcher replacing it:  MLI-84M1 armed with ATGM launcher capable of firing Yugoslavian 9M14-2T Maljutka-2T antitank guided missiles instead of the 9M14 Malyutka.

The records often carry, besides the name Shandar, the logo Shanti. The label was financed by Aim√© and Marguerite Maeght, creators of the Maeght Foundation which organized modern art exhibitions and concerts. Consequently, much of the label's catalog consists of recordings of Maeght-sponsored concerts, as in the cases of Cecil Taylor's and Albert Ayler's Nuits de la Fondation Maeght. Among the works in its catalog, one of the most unusual is La Monte Young's Dream House 78' 17\\", containing the music for one of Young's installations, the Dream House: both sides were almost 40 minutes long for a total duration of 78' 17\\", a length unheard of at the time but made necessary by the nature of the work. The label also released Guitares D√©rive, written and performed live by the classical guitar duo Vincent Le Masne and Bertrand Porquet. In spite of the unique material it owned, the label was short-lived. According to the magazine The Wire, a cellar beneath an art gallery in 40 Rue Mazarine in Paris where founders Daniel Caux and Chantal Darcy worked was flooded in 1979, damaging irreparably both vinyl stocks and recordings. The gallery closed soon thereafter and Shandar vanished. Some of its catalog was subsequently bought by other small labels and is therefore still available, but much of it has disappeared.

He is known for his haute cuisine offal dishes, and was chef-partner at Incanto in San Francisco. Forbes Traveler called Incanto \\"perhaps America‚Äôs most adventurous nose-to- tail restaurant ‚Ä¶ On offer are lamb‚Äôs necks, pig trotters and a five-course nose-to-tail tasting menu perhaps including venison kidneys and chocolate- blood panna cotta.\\" Incanto closed on March 24, 2014. In December 2014, he opened Cockscomb, a restaurant centered around his updated interpretations of classic San Francisco dishes. In 2017 he published the cookbook Offal Good: Cooking from the Heart, with Guts, and he maintains an offal-themed website, \\"Offal Good\\". Early life Chris Cosentino was raised in Rhode Island and is a 1994 graduate of Johnson & Wales University.Johnson & Wales University: Chris Cosentino '94 In 2018, Cosentino gave a cooking demonstration to students at his alma mater, during which he offered students career advice to achieve their goals. While there, he also had a chance to thank one of his mentors, a chef, Jacques Pepin. He cited Pepin's cookbooks, La Technique and La Methode, with their detail and step-by-step illustrations as helping him deal with dyslexia and attention deficit disorder. Explaining what these books and Pepin's influence meant to him, Cosentino said that having dyslexia and attention deficit disorder prevented him from being able to read traditional textbooks and cookbooks. Raised in an Italian American community, he has stated that he hated offal as a child, especially the tripe his Italian grandmother prepared. Since becoming a chef himself, however, he has embraced a \\"whole-animal\\" ethic. He explains, \\"What I try to do is make people understand a whole-animal ethic. When people realize that this is a whole animal, that there is more than just the skeletal meats, sometimes that makes people step back and they might not order any meat. They might have a vegetable entr√©e. Putting a face on what you‚Äôre eating sometimes opens your eyes a lot.\\" Career Cosentino worked at Mark Miller's Red Sage and later at Kinkead‚Äôs, in Washington, D.C. He then moved to San Francisco's Rubicon, which was owned by Francis Ford Coppola, Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. He went on to work at several prestigious restaurants, such as the Coach House on Martha's Vineyard and Bay Area restaurants Chez Panisse and Belon. He was then hired as a consultant to the Aqua restaurant group. While working with them, he opened several restaurants, including the highly acclaimed Nobhill at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. After 2002, Cosentino worked at Incanto in the San Francisco neighborhood Noe Valley, serving as the executive chef.Incanto People Local restaurant critics noted an upturn in food quality at Incanto after he took over. Working with co-owner Mark Pastore, Cosentino created a rustic Italian menu that included cuts of meat from whole animals and fish, including what would usually be discarded or used as an ingredient in animal feed. In 2007, Incanto held their fourth annual \\"Head-to-Tail Dinner.\\" In 2007, Cosentino opened a salumeria named Boccalone: Tasty Salted Pig Parts in San Francisco's Ferry Building. This new company was following in his family's traditions, as his mother's family ran Easton‚Äôs Sausage Company in Newport, Rhode Island from 1860 to 1942. He uses many of the original recipes from Easton's for Boccalone products. Under Cosentino's direction, Incanto launched a charcuterie selection, with all products cured in-house and ranging from mortadella to fennel salume, sweetbread terrines, and salt-cured pork liver. This product line is based on the community-supported agriculture (CSA) concept in which providing locally grown produce is the focus. Cosentino credits the late chef Jean-Louis Palladin with teaching him never to cook for reviews but only for the diners and himself. Palladin was an avid hunter and taught Chris to be realistic and respectful about the fate of an animal going from the farmyard or the forest to the dinner plate. In October 2007 Cosentino was a contestant on The Next Iron Chef, competing with his former mentor at Rubicon, Traci Des Jardins, still a close friend. On the third episode, when Michael Symon gave him squab as a secret ingredient, his first action was to check the cavities for offal. It was implied that Symon had removed the innards; when Cosentino discovered this, Symon quipped, \\"No guts, no glory.\\" In episode 7, 'Lead and Inspire', he was the last chef eliminated before the final battle. In November 2007, he was featured at the end of a Modern Marvels episode about pigs, during which he showed his expertise in cooking pork brain.Modern Marvels episode: The Pig (ep. 491, Nov 27, 2007) In August 2009, he and fellow The Next Iron Chef contestant Aar√≥n S√°nchez began hosting Chefs vs. City on the Food Network. Each week they traveled to a different city, taking on two local chefs in a variety of food-related challenges. Repeated consumption of chili peppers resulted in Cosentino's suffering third-degree alkaline burns in his digestive system and losing intestinal motility. This injury took five years to heal. Cosentino is regularly featured on episodes of the Food Network series The Best Thing I Ever Ate. He considers single- varietal extra-virgin olive oils with their distinctive flavors as his culinary secret weapon. Cosentino's involvement with local farmers' markets has enabled him to develop close relationships with local food producers. These relationships are very important to him and allow him to be involved in the production of meat and other ingredients he uses in his many specialties. He has been especially dedicated to the San Francisco Ferry Plaza Farmers' Market. In his spare time Cosentino cycles on rugged Northern California mountain-biking trails on a one-speed bicycle, participates in endurance rides, and spends time with his wife \\"Meat Maven\\" and young son. In 2011 it was announced that Cosentino is teaming up with the publishers of Wolverine to write a comic book. In addition to helping out with the story, he'll also be featured as a character.Zagat Buzz Blog: Chris Cosentino to Write, Star in Issue of Wolverine, April 4, 2011 He has authored a cookbook, Beginnings: My Way to Start a Meal, published in May 2012. Michael Harlan Turkell is the photographer for the book, and Traci Des Jardin wrote the foreword. The book contains recipes for dishes for first courses (most vegetable-based, not meat- based, despite Cosentino's specialty), but also includes philosophy and reproduced handwritten notes and sketches. It is laid out by seasons. In March 2012, Cosentino partnered with Adam Fleischman and opened PIGG, \\"a tribute to all things pork around the world\\", at UMAMIcatessen in Los Angeles. UMAMIcatessen is a three-part cafeteria-style dining establishment on the ground floor of the Orpheum Lofts at 9th and Broadway. On September 26, 2012, Cosentino won season four of Top Chef Masters on Bravo, raising $141,000 for the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. Cosentino and his partner announced on March 5, 2014, that they would close Incanto to open Porcellino at the same location. It was to be a more casual neighborhood dining option/retail space. With the opening of Cockscomb, however, it was closed. Cockscomb focuses on classic San Francisco cuisine more than to Italy. Oysters and shellfish are a major aspect of what the restaurant offers. In 2016, Cosentino announced that he would open Jackrabbit, his first restaurant outside of California, in Portland, Oregon. Television appearances * 2005, Check Please!

The Neversink Library, \\"a collection of lost, forgotten, and 'foolishly ignored' books from around the world\\". The Last Interview series, which collects interviews with prominent writers, including the last interviews given before their deaths, has included Ernest Hemingway, Philip K. Dick and Nora Ephron. In 2014, it published the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture in just 19 days; and later that year, an edition of the Pope Francis' Laudato si', an encyclical on climate change, soon after the Pope released it. The speed of publications has been called \\"extraordinary\\" for the industry. In 2016, Melville House published The Making of Donald Trump by David Cay Johnston. Melville used a process they call \\"crashing the book\\" to work around the clock and bring the book out in 27 days. It beat other Trump books to press that summer and went on to spend four weeks on the New York Times Best Sellers List.

It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1968 and and a Mississippi Landmark in 1986. The landmarked area comprises the entire Courthouse Square, which includes the courthouse and four attached buildings that were originally cistern houses for catching rainwater to fight fires, but these were later converted into offices. Atop one of the highest bluffs in Vicksburg, construction began in the summer of 1858. The property for the new building was donated to the city by its founder, Newitt Vick. The Weldon brothers from Rodney, Mississippi, were hired to build the courthouse, which was completed in 1860 at a cost of $100,000. During the Civil War, the building was one of the main targets in Vicksburg. As hard as the Union tried, the building suffered only one major hit. After a 47-day siege, on July 4, 1863, the Stars and Bars were lowered and the Stars and Stripes were raised. Many historical figures have visited the courthouse over the years, including Jefferson Davis, Booker T. Washington, William McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt. Famous trials were conducted in the building's second-floor courtroom. One was of freed slave Holt Collier, who in 1867 was arrested and charged with the murder of a white police officer from North Mississippi. He was acquitted of all charges for defending his former owner's name. The original iron doors and shutters are still on the building today. On June 3, 1948 the museum opened its doors, thanks to Eva Whitaker Davis. Mrs. Davis is the founder of the Vicksburg and Warren County Historical Society.

Credited to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, \\"Too Much Blood\\" is largely a Jagger composition. The song is a reflection of the many influences the Stones had during their career in the mid-1980s. Jagger said at the time of its release, \\"I had made out a very honest burden of mind before everyone had arrived one night. It was just Charlie [Watts] and Bill [Wyman]. And one of our roadies called Jim Barber, he was playing guitar on it too. And I just started playing this riff I had, with this middle part, I didn't have any words to it and then I just suddenly started rapping out these words which are the ones you hear.\\" Barber remarked that \\"Mick asked me if I could do an 'Andy Summers' on the track.\\" The song itself deals with the growing depictions of violence in the media at the time and the case of Issei Sagawa, with Jagger saying, \\"Well there was this scandalous, murderous story in France - it was a true story - about this Japanese guy who murdered this girl and it sort of captured the imagination of the French public, and the Japanese. The Russians wanted to make a movie out of it. So that was the first bit and then I started becoming more light-hearted about it, movies and all. ...it came out as a sort of anti-gratuitous cinema of violence. And it's a kind of anti-violent thing.\\" Jagger uses a half-hearted rap delivery for some lines, saying at the time, \\"I'm not a great rapper... It's just made up on the spot as well. It's completely extemporized, as well, most of it. A couple words I cleaned up. I don't mean clean up, just made better sounds. That was just rap off the top of my head. I didn't write it down, even.\\" Recording took place at Paris' Path√© Marconi Studios and New York City's Hit Factory between October and November 1982. With Jagger on lead vocals, he also performs electric guitars with Barber and Wood. Horns are provided by Chops and percussion by Sly Dunbar. A dance version of \\"Too Much Blood,\\" remixed by Arthur Baker, was released as a twelve-inch single on December 1984. A music video, directed by Julien Temple, was produced in support showing the band performing the song as well as Richards and guitarist Ron Wood chasing Jagger with chainsaws.

Common side effects include loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, sleepiness, trouble sleeping, and cough. Safety in pregnancy is not clear; however, the medication may be used if others are not possible. It is believed to be safe for use during breastfeeding. Artesunate and amodiaquine are both antimalarial medication; however, work by different mechanisms. Artesunate/amodiaquine was commercially launched in 2007. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Artesunate/amodiaquine is available as a generic medication. As of 2014 it is not commercially available in the United States or United Kingdom. Medical uses Early clinical trials showed that a once- a-day dosage was effective. It was subsequently clinically shown to be equally effective as artemether/lumefantrine, although it is likely to be more effective in the field due to its simpler once-a-day dosage compared to artemether/lumefantrine twice-per-day dosage.

Built in 1836, it served as the headquarters for Confederate General John C. Pemberton during most of the 47-day siege of Vicksburg, and was the site where he decided to surrender the city to Union General Ulysses S. Grant on July 4, 1863. The house is owned by the National Park Service and is open to the public as part of Vicksburg National Military Park. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. and Description and history Pemberton's Headquarters is located on the eastern fringe of Vicksburg's downtown area, on the south side of Crawford Street just west of Adams Street. It is a two-story brick building, set well above the street, from which it is separated by a retaining wall and steep terraced landscaping. A concrete stair climbs through the terracing to provide access to the front of the property. The house is a large L-shaped structure, with a brick front section and a rear wood frame addition. The front portion of the house was built in stages, with the initial structure of 1836 consisting of a main hall and flanking parlors, with a porch (probably smaller but more architecturally elaborate than the present one) sheltering the entrance. This was enlarged in brick in about 1850, with the rearmost additions coming around the turn of the 20th century. The house was probably built by William Bobb, who sold it in 1836 to John Willis, an area plantation owner. It was under Willis ownership at the outbreak of the American Civil War, and when the war came to Vicksburg, Willis's house, one of the largest in the city, was chosen by Confederate General John C. Pemberton as the headquarters for the city's defense. It was here that Pemberton and his subordinates planned out their military activities, and it is where they made the decision to surrender on July 3, 1863. The Willises sold the house in 1886, and in 1890 it was bought by Mary Cowan, the wife of a Confederate veteran who died two years later. Mrs. Cowan died in 1914, and her estate sold it to the Sisters of Mercy, who operated a convent and school across the street. The house was used as part of their facilities (and called \\"St. Anthony's Hall\\") until 1973, when it was sold into private hands. In need of significant restoration at that time, it continued to decline until the 1990s, when it was sufficiently restored to operated for several years as a bed and breakfast inn. That enterprise failed, and it stood vacant until its acquisition by the National Park Service in 2003. The Park Service was authorized in 2002 to purchase the house, for inclusion as an element of the Vicksburg National Military Park. Although most of that park's facilities are on the city's outskirts, the house is now used to interpret the experiences of the Confederate leadership, and the conditions in the city during the siege.

It has rough, fibrous and flaky bark on the trunk, smooth bark on the branches, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, white flowers and cup-shaped to hemispherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus todtiana is a tree or a mallee that typically grows to a height of between and forms a lignotuber. It has a weeping habit and rough, fibrous, prickly bark on the lower trunk, rough, scaly bark on the upper trunk and smooth grey to pinkish bark on the branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile leaves that are elliptical to oblong, long and wide and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, light green, lance-shaped, long and , tapering to a petiole long. The plant has a dense, spreading to pendulous crown. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven, nine or eleven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from January to April and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped to hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus todtiana was first formally described by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1882, based on specimens collected by him from sandy ridges near the Greenough and Arrowsmith Rivers in 1877, and also specimens collected by John Forrest from near the Moore River. The description was published in the journal Southern Science Record. The specific name honours Emil Todt, a botanical artist who drew some of the plates for Mueller's Atlas of Eucalypts. This species is part of the Eucalyptus subgenus series Diversiformae, subseries Neuropterae, a group of mallees that all have adult leaves held erect, buds with a single unscarred operculum and pyramidal seeds. Distribution and habitat Coastal blackbutt grows in scrub and in open woodland on sandy flats and gentle slopes on the coastal plain between Perth and Dongara in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. Ecology The slow growing, long lived species is a habitat tree for many local fauna such as nectar- feeding birds, bats, lizards and insects. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Eucalyptus todtiana is not often grown in cultivation. It grows rapidly as a sapling if planted in an open position, but as an adult it grows slowly and flowers profusely. It is both frost and drought tolerant. Uses Indigenous Australians used parts of the tree for medicinal purposes. The leaves as a nasal decongestant or as an antibacterial poultice by crushing the leaves. Leaves were also eaten to relieve dysentery. The gum was also used on sores as an ointment. Leaves from the tree were also commonly used for bedding. =Gallery= Image:Eucalyptus todtiana - sign.jpgConservation sign adjacent to Victoria Park specimen Image:Etodtiana3April2012.jpgThe same tree as above, five years later in 2012.

Built in the 1838, it is architecturally unique among Mississippi's antebellum mansions for its enormous octagonal cupola. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1973. Description Waverley is located roughly midway between West Point and Columbus, on the northeast side of Waverley Road south of Mississippi Highway 50. It is set overlooking the Tombigbee River on a small portion of the original plantation land. The main house is a basically H-shaped two story structure, with a hip roof from which an oversized octagonal cupola rises another two stories. The building's Greek Revival features include corner pilasters and a dentillated cornice. The interior is richly decorated, with four rooms on each level opening into a central octagonal space. Hanging from the center of the cupola is the original gas- fired chandelier. History The antebellum home was originally owned by George Hampton Young, a colonel from Georgia. Young named the home after Sir Walter Scott's novel Waverley. From its accepted date of completion in 1852, the Waverley Plantation was a self-sustaining community, complete with gardens, orchards and livestock. It maintained a brick kiln, cotton gin, ice house and swimming pool with a bathhouse. Gas for the chandeliers was produced by burning pine knots in a retort. In later years, Waverley had its own lumber mill, leather tannery and hat manufacturing operation. It is believed that the first American-made saddle blankets were produced at Waverley and the first fox hunt association was formed in the mansion's library in 1893. The mansion fell into disrepair following the end of the Young family line in 1913, but was restored by the Robert Snow family beginning in 1962.http://www.wpms.net/waverley_mansion.htm Waverley Mansion.

History Gorubathan was once ruled by Lepcha kings who built Dalim Fort on top of a hill at Dalim Busty. Lepcha king Gaebbo Achyok defeated the King of Bhutan when the Bhutanese had invaded Gorubathan and signed a treaty in that fort, making it a place of significance for the Lepcha tribe. In 2008, Govt of West Bengal announced the place as a heritage site. How the nomenclature ‚ÄòGorubathan‚Äô was started is still controversial but due to vast grazing land and rearing of huge cattle in the open plain land of this area in earlier time must have started calling the place as Gorubathan (herds of cattle/Goru means- Ox, Bathan means -Herd) in Nepali language by the local people. Some say that this place must have been dominated by the Gurus (priests) with their deity and supernatural powers in earlier times and subsequently started calling Gorubathan. It is also said that the cowboys from Bhutan used to supply Ox (Goru) in bulk meant for Kalimpong Hat Bazar from Bhutan. They used to stay on the bank of Chel river of present Sombarey Bazar for a day. Those Ox used to graze in the vast grazing areas of Upper Fagu and its adjoining areas. this is how the name of the place Gorubathan (herd of Ox) came into existence.

The electrode is a cathode for an electropositive plasma, while it is an anode for an electronegative plasma. Plasma can be generated in a suitably designed vacuum chamber with the help of various plasma sources such as Electron Cyclotron Resonance plasma source which yields plasma with the highest ion density and lowest contamination level, helicon plasma source, capacitively coupled plasma source, inductively coupled plasma source, DC glow discharge and metal vapor arc(for metallic species). The vacuum chamber can be of two types - diode and triode typeMichael A. Liberman and Allan J. Lichtenberg, Principles of plasma discharges and material processing, Ed. New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1994. depending upon whether the power supply is applied to the substrate as in the former case or to the perforated grid as in the latter.  Working  thumb In a conventional immersion type of PIII system, also called as the diode type configuration, the wafer is kept at a negative potential since the positively charged ions of the electropositive plasma are the ones who get extracted and implanted. The wafer sample to be treated is placed on a sample holder in a vacuum chamber. The sample holder is connected to a high voltage power supply and is electrically insulated from the chamber wall. By means of pumping and gas feed systems, an atmosphere of a working gas at a suitable pressure is created.W. Ensinger, ‚ÄúSemiconductor processing by plasma immersion ion implantation‚Äù, Materials science & engineering. A., Vol. 253, No. 1 - 2, 1998, pp. 258‚Äì268. When the substrate is biased to a negative voltage (few KV's), the resultant electric field drives electrons away from the substrate in the time scale of the inverse electron plasma frequency œâe‚àí1 ( ~ l0‚àí9 sec). Thus an ion matrix Debye sheath which is depleted of electrons forms around it. The negatively biased substrate will accelerate the ions within a time scale of the inverse ion plasma frequency œâi‚àí1 ( ~ 10‚àí6 sec). This ion movement lowers the ion density in the bulk, which causes the sheath-plasma boundary to expand in order to sustain the applied potential drop,in the process exposing more ions. The plasma sheath expands until either a steady-state condition is reached, which is called Child Langmuir law limit; or the high voltage is switched off as in the case of Pulsed DC biasing. Pulse biasing is preferred over DC biasing because it creates less damage during the pulse ON time and neutralization of unwanted charges accumulated on the wafer in the afterglow period (i.e. after the pulse has ended). In case of pulsed biasing the TON time of the pulse is generally kept at 20-40 ¬µs, while the TOFF is kept at 0.5-2 ms i.e. a duty cycle of 1-8%. The power supply used is in range of 500 V to hundreds of KV and the pressure in the range of 1-100 mTorr.Andr√© Anders et al., Handbook of Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation and Deposition, Ed. New York: John Wiley and Sons, 2000. This is the basic principle of the operation of immersion type PIII. In case of a triode type configuration, a suitable perforated grid is placed in between the substrate and the plasma and a pulsed DC bias is applied to this grid. Here the same theory applies as previously discussed, but with a difference that the extracted ions from the grid holes bombard the substrate, thus causing implantation. In this sense a triode type PIII implanter is a crude version of ion implantation because it does not contain plethora of components like ion beam steering, beam focusing, additional grid accelerators etc. See also *List of plasma (physics) articles  References   Other sources  C.R.

One of the largest and most popular beaches in Los Angeles County, California, Zuma is known for its long, wide sands and excellent surf. It consistently ranks among the healthiest beaches for clean water conditions in Los Angeles County. The origin of the name of the beach may be related to the origin of the name of nearby [promontory] Point Dume. Point Dume was named by George Vancouver in 1793 in honor of Padre Francisco Dumetz of Mission San Buenaventura.Point Dume Brochure California State Parks. The name was misspelled on Vancouver's map as \\"Dume\\" and was never corrected.

Like all beaches with good surf, Zuma has its share of rip currents.Rip Currents Visitors are encouraged not to swim or surf in front of the Lifeguard Headquarters between Towers 8 and 9, an area particularly prone to rip currents. In fact, rip currents are so prevalent that as of 2007 the Los Angeles County Fire Department Lifeguard Unit uses Zuma Beach to illustrate a rip current.LACFD: What is a rip current Zuma Beach hosts several premier surfing events each year. With optimum wind conditions nearly daily in the late afternoon, Zuma draws many to kitesurfing on the northern end of Zuma Beach. Zuma Beach can be accessed directly from PCH, and lies between the major access corridors Las Virgenes/Malibu Canyon Road and Kanan-Dume Road to the southeast, and Las Posas Road to the northwest. Parking is available in a large fee parking lot. Additional parking is available on the adjacent PCH. On its southeast side, Zuma is bordered by Westward Beach. Westward is geographically situated on Malibu's westernmost promontory known as Point Dume. Westward includes a stretch of 2-way road right at the sand's edge. Parking is available on the road as well as a fee parking lot. Westward Beach is marked by a shorter sand shelf than Zuma, a veritable pipeline, making the waves of less duration and higher impact. Westward Beach is recommended only for strong swimmers, as the wave action compared to Zuma Beach is stronger, can push down on swimmers, and delivers more of a \\"crunch.\\" Westward Beach is where former lifeguard Jesse BillauerJesse Billauer suffered the accident that left him paralyzed.

Built in 1823, it served as the architectural inspiration for a large number of Natchez's grand Greek Revival mansions, and was a major influence on Antebellum architecture in the greater region. During the American Civil War, it served as Union headquarters for the Natchez area from July 1863 on. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989. Description Rosalie is located southwest of Natchez's downtown area, overlooking the Mississippi River at the junction of Orleans and South Broadway Streets. It is a basically cubical three-story brick building, with a truncated hip roof encircled by a low balustrade. Its front facade has a monumental four-column Tuscan portico, with entablature and a gabled pediment with a semi-oval window at its center. Broad entrances in the center bay provide access to the house on the ground floor and a balcony on the second; both have double-leaf doors, sidelight windows, and semi-oval transom windows. A five-column portico extends across the center of the rear elevation, although it is covered by a flat roof without entablature. History Rosalie, by Frances Benjamin Johnston, 1938 Rosalie Mansion was built for Peter Little, a wealthy cotton broker, in 1823 on the bluff overlooking the Mississippi River. It is on a portion of the site of the Natchez Indians' 1729 massacre of the French at Fort Rosalie. On July 13, 1863, a week after the Battle of Vicksburg, General Grant took possession of Rosalie to use as Union Army headquarters. On August 26, 1863, General Walter Gresham took command of Union Army troops at Natchez. His headquarters remained at Rosalie. Gresham had much of the owner's furnishings stored in the attic and put under guard to prevent theft or destruction. Union army tents covered much of the property surrounding the mansion. Union Army soldiers were placed in position in the widow's walk on top of the mansion. Historic house museum Rosalie Mansion has been owned, operated, and maintained as a historic house museum by the Mississippi State Society Daughters of the American Revolution, for more than seventy years. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989. and Photography is not allowed inside the mansion.

Program Description  CYMA, the Canadian Youth Mission to Armenia, is a Canadian, volunteer led humanitarian and exchange program focused on redevelopment, community projects, humanitarian aid distribution and student exchange. CYMA was founded in late 1992 through a collaboration between Archbishop Hovnan Derderian, then primate of the Canadian Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church, and university student Ronald Alepian. 1993 The first CYMA \\"mission\\" took place in the summer of 1993 when 24 young Canadians spent a month in the Ararat region of the newly independent Armenia. The mission had three main projects: The construction of a primary school. A . building left uncompleted after the fall of the Soviet Union was renovated and furnished in under 4 weeks by the volunteers and opened in late August 1993. It continues to operate today. Distribution of aid to border villages affected by the War in Karabakh and to children and orphan members of the CFFA - Children's Fund for Armenia. Visitations, aid and humanitarian relief to poor families in the Ararat Region. 1994 The summer of 1994 saw fifty participants from several cities across Canada, as well as individuals from Europe and the United States. These volunteers chose to take part in the renovation of a school and a monastery, establish a day camp for the young victims of the Nagorno-Kharabagh war, present a Christian outreach program, conduct home visitations and collect statistical data and anecdotal evidence regarding the forced Armenian exodus from Azerbaijan. Most importantly they chose to share and connect with the locals to raise spirits and give them hope to endure those difficult times and look forward to a brighter future. 1995 In a meeting with local school board officials, CYMA leaders identified Afshar High School for Honor Students as the main project. Local officials began renovating the building in the hopes of creating a school for higher learning to prepare bright and promising students in the region for university education. In September 1996, the school opened and the villages in the Ararat Region began to train their youth for the future. The alumni of the \\"Nor Tbrotz\\" school of Istanbul, Turkey donated a substantial amount of money for the realization of this project. The year also witnessed the start of the new Christian Outreach Program and Education, see below. Also, CYMA participants renovated all of the floors of the Shirazloo village's high school and financed the reconstruction of the flooring in Shirazloo Kindergarten. From years of neglect, many of the floors were collapsing due to rotting of the wood in both establishments. 1996 The 1996 mission was dedicated to the renovation of an orphanage, as well as a day camp for children between the ages of eight and twelve. In the mountainous and enchanting site of Dilijian, participants found themselves on the grounds of the Meredi orphanage. The building was limited in capacity due to the unlivable state of some of the dormitories: floors were covered in dust and garbage, or contained major fissures, walls were on the verge of collapse, wallpaper was shredded and the exterior walls were compromised due to the faulty masonry during the original construction. An extensive renovation was carried out which resulted in an increase of the capacity of the orphanage. As every year, CYMA had organized a day camp for disadvantaged children. During the day, CYMA volunteers participated with the kids in the regular classes organized by the orphanage for the children. The youth played games, music, taught arts & crafts and introduced many new sports to the orphans. 1997 Young Armenian Canadian students and workers participated in the Canadian Youth Mission to Armenia's fifth anniversary. The summer of 1997 was an all-out summer camp with children including visitations to local community houses and also the distribution of humanitarian aid. 1998 CYMA renovated Khor Virap and conducted day camps in Ararat. 1999 The CYMA mission of 1999 was the seventh pilgrimage to Armenia and took place in the village of Dzaghgatzor. Participants joined together from Canada, United States and Mexico to on a major renovation of a day camp known as George Makinisian Camp. Some of the tasks of the construction included, cleaning, removing existing furniture, scraping the wallpaper, chiseling the tiles from the walls, carving opening for wire and cable application to interior partition walls, sanding walls, window frames, doors and flooring, leveling the ground and digging a 200-meter water pipe line trench. The day camp took place twice a week in the mornings for approximately 120 local children in Dzaghgatzor. The average class was 17 people with three or four CYMA participants as leaders of each class. During the course of the morning the participants interacted with the children by teaching them prayers, songs and poetry in both English and Armenian. In addition, the participants spent time with the kids through games, sports, arts and crafts.  COPE: Christian Outreach Program and Education  One of CYMA's primary goals is to reach out to the people of Armenia. To do so, a religious outreach program named COPE was established where CYMA would provide spiritual guidance as well as basic humanitarian assistance to the families, by visiting them in small groups directly in their homes. The program allowed the introduction of the Armenian Church to families and the re-awakening of their spirituality.  Creation of CYMA  CYMA operates under the auspices of the Canadian Diocese, but since its early days, enjoys the active participation and support of the various Armenian organizations in Canada, including the AGBU - Armenian General Benevolent Union. It was founded in 1992 by Archbishop Hovnan Derderian and Founding Chairperson Ronald Alepian, then a 22-year-old university student. When creating CYMA, Alepian formed an honorary Board of Directors to add credibility to the mission, which included the late Senator Jacques Hebert (founder of Canada World Youth) and the late Senator Shirley Maheu. Hebert and Maheu gave counsel and direction to Alepian and the early CYMA leaders. Image:Cymamenu r1 c11.gif One of the first things done by the founding committee was to commission a logo to brand the program in the minds of the community. The logo is highly recognizable within the Armenian community and remains a symbol of Canada's participation in the redevelopment of the new country. Alepian was awarded the St. Gregory of Nareg Cross by Archbishop Derderian in 1993 for his work developing the CYMA program.  On- going mission  CYMA continues to operate today, now working in direct collaboration with the Armenian Church Youth Organization.Getting to the Heart of Armenia - http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=67ac70a4-49fa-448d-a0b2-c681407a3cdc&sponsor;= It remains one of the most active youth projects within the Armenian community.10th Mission to Armenia - http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-79124820.html References Category:Armenian-Canadian culture Category:Youth organizations established in 1992 Category:Youth organizations based in Canada Category:Religious organizations based in Canada Category:Foreign charities operating in Armenia ","title":"CYMA ‚Äì Canadian Youth Mission to Armenia"},{"id":"13871519","text":"Palatu is a village in L√§√§neranna Parish, P√§rnu County in southwestern Estonia.

His parents were separated when he was three years old, and subsequently raised by his father. Birra was raised speaking the Oromo language. He attended Arabic school as a child, where he learned Arabic. He also enrolled in a local public school and pursued his education until sixth grade. In his early years, Ali would do small street-peddling in order to live without begging people for money to support his livelihood. When he was 13, he joined Afran Qallo, a cultural group which he was operating unofficially function to promote the Oromo music and culture. The first song that he sang on stage for first time called \\"Birra dha Bari'e\\". After he sang the song, \\"Birra dha Bari'e\\", people gave him a nickname called \\"Ali Birra\\". Which \\"Ali\\" is his first name and \\"Birra: is the initial song name, when it comes together, it means, \\"Ali the Spring\\". The government banned the Afran Qallo group in 1965 and arrested some of its members. Ali escaped arresting and moved to Addis Ababa. After settling in Addis Ababa, he engaged in different activities along with singing. On this occasion, Ali came to know the nationalist Ahmad Taqi, and the latter bought him a guitar so that Ali could sing more widely. His fame increased dramatically throughout the city. He had ability to sing in Amharic, Arabic, Harari, and Somali languages, in addition to Oromo, his mother tongue. He gained appreciation from different contemporary personalities including Eyoel Yohannes, at the time the head of Kibur Zebegna, who then recruited him as a solo singer in Oromo. He joined other famous singers such as Mahmoud Ahmed, Tilahun Gessesse and Bizunesh Bekele. He traveled with the group throughout the regions of the country, and even beyond to Sudan to sing with well-known celebrities like Mohammed Wardi. When he was in Addis Ababa, he would perform in large venues such as Hager Fiker and Ras Teyater, but following a discussion with his father, he left Addis Ababa. In the early 1970s, at the break of the Ethiopian revolution, Ahmad Taqi was killed in eastern Ethiopia while fighting the government army. Ali Birra mourned deeply and sang metaphorically, > Yaa Hundee Bareeda > Yaa Finxee Midhaga Hundee was another name for Ahmad Taqi. Ali Birra continued his career both as a musician and a composer. He produced his first album in 1971, the first in the history of Oromo music. He then recorded successful hits such as \\"Hin Yaadin\\", \\"Asabalee\\", \\"Ammalelee\\", and \\"Gamachu\\". His albums included Sudanese songs such as \\"Al-Habib Ween\\" and Harari songs such as \\"Yidenqal\\". A Swedish admirer of Ali Birra, who had been a vice-secretary at the Swedish Embassy in Addis Ababa, asked him for marriage. Ali agreed and married her in 1985, her name was Birgitta √Östr√∂m (21 July 1942 - 13 September 2009). In 1986, Ali's wife was transferred to Saudi Arabia, and Ali accompanied her to the country. But Ali faced difficulties in Saudi Arabia, and proceeded to Sweden, where he lived for two years. In 1988, he went to the United States to attend the Los Angeles Arts Academy. He graduated in 1990, and by 1992, he had released his first two albums outside of Ethiopia amid increasing international fame. He also conducted many concerts and festivals in many countries, including the 2005 Enkutatash (Ethiopian New Year) celebration at the Addis Sheraton. , Ali Birra reported that he had recently been treated for colon cancer, but planned to continue performing music, in spite of reports that his most recent album would be his last. Awards In 1995, Ali received the Toronto African Merits Award. In 2010, Ali received an honorary doctorate from Jimma University.

Almost 900 species are currently recognised belonging to 9 subfamilies and 167 genera. They are active hunters, but generally dwell in protected environments such as under stones. The group is widely distributed from shallow intertidal waters to hadal trenches. They are the most diverse group of polychaetes in terms of genus number and second most diverse in terms of species number which is almost 8% of all segmented worm species. A scale worm moving along the substrate at a depth of 20m in the Lembeh Strait Description Most Polynoidae species are short and flattened, but can reach as much as 20 cm in length and 10 cm width in Eulagisca gigantea and Eulagisca uschakovi. Individuals are usually covered almost entirely by elytra, which can be shed and regenerated in many species. The elytra of some species are faintly bioluminescent, and leave glowing traces around the mouthparts of their predators, making those predators more likely to be attacked in turn. Deep sea The first deep-sea species of Polynoidae was collected at 1230m during the Challenger Expedition and several a number of subfamilies appear to be restricted to the deep sea below 500m. Species have colonised submarine caves and hydrothermal vents. Deep sea species are characterised by a partial or complete loss of antennae, fewer segments, a reduction in jaws and delicate elytra. Phylogenetic relationships The Polynoidae has recently been shown to be monophyletic, however relationships within the family are unclear and hence the number of valid subfamilies has been repeatedly revised in recent years. One of the main deep sea subfamilies, the Macellicephalinae has been consistently recovered as paraphyletic and Bonif√°cio & Menot found that ten Polynoid subfamilies could be synonymized with it to create a homogeneous clade characterised by a lack of lateral antennae. More recently, however, one of the synonymized subfamiles was reinstated.

It dealt with the application of US law by United States consular courts over foreign sailors on US-flagged ships in countries where the United States exercised extraterritorial jurisdiction. Background John M. Ross, a Canadian sailor on the American ship Bullion, was convicted in the US consular court in Yokohama of murder on the ship while it was in Yokohama before the US consul general at Kanagawa, Thomas van Buren. He was sentenced to death, but President Rutherford B. Hayes commuted the sentence to a life sentence of hard labor at Albany penitentiary. Although Ross accepted the commutation, he later sought a writ of habeas corpus for his release on the grounds that having been born on Prince Edward Island he was a British subject and so not subject to the jurisdiction of an American Consular Court. Decision The Supreme Court upheld the jurisdiction of the court on the basis that having enrolled on a United States ship he became subject to the jurisdiction of United States courts.

CPM-GOMS stands for two things: Cognitive Perceptual Motor and the project planning technique Critical Path Method (from which it borrows some elements). Overview CPM-GOMS was developed in 1988 by Bonnie John, a former student of Allen Newell. Unlike the other GOMS variations, CPM-GOMS does not assume that the user's interaction is a serial process, and hence can model multitasking behavior that can be exhibited by experienced users. The technique is also based directly on the model human processor - a simplified model of human responses. Evaluators begin a CPM-GOMS analysis in the same way they would a CMN-GOMS analysis. However, when the tasks are broken down just to the level where they are still perceptual or motor, the evaluator applies techniques from the model human processor. The tasks are first joined together serially and then examined to see which actions can be overlapped so that they happen in parallel. This technique facilitates representation of overlapping and very efficient \\"chunks\\" of activity characteristic of expert users. The estimated times by CPM-GOMS are generally faster since they do not allocate as much time to the \\"prepare for action\\" type operations. This is the most difficult GOMS technique to implement. Therefore, it has the problem of discrepancies between evaluators. Research is currently being conducted to improve the CPM-GOMS technique so that it can be used without the evaluator having a high level understanding of the GOMS theoretical foundations. Software Cogulator, an open source software package, can be used to build CPM-GOMS models  See also  * Human information processor model * KLM-GOMS * NGOMSL * CMN-GOMS References =Notations= *This article incorporates text from Dr. G.

It is part of the wider efforts of the European Union in support of Palestinian state building in the context of working towards a comprehensive peace based on a two-State solution. It is one of two civilian missions the EU runs in the Palestinian territory, the other being the European Union Border Assistance Mission Rafah (EU BAM Rafah). EUPOL COPPS has its headquarters in Ramallah, and its objective is to assist the Palestinian Authority in building the institutions of a future State of Palestine in the areas of policing and criminal justice under Palestinian ownership and in accordance with the best international standards. The support of the EU aims at increasing the safety and security of the Palestinian population and at serving the domestic agenda of the Palestinian Authority in reinforcing the rule of law. EUPOL COPPS acts also as a key channel for the efforts of the EU and the wider international community, in its area of responsibility, to improve the situation on the ground and obtain practical results. Establishment EUPOL COPPS was established following an EU Council decision in November 2005, and builds on the work of the EU Co-ordination Office for Palestinian Police Support (EU COPPS), which was established in January 2005 within the office of the EU Special Representative for the Middle East Peace Process, Ambassador Marc Otte. The initiative followed the expression by EU leaders in June 2004 of their readiness to support the Palestinian Authority in taking responsibility for law and order, and in particular, in improving its Palestinian Civil Police Force and law enforcement capacity. Organisational structure EUPOL COPPS is composed of 114 unarmed members of staff, 69 of whom are internationals and 45 locals. Most of the staff are secondees from EU member states. EUPOL COPPS has three operational pillars: a Police Advisory, a Rule of Law and a Programme and Evaluation Department. All sections are composed of experienced police officers, magistrates and experts from EU Member States and non EU contributing countries, such as Canada or Norway. Close cooperation between the sections takes place through various thematic groups. The current Head of Mission is M. Rodolphe Mauget, who succeeded, Kenneth Deane, Henrik Malmquist and Paul Robert Kernaghan. The first Head of Mission was Jonathan McIvor. The Head of Mission receives guidance from EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy through the EU Special Representative for the Middle East Peace Process.

It was one of the earliest structures built of stone in a national park. Memorial The lodge is a memorial to Edward Taylor Parsons, a New Yorker who joined the Sierra Club about 1900, and who eventually became the club's director from 1905 to 1914. Parsons was heavily involved in the losing fight against the flooding of the Hetch Hetchy Valley to provide a municipal water source for San Francisco. Parsons died in 1914, and in memorial the Sierra Club established a fund to build a club meeting house, library and headquarters in Yosemite. The site at Tuolumne Meadows was chosen for its accessibility to park backcountry and its location near Soda Springs, a location that the Sierra Club wished to safeguard. The lodge's design It is not clear who designed the Lodge. Mark White, brother-in-law and partner in Maybeck and White to architect Bernard Maybeck, was credited at the time of the lodge's completion. White was a Sierra Club member. Maybeck scholars Gray Brechln and Kenneth Cardwell have suggested that Maybeck was involved in the design, chiefly through similarities to Maybeck-designed buildings at Lake Tahoe. Maybeck is alleged to have done the conceptual design, which was developed by White and White's brother John, who would go in to design the LeConte Memorial Lodge. Description The Parsons Memorial Lodge is a one story stone building, accessible only from June through October in most years. The walls are rubble masonry with a concrete core, using local pink feldspar and gray granite, bedded with deeply raked mortar joints, and tapering from three feet at their base to two feet at the top. The door is arched with heavy stonework. The low-pitched roof is framed with peeled log rafters, about in diameter with interior and exterior log braces resting on low buttresses projecting from the walls on the east and west sides. The rafters are similar to the vigas found in American Southwestern architecture. Smaller peeled logs analogous to latias rest on top of the rafter logs, running perpendicular, topped by roofing paper and a galvanized metal top surface. The interior features a massive fireplace on the north wall opposite the entrance. There are two windows with benches below them in the east, west and south walls. Modifications to the lodge The lodge has been modified slightly. In 1935 a concrete floor was installed over what had apparently been a dirt surface. Wood surfaces were placed over the stone benches, and the windows and shutters were studded with nails to deter bears. The lodge is still in use today, though it is now managed by the National Park Service. It is representative of the Bay Area architectural influences adapted by Bernard Maybeck for the extreme weather variations on the high valley, and National Park Service Rustic.

It aired on November 19, 2007. Plot The Bennet family is preparing to go on the run, but Claire refuses. Noah intends to force her, but Sandra interrupts and postpones the departure until that night. Claire lays out a message for West (\\"SORRY\\"), who comes down from his flight to school to meet her. He accuses her of working with her father to spy on him and refuses to believe her protestations of innocence. Meanwhile, Mohinder and Bob discuss the plan to kidnap Claire; Bob admires Mohinder for his moral principles, but claims Suresh needs a partner who can \\"execute.\\" He introduces Mohinder to that partner ‚Äì his daughter Elle. Noah calls Mohinder, hoping to use Molly to track down West. Unable to simply wait for results, he leaves the house, only to be immediately swept into the air by West. West demands to know if Claire had betrayed him, but Noah assures him that she never even revealed his existence. His strength failing, West crash-lands. Bennet subdues him and insists he help convince Claire to leave town. Mohinder informs Bob of Noah's call, and wants to use it to get him out of the way without killing him. After Suresh threatens to blow the whistle on the entire operation, Bob accedes. Elle also gives Mohinder the gun he is depicted using in one of Isaac's paintings. Mohinder and Elle head to a stakeout point, and Suresh calls Bennet, giving him the false location. Bennet, already with West, realizes the ruse. Nevertheless, he arrives at the given location, where Mohinder jumps into his car and forces him to drive off at gunpoint. At the rendezvous point, Elle reveals herself, but West catches her by surprise and knocks her unconscious. Noah disarms Mohinder, but West discourages him from killing the doctor. Instead, they take Elle as a hostage. Bob tries to talk to Claire at school, but by addressing her as \\"Miss Bennet\\", tips her off. She runs home, but Bob follows, kidnaps her, and ties her up. Noah heads home when he sees Sandra. She is gagged with tape and her hands and feet are tied to a chair. She explains how Bob took Claire. Noah then ties Elle's hands to a chair and he ties her bare feet together and puts them in a doggie bath so as to make her shock herself if she tries to use her ability. Noah and West call Bob to arrange a hostage exchange. Before Bob takes Claire to the trade, he takes some of her regenerative blood. The swap goes smoothly at first. When the deal is made, West flies away with Claire, but the newly freed Elle shocks the couple and they fall to the ground, with Claire cushioning the fall. Bennett then shoots Elle in the arm, and is about to kill Bob, when Mohinder ultimately shoots Bennet in the eye as predicted by the painting. West flies Claire back home, where she breaks the news to her mother. Hiro goes back in time to save his father, who does not wish to be saved. Hiro takes them back in time to his mother's funeral, hoping to show his father the same grief he feels. While there, he encounters himself as a child. Little Hiro is determined to protect his father from the same fate of his mother, and present-day Hiro sees how childish he has been. He accepts his father's wishes and brings him back to the day of his death. However, before returning to the present, Hiro time-freezes the murder in order to learn the identity of his father's killer ‚Äì Takezo Kensei. Matt starts manifesting the ability to implant suggestions in others' minds. He initially tests this ability on Molly, and then uses it on his boss to get extra time to investigate Kaito Nakamura's murder. Again he confronts Angela Petrelli, and with his stronger powers, demands the identity of Kaito Nakamura's real killer and the last woman in the Company portrait. Angela tells Matt about Adam Monroe but pleads that the unidentified woman just wants to be left alone. She warns Matt that, if he takes this secret from her, he will not just be like his father, he would be his father. The penultimate scene shows he has the woman's name: Victoria Pratt. During the final scene, in a Company holding cell, Bennet is given a transfusion of Claire's blood, reviving him and healing his eye.

He is best remembered for his collaborations with the composer Francesco Cavalli. Life and career Faustini was born in Venice. Impresario at the Teatro San Cassiano, Teatro San Mois√® and Teatro Sant 'Apollinare, his 14 libretti were mostly set by Cavalli, with a few being used by other composers. The libretti Faustini left incomplete at his death were later finished by his brother Marco Faustini, who continued his brother's career as impresario at multiple theatres. Three of his librettos are based on mythological themes, but these are exceptions rather than the rule. A typical Faustini plot relies not on myth or classical history but upon his own imagination. He based his creative thinking upon a fundamental pattern of two pair of aristocratic lovers from exotic nations, who undergo a lengthy process of separation and reconciliation, assisted by a good number of clownish servants who provide comic relief. Many devices from Roman comedy and the pastoral genre also appear, such as sleeping potions and letters delivered to the wrong person. Faustini was heavily committed to his career as a professional librettist, and his work with Cavalli was of vital importance in the development of Venetian opera.

He intended it to be used by the newly hired park rangers who were taking over from the departing army troops. He specifically intended it to blend into the natural environment. Its use of rustic stylings was part of a trend to the use of rustic design and natural materials in Park Service buildings until the 1940s. Concept The Rangers' Club was designed by San Francisco architect Charles K. Sumner. Construction was completed in August 1924, at a cost to Mather of $39,380. The Rangers' Club was intended to foster a sense of esprit de corps among the newly-created ranger service. Mather hoped that the example at Yosemite would encourage Congress to appropriate money to build similar facilities at other national parks, a vain hope. The Rangers' Club was the first significant structure on the north side of the Yosemite Valley, part of a Mather strategy to relocate park services. Description The Rangers' Club is a U-shaped wood frame structure, 2-1/2 stories high, centering on a massive stone chimney in the center of the U. The interior is clad in redwood shingles, with board-and- batten siding on the gable ends. The building rests on a granite rubblestone foundation. Peeled log pilasters emphasize the corners of the frame building, originally extending through the roof. The gable ends feature balconies at the second floor, with jigsaw-pattern railings. The wood shingle roof is steeply pitched with shed roof dormers in the main section and steeply pitched gable dormers on the outer side of the flanking wings. The interior arrangement has not been substantially altered. The first floor features a living room and dining room connected by a hallway, which itself features nooks furnished with bookshelf-partitions on its north and south sides, featuring decorative fir tree designs. Columns and beams are dressed and trimmed, with rough-hewn ceiling joists supporting diagonal ceiling sheathing. Downstairs interior spaces are finished in plaster with dark wood wainscoting. The building's original furnishings remain in the living and dining rooms. Upstairs a central hall runs to the ends of the wings, flanked by individual and dormitory rooms. The building's kitchen and bathrooms have been updated, and the partial basement contains mechanical equipment. An adjoining L-shaped garage-woodshed and a transformer house are similarly designed, and complement the main building. The Rangers' Club was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. The building was altered in 2008 to install new earthquake-resistant foundations and other seismic strengthening measures.

A fluent Maori speaker and a lawyer, he is noted for his efforts with the Repudiation Movement in the 1870s to solve land issues on behalf of Hawkes Bay Maori chiefs who claimed large European land holders, such as McLean, had acquired land improperly. The Repudiation Movement failed but Sheehan gained a positive reputation with Maori leaders. In 1877 he became Native Minister in the Grey Government. He tried to negotiate land deals in Taranaki with iwi leaders and, in respect of the King Country, with King Tawhaio, but failed. However, during these meetings he discovered that Rewi Maniapoto wanted to sell land and negotiated land sales to Europeans in the King Country that the government hoped would speed up assimilation. Sheehan negotiated unsuccessfully with Te Whiti whose base of Parihaka was destroyed by the Armed Constabulary in November 1881 after Sheehan had ceased to hold ministerial office (in 1879). Sheehan was also active in promoting secular education and widening the franchise but he wanted only one system of Parliamentary representation, the abolition of separate Maori seats and the end of plural voting. He was one of the first ministers to advocate breaking up of the large runholder monopolies which he believed had created a social elite at the expense of the normal citizen. =Death= Sheehan died of pneumonia and cirrhosis of the liver in Napier on 13 June 1885 aged 40 years. In 1890, his widow, Lucy Caroline Sheehan, married Herbert Samuel Wardell, previously a resident magistrate of Wellington. She was given away by John Nathaniel Wilson.

He served two terms as a Senator for Victoria, representing the United Australia Party (UAP) from 1940 to 1944 and the Liberal Party from 1950 to 1956. Spicer was Attorney-General in the Menzies Government from 1949 to 1956. He left politics to become chief judge of the newly created Commonwealth Industrial Court, a position which he held until 1976. Early life Spicer was born in the Melbourne suburb of Prahran, but was taken to England by his family in 1905 and educated at Chelston School, Torquay. His family returned to Australia in 1911 and he attended Hawksburn State School in the inner Melbourne suburb of South Yarra. In 1913, he started working as an office boy in a legal practice. He studied law at the University of Melbourne from 1916 to 1918, and was admitted as a barrister and solicitor in March 1921, later establishing a successful legal practice. He married Lavinia May Webster in June 1924. Political career Spicer early in his political career Spicer won a seat in the Senate as a United Australia Party candidate at the 1940 election. In the Senate, he spoke frequently on tax issues and promoted \\"sound and honest finance\\". Spicer was defeated at the 1943 election. He strongly opposed Ben Chifley's bank nationalisation and acted for the English banks in court action on the issue. He took silk in 1948. Spicer returned to the Senate as a Liberal Party candidate in the December 1949 election, and was immediately appointed Attorney-General in the Menzies Government, even though his Senate term did not begin until February 1950. He was the first senator to hold the position since Josiah Symon in 1905. Spicer's first priority was to draft a bill banning the Communist Party of Australia. The Bill was eventually passed by the Parliament and became the Communist Party Dissolution Act 1950, but was later declared unconstitutional by the High Court of Australia. In 1952, he drafted an official secrets bill which included a provision permitting the death penalty for spying and wide powers of search and arrest without warrant, but this was rejected by cabinet. He was also Minister for Transport for two weeks after George McLeay's death. Judicial career In August 1956, Spicer resigned from parliament so that he could be appointed to the Commonwealth Industrial Court. He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1963. Spicer presided over inquiries into aviation accidents: *Trans Australia Airlines Flight 538, a Fokker F27 Friendship aircraft that crashed into the sea in 1960 while attempting to land in Mackay, Queensland, killing all 29 people on board. *Ansett-ANA Flight 325, a Vickers Viscount aircraft that crashed into Botany Bay in 1961, killing all 15 people on board. *Ansett-ANA Flight 149, a Vickers Viscount aircraft that crashed near Winton, Queensland in 1966, killing all 24 people on board. Spicer also chaired a royal commission in 1964 into the sinking of HMAS Voyager. He found that officers in both Voyager and HMAS Melbourne had been at fault. A second royal commission in 1967-68 attributed blame to Voyager's officers only. Spicer retired in 1976, and died in the Melbourne suburb of Armadale two years later, survived by his wife and son.

The tributaries of the Sence, including the Saint and Tweed, fan out over much of western Leicestershire from Charnwood Forest and Coalville in the north-east to Hinckley and almost to Watling Street in the south and south-west. Its watershed almost coincides with Hinckley and Bosworth Borough of Leicestershire, which was formed in 1974 by amalgamation of Market Bosworth Rural District and Hinckley Urban District. It flows into the Anker, which in turn flows into the River Tame. It is part of the wider River Trent catchment, which covers much of central England. In 1881, Sebastian Evans wrote that the usual names for this river were Shenton Brook and Sibson Brook.Evans, Arthur Benoni (1881) Leicestershire Words, Phrases, and Proverbs; edited, with additions by Sebastian Evans. London: Tr√ºbner & Co.; p. 47 Confusions of the name Sence It is also used of the Saint and its tributary from Stapleton.Ordnance Survey (1887)Peter Foss (1998) Antiquarian accounts of the Battle of BosworthWilliam Hutton (1788), The Battle of Bosworth FieldJohn Pridden (1789), in John Nichols (1811), History and antiquities of Leicestershire label the brook upstream of Shenton \\"Tweed\\". Recent Ordnance Maps 1:25 000 (2000) label only the \\"Tweed River\\" south-west of Stapleton and the 1:50 000 (1990) map gives it no name. The lower reaches from Shenton to Ratcliffe Culey are known locally as the Saint, as used below. River Sence in the strict sense The Sence rises on Bardon Hill (GR SK461132; alt. 278 m), crosses the A50 (GR SK453122) and gathers a group of three headwaters around Bardon (GR SK457123) and Stanton under Bardon. It flows westwards with a tributary stream from Coalville, past Hugglescote (GR SK424123) and Donington le Heath. It then turns south-west, receiving Blower's Brook and another tributary from Ravenstone, continuing between Heather and Ibstock, between Newton Burgoland and Odstone, through Shackerstone, between Bilstone and Congerstone, and between Sheepy Magna and Sheepy Parva. It joins the Anker on the boundary with Warwickshire between Sheepy, Ratcliffe Culey and Atherstone at the Mythe, an ancient chaplry of Sheepy (GR SK315991). From Bardon village over a distance of about 20 km, it falls by about 100 m, a gradient of 1:200. Tributaries =Carlton Brook= Carlton Brook is fed by a group of streams around Bagworth and Nailstone. It runs between Carlton and Market Bosworth, and joins the Sence south of Congerstone. =Tweed‚ÄìSaint Brooks= The largest tributary of the Sence is the Saint, with a headwater called the Tweed rising near Barwell (GR SP435961; alt. 125 m) and on Barwell Lane (GR 438957; alt. 115 m). A branch from Hinckley (GR SP429951; alt. ca 125 m) joins the Tweed south-west of Stapleton, south of Harper's Hill. The Tweed runs west almost to Dadlington, whence it is canalized north-west to the confluence with Stapleton Brook. It then runs west along the foot of Ambion Hill. It gains a stream from between Higham on the Hill and Wykin running north and another from Lindley running north-east and turns north to Shenton, where it joins a smaller stream running west from Cadeby (GR SK429020; alt. 128 m) to become the Saint flowing westwards. A large stream from the north rises west of Market Bosworth and north-west of Hoo Hills, Wellsborough, passing the Bosworth hamlet of Far Coton to join the Saint on Upton Ridge. Thence the Saint continues west to Sibson and meanders to the Sence between Sheepy and Ratcliffe Culey (GR SK326999). In general, its course from Barwell to Ratcliffe covers about 13 km, in which it falls about 50 m, a gradient of about 1:650, resulting in a slower flow than of the Sence, and a muddy, marshy and more meandering channel than the Sence. Only across the Upton‚ÄìLinley north‚Äìsouth ridge between Shenton and Sibson is its flow faster. Watershed of the Sence and Saint To the north-west, the watershed of the Sence adjoins that of Bramcote Brook and Frog Moor Stream, both running south-west into the Anker, and the Gillwiskaw, a stream running into the River Mease north of Gopsall. The boundary runs north-west from Orton on the Hill, through Norton juxta Twycross and Newton Burgoland, between Normanton le Heath and Heather, through Alton to Swannington. To the north-east along Charnwood Forest, headwaters adjoin Grace Dieu Brook and Black Brook running north-east towards the Soar. To the east and south-east, the Sence adjoins various brooks running into the Soar running south and south-east: Slate Brook, Rothley Brook and Thurlaston Brook. The boundary runs south-west from Stanton under Bardon to Bagworth, where it turns south. The watershed of the Saint‚ÄìTweed runs through Cadeby, Stapleton and Barwell to Hinckley. To the south, the boundary runs through Higham on the Hill and Lindley, where it turns north-west over Upton Ridge through Upton to Ratcliffe Culey. South of Hinckley, it adjoins Soar Brook, and two small tributaries of the Anker, Sketchley Brook and Harrow Brook. The area west of Upton Ridge between Fenny Drayton, Atterton and Witherley is reclaimed marsh draining into the Anker north of Witherley. =Geomorphology of the Sence Watershed= The watershed is formed primarily by the upthrust of Ordovician (Precambrian) rocks north-east of the Ticknall‚ÄìThringstone Fault with Carboniferous measures to the south-west of the fault, including coal, clay and sandstone, which have been exploited in the 19th and 20th centuries as the Leicestershire and South Derbyshire Coalfield. Over much of the watershed, the Ordovician outcrop of Bardon Hill is prominent. Most of the Carboniferous measures of western Leicestershire are covered with red mudstones of the Triassic Mercia Mudstone Group. The outcrop of these rocks gives rise to a moderately undulating landscape characterised by mixed pasture and arable agricultural use that has developed on the neutral clay soils. The most prominent hills in the landscape are at Market Bosworth and Wellsborough. The higher land towards the north-east formed a plateau, in which the tributaries of the Sence have cut narrow valleys. The Saint‚ÄìTweed valley contained a major branch of the ‚ÄòProto-Soar‚Äô until the Pleistocene glaciation when the valley was blocked by sands and gravels around Cadeby and Stoke Golding.Douglas (1975) The lower parts of the Sence Valley and most of the Tweed‚ÄìSaint Valley were filled with clays from Lake Harrison, which filled much of Leicestershire and Warwickshire towards the end of the Ice Age, when drainage was blocked by ice from Wales and the north. Water from south-west Leicestershire would have escaped from Congerstone, along the line of the Ashby de la Zouch Canal, then along the line of the Anker south-east past Nuneaton to the Fenny Compton Gap towards the Thames. From the Anker, it also escaped southwards through Nuneaton towards Coventry and the Avon. At a later stage, a smaller lake east of Upton remained with overflows southwards and through Fenny Drayton to the Anker as well as that towards the Sence, until it cut through Upton Ridge to form the Saint. Upton Ridge and Wellsborough Hill give good views of the flood plain of the lower reaches. The middle reaches of both rivers are less visible in the landscape. The coalfields were exploited from mines at Coalville, Snibston, Hugglescote, Ibstock, Nailstone, Bagworth and Ellistown. Brickworks and terracotta works were mainly around Ibstock and Heather.Mee (1937), p. 7 Names related to the watercourses Ambion is the name of a deserted village by a headwater of the Saint rising in Cadeby. It is recorded as Anabein (ca 1270), Anne Beame in the Hollinshead Chronicle (1576), Anbein (1622) and Amyon by John Hutton (1788).Foss (1998), p.17, 21 The name seems to derive from Old English ƒÄna-bƒìam, a One-Beam bridge,Ekwall (1960), p.9, 32 probably the hamlet's means of crossing the stream towards Market Bosworth. It is claimed as the traditional site of the Battle of Bosworth. Barwell, Barwalle (1043), Barewelle (1086), sometimes pronounced ‚ÄòBarrull‚Äô. The first element is Old English bƒÅr, ‚Äòboar‚Äô. Old English wella signifies a spring or streamEkwall, p.29 In west Leicestershire, it seems to mean the stream issuing from a spring rather than the spring itself. The area of the headwaters of the Tweed would have been frequented by wild boar in Anglo-Saxon times. The other example of wella in the watershed is \\"Twitchell\\". Brook Farm, west of Stoke Golding takes its name from the unnamed stream running north towards the Tweed at the foot of Ambion Hill. King Dick's Hole is a deep part of the Anker at its confluence with the Sence. Since at least Victorian times, it has been a popular bathing place for the youth of Atherstone and Sheepy. Local tradition has it that it is where King Richard bathed before the battle.Austin (2004), p.37 More likely ‚Äòhole‚Äô is a corruption of early English halgh; an area of flood plain enclosed by a meandering river.Ekwall (1960), p.212 The name could originally have referred to the area where Richard stationed some of his troops while lodging the night at Mythe Hall.Michael K. Jones (2002) Lovett or Lovett's Bridge, sometimes ‚ÄòLovatt‚Äô links Sheepy Parva across the Sence towards Orton on the Hill and Polesworth. Though there is now a footbridge, the ford there is at least 1000 years old.Gillian Adams et al. [2000], p.19 No association with a person so called has been found. Its relation to a branch of Redway towards Polesworth and to an ancient crossing of the Saint through Ratcliffe Culey suggests at least Iron Age origin. Nearby on that branch, Watery Lane, was an undatable Swithland slate courseway raised above flood level demolished by the Highways Authority around 1950. The River Ouzel in Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire used to be called ‚ÄòLovat‚Äô and in Sussex is the River Lavant, both explained from Celtic British, perhaps here meaning either ‚Äòsmooth-flowing‚Äô.or ‚Äòdeep pool‚Äô.Ekwall (1960), p.290 Mythe derives from Old English gemy√æe, ‚Äòplace where waters meet, confluence‚Äô, here the confluence of the Sence with the Anker. The name exists also for a settlement where the Avon joins the Severn north of Tewkesbury.Ekwall (1960), p.335Ordnance Survey (1973), p.20‚Äì21 Ratcliffe, Redeclive (1086), ‚Äòroad- cleave‚Äô. Ratcliffe Culey takes its name from the ford where the Hinckley‚ÄìMythe road was ‚Äòcleaved‚Äô by the Sence 100 m upstream of its confluence with the Anker. Sandeford is mentioned as the place where Richard III was killed in the Battle of Bosworth but its situation is lost. It might be where Fenn Lane crosses the Tweed (GR 407989) or a tributary from Higham on the Hill (GR 391984)Peter Foss 1998, p.50 or on the Redway where a stream ran into the marsh north of Fenny Drayton (GR 352979)Michael K. Jones (2002).John D. Austin (2004), p.44‚Äì44 Both sites are rather marshy, so that a site on the River Saint at Miles Ford north-west of Shenton (GR 377010) is more probable. 'Sence and Saint probably share their origin with the British tribe Iceni in a word- root isc-, 'shine', iscent-, ‚Äòshining‚Äô. In common with other rivers of the Midlands, a Celtic origin is more likely than Old English scenc, 'cup, drinking can.Ekwall, 1960, p.412 Either by coincidence or by association with the river name, All Saints is the dedication of the churches at Sheepy, Ratcliffe Culey and Nailstone in the Sence watershed. It is also the dedication of Ranton, Staffordshire, whose Priory owned Sheepy Manor until the Reformation. Sheepy probably also derives its name from Celtic isc- with apa, ‚Äòshining water‚Äô rather than from Old English. sceap-ea, 'sheep river', or sceap-e.g., 'sheep island'.Ekwall (1960), p.416 Shenton, \\"Scenctun\\" (1002), Scentone (1086) derives its name from the river: scenc-t≈´n, ‚Äòsettlement on the Saint‚Äô.Ekwall (1960), p.416 Tweed derives from Celtic tueda, ‚Äòpowerful, swollen‚Äô and tuea, ‚Äòswell‚Äô.Ekwall (1960), p.483 like the River Tweed in southern Scotland. It may describe the growth of the stream from Barwell to Shenton or the swelling marsh in rainy times.. Twitchell is a small stream running into the Sence at Sheepy Magna and the lane it adjoins. The origin of the name might be Twice-wella, a stream rising from two springs. Water mills The river was exploited for water power and fishing in the 19th and 20th centuries, when there were at least eight water-driven corn mills on the Sence, which has an average gradient of about 1:200: Hugglescote Corn Mill; Ravenstone Mill; Ibstock Corn Mill; Help-Out Mill, Shackerstone; Congerstone Corn Mill; Temple Corn Mill; Sibson Corn Mill; Sheepy Corn Mill. Perhaps in earlier times, there was a mill at the moated site at Old Hall Farm and Brook Farm, Bardon. Early in the 19th century, the formerly moated site of Mythe Hall had a mill fed by water from the Sence and discharging into the Anker. The tributary from Bagworth to Shackerstone may have had mills at the moated sites of Pickering Grange and Ibstock Grange. On Carlton Brook between Carlton and Market Bosworth was Bosworth Mill. Help-Out Mill fell out of use in the late 1960s. When Elijah T. Timms died in 1970, it ended a family association with the mill dating back to 1734. The name is believed to derive from the reliable water supply compared with mills on the branch streams. The overcast waterwheel was replaced by a water turbine in 1902.http://www.lihs.org.uk/past_visits_Help_Out_Mill.html Temple Mill was first mentioned in 1279 and continued operating till after World War II.Adams et al. [2000], p. 48 Sibson Mill is remarkable in being on the Sence, not its own Saint river, some distance from Sibson village. Sheepy Mill is mentioned in the Domesday Book and was exploited by Ranton Priory until the Reformation. It was enlarged in the 19th Century by Charles Bonington Lowe and switched to steam power. After World War II, the mill installed a water turbine but switched to electrical power. It closed around 1970. For the first half of the 20th century under the name C. B. Lowe Ltd, it was a major employer in the village and a supplier of flour for a wide district. Its Sentinel steam lorries drew water from the river. The Saint, with its low gradient is unsuitable for water power and probably never had many mills. The names Mill View near the Tweed in Barwell and Mill Lane south of ShentonOrdnance Survey 1887 suggest that water mills existed there in earlier times. The Domesday Survey lists only three mills in the Sence watershed: at Alton, Congerstone and Sheepy.Williams & Martin (1992), pp. 636‚Äì637 The mill at Alton near Ravenstone was probably wind-driven. Lakes On the Sence are two small lakes between Heather and Ibstock, used for fishing in an area of former clay workings. Sheepy Lake was formerly fed from the river and supplied the mill in times of drought. It too is used for fishing and is now fed from ground water. Stapleton Brook has a lake east of Sutton Lane in Bosworth Park. Fishing and wild life The River Sence is fished for roach, chub, dace, perch, trout, bream tench and carp and was restocked with grayling in 2007.http://www.anglersnet.co.uk In the 12th Century, Richard de Harcourt of Great Sheepy (Leics.) gave Ranton Priory in Staffordshire 9 virgates of land with fishing rights and 2s. rent from his mill there. This property was the priory's most important temporal estate outside Staffordshire and remained so until the dissolution of the priory in 1537.Victoria History of Leicestershire Ranton Priory probably enlarged the mill and dug out the reservoir called Sheepy Lake. Legend has it that Richard III granted the freemen of Sheepy fishing rights in the Sence in thanks for their hospitality on the eve of the eve of the Battle of Bosworth Field.Austin (2004), p.34‚Äì35 In practice, those rights remained with the owners of the Manor of Sheepy, though they sometimes turned a blind eye to villagers who exploited their claim. According to that legend, Richard stayed at Mythe Hall. In recent years, Leicestershire County Council took over clay workings and coal pits in the Sence Valley between Ravenstone, Ibstock and Heather and later transferred them to the Forestry Commission, which reclaimed the area as the Sence Valley Forest Park. It contains woodland, lakes linked to the River Sence, grassland and a wild flower meadow. An artificial nesting wall for sand martins has also been constructed alongside Horseshoe Lake. In this varied habitat, 150 species of bird have been recorded. The lakes provide habitat for heron, coot, tufted duck, pochard, wigeon and great-crested grebe. Kestrels nest each year and, though less evident in daytime, there are barn owls and short-eared owls. Raptors, marsh, hen and Montague's harrier, osprey, red-footed falcon, merlin, peregrine and buzzard have all been seen. The bird list for the park currently stands at 101 species. Long grassy areas have become home for many wild mammals including field vole, shrew, stoat, rabbit and fox. Water voles are present on streams feeding the river. Otters too are once again using the river. Among the species of bats are pipistrelle, Daubenton's bat and noctule. Insects in summer include gatekeeper butterfly, meadow brown, speckled wood, small skipper, green-veined white, peacock butterfly and small tortoiseshell. Around the lakes, damselflies such as common blue, blue-tailed and azure as well as dragonflies such as the southern hawker and brown hawker are also fairly abundant. In the middle reaches of the Sence around Shackerstone, Bilstone and Congerstone, fishing rights belong to Gopsall, now falling under Crown Estate, which is working in cooperation with the Environment Agency and Gopsall Fishing Club to reverse bank erosion caused by cattle poaching, land drainage, dredging and tunnelling of the river and to divert otters away from the A444.http://www.derby.ac.uk/news/conservation-accolade-for-derby- studenthttp://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/newscontent/92_gopsall_fishing_club.htm Influence on communications At least five undatable through routes, probably Iron Age, and one Roman road cross the Sence watershed. Three modern trunk roads, largely following 18th century turnpikes, cross the area, two from north to south: the A444 Burton on Trent‚ÄìNuneaton and the A447 Ravenstone‚ÄìHinckley‚ÄìNuneaton. The A50 Burton on Trent‚ÄìAshby de la Zouch‚ÄìLeicester road runs south-east across the headwaters. The prehistoric roads almost avoided river crossings. No motorways pass through the watershed, though the M1 adjoins a headwater east of Bardon. The one canal and a former through-line of railway exploited glacial overflow channels linking the valleys of the Sence and Tweed‚ÄìSaint. =Redway: Derby‚ÄìCoventry‚ÄìEdgehill= The Redway, in southern Warwickshire called Radway, crosses Roman roads in a way that suggests it is earlier. It aligns with a road from Ripon, Yorkshire, to Little Chester at the River Derwent crossing to Derby, always running due south. From Derby, it crosses western Leicestershire towards Coventry and ends at Edge Hill, Warwickshire. It entered the Sence watershed between Swepstone and Newton Burgoland. South of Bilstone near Temple Mill, it crossed the Sence, probably by a bridge since prehistoric times. Just south of Sibson, it crossed the Saint by a muddy ford towards Atterton, whence it crossed the eastern edge of the marsh of Fenny Drayton, leaving the county at Redgate, Fenny Drayton, also meaning ‚ÄòRoad-Way‚Äô. The section from the Sence to Redgate has been replaced by the A444, mostly 100‚Äì200 m further east. From the west side of the river at Temple, a branch followed the west bank of the river, skirting north of Sheepy Magna and running as Green Lane south of Orton on the Hill through the deserted village of Bell Weston towards Polesworth. =Hinckley‚ÄìUpton‚ÄìThe Mythe= The second route, either Iron Age or Danish, entered the watershed as a now metalled road at Wykin and running between Higham on the Hill and Stoke Golding, crossing Fenn Lane near Fenn Lane Farm and Upton Park, whence most of its route to Ratcliffe Culey is preserved as a green lane. From Ratcliffe, it crossed the Sence 100 metres upstream of its confluence with the Anker as a cobble-bottomed ford to Mythe Hall. Most of its course is close to the watershed boundary with the middle reaches of the Anker. Munitions from the time of the Battle of Bosworth Field have been found near the intersection with Fenn Lane. According to a recent theory,Michael K. Jones (2002) King Richard passed that point on his way towards Ratcliffe and the Mythe on the eve of the battleAustin (2004) and Henry could well have established his lines near the intersections of the Hinckley road, the Redway and Fenn Lane, if he approached the battlefield along the Redway.John Nichols (1818)Austin (2004), pp. 21‚Äì22 =Salt Street: No Man‚Äôs Heath‚ÄìBarwell= The third route, Salt Street, entered the watershed from the north-west near Norton-juxta-Twycross, passed through Twycross and crossed the Sence by Temple Mill. Thence it crossed Wellsborough Hill to Far Coton, skirting the larger tributaries of the River Saint and Tweed, probably to Barwell.Foss (1998), Chap. 4, fn. 48 A branch towards Leicester ran through Measham, possibly through Heather, Ibstock and Bagworth.Simon Marchini: www.btinternet.com/~simonmarchini/History/glossery.htm#Swepstone Way =Swepstone Way: Ravenstone‚ÄìPolesworth= A prehistoric route follows the north-west boundary of the Sence watershed from Ravenstone, between Normanton le Heath and Heather, through Newton Nethercote, Norton juxta Twycross, Orton on the Hill, Little Warton to an ancient crossing of the Anker at Polesworth.Simon Marchini: www.btinternet.com/~simonmarchini/History/glossery.htm#Swepstone Way Its importance in Anglian‚ÄìDanish times is indicated by the name of the route east of Norton: Shelford Lane, ‚ÄòShallow Ford‚Äô Lane.Ekwall (1960), p. 415 =Packington‚ÄìBagworth‚ÄìHinckley road= A road that dates at least from Anglian times runs south from Packington, through Ravenstone to Bagworth. It crossed Blower's Brook south of Alton, Ravenstone Brook in Ravenstone, a stream from Coalville at Snibston and Sence Brook near the Manor House, Donington le Heath. Though it crosses hilly terrain, the rivers are crossed as small streams. The continuing communication along this line into Christian times is suggested by the shared unusual dedication of their churches to the Holy Rood. From Bagworth, it runs close to the watershed. perhaps through Cadeby or slightly further east through Newbold Verdon, to Barwell and Hinckley. A road from Bagworth to Polesworth along the line of Bagworth Brook to Shackerstone, continuing through Congerstone towards Polesworth seems also to be an Anglian or Iron Age route. =A Roman road, Fenn Lane: Leicester‚ÄìMancetter= The Roman road from Leicester to Manduessedum, now Mancetter and Witherley, entered the watershed of the Saint south-east of Sutton Cheney, where it crosses Salt Street. Between Upton Park and Fenn Lane Farm, it crosses the Hinckley‚ÄìMythe road and near Fenny Drayton church it formerly crossed the Redway. It is not aligned on Mancetter but joins the Watling Street 1 km further east because of the then impassable marshes between Fenny Drayton and Witherley. The section where it crossed the poorly drained part of the Saint‚ÄìTweed river system between Sutton Cheney, Shenton, Dadlington and Stapleton has been lost and was probably an unstable courseway when constructed. Richard III followed this route from Leicester on the eve of the Battle of Bosworth Field. It is a matter of debate where he stopped for the night. The Ordnance Map of 1887 labels his camp at Barn Farm (OS 429980) near Barwell. Recent sources suggest that he continued further, perhaps to the Mythe, expecting to face Henry across the River Anker.Austin (2004), pp. 36, 50 =Ashby de la Zouch Canal= The Ashby Canal was opened in 1804. It linked the South Derbyshire and Leicestershire Coalfield at Moira and Measham with the Coventry Canal south of Nuneaton. It was the longest contour canal in England, exploiting the Glacial channels between the Warwickshire Avon, the Anker, the Saint, the Sence and the Mease. The canal crosses the Sence by an aqueduct near Shackerstone Station. Northern parts of the canal in the Mease watershed beyond Snarestone were closed during the 20th Century because of mining subsidence. =Railways= The Battlefield Line Railway from Cadeby to Shackerstone is a conserved part of the railway from Nuneaton to Measham and Moira, which opened in 1873. It was built along the same line as the Ashby Canal. At Shackerstone station, there was a junction with a line up the Sence Valley towards Coalville. In 1883, the Charnwood Forest Railway was opened, which extended that branch from Coalville to Loughborough. The Burton on Trent‚ÄìAshby de la Zouch‚ÄìLeicester line enters the watershed of the Sence between Coalville and Bardon. It opened in 1845 and is now used only by goods traffic. In contrast to the Nuneaton‚ÄìMeasham line, it cannot follow the contours. The two lines provided better access to the Leicestershire coalfield.

It circulated in manuscript in fifteenth-century England, and was among the works printed by William Caxton. One manuscript forms part of the Egerton Collection in the British Library. The English translator Nothing in the English work gives any indication of who the translator may have been, except for one rather cryptic indication in the verba translatoris (translator's note) at the end of two manuscript copies (Egerton and Spencer, below): > And I the symple and vnsuffisaunt translatoure of this lytel book pr[ay] and > beseke as lowely as I kan to the reder or herer of this processe to for geue > it me √æat I haue not translated worde for word as in was in the Frensche, > somewhat be cause of ille writyng of myn exampler,somewhat be cause of hard > Frensch  specially sith I am but litel expert in √æat langage  somewhat > also be cause of somme thinges √æat were diffuse and in som place ouerderk. > Wherfore, I haue in dyuers places added and with drawe litel as what me > semed needful, no thing chaunging the progresse ne substaunce of the mater, > but as it myght be most lusti to the reder or herer of the matier.

In addition to the lack of internal evidence in the Soul, there is no external evidence from any source to indicate the identity if the translator. Nevertheless, two English poets have been put forward as possible translators of the French work, but neither of them convincingly. These are John Lydgate (c.1370-1449) and Thomas Hoccleve (c.1368-1426), both of whom can be considered disciples of Chaucer. In the Verba Translatoris at the end of the Spencer manuscript, the translator addresses the \\"ful worshipeful and gracious ladishipe\\" who \\"commaunded [him] to take this occupacioun\\". If the translator was Hoccleve, this literary patron could well have been Joan FitzAlan. Manuscripts of The Pilgrimage of the Soul The Middle English Pilgrimage of the Soul exists complete or in part in at least ten fifteenth-century manuscripts and one printed edition. London, The British Library, Egerton MS 615. Fols. 1r-106r contain The Pilgrimage of the Soul, including a table of contents on 1r-3v and the translator's epilogue on 106r. The hand of Egerton MS 615 and the style of its border decorations suggest a date somewhat later than Spencer 19. Probably from the same workshop. The language, according to the Linguistic Atlas of Late Mediaeval English (LALME) shows characteristics associated with the border area between Norfolk and Ely, and occasional forms associated with Rutland. Produced at the end of the second quarter of the fifteenth century.5 London, British Library, Add MS 34193. Fols. 4r-97v contain The Pilgrimage of the Soul, without the translator's epilogue or a scribal colophon. BL Add. 34193 is an anthology of English and Latin texts with historical, moral, satirical, and devotional topics. It also contains several charters, the Rule of Celestine, and a treatise on the Westminster Synod of 1125, which suggests that the compilation was made by an ecclesiastical community. The language, according to LALME, shows characteristics of East Leicestershire. Oxford, Corpus Christi College, MS 237. Omits words of the translator. This copy of Soul is the youngest and least elaborate of all. The manuscript is an anthology of texts that are mostly of a religious nature. Amongst other texts, it contains two Saints‚Äô Lives and Lydgate's Dance Macabre. Its language shows a mixture of dialectal forms, which may be the result of repeated copying. The scribe of Soul gives his initials as ‚ÄòEC‚Äô on fol 137r, and is probably the Edmund Carpenter whose ownership of the manuscript is indicated in a fifteenth- century hand as the first inscription on the front pastedown: ‚Äòiste liber constat Edmondus Carpenter.‚Äô Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 770 (2552). Folios 1r-99v contain a copy of Soul without the translator's epilogue or scribal colophon. This manuscript's inconsistencies and idiosyncratic features indicate that it is a provincial product of the middle of the fifteenth century. According to LALME, the language of the manuscript shows the characteristics of the border area of Norfolk and Ely. Sir James Ley (1550‚Äì1629), the first Earl of Marlborough, donated this manuscript to the Bodleian Library in 1612. Oxford, University College, MS 181. This manuscript consists of 155 leaves. Fols. 1r-153v contain a copy of Soul without the translator's epilogue or a scribal colophon. The language shows characteristics associated by LALME with Northamptonshire. The craftsmanship of the manuscript indicates that it is the work of professional artists working in the middle of the fifteenth century. A partially erased inscription shows that the book was given to Henry Percy, prior of the Augustinian priory of St. Paul in Newham, Bedfordshire by his predecessor John Renhall in 1491. Cambridge, Gonville and Caius College, MS 124/61. This manuscript consists of 130 vellum leaves. Omits 2 quires at the beginning, the words of the translator, and a scribal colophon. This is one of the earliest known copies of Soul. LALME associates the characteristics of its language with Norfolk, with some features of Ely and Lincolnshire. The manuscript shows a fairly high degree of standardisation and is the work of two professional scribes. It may therefore have been produced at a metropolitan bookshop or by a network of artists. Cambridge University Library, MS Kk.1.7. This manuscript originally consisted of 136 leaves, of which 124 are left. fols. 1v- 124v contain Soul, without the translator's epilogue or scribal colophon. Its language contains forms associated by LALME with the border between Norfolk and Suffolk, with the occasional use of forms associated with the area between Leicestershire and Lincolnshire. The manuscript contains additions with a doctrinal content that suggests that Kk 1.7 or its exemplar is of clerical or monastic origin. One fifteenth- century or sixteenth-century owner so strongly identified with the protagonist of the story that he wrote \\"his iaset Tomas Showall\\" on the bed in the miniature on fol. 1r, \\"his iaset y\\" in the right margin of the page, and \\"hic iaseth Tome\\" in the right margin of fol. 92r. Hatfield (Hertfordshire), Hatfield House, MS. Cecil 270. This manuscript consists of 75 leaves. Fols.1r-72v contain Soul without the translator's epilogue. Its language shows characteristics associated by LALME with Cambridgeshire. It contains numerous fifteenth and sixteenth-century inscriptions indicating that it was made for a member of the royal court and continued to circulate among families associated with the court until the early seventeenth century. Henry VI is the earliest known owner of Cecil 270, though nothing in the decoration or original contents of the book indicates that it was made for him. ‚ÄòRex Henricus Sextus‚Äô appears on ff 1r, 36v, and 72v, in the same fifteenth- century hand. On paleographical, artistic, and textual grounds, Cecil 270 seems to be the work of professional artists in the 1440s. New York Public Library, Spencer 19 (formerly Petworth 2). Spencer 19 consists of 136 leaves. The Pilgrimage of the Soul can be found on fols. 1r-133v. It includes a table of contents and a translator's epilogue but lacks a scribal colophon. It is the work of two scribes who worked in the second quarter of the fifteenth century. Its language shows features associated by LALME with the border area between Norfolk and Lincolnshire. The second scribe also uses forms typical of Rutland or Nottinghamshire and even Kent. On flyleaf Av, a fifteenth-century hand has written \\"Liber domini Thome Comorworth militis\\". Sir Thomas Cumberworth was Sheriff and Member of Parliament for Lincolnshire and died in 1451. He mentions the book, which he calls \\"my boke of grasdew of the sow[l]e\\" and bequeaths to the priest at chantry of the Virgin Mary at Somerby parish church, in his 1437 will. Melbourne, State Library of Victoria, MS *096/G94. This manuscript contains 217 leaves. Fols. 1r-95v contain a copy of the prose Life of the Manhood. Fols. 96r-215v contain a copy of The Pilgrimage of the Soul. The incipit on fol. 1r gives the title of the whole book as Grace Dieu. The handwriting dates from the second quarter of the fifteenth century and is the work of two, possibly even four, scribes. Most of the work is done Scribe A, who identifies himself as ‚ÄòBenet‚Äô. LALME identifies the language of scribe A as Lincolnshire. This is the only manuscript known to contain both The Pilgrimage of the Soul and The Pilgrimage of the Life of the Manhood. The first known owner of this manuscript was Sir John Roucliffe of Cowthorpe, South Yorkshire, who died in 1531, whose name appears in the bottom margin of fols. 1r and 215v. Parts of The Pilgrimage of the Soul appear in the following manuscripts: London, British Library, Add MS 37049. Leaves 69b-77 contain \\"The Apple of Solace\\", a short prose tract containing eight poems and four prose parts from the Soul. This manuscript's content and language suggest that it was compiled by the Carthusians in the Northeast Midlands during the middle of the fifteenth century. London, British Library, Harley MS 7333. Harley MS 7333 consists of 211 leaves and is an anthology of poetry and prose, primarily in English, including works by Benedict Burgh, Lydgate, Chaucer, Gower and Hoccleve. Fol. 148v contains book 1, chapter 2 of Soul. The scant linguistic information we can derive from this page shows forms associated by LALME with Leicestershire and Rutland. San Marino, Huntington Library HM 111 (formerly Phillipps 8151). HM 111 consists of forty-seven leaves. It is a collection of sixteen poems by Thomas Hoccleve. Fols. 3r-7v contain Hoccleve's ‚ÄòCompleynte of the Virgin‚Äô, without the first six stanzas, which appears as ‚ÄòThe Lament of the Green Tree‚Äô in book 4 of The Pilgrimage of the Soul. Adaptation in the translation The English translation of the French √Çme is not an extremely faithful one. As McGerr's edition shows, though the translator has remained faithful to much of the original‚Äîthe narrative structure and allegorical techniques remain the backbone of the English text‚Äîhe made some changes that make Soul more suited for a fifteenth-century English audience. The main change is that of the narrator of the story. In Guillaume's work the protagonist is clearly a Cistercian monk who can easily be identified with Guillaume himself. In the English Soul, the narrator has become an Everyman with whom the reader can identify. The differences can be seen from the beginning of the work on. Guillaume's √Çme is clearly meant as a sequel to his Vie. The English translation is not. The reader can understand the purpose of the work without having read Life of the Manhood first. All the references that Guillaume makes in √Çme to his previous work become references of the pilgrim's earthly life in Soul. The pilgrim in √Çme, when he needs an advocate to speak for him in the heavenly court, appeals to monastic patrons such as St. Benedict and St. Bernard. Since these saints lose much of their relevance to the English Everyman pilgrim, they are omitted. In the thirtieth chapter of the first book, Guillaume's discussion of the monastic ideal is replaced with Mercy questioning Justice on God's purpose in creating mankind and ordaining laws and about the relationship between earthly law and divine law. She builds a case for the pilgrim's salvation on the basis of the answers Justice gives her. Another typically English feature introduced into the English Soul is the occasional use of alliteration for dramatic effect. As McGerr notes, we find a fine example in chapter thirteen of book one, where the pilgrim is accused of several sins: > He hath iourneyed by the perylous pas of Pryde, by the malycious montayne of > Wrethe and Enuye, he hath waltred hym self and wesshen in the lothely lake > of cursyd Lechery, he hath ben encombred in the golf of Glotony. Also he > hath mysgouerned hym in the contre of Couetyse, and often tyme taken his > rest whan tyme was best to trauayle, slepyng and slomeryng in the bed of > Slouthe. McGerr uses the term \\"Englishing\\", a term also used by fifteenth-century English writers, rather than ‚Äòtranslating‚Äô. The translator loosed his knowledge of theology and English tradition on √Çme to change Guillaume's courtly poem into a polemical work that implicitly answered the attacks of Lollards and other critics of Roman Catholic doctrine. I think therein lies much of the value the work had for a fifteenth-century English audience, especially a lay one. English printings =William Caxton's The Pylgremage of the Sowle= The William Caxton printing indicates that the French √Çme was translated into English in 1413. Clubb, in the introduction to his edition of MS Egerton 615, mentions that two of the manuscripts (BL Add. 34193 and Corpus Christi MS 237) give no date for the translation; two (Bodleian Library MS 770 and University College MS 181) give 1400 as the date. Three manuscripts (Egerton 615, Spencer 19, and Gonville and Caius College, MS 124/61) and Caxton's print give 1413 as the date. Even more specifically, the Caxton print and University College MS 181 state that it ‚Äòendeth in the vigyle of Seynt Bartholomew‚Äô, that is, August 24. The weight of the evidence, therefore, points to 1413, and 1400 is probably a scribal error. But the Caxton print does not state by whom the translation was made. Neither do any of the manuscripts. =Later editions of The Pylgremage of the Sowle= The only editions of Sowle (or parts of it) since Caxton are as follows: Katherine Custs's 1859 reprint of selected portions of Caxton's work, Furnivall's 1892 transcript of the \\"Lamentacion of the Grene Tree\\" from MS Phillipps 8151 (now Huntington Library MS HM 111), Furnivall's 1897 transcript of the fourteen poems from British Library MS Egerton 615, mother Barry's 1931 editions of Spencer 1910, Clubb's 1954 edition of British Library Egerton MS 615, and Rosemarie Potz McGerr's hitherto partly published critical edition of Spencer 19, in two volumes, the first of which, containing the introduction, the first two books and their notes, was published in 1990.

He was born an Ottoman subject in Epirus, but escaped to Greece after being denounced to the authorities for writing a patriotic collection of poetry. Krystallis initially wrote his works in archaic language, but after 1891 he adopted the vernacular (Demotic) Greek language and became influenced by the New Athenian school. He was a pictorial writer, with a love of nature, while most of his work was based on traditional folk poetry. Life Kostas Krystallis, was born in the village of Syrrako, Epirus, then Ottoman Empire. He was the son of a local merchant. When his mother died he moved together with his father to Ioannina, where he attended the Zosimaia High School. As a pupil he wrote his first poetry collection, named Œ£Œ∫ŒπŒ±ŒØ œÑŒøœÖ ŒÜŒ¥ŒøœÖ (\\"Shadows of Hades\\"), which consisted of three short stories, and exhibited obvious borrowings from Dante's Inferno and Homer's Odyssey. Because of this highly patriotic work he was denounced by the Ottoman authorities, and sentenced to 25 years in exile. Krystallis managed to escape to Greece at 1886. While living in Athens he changed several jobs: initially worked as a typographer, copy editor and author in an encyclopedia, secretary for the periodical Œó ŒïŒ≤Œ¥ŒøŒºŒ¨œÇ (\\"The Week\\") and then ticket inspector in the national railway. For a short period he became author in the newspaper Œ¶œâŒΩŒÆ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒóœÄŒµŒØœÅŒøœÖ (Voice of Epirus) and supported the rights of the population of his home place Epirus, which was still under Ottoman control. At 1893, he lost his job; however, he won a lottery prize and could so afford the publication of a number of works he composed that time. Krystallis died of tuberculosis on April 22, 1894, aged 26. Work Krystallis wrote a relativelly small quantity of poems and prose. His first collection Œ£Œ∫ŒπŒ±ŒØ œÑŒøœÖ ŒÜŒ¥ŒøœÖ (\\"Shadows of Hades\\"), was finally published in 1894, the year of his death. In 1890 he composed a long narrative poem named Œü Œ∫Œ±ŒªœåŒ≥Œ∑œÅŒøœÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒöŒªŒµŒπœÉŒøœçœÅŒ±œÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒúŒµœÉœÉŒøŒªŒøŒ≥Œ≥ŒØŒøœÖ (\\"The monk of Kleisoura of Missolonghi\\") and the next year his work ŒëŒ≥œÅŒøœÑŒπŒ∫Œ¨ (\\"Pastorals\\") was awarded in a poetry contest. During this period, Krystallis' writing style was heavily influenced by Aristotelis Valaoritis. In 1893 he wrote his last collection Œü œÑœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒøœÖŒ¥ŒπœÉœÑŒÆœÇ œÑŒøœÖ œáœâœÅŒπŒøœç Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑŒ∑œÇ œÉœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒ∑œÇ (\\"The singer of the Village and the Fold\\") which was also praised at a poetry contest. Krystallis initially wrote his works in archaic language and belonged to the romantic poets of the First Athenian school. However, after 1891 he adopted the vernacular (Demotic) Greek language, while he became influenced by the New Athenian school, which was dominated by Kostis Palamas, the composer of the Olympic Hymn. During this period many of his poems were mainly adaptations of oral folk poetry. Krystallis, as well as Christos Christovasilis, composed short patriotic stories inspired by the bravery of the fighters of the Greek War of Independence (1821‚Äì1830) and especially the Souliotes. He has been described as a pastoral, rural poet who extolled nature, while on the other hand it has been claimed that he was never acclimatized to the urban environment himself. Legacy Krystallis was one of several Greek poets and author of that era that died young. In present days, an annual festival takes place every summer at Athens, the Krystalleia, named after Kostas Krystallis, which offers performances of contemporary Greek and classical music.

By this time, he was an active socialist and on his return to Portsmouth a few years later, he joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP), the local Labour Representation Committee, and the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers. He was a supporter of British involvement in World War I and volunteered for the British Army, but was ordered to continue his work in the pattern shop at the naval dockyard. At the 1918 general election, he stood for the Labour Party in Portsmouth South, but took third place and was not elected.Margaret 'Espinasse, Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.III, pp.126-127 In 1919, Lacey was elected to Portsmouth City Council, serving until 1922, and again from 1934 until 1970.

Guillaume de Deguileville (1295 - before 1358) was a French Cistercian and writer. His authorship is shown by one acrostic in Le P√®lerinage de la Vie Humaine, two in Le P√®lerinage de l'√Çme, and one in Le P√®lerinage de Jhesucrist. These acrostics take the form of a series of stanzas, each beginning with a letter of Deguileville's name. According to indications in the Vie his father was called Thomas, he was named after his godfather, and his patron saint was William of Chaalis. There is no evidence that his name is connected with a village of Guileville. Life and writings Guillaume entered the Cistercian abbey of Chaalis in 1316, at the age of twenty-one. This is in agreement with his assertion in the second redaction of the Vie, where he states that he has been in the abbey for thirty-nine years. The abbey of Chaalis‚Äîor what is left of it, for it is no more than a ruin nowadays‚Äîis in the diocese of Senlis, north of Paris, and was founded in the twelfth century. A manuscript of a French prose rendering of the √Çme states that Guillaume eventually became prior of Chaalis, but it is not known whether this is true or, if so, when this happened. According to the second redaction of the Vie, Guillaume was thirty-six years old when he wrote his first redaction in 1330, so he must have been born ca. 1294. The √Çme was written immediately after the second redaction of the Vie (1355), and in it he states that he was over 60 years old when writing the √Çme. He also refers to a passage in the Vie which only occurs in the second redaction of the poem, which is another indication that he wrote the √Çme after 1355. Guillaume wrote this second redaction of the Vie, he states in its prologue, because the first redaction had been stolen. This does not mean that this first redaction was lost to posterity, for, according to Clubb in the introduction of his edition of Egerton 615, J. J. St√ºrzinger based his edition of Vie on it. We can date Deguileville‚Äôs poems as follows: The first version of the Vie was written between 1330 and 1332; the second version of it around 1355; the √Çme between 1355 and 1358; and Jhesucrist about 1358. Some seventy-three manuscripts of Guillaume‚Äôs works, including forty-six of the √Çme, are extant in various libraries in Europe. The only edition of Guillaume‚Äôs three poems is that of St√ºrzinger, who based his edition of the Vie on the first redaction. The second redaction has never been edited. Although the surviving manuscripts of the P√®lerinage trilogy render the author's name as \\"Guillaume de Deguileville\\", a number of other variants can be found in both medieval and modern sources.Kamath 2012, p. XIII One alternative spelling is Guillaume de Deguilleville.Gray 2003, entry for \\"Deguilleville, Guillaume de\\"Gray 2003, entry for \\"ABC\\" Modernized form Guillaume de Digulleville is also used.Nievergelt and Kamath 2013, p. 1 A different interpretation of the surname gives Guillaume de Guileville or Guillaume de Guilleville. The Latin version of the name is Guillermus de Deguilevilla. English translations It was not until the 15th century that the first two parts of the P√®lerinage trilogy, P√®lerinage de la Vie Humaine and P√®lerinage de l'√Çme, appeared in English. The Pilgrimage of the Soul, anonymous but sometimes attributed to John Lydgate or Thomas Hoccleve, is known at least 10 complete and 3 partial manuscripts. The date for the translation is omitted in some manuscripts, and given as either 1400 or 1413 in others, one specifically saying it \\"endeth in the vigyle of Seynt Bartholomew\\", that is, August 24. This last quote, with 1413 dating, is also repeated in the first printed edition published by William Caxton in 1483. However, a considerably older English version of one fragment is known. Geoffrey Chaucer's poem ABC is in fact a translation of a prayer to Virgin Mary from P√®lerinage de la Vie Humaine. The form of the translation, closely modelled on that of the French original, is a particular type of an alphabetical poem. Both acrostics are composed of 23 stanzas, 12-lines-long in Guillaume's case and 8-lines-long in Chaucer's, each stanza beginning with letters from A to Z in order (J, U, and W excluded). While its precise date is not known, it is certainly a 14th-century work, pre-dating Chaucer's death in 1400; it may even be one of his earliest works, although this can not be proved conclusively. The main evidence comes from the Second Chaucer edition published by Thomas Speght in 1602. According to Speght, the poem was written, \\"some say\\", by the order of Blanche, duchess of Lancaster, the mother of King Henry IV. If this story is indeed a record of a genuine medieval tradition, the poem would have been written in 1368 at the latest, as Blanche died that year. This would make ABC Chaucer's earliest work, preceding The Book of the Duchess, an elegy commemorating Blanche's death. Edition * St√ºrzinger, Jakob J. (ed.)

From 1882 to 1896 he was the first Anglican Bishop of Newcastle upon the diocese's creation, and from 1896 to 1907 he was Bishop of Chichester.  Early life and career  The third son of another bishop, Samuel Wilberforce, and his wife, Emily Sargent (1807‚Äì1841) ‚Äî as well as the grandson of William Wilberforce, leader of the movement to abolish the slave trade ‚Äî Ernest, was born at his father's rectory, and grew up in Lavington and Cuddesdon, there gaining a love of country sports which lasted his whole life. Ernest's younger brother Basil became Archdeacon of Westminster. He was educated at Harrow from 1854 to 1857, then for 2 years with a private tutor, then from May 1859 to 1862 at Exeter College, Oxford. He showed little academic merit at any of these and ‚Äì better known as a good oarsman than a good scholar ‚Äì graduated BA with fourth-class honours. During his time at Oxford he married Frances Mary, third daughter of Sir Charles Anderson, baronet (1804‚Äì1891) on 23 June 1863, and subsequently, his attitude to his work and life became more serious, proceeding MA in 1867 and going to train for the ministry at Cuddesdon College, then under Edward King. His father ordained him deacon in December 1864 and priest in 1865 and, after short curacies at Cuddesdon itself and at Lea, was presented to living at Middleton Stoney, near Bicester, in 1868, though he had to resign from it two years later due to Frances' poor health (she died in October 1870 in San Remo of tuberculosis). In 1870 he became his father's domestic chaplain at Winchester, a year later sub-almoner to Queen Victoria, and in 1873 priest of Seaforth. This parish was traditionally evangelical and Ernest's moderate-high churchmanship could have led to friction with his parishioners, but his introduction of daily service and a weekly celebration of holy communion was tactful and such conflict was avoided, and it was in this parish that Ernest first became known for the power of his sermons and his voice. Also in Seaforth, he and his new wife (on 14 October 1874 Ernest had married a second time, to Emily, only daughter of George Henry Connor, later dean of Windsor ‚Äî the couple had 3 sons and 3 daughters) became active supporters of the temperance movement, taking the pledge together in 1876.  Bishop of Newcastle  In 1878 Wilberforce became a residentiary canon of Winchester and warden of the Wilberforce Mission (whose formation and endowment was a memorial to his father), with most of his activity for the latter occurring in Portsmouth and Aldershot (though in 1881 the mission was removed to the diocese of Rochester via a legal ruling and Ernest left England for Quebec, on a brief missionary trip). On his return in 1882, he was awarded his BD and DD and William Ewart Gladstone offered Ernest the new see of Newcastle, which he accepted ‚Äì he was nominated on 4 July ‚Äì becoming the Church of England's youngest diocesan bishop on his consecration on 25 July that year. It had taken four years between the parliamentary act that had formed the new diocese, and Ernest's appointment, to raise enough money to support a bishop, since the Church of England had only just taken interest in this industrial area and in its absence the dominant Christian force there had become the non- conformist churches (less than 4% of those in the 1881 census were recorded as attending Anglican services, a decline since 1851). Realising that this financial problem was his main impediment, Ernest raised nearly ¬£250,000 in its first five years for his Bishop of Newcastle's, allowing 11 new churches and 7 new vicarages to be built and 28 new clergy to be employed in the city within 10 years. He also made long journeyes across rural Northumberland for confirmations, confirming double the numbers in 1882‚Äì86 than had been confirmed 1878‚Äì1882 and making his presence felt right across the diocese. Even many nonconformists (after initial opposition) were won over by Ernest's tactful approach, and his DNB entry compares his work there to W. F. Hook's work in Leeds in the previous generation.  Bishop of Chichester  He was translated to Chichester on 16 January 1896, however, his health affected by his unflagging work in Newcastle, though there he found a number of ritualistic Anglican churches on the Sussex coast under fire from evangelicals from 1898 onwards. This culminated in a judgment from Lambeth against the use of incense and processional lights in 1899, with which Wilberforce persuaded five of the nine ritualist incumbents in Chichester diocese to comply. Attempting to protect the four others from prosecution and defending their work in the evidence he gave as a witness in front of the 1905 royal commission on ecclesiastical discipline (at which he also brought criticism to bear on what he saw as the evangelicals' prejudice and inaccurate claims), he tried to avoid the division and rancorousness he saw as results of the 1874 Public Worship Regulation Act and ensuing imprisonments and legal proceedings, despite having little personal investment in ritualism. He was also still active in other areas, having his work for the temperance movement recognised in 1896 by becoming chairman of the Church of England Temperance Society and in 1904 (at the age of 64) joining the 'mission of help' to southern Africa (aimed at reconciliation after the South African War). Following a short illness Wilberforce died in 1907 on the Isle of Wight and was buried at Westhampnett, near Chichester, on 14 September. Emily survived him and died 17 July 1941.Descendants of William Wilberforce MP  Notes   References  * ODNB entry *J. B. Atlay, The life of the Rt. Revd.

Stability, in this context, should be considered as an ability to control the position and movement of the core. Thus, if a person has greater core stability, they have a greater level of control over the position and movement of this area of their body. The body's core is frequently involved in aiding other movements of the body, such as the limbs, and it is considered that by improving core stability a person's ability to perform these other movements may also be improved i.e. core stability training may help improve someone's running ability.Kibler, W. B., Press, J., & Sciascia, A. (2006). The role of core stability in athletic function. Sports medicine, 36(3), 189-198. The body's core region is sometimes referred to as the torso or the trunk, although there are some differences in the muscles identified as constituting them. The major muscles groups include the quadriceps and abductor's erector spine, biceps, and triceps muscles. These muscles help you pull through your core to maintain balance while turning. . The minor muscles involved include the latissimus dorsi, gluteus maximus, and trapezius. Notably, breathing, including the action of the diaphragm, can significantly influence the posture and movement of the core; this is especially apparent in regard to extreme ranges of inhalation and exhalation. On this basis, how a person is breathing may influence their ability to control their core. Some researchers have argued that the generation of intra-abdominal pressure, caused by the activation of the core muscles and especially the transversus abdominis, may serve to lend support to the lumbar spine.P.W. Hodges, A.E.M. Eriksson, D. Shirley, S.C. Gandevia. 'Lumbar Spine Stiffness is Increased by Intra- Abdominal Pressure' One way in which intra-abdominal pressure can be increased is by the adoption of a deeper breathing pattern. In this case, and as considered by Hans Lindgren, 'The diaphragm [...] performs its breathing function at a lower position to facilitate a higher IAP.'http://hanslindgren.com/articles/diaphragm-function-for-core-stability/ Thus, the adoption of a deeper breathing pattern may improve core stability. Typically, the core is associated with the body's center of gravity, which is over the region of the second sacral vertebrae groups and stability is associated with isometric or static strength. In addition, it is the lumbar spine that is primarily responsible for posture and stability thus providing the strength needed for the stability especially utilized in dynamic sports. In practice Whenever a person moves, to lift something or simply to move from one position to another, the core region is tensed first. This tension is usually made unconsciously and in conjunction with a change in breathing pattern. An example to try is to sit in a chair and to reach forward over a table to pick up a cup. This movement is first accompanied by a tension in the core region of the abdomen and can be felt by placing one hand on the abdomen as the movement is made. As the load increases the key muscles contract around the viscera, which are in-compressible, to form a stable ball-like core region against which the forces are balanced in coordination with posture. It is commonly believed that core stability is essential for the maintenance of an upright posture and especially for movements and lifts that require extra effort such as lifting a heavy weight from the ground to a table. Without core stability the lower back is not supported from inside and can be injured by strain caused by the exercise. It is also believed that insufficient core stability can result in lower back pain and lower limb injuries.. Research There is little support in research for the core stability model and many of the benefits attributed to this method of exercise have not been demonstrated. At best core stability training has the same benefits as general, non-specific exerciseKriese M, et al Segmental stabilization in low back pain: a systematic review.

They also function by distributing one's bodyweight when standing upright.\\"Vertebral column\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2015. Web. 16 Feb. 2015 . Many injuries to the spine occur as a result of vehicle accidents, falling, and sports and recreation. While it is impossible to prevent such events from happening, increasing intra-abdominal pressure and strengthening the musculature in the back, along with keeping a neutral spine, can minimize injuries like hernias, strains, and sprains. =Intra-abdominal pressure= The correlation between having a significant amount of core strength and spinal health has been well documented by many studies in the past. Some of these studies were able to quantify the effects that antagonizing abdominal muscle had on stabilizing the lumbar spine by increasing the amount of intra-abdominal pressure in order to maintain a straight lumbar spine and to avoid rounding during physical activities Gardner-Morse, M., & Stokes, I.

The name Scanisaurus means \\"Sk√•ne lizard\\", Sk√•ne being the southernmost province of Sweden, where a majority of the fossils referred to the genus have been recovered. The genus contains one species, S. nazarowi, described in 1911 by Nikolay Bogolyubov as a species of Cimoliasaurus based on a single vertebral centrum discovered near Orenburg, Russia. S. nazarowi was separated into its own genus by Per-Ove Persson in 1959 after several differences were observed between the Russian centra and new fossils from Sk√•ne and the type species of Cimoliasaurus. Due to the limited type material and the lack of diagnostic features in the Swedish fossils confidently separating Scanisaurus from other Late Cretaceous elasmosaurids, the genus is of questionable validity, though it continues to be used in practice. Scanisaurus fossils have mainly been found in the Kristianstad Basin in northwestern Sk√•ne, where they represent the most common plesiosaur fossils. Scanisaurus shared its environment with a diverse marine fauna, including many other marine reptiles. It would have been a middle trophic-level predator, about 4‚Äì5 meters (13‚Äì16 ft) in length, and would have been able to feed both in open water and on the sea floor, likely feeding mainly on small prey such as small fish or belemnites.  History of research  In 1911, Russian mathematician, physicist and paleontologist Nikolay Bogolyubov described a Late Cretaceous posterior cervical (neck) vertebral centrum discovered near Orenburg, Russia. Bogolyubov referred the centrum to the plesiosaur genus Cimoliasaurus and believed it to represent a new species, which he named C. nazarowi. Bogolyubov compared the centrum with those of other plesiosaurs and found it to be most similar to a vertebra referred to Cimoliasaurus sp. from the Cenomanian Quiriquina Formation of Quiriquina Island, Chile and to vertebrae referred to Cimoliasaurus magnus, the type species of Cimoliasaurus. The main distinguishing feature used by Bogolyubov to justify the creation of a new species was that his centrum was wider than other centra referred to Cimoliasaurus.Teeth referred to Scanisaurus sp., excavated in the Kristianstad Basin and exhibited at \\"Havsdrakarnas hus\\" in Brom√∂lla, SwedenIn 1959, Swedish paleontologist Per-Ove Persson examined the fragmentary plesiosaur fossil record of Late Cretaceous Sk√•ne in southern Sweden, primarily recovered from fossil sites within the Kristianstad Basin (many from the island of Iv√∂) and from south-western Sk√•ne. He found that cervical vertebral centra from Sk√•ne accorded so well with the vertebra described by Bogolyubov that they \\"must belong to one and the same genus\\". Furthermore, Persson noted several differences between Bogolyubov's centrum and the Swedish material and the fossils of C. magnus, and considered C. nazarowi distinct enough to warrant being placed in a separate genus. Persson named this new genus Scanisaurus, meaning \\"Sk√•ne lizard\\". Persson noted that S. nazarowi remained an \\"undefinable\\" species since it remains based on only a single vertebral centrum, but felt confident that the Swedish material was referrable to the species since it did not differ in any essential points from Bogolyubov's fossil. Persson noted that the Swedish fossils were the same species \\"with a fairly great degree of probabilty\\" and provisionally designated them as S. cf. nazarowi. There were three principal characteristics Persson perceived to differentiate Scanisaurus from Cimoliasaurus. First, in Cimoliasaurus, the ribs were fused to the vertebrae with at least the pre-pectoral centra, whilst in Scanisaurus the cervical ribs were fused to the centra by only the sutures. Second, the length of the posterior cervical centra decreased towards the head in Cimoliasaurus, while the opposite was true in Scanisaurus. Third, the cervical centra of Scanisaurus were broader proportional to their length than the corresponding centra of Cimoliasaurus. Because centra referred to S. cf. nazarowi were far more common in the Swedish fossil sites compared to centra from other plesiosaurs, Persson concluded that S. cf. nazarowi was \\"obviously the most common plesiosaurian\\" in Late Cretaceous Sk√•ne. With this in mind, he also referred the most common type of plesiosaur teeth found, some of which had been found in association with S. cf. nazarowi vertebrae, to the species as well, alongside associated ossifications of humeri and femora. In 1995, in an examination of material referred to the invalid species Plesiosaurus houzeaui (found in Belgium), French paleontologist Nathalie Bardet and Belgian paleontologist Pascal Godefroit discussed other questionable plesiosaur species from Europe. Bardet and Godefroit noted that though Persson had referred the Swedish material to several different elasmosaurid genera, including Scanisaurus and Elasmosaurus, the fossils only possessed the necessary characteristics to be referred to the Elasmosauridae, not a particular genus or species. Though the material referred to S. cf. nazarowi, consisting of vertebrae, teeth and limb bones, was more complete than the material referred to Elasmosaurus, it was deemed to lack any diagnostic features with which it could be differentiated from other Late Cretaceous elasmosaurids. Though Scanisaurus for this reason is typically no longer considered a valid taxon (constituting a nomen dubium), the name continues to be used in practice. In 1996, Persson provisionally referred a crushed reptile skull recovered from Ignaberga quarry in the Kristianstad Basin to Scanisaurus sp., since two tooth fragments associated with the fossil showed the same striation pattern as in the teeth referred to S. cf. nazrowi. Though the skull is too crushed to give much useful anatomical information, it is the only cranial fossil referred to Scanisaurus (with the exception of teeth) and demonstrates that its head was comparatively larger than the heads of other dolichodiran plesiosaurs.  Description  alt= Scanisaurus was a \\"dolichodiran\\" (i.e. long-necked) plesiosaur, albeit one with a neck relatively shorter than those of some of its relatives (such as Elasmosaurus). It has sometimes been described as a \\"mesodiran\\" plesiosaur, with a larger head and shorter neck relative to other dolichodiran genera. It was likely similar to other relatively short-necked elasmosaurids, such as Cimoliasaurus and the genera in the subfamily Aristonectinae. Based on the size of its fossils and comparisons with the proportions of other plesiosaurs, Scanisaurus probably reached 4‚Äì5 meters (13‚Äì16 ft) in length.  Classification  Scanisaurus was probably similar (and maybe closely related) to other short- necked elasmosaurids, such as Aristonectes (pictured) Persson wrote that most of the known characteristics Scanisaurus agreed well with the characteristics of the Elasmosauridae. However, Persson did not consider the genus to represent a typical elasmosaurid and noted that it differed in one essential feature; the cervical centra of Scanisaurus were shorter and broader than those of other elasmosaurids. With this in mind, Persson suggested that Scanisaurus could be a representative of a new family of Late Cretaceous plesiosaurs, possibly a group intermediate between pliosaurs such as the polycotylids and elasmosaurids. Because Scanisaurus was far more similar to elasmosaurids than it was to polycotylids, Persson provisionally referred the genus to the Elasmosauridae. In 1960, Persson referred both Cimoliasaurus and Scanisaurus to a new family of mesodiran plesiosaurs, which he dubbed the Cimoliasauridae. In 1963, Persson also referred Aristonectes to the Cimoliasauridae on account of perceived close resemblances with fossil material of Cimoliasaurus and Scanisaurus in the length-width ratio of the cervical centra. Cimoliasauridae was placed as the sister group to Polycotylidae, but a 2009 revision of the type fossils of Cimoliasaurus by American paleontologist F. Robin O'Keefe and Canadian paleontologist Hallie P. Street showed that Cimoliasaurus belonged to the Elasmosauridae, making the Cimoliasauridae synonymous with the Elasmosauridae. A 2011 re-examination of the cervical vertebrae referred to Scanisaurus by Swiss paleontologist Christian Foth and German paleontologists Johannes Kalbe and Ren√© Kautz suggested that Scanisaurus being placed in the Elasmosauridae was plausible. The well-defined ossified articular margins and binocular-shaped articular faces of the centra, combined with their relatively short length, are features shared between Scanisaurus and other elasmosaurids. Modern research thus tends to place Scanisaurus in the Elasmosauridae, though its precise position within the family is uncertain.  Paleoecology  Most of the fossils referred to Scanisaurus cf. nazarowi have been recovered from fossil sites within the Kristianstad Basin, where, according to Persson, S. cf. nazarowi fossils represent the most common plesiosaur fossils found. During the Campanian, the Kristianstad Basin was a subtropical to temperate shallow inland sea home to a diverse marine fauna characteristic of shallow marine life of an inner shelf community and included abundant algae, brachiopods, bryozoans, molluscs (including bivalves, gastropods, belemnites and the ammonites), sea urchins, serpulids, decapods and sponges. Additionally, fish (including a vast array of sharks) were also common and fossils of many species of reptiles, most of them marine, have also been found, including mosasaurs, sea turtles, crocodylmorphs and a few dinosaurs. There were also three to five other plesiosaur species (two species of Elasmosaurus, one or two polycotylids and potentially another species of Scanisaurus, represented by the 1996 skull and isolated teeth). Mosasaur bite marks have been found on plesiosaur bones recovered from the basin. A 2017 study by Swedish paleontologists Benjamin P. Kear, Dennis Larsson and Johan Lindgren and Slovak paleontologist Martin Kundr√°t interpreted Scanisaurus as a middle trophic-level predator that would have been able to feed both in open water and on the sea floor. Kear and colleagues drew this conclusion from the fact that elasmosaurid teeth were both structurally fragile and took more time to replace than the teeth of other reptiles, meaning that elasmosaurids such as Scanisaurus would probably have kept to easily subdued prey to minimize the potential for damage, making them ecologically optimized towards middle trophic level aquatic predation. The sharp and elongated teeth of Scanisaurus indicates that they were used to smash or pierce smaller prey such as small fish or belemnites. Stomach content from other plesiosaurs has revealed a wide variety of prey, including bottom- dwelling invertebrates (i.e. gastropods and bivalves), fish, pterosaurs and ammonites.  In popular culture  The Scanisaurus fountain in Brom√∂lla, SwedenA fountain by the name Scanisaurus was constructed in Brom√∂lla, a town close to Iv√∂, by artist Gunnar Nyland in 1971. The fountain depicts two plesiosaurs, one male and one female, sunbathing on a rock on the ancient Iv√∂ island. The sculptures are made of around 3000 parts of shaped ceramics on bodies made of reinforced concrete. Locally in Sweden, plesiosaurs and Scanisaurus in particular are often referred to as \\"svan√∂dlor\\" (\\"swan lizards\\") or \\"svanhals√∂dlor\\" (\\"swan-neck lizards\\").

Van Rooyen and his female accomplice Joey Haarhoff are believed to be responsible for the abduction, sexual assault and murder of several missing girls, aged between 9 an 16-years-old, across eastern South Africa. In early 1990, when faced with arrest after the escape of their latest kidnap victim, Van Rooyen killed Haarhoff before committing suicide. Despite later evidence against them, the two were never formally convicted due to their deaths, and the bodies of their alleged victims were never found.  Biography  Cornelius Gerhardus van Rooyen was born in South Africa in 1938, and was commonly known as Gert or by his nickname \\"Bokkie\\". He is assumed to be the sole killer, although the South African Police Force has not conducted a full and conclusive investigation since his suicide. It is commonly believed that he was part of a pedophile group, although this has not been fully investigated. Various reports as to the whereabouts of his victims have not been investigated, leaving their families unable to put them to rest.  Criminal history  Gert Van Rooyen's first crimes were various thefts. He was sent to a reform school in 1954, after stealing a car which he used as transport from Cape Town to Pretoria to visit his dying mother. In 1960, he was convicted of stealing motor spares and clothing. Van Rooyen married and subsequently fathered six children: Anne Marie, Judith, Hannes, Flippie, Gerhard and Adriaan, and earned a legitimate living running a building construction business together with his brothers. In 1979, Van Rooyen abducted two girls, aged 10 and 13, taking them to the Hartbeespoort Dam near Pretoria, where he punched them in the face, ordered them to remove their clothing and sexually molested them. Van Rooyen released the girls in Pretoria the following day, and was subsequently arrested and sentenced to four years imprisonment for the abduction, sexual assault and common assault of the girls, serving three years before being released. In August 1983, he and his wife Aletta divorced. In 1988, Van Rooyen started dating divorcee Francina Johanna (\\"Joey\\") Hermina Haarhoff, who became his alleged accomplice, and the couple holidayed together at Warmbaths and Umdloti, on the KwaZulu Natal coast.. It is commonly believed that some of their victims may be buried on the beaches in KZN, as the time of the abductions corresponds to known vacation periods. Possible victims Photographs of the missing girls that were circulated by police Van Rooyen is thought to have used Haarhoff to lure young girls for him. Children's homes reported that she telephoned requesting to bring girls home for the holidays and weekends. The couple applied to foster children, but the application was turned down. At the end of 1989, a 14-year-old girl from an orphanage in the Orange Free State spent the Christmas holidays with the couple. * On 1 August 1988, 14-year-old Tracy-Lee Scott-Crossley of Randburg near Johannesburg disappeared. She was seen by witnesses climbing into a Volkswagen Beetle outside of the shopping mall in Cresta. A nationwide police search and hypermarket poster campaign were launched.Face to Face with Noereen Scott- Crossley Sunday Times (South Africa). 11 September 1988 Her brother Mark, who had declined an offer to go shopping with her, was severely guilt-ridden and traumatised by her disappearance. In later life he was found guilty of the murder of a farm worker, beating him and throwing his unconscious body to the lions. * On 22 December 1988, 12-year-old Fiona Harvey of Pietermaritzburg disappeared. A white Ford Bantam pick-up truck used in her abduction with an advertisement for Van Rooyen's building-contracting business on it would later link him to this crime. * On 7 June 1989, 12-year-old Joan Horn of Pretoria disappeared. * In July 1989, 16-year-old Janet Delport of Durban disappeared after being abducted in a shopping mall by a blonde woman. She was later found wandering around distressed, but unharmed. * Some weeks later, 9-year-old Rosa Piel of Alberton disappeared. * On 22 September 1989, 11-year-old Odette Boucher and 12-year-old Anne-Mari Wapenaar, both of Kempton Park, disappeared. * On 29 September 1989, Kobie Wapenaar, Anne-Mari's mother, received a letter from her daughter claiming that she and Odette had run away to Durban with some boys. Odette's letter arrived a week after Anne-Mari's ‚Äï although it was posted on the same day, 23 September 1989, in Durban. It is suspected the letter was written under duress. * On 3 November 1989, 13-year-old Yolanda Wessels, the niece of Van Rooyen's partner Joey Haarhoff, disappeared. * On 11 January 1990, 16-year-old Joan Booysen of Pretoria was abducted by Haarhoff in Church Square, Pretoria, and was taken to Van Rooyen's home on Malherbe Street, in the Capital Park neighborhood of the city.() Booysen was handcuffed, drugged and sexually assaulted before being locked in a cupboard. It is likely that Van Rooyen and Haarhoff thought that Booysen was younger than she was due to her small stature. She managed to escape and alert the police who placed the home under surveillance and four days later identified Van Rooyen when he drove past his house in a white Ford pick-up that matched the description of a vehicle used in one of the abductions. Upon discovering Booysen's disappearance, Van Rooyen shot and killed Haarhoff with a .22 revolver before committing suicide with a .357 revolver. All the above disappearances, with the exception of Rosa Piel, were linked by witness statements or forensic evidence to Van Rooyen and Haarhoff following their deaths. For example, Odette Boucher's home address and phone number were found written on a piece of paper and hidden under a carpet in the garage, as well as her class captain's badge and yellow bag. Anne-Mari Wapenaar's address and home keys, as well as the envelopes and paper used when writing to their parents were found in his home. None of the Van Rooyen's victims were ever found, despite extensive police searches of his business premises and house, which was dubbed \\"The House of Horrors\\" by the press. In 1996, Absa Bank donated Van Rooyen's former house to the police to allow the girls' disappearance to be investigated further. On 13 May 1996, police systematically demolished the house in a search for new forensic evidence that might provide clues to the fate of the missing girls. The roof was removed and vacuumed for traces of human hair and nails, then the walls demolished and the kitchen and main bedroom scanned with sonar equipment for cavities. The soil in the garden was sifted and some bones found, but forensic pathologists identified these as non-human. In February 2001, Flippie Van Rooyen, Gert van Rooyen's son, was found guilty of perjury in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court. He was charged with three counts of perjury after giving police conflicting statements under oath relating to the six missing schoolgirls. Flippie was then already in jail for a death sentence which had been commuted to life imprisonment, for the murder of a 15-year-old Zimbabwean girl. He was paroled in 2008. Another son, Gerhard, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for theft and fraud. In June 1990, a customer at the Fabric Library in Midrand found a pencilled note, written in a childish hand, on a slip. It read: \\"I am Anne- Mari. My friend and I are with our kidnappers at (listed an address) . My friend has tried to phone, but was cut off.\\" Interviewed by the Sunday Star in April 1993, when news of the letter came to light, former Fabric Library personal assistant Debora Sloane said: \\"What riveted me was a little girl who came into the Fabric Library shortly before the note was discovered. This girl of about twelve had short black hair and appeared very scared. I can still see her sitting there and wondered at the time why she was looking so scared.\\" Contacted this week, Kobie Wapenaar told the Saturday Star that \\"the handwriting was definitely Anne-Mari's - and police handwriting experts confirmed it.\\" Although Ray Boucher said police investigations at the address given in Anne-Mari's note proved fruitless, it remains the only positive proof that she and Odette were perhaps alive months after the paedophile couple's bodies were cremated. On 12 March 2007, renewed interest in the case occurred after a set of adolescent bones was found on the beach near Umdloti, Kwazulu- Natal about 500m away from a holiday resort that Van Rooyen and Haarhoff are known to have visited. Subsequent DNA testing did not identify any of the Van Rooyen victims. The South African Police have not released further details, which would lead one to believe there was no positive identification made. Significant public attention has been brought to bear on the case by the investigative television series, Carte Blanche which dedicated an episode to the mystery. In November 2007, bones were discovered in a property adjacent to Van Rooyen's house in Pretoria whilst ground was being dug up to install a swimming pool. Local authorities were alerted and police forensic experts were to determine if the bones were human.

It is said to have taken its name from the legendary king Vortigern (). For most of the medieval era, it was associated with the cantref of Buellt and then Elfael, small regional kingdoms whose rulers operated independently of other powers. In the Norman era, like the rest of the region between Wye and Severn it came to be dominated by Marcher Lordships. Name and boundaries According to the 9th-century Historia Brittonum, Gwrtheyrnion, here Latinised Guorthegirnaim, was named after Vortigern (), a legendary 5th-century King of Britain.Historia Brittonum, ch. 47. John Edward Lloyd considers this derivation accurate.Lloyd, pp. 253‚Äì254. Generally, its boundaries were the cantrefi of Arwystli to the north, Maelienydd (in its restricted sense) to the east, Elfael to the southeast, and Buellt to the southwest. It also controlled the commote of Deuddwr (i.e. Cwmwd Deuddwr, also known as Elenydd) on the west of the Wye; together they formed a cantref. History =Early years= Territories in and adjacent to the region between Wye and Severn The Historia Brittonum provides the earliest mention of Gwrtheyrnion. According to the text, Vortigern fled to Gwrtheyrnion after Saint Germanus of Auxerre had castigated him for his various sins. He eventually died, and his son Pascent received Gwrtheyrnion and Buellt from Ambrosius Aurelianus.Historia Brittonum, ch. 47‚Äì49. One of the text's copyists, from whose copy most other surviving manuscripts are derived, took particular interest in this combined kingdom, tracing its medieval rulers back to Vortigern through Pascent.Lloyd, p. 224 and notes. The dynasty, so these manuscripts report, ended in a certain Ffernfael ap Tewdwr, who is also known from the genealogies from Jesus College MS 20. These Jesus College genealogies indicate that Ffernfael's cousin Brawstudd married Arthfael Hen ap Rhys, the ruler of Morgannwg, implying a floruit for Ffernfael around the early 9th century. Following Ffernfael's death, Buellt (and hence Gwrtheyrnion) came into the possession of neighbouring Arwystli,Owen, p. 203. for unclear reasons, after having temporarily been in the possession of Seisyllwg, for an unclear amount of time. At around this time, Arwystli's ruler was Iorwerth Hirflawdd; when Iorworth's son Idnerth died, his realm was re-divided, with Buellt (including Gwrtheyrnion) going to Cadwr GwenwynLloyd, p. 406 & note. (the rest of the realm - Arwystli - went to a different son). Cadwr's grandson, and heir, married a granddaughter of Merfyn ap Rhodri, the king of Powys (this did not mean that Powys gained any authority over Buellt/GwrtheyrnionOwen, p. 203.); their grandson, and heir, was Elystan Glodrydd. Elystan Glodrydd conquered the adjacent land between the Wye and Severn - Ferlix (known also by various other spellings, such as Fferllys, Fferleg, and Fferregs) and incorporated it into his own realm. Elystan was succeeded by his son, Cadwgan, who was succeeded by his eldest son, Idnerth; a younger son gave rise to the Cadogan family, who were raised to the nobility many centuries later. =Normans= Due to their allegiances to the Saxon Kings (Elystan had been the god-son, and namesake, of King Athelstan), once the Normans invaded England, many Welsh princes had assisted anti-Norman revolts like that of Eadric the Wild. Hence, in 1080, when a revolt broke out in Northern England, the Normans pre-emptively occupied Wales, to prevent any further Welsh assistance to the Saxons. In turn, this led to a Welsh revolt in 1094, but by the end of the century it was successfully suppressed by a number of Norman magnates. The southern parts of Ferlix were conquered by Philip de Braose.Lloyd, pp. 402‚Äì405.British Archaeology, no 34, May 1998 (ISSN 1357-4442): Paul Remfry. Discovering the lost kingdom of Radnor Eventually, like other Welsh princes, Idnerth came to a personal agreement with the local Norman magnate; Idnerth was restored to Gwrtheyrnion, and most of Ferlix, but Braose kept the rest of Buellt for himself. Following Idnerth's death, and that of his son, Madog, the retained parts of Ferlix were divided between Madog's sons: Cadwallon received most of the northern half, which became Maelienydd, while the remainder - Elfael - went to his brother, Einion Clud. Einion Clud was succeeded by his son, Einion o'r Porth. Einion o'r Porth married Susanna, a daughter of Rhys ap Gruffydd, the ruling prince of Deheubarth. The only named ruler of Gwrtheyrnion in historic manuscripts (other than the legendary Pascent) is an Einion ap Rhys who visited the king in 1175, and was Rhys ap Gruffydd's son-in-law; unless this Einion ap Rhys is really a bodged reference to Einion o'r' Porth, then he, his father, and the consequently distinct line of rulers in Gwrtheyrnion, are otherwise entirely unknown. In 1177, Rhayader Castle was built in Gwrtheyrnion by Rhys ap Gruffydd. Einion was murdered by his own brother, Gwalter. Einion's other brother, Iorwerth Clud, was able to depose Gwalter with the aid of Reginald de Braose (who had, by now, inherited Buellt), in alliance with Llywelyn Fawr (the most powerful Welsh prince). Unfortunately, Llywelyn's son (and successor), Dafydd, chose to repudiate the Treaty of Gwerneigron, which lead to Ralph Tosny seizing Elfael, although Tosny was later expelled from Elfael by Dafydd's nephew, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. King Henry acknowledged Llywelyn ap Gruffudd's victory, by the Treaty of Montgomery.Lloyd. pp. 739‚Äì740. However, when Llywelyn ap Gruffudd married Eleanor de Montfort (the daughter of Henry's greatest enemy), Henry's son, Edward I (now King), declared Llywelyn a rebel, and attacked his lands. In 1277 Llywelyn was forced to agree the Treaty of Aberconwy, which made Llywelyn a vassal of Edward, and limited his authority to Gwynedd alone; Elfael was given to Ralph Tosny's grandson. =Later history= In the 15th century, the Tosny lands were inherited by Margaret Beauchamp of Bletso, and hence by her great-grandson, King Henry VIII. Following the latter's Laws in Wales Acts, Gwrtheyrnion and the rest of Ferlix became Radnorshire. In 1996, Radnorshire and the adjacent counties on either side - Montgomeryshire and Brecknockshire - became the main constituents of the modern county of Powys.

She is a native of Tokyo and graduate of Chiba University. After a career in education, Aoki entered politics in 2003 and has served a total of four terms in the national Diet of Japan, having sat in the House of Representatives from 2003‚Äì2005 and 2009‚Äì2014, and a partial term in the House of Councillors from 2007‚Äì2009. Aoki was returned to the House of Councillors in the election held on 10 July 2016. Education and pre-politics career Aoki was born in Tokyo and was raised in the town of Chikura, Chiba Prefecture. She graduated from in 1984 and gained a bachelor's degree in education from Chiba University in 1988. She later obtained a master's degree in education from the university in 1999. After graduating university Aoki was active as a singer-songwriter, releasing a total of six singles between 1989 and 1998, and an album titled in 1991. After completing her master's degree she gained employment at a kindergarten in Chikura. Political career =House of Representatives (2003‚Äì2005)= Aoki's father is a former member of the Chikura town assembly. In 2001 Aoki sought entry into the , a cram school for aspiring politicians operated by Ichiro Ozawa, but was unable to enroll due to being one year over the school's upper age limit of 35. Despite this, Aoki received Ozawa's recommendation and joined the Liberal Party, a party founded by Ozawa three years earlier. In September 2003 the Liberal Party merged into the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and Aoki contested the as a DPJ candidate at the October 2003 general election. Aoki received 40.8% of the vote but lost to the incumbent Liberal Democratic Party member Yasukazu Hamada, who received 53.9%. The DPJ received 40 per cent of the vote in the Southern Kanto proportional representation block, entitling them to nine of the 22 seats in the block. Aoki's comparatively low margin of defeat meant she gained the DPJ's final seat in block. In the 2005 general election Aoki again contested the Chiba 12th district against Hamada, this time losing by more than 50,000 votes and failing to retain her seat in the proportional representation block. During her two years in the House of Representatives Aoki served on the Committee on Health, Welfare and Labour, Committee on Education, Culture and Science and the Research Commission on the Constitution. =House of Councillors (2007‚Äì2009)= After losing her seat in the lower house of the Diet, Aoki turned her attention to contesting the July 2007 House of Councillors election. She ran in the , where the DPJ won 20 of the 48 seats with 39.5% of the vote. Aoki personally received 297,034 votes, third-highest within the party and 13th highest overall. Whilst a councillor Aoki served on the Committee on Education, Culture and Science, Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Committee on House Rules and Administration and the Special Committee on Disasters. Aoki was also a part of the Education, Culture and Science department within the DPJ's shadow cabinet. In July 2009, whilst still in the second year of her six-year term as a Councillor, Aoki nominated as a candidate for the in the August 2009 general election, thereby automatically losing her seat in the House of Councillors; she was replaced by fellow DPJ candidate . =House of Representatives (2009‚Äì2014)= In the election Aoki defeated Akihiro Ota, the incumbent member and leader of the Komeito party, by more than 10,000 votes. This election brought the DPJ into power for the first time, and Aoki served in roles including as a director of the House's Committee on Health, Welfare and Labour and a director of the House's Committee on Fundamental National Policies. In September 2009 Ozawa became Secretary-General of the DPJ and the following month he announced Aoki as one of his deputies. In June 2010 friction between Ozawa and party president and Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama led to both men resigning from their roles in order to give the party a \\"clean start\\". On 13 June five Ozawa faction members resigned from their positions within the party, including Aoki who resigned as Deputy Secretary-General. On 24 January 2012 Aoki was selected as the Chairperson of the House's Special Committee on Consumer Affairs. On 2 July 2012 Aoki was one of fifty DPJ Diet members, led by Ozawa, to resign from the party after Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda publicly announced as policy a plan to increase the national consumption tax. A week later 37 members including Aoki and Ozawa were officially expelled from the DPJ for voting against the tax bills. Aoki resigned from the role of Committee Chairperson on 10 July and the next day became one of the founding members of Ozawa's new People's Life First Party, which merged with other minor parties in November 2012 to form the Tomorrow Party of Japan. In the December 2012 general election which removed the DPJ from power, Aoki contested the Tokyo 12th district as a Tomorrow Party candidate, losing to Ota by 47,000 votes. In the Tokyo proportional representation block, the Tomorrow Party received 6.9% of the vote, granting the party one of 17 seats in the block. As Aoki's defeat was the smallest suffered by the Tomorrow Party's 17 candidates in Tokyo, Aoki received the block seat and remained in the House of Representatives. The party's poor showing in the election led to the party's dissolution shortly after, and Aoki was one of fifteen Tomorrow Party Diet members who joined Ozawa in his new party, the People's Life Party. As a People's Life Party member Aoki again served in the House of Representatives' Committee on Education, Culture and Science, the Special Committee on Consumer Affairs and the Special Committee on Promotion of Science and Technology, and Innovation. In the December 2014 general election Aoki ran as a People's Life candidate and finished third in the Tokyo 12th district behind Ota and Japanese Communist Party candidate Saori Ikeuchi. The party received only 2.7% of the vote in the Tokyo proportional representation block, not enough for one of the seventeen seats, meaning Aoki was left without a seat in the Diet for the first time in nine years. =Return to House of Councillors (2016‚Äìpresent)= In June 2016 Aoki sought a return to the House of Councillors, receiving the People's Life Party's number one ballot spot for the National Block at the July 2016 upper house election. The People's Life Party received 1.9% of the vote in the National Block, entitling the party to one of the 48 seats being contested. Aoki received 68.9% of the votes cast for the party's five candidates, meaning she was awarded the party's seat.

The type and only known species is Tuarangisaurus keyesi, named by Wiffen and Moisley in 1986. Description The estimated length of Tuarangisaurus is about . It can be distinguished from all other known elasmosaurids by a unique combination of characteristics as well as two otherwise unknown traits: the ectopterygoid has a long process directed towards the back, and a large boss of bone underneath. A stapes is present in the holotype; this bone was previously thought to be absent from elasmosaurids. Discovery and naming Tuarangisaurus is known from the holotype NZGS CD425, a nearly complete skull and mandible, and from NZGS CD426, nine anterior-most cervical vertebrae. Some postcranial remains of juveniles were also attributed to Tuarangisaurus. It was collected from the Maungataniwha Sandstone Member of the Tahora Formation, dating to the upper Campanian to lower Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, about 78 million years ago. A second species, T. australis, was named in 2005; however, it was moved to the genus Eromangasaurus in 2007, becoming the senior synonym of E. carinognathus. A third species, T.? cabazai, was also referred to Tuarangisaurus by the original description; however, it was most recently reassigned to an indeterminate aristonectine. Classification Tuarangisaurus was initially assigned to the Elasmosauridae; one study found it to be a close relative of Callawayasaurus. A new phylogenetic analysis of plesiosaurs in 2016 reaffirmed that Tuarangisaurus was an elasmosaurid, but rejected a close relationship with Callawayasaurus. Its position within the Elasmosauridae according to this analysis is shown below.

During her 30 years as headmistress, her educational philosophy raised Ascham School to prosperity and prominence across Australia. The school totaled over 400 students at her retirement in 1947. She was an educator, world traveler, and women's activist.  Life and career  Bailey was born at Toowoomba, Queensland. She was the eldest child of John Bailey, grazier, and his wife Jane, n√©e McCurdy, who raised her in the Presbyterian faith. She graduated from the Newnham School for Girls in Toowoomba, and won an exhibition to the University of Sydney. She completed her baccalaureate in 1900, taught at various schools in the area, and later studied abroad in France. While abroad, she discovered that she could not converse in the French language, despite having graduated with honors in French. This circumstance sparked her interest in language pedagogy, which she would research in Paris, Berlin, and London. She would later earn an education diploma from the University of London. Bailey returned to Sydney in 1914, and bought Ascham School from former headmaster H. J. Carter. In 1916, she became an educationist at the school, and found opportunity to solve the school's problems pragmatically‚Äîfor instance, purchasing student uniforms from army disposal outlets. She adapted the Dalton plan to her school in 1927. The plan's Montessori school inspiration, combined with the school's enthusiastic staff, saw the plan launched to great success. Bailey would also introduce the purchase and construction of several other buildings and classrooms to accommodate Ascham School's growing body of pupils. In 1937, Bailey and a council of governors incorporated the school as a non-profit organization. She became an active member of the Headmistress' Association of Australia and the New Education Fellowship, later serving as vice-president and then president of the Sydney University Women Graduates' Association. Bailey retired in 1947, and died peacefully in Roseville, New South Wales in 1955.

George Henry Connor (1822‚Äì1 May 1883, the Deanery, Windsor) was a Church of England clergyman who became Dean of Windsor.  Family  He was the eldest son of George Connor, master in chancery in Ireland. He married Maude Worthington in 1852, eldest daughter of John Worthington of Kent House, Southsea. The couple had two sons and several daughters, of which Emily Henrietta married another clergyman, Ernest Roland Wilberforce.  Life  He graduated BA in 1845 and proceeded MA in 1851 at Trinity College, Dublin, and was ordained deacon in 1846 and priest in 1847. He officiated for a time at St Thomas's Chapel, Newport, Isle of Wight. He was then curate at St Jude's, Southsea then Wareham, Dorset, before returning to Newport as vicar in 1852, where his drive and initiative got the parish church rebuilt for ¬£22,000 (with Prince Albert laying the foundation stone), a new vicarage and almhouses built, and local schools improved. Developing a relationship with Queen Victoria, residing mainly at nearby Osborne House at this time, he became for many years her honorary chaplain and chaplain-in-ordinary, chaplain to the governor of the Isle of Wight, and official and commissary of the archdeaconry of Wight, culminating in his appointment as Dean of Windsor in October 1882 by the queen herself, without consulting Gladstone. Connor departed from Newport, to the parishioners' general regret, but proved unsuited to the pressures of such a prominent deanery as Windsor. His health rapidly failed (his presence at the christening of Princess Alice of Albany on 26 March 1883 took a great effort) and though he preached often in the private chapel, he only preached once in St George's Chapel before dying in office in 1883.

At the time of recording, the band wanted to create an album that was focused instead of going in multiple directions compared to their previous studio album Nickels for Your Nightmares. Composition Production In the production of The Oracle of Hi-Fi, Headstones used Pro Tools for recording and RADAR for mixing. Most of the band's performances on the album was digitally layered, with the exception of the live track \\"Coffee Cup\\".

Isthmian Steamship was the brainchild of US Steel President James A. Farrell, who had connections with the maritime industry through his father's trade as a ship's master. Farrell realized that US Steel could save substantial sums of money by owning its own fleet of freighters, rather than chartering cargo space from other companies. Farrell named the company after the Isthmus of Panama, in honour of America's recent construction achievement, the Panama Canal. Farrell headquartered Isthmian Steamship in London, partly in order to take advantage of Great Britain's respected name in the industry, and partly to benefit from Britain's long history of maritime experience. Management of the company was assigned to the British Federal Steam Navigation Co Ltd, a company which traced its own origins back as far as 1782 with the British East India Company. The US end of Farrell's new company was managed by the Norton Lilly Agency. The company's first ship was the SS Bantu, a British vessel launched in 1902 and purchased by US Steel in 1907 for a reputed ¬£24,000. By 1914, the company had purchased six additional ships ‚Äì Kentra, Buenaventura, Santa Rosalia, Charleton Hall, Craston Hall and the sleek cargo liner Crofton Hall ‚Äì all sturdy British steamships. With the outbreak of World War I however, Farrell brought the company back under the protective cover of the flag of America, which was not at the time a belligerent. Isthmian Steamship Company On 30 January 1930 Isthmian Steamship Company was organized separately from US Steel which retained the ships SS Steel Chemist, SS Steel Electrician, SS Steelmotor, and SS Steelvendor.

It lies at the junction of State Road 29 and Janes Memorial Scenic Drive (County Road 837). Copeland lies along the western border of the Big Cypress National Preserve, and wedged beside the Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park to the east. The hamlet of Jerome is a few miles to the north, while Carnestown lies a few miles to the south at the intersection of State Road 29 and U.S. Route 41. Logging era: 1943-1957 During the Second World War, the demand for cypress brought the timber industry to southwest Florida. The newly established Lee Cypress Lumber Company began operations in 1943 and designated Copeland as a company town. The operation was overseen by superintendent J.R. Terill, and Copeland served as the base camp for over three-hundred sawyers, railroad workers, and their families. Homes were made of cypress and assembled on-site as the population increased. Most of the people living at Copeland were African-American and the community was segregated with separate facilities for white and black workers. The town boasted a commissary and a few \\"jukes\\" for entertainment. Almost all functions including entertainment were overseen by the Lee Cypress Company. A large railroad depot handled the logs that were brought out of the Fakahatchee Strand and other parts of the Big Cypress Swamp, the current Jane's Scenic Drive serving as the main railroad line through Fakahatchee. The logs were sent to the massive sawmill complex in Perry, Florida, four-hundred miles north. The remaining steam locomotive used to carry timber is on display Collier County Museum in Naples.Copeland's population dwindled quickly in the late fifties as the timber industry completed its operations in 1957. The population was estimated at 275 people in 2006. Copeland also lies within a Florida panther habitat. Copeland was founded in 1932 in honor of David Graham Copeland, a U.S. Navy engineer who helped plan the Tamiami Trail and began a family-owned farming business at this location. Copeland is part of the Naples-Marco Island Metropolitan Statistical Area. Copeland was also the location of the low-budget, 1978 horror movie, Blood Stalkers.

He has been called \\"Bermuda‚Äôs outstanding genius of the seventeenth century\\".Bermuda, Today and Yesterday - Richard Norwood Life Born about 1590, he was in 1616 sent out by the Somers Isles Company to survey the islands of Bermuda (also known as the Somers Isles), then newly settled. He was later accused of collusion with the governor, and that, after assigning the shares to all the settlers, eight shares of the best land remained over, for the personal advantage of himself and the governor. His map was published in London in 1622. In 1623, Norwood patented lands in Virginia, but it does not appear that he ever went there. He is said to have resided at that date in the Bermudas. He may have made several visits to the islands, but according to his own statements he was, for some years before 1630 and after, up to 1640, resident in London, near Tower Hill, as a teacher of mathematics. He is also credited with founding Bermuda's oldest school, Warwick Academy, in 1662.Warwick Academy: Previous Headmasters Between June 1633 and June 1635 he personally measured, partly by chain and partly by pacing, the distance between London and York, making corrections for all the windings of the way, as well as for the ascents and descents. He also, from observations of the sun's altitude, computed the difference of latitude of the two places, and so calculated the length of a degree of the meridian. His result was some 600 yards too great; but it was the nearest approximation that had then been made in England. Isaac Newton noted Norwood's work in his Principia Mathematica. During the English Civil War he seems to have resided in Bermuda, where he had a government grant as schoolmaster. In 1662, he conducted a second survey there. Norwood was in England in 1667, probably only on a visit. He died at Bermuda in October 1675, aged about eighty-five, and was buried there. Works His published works are: * Trigonometrie, or the Doctrine of Triangles, 1631. * The Seaman's Practice, 1637. Published London. * Fortification, or Architecture Military, 1639. * Truth gloriously appearing, 1645. * Considerations tending to remove the Present Differences, 1646. * Norwood's Epitomy, being the Application of the Doctrine of Triangles, 1667.

The theory of nullification has never been legally upheld by federal courts.\\"[S]tates throughout U.S. history have attempted to use variations of the nullification doctrine to invalidate national law. However, every attempt by states to nullify federal law was clearly rejected by not only the federal government, but also by other states.\\" Card, Ryan, \\"Can States 'Just Say No' to Federal Health Care Reform? The Constitutional and Political Implications of State Attempts to Nullify Federal Law\\", 2010 B.Y.U. Law Review 1795, 1808 (2010). The theory of nullification is based on a view that the states formed the Union by an agreement (or \\"compact\\") among the states, and that as creators of the federal government, the states have the final authority to determine the limits of the power of that government. Under this, the compact theory, the states and not the federal courts are the ultimate interpreters of the extent of the federal government's power. Under this theory, the states therefore may reject, or nullify, federal laws that the states believe are beyond the federal government's constitutional powers. The related idea of interposition is a theory that a state has the right and the duty to \\"interpose\\" itself when the federal government enacts laws that the state believes to be unconstitutional. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison set forth the theories of nullification and interposition in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798. Courts at the state and federal level, including the U.S. Supreme Court, repeatedly have rejected the theory of nullification.See Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1 (1958), Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 364 U.S. 500 (1960), Ableman v. Booth, 62 U.S. 506 (1859), and United States v. Peters, 9 U.S. (5 Cranch) 115 (1809), all of which are discussed below. The courts have decided that under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, federal law is superior to state law, and that under Article III of the Constitution, the federal judiciary has the final power to interpret the Constitution. Therefore, the power to make final decisions about the constitutionality of federal laws lies with the federal courts, not the states, and the states do not have the power to nullify federal laws. Between 1798 and the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, several states threatened or attempted nullification of various federal laws. None of these efforts were legally upheld. The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions were rejected by the other states. The Supreme Court rejected nullification attempts in a series of decisions in the 19th century, including Ableman v. Booth, which rejected Wisconsin's attempt to nullify the Fugitive Slave Act. The Civil War ended most nullification efforts. In the 1950s, southern states attempted to use nullification and interposition to prevent integration of their schools. These attempts failed when the Supreme Court again rejected nullification in Cooper v. Aaron, explicitly holding that the states may not nullify federal law. The Constitution and the theory of nullification =Provisions of the Constitution= The Constitution does not contain any clause expressly providing that the states have the power to declare federal laws unconstitutional. Supporters of nullification have argued that the states' power of nullification is inherent in the nature of the federal system. They have argued that before the Constitution was ratified, the states essentially were separate nations. Under this theory, the Constitution is a contract, or \\"compact\\", among the states by which the states delegated certain powers to the federal government, while reserving all other powers to themselves. The states, as parties to the compact, retained the inherent right to judge compliance with the compact. According to supporters of nullification, if the states determine that the federal government has exceeded its delegated powers, the states may declare federal laws unconstitutional.Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798: \\"[B]y compact, ... [the states] constituted a general government for special purposes, delegated to that government certain definite powers, reserving, each state to itself, the residuary mass of right to their own self- government. ... [E]ach party has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress.\\" Nullification supporters argue that the power to declare federal laws unconstitutional not only is inherent in the concept of state sovereignty, but also is one of the powers reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.The South Carolina Exposition and Protest of 1828, written by John C. Calhoun, stated: \\"[T]he power of the States to interpose in order to protect their rights ... like all other reserved rights ... is to be inferred from the simple fact that it is not delegated.\\" This view of the Constitution has been rejected by the federal courts, which consistently have held that under the Constitution, the states do not have the power to nullify federal laws. The courts have rejected the compact theory, finding that the Constitution was not a contract among the states. Rather, the Constitution was established directly by the people, as stated in the preamble: \\"We the people of the United States ...\\"In Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304 (1816), the Court said: \\"The Constitution of the United States was ordained and established not by the States in their sovereign capacities, but emphatically, as the preamble of the Constitution declares, by 'the people of the United States.' ... The [Articles of] Confederation was a compact between States, and its structure and powers were wholly unlike those of the National Government. The Constitution was an act of the people of the United States.\\" See also McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819) (\\"The government proceeds directly from the people [and] is 'ordained and established' in the name of the people. ... The Constitution, when thus adopted, was of complete obligation, and bound the State sovereignties.\\") and Texas v. White, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 700 (1869) (the union was \\"more than a compact\\"). The people made the federal government superior to the states in certain ways. Under the Supremacy Clause of Article VI, the Constitution and federal laws made in pursuance thereof are \\"the supreme law of the land ... any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.\\"The Supremacy Clause provides: \\"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\\" The courts have held that federal laws are therefore superior to state laws and cannot be negated by the states. Federal laws are valid and are controlling, so long as those laws were adopted in pursuance of‚Äîthat is, consistent with‚Äîthe Constitution. Determining whether a federal law is consistent with the Constitution requires interpretation of the law, which is inherently a judicial function. The federal judicial power granted by Article III of the Constitution gives the federal courts authority over all cases \\"arising under this Constitution [or] the laws of the United States\\".Article III provides that \\"The judicial power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties\\", and that \\"the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction\\" in such cases. The federal courts therefore have been given the power to determine whether federal laws are consistent with the Constitution, with the Supreme Court having final authority.See Marbury v. Madison, 5 US (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). Thus, the federal courts have held that under the Constitution, federal law is controlling over state law, and the final power to determine whether federal laws are unconstitutional has been delegated to the federal courts. The courts therefore have held that the states do not have the power to nullify federal law.See Ableman v. Booth, 62 U.S. 506 (1859), Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1 (1958). =The Constitutional Convention and state ratifying conventions= The concept of nullification of federal law by the states was not discussed at the Constitutional Convention.According to a leading historian of the Constitutional Convention, nullification and the related concept of secession \\"were probably not even seriously considered at that time; there certainly is no record of their being mentioned in the convention\\". The records of the Constitutional Convention therefore do not provide support for the theory of nullification. On the other hand, the records of the Convention support the idea that the power to declare federal laws unconstitutional lies in the federal courts. At least fifteen Constitutional Convention delegates from nine states spoke about the power of the federal courts to declare federal laws unconstitutional. For example, George Mason said that under the Constitution, federal judges \\"could declare an unconstitutional law void\\". James Madison said: \\"A law violating a constitution established by the people themselves, would be considered by the Judges as null & void.\\"Ibid., p. 93. Elbridge Gerry said that the power of federal judges to interpret federal laws includes \\"a power of deciding on their constitutionality\\".Ibid., p. 97. See Prakash, Saikrishna, and Yoo, John, \\"The Origins of Judicial Review\\", 70 U. Chicago Law Review 887, 941-43, 952 (2003), which describes a number of statements in the Convention recognizing that the federal courts would have the power to declare laws unconstitutional. See also Judicial review in the United States. Several of the Convention delegates said that the federal courts would have power to determine disputes between the federal government and the states. Charles Pinckney referred to federal judges as \\"Umpires between the U. States and the individual States\\". John Rutledge indicated that the Supreme Court would \\"judge between the U.S. and particular states\\".Ibid., p. 428 These statements indicated that the Supreme Court would have final authority in constitutional disputes between the federal government and the states. The records of the state ratifying conventions do not include any assertions that the states would have the power to nullify federal laws. It has been argued that certain statements in the Virginia ratifying convention, although not asserting a right of nullification, articulated a basis for the compact theory. Edmund Randolph and George Nicholas stated that Virginia's ratification of the Constitution would constitute its agreement to a contract, and that if Virginia were to state its understanding at the time of ratification that the federal government could exercise only its delegated powers, this understanding would become part of the contract and would be binding on the federal government.Randolph said, \\"we should be at liberty to consider as a violation of the Constitution every exercise of a power not expressly delegated therein.\\" Nicholas said Virginia would be \\"exonerated\\" if there were an attempt to impose a \\"supplementary condition\\". These statements implied a belief that Virginia, as a party to the contract, would have a right to judge the constitutional limits of federal power.See Gutzman, Kevin, \\"Edmund Randolph and Virginia Constitutionalism\\", 66 Review of Politics 469 (2004). Virginia's final ratification resolution stated: \\"[T]hat the powers granted under the Constitution, being derived from the people of the United States, be resumed by them whensoever the same shall be perverted to their injury or oppression, and that every power, not granted thereby, remains with them, and at their will.\\" The records of the state ratifying conventions include over three dozen statements in more than half the states asserting that the federal courts would have the power to declare laws unconstitutional.Prakash and Yoo, \\"The Origins of Judicial Review\\", 70 U. of Chicago Law Review at p. 965. See also Judicial review in the United States. For example, Luther Martin's letter to the Maryland ratifying convention asserted that the power to declare laws unconstitutional could be exercised solely by the federal courts, and that the states would be bound by federal court decisions: \\"Whether, therefore, any laws or regulations of the Congress, any acts of its President or other officers, are contrary to, or not warranted by, the Constitution, rests only with the judges, who are appointed by Congress, to determine; by whose determinations every state must be bound.\\" John Marshall said in the Virginia convention that protection against infringement of the Constitution would be provided by the federal courts: \\"If [Congress] were to make a law not warranted by any of the powers enumerated, it would be considered by the [federal] judges as an infringement of the Constitution which they are to guard. ... They would declare it void. ... To what quarter will you look for protection from an infringement on the Constitution, if you will not give the power to the judiciary? There is no other body that can afford such a protection.\\" A number of other delegates spoke about the power of the federal courts to declare laws unconstitutional. For example, Oliver Ellsworth stated in the Connecticut convention: \\"This Constitution defines the extent of the powers of the general government. If the general legislature should at any time overleap their limits, the judicial department is a constitutional check. If the United States go beyond their powers, if they make a law which the Constitution does not authorize, it is void; and the judicial power, the national judges, who, to secure their impartiality, are to be made independent, will declare it to be void.\\" In short, there were no statements in the Constitutional Convention or the state ratifying conventions asserting that the states would have the power to nullify federal laws. On the other hand, the records of these conventions support the idea that the power to declare federal laws unconstitutional lies in the federal courts.\\"The evidence from the Constitutional Convention and from the state ratification conventions is overwhelming that the original public meaning of the term 'judicial power' [in Article III of the Constitution] included the power to nullify unconstitutional laws.\\" Barnett, Randy, \\"The Original Meaning of Judicial Power,\\" 12 Supreme Court Economic Review 115, 138 (2004). =The Federalist Papers= The Federalist Papers do not say that the states have the power to nullify federal law. On the contrary, they say that the power to declare laws unconstitutional concerning is delegated to federal courts, not the states. Federalist No. 33 states that federal laws are supreme over the states, so long as those laws are within the federal government's delegated powers.\\"If a number of political societies [i.e. the states] enter into a larger political society [i.e. the federal government], the laws which the latter may enact, pursuant to the powers intrusted to it by its constitution, must necessarily be supreme over those societies ...\\" Federalist No. 33 Federalist No. 39 directly addresses the question of who is to decide whether the federal government has exceeded its delegated powers and has infringed on the states' reserved powers. It explains that under the Constitution, this issue is to be decided by the Supreme Court, not the states: \\"[The federal government's] jurisdiction extends to certain enumerated objects only, and leaves to the several States a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects. It is true that in controversies relating to the boundary between the two jurisdictions, the tribunal which is ultimately to decide, is to be established under the general [i.e. federal] government. ... Some such tribunal is clearly essential to prevent an appeal to the sword and a dissolution of the compact; and that it ought to be established under the general rather than under the local governments, or, to speak more properly, that it could be safely established under the first alone, is a position not likely to be combated.\\" Federalist No. 44 discusses the role of the states in checking actions of Congress that exceed its delegated powers. According to Federalist No. 44, the role of the states is to \\"sound the alarm\\" regarding any unconstitutional exercise of power by Congress, and to assist in electing new representatives to Congress.\\"The success of the usurpation [by Congress] will depend on the executive and judiciary departments, which are to expound and give effect to the legislative acts, and in the last resort a remedy must be obtained from the people who can, by the election of more faithful representatives, annul the acts of the usurpers. ... [T]he state legislatures ... will be ever ready to mark the innovation, to sound the alarm to the people, and to exert their local influence in effecting a change of federal representatives.\\" Federalist No. 44 Federalist No. 44 does not imply that the states have the power to legally nullify federal law, although this would have been an appropriate context in which to mention it if such a power were thought to exist. Federalist No. 78 says that the federal courts have the power \\"to pronounce legislative acts void, because contrary to the Constitution\\".\\"The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute.\\" Federalist No. 78 Federalist No. 80 asserts that the final authority to interpret the Constitution and federal law lies in the federal courts, not the states, because of the need for uniformity.\\"The mere necessity of uniformity in the interpretation of the national laws, decides the question. Thirteen independent courts of final jurisdiction over the same causes, arising upon the same laws, is a hydra in government, from which nothing but contradiction and confusion can proceed.\\" Federalist No. 80. Likewise, Federalist No. 22 says that the federal courts should interpret federal law due to the need for uniformity.\\"Laws are a dead letter without courts to expound and define their true meaning and operation. ... To produce uniformity in these determinations, they ought to be submitted, in the last resort, to one SUPREME TRIBUNAL. ... If there is in each State a court of final jurisdiction, there may be as many different final determinations on the same point as there are courts. ... To avoid the confusion which would unavoidably result from the contradictory decisions of a number of independent judicatories, all nations have found it necessary to establish one court paramount to the rest, possessing a general superintendence, and authorized to settle and declare in the last resort a uniform rule of civil justice.\\" Federalist No. 22 Federalist No. 82 says that because of the need for uniformity and the federal government's need to effectively enforce its laws, the Constitution gives the Supreme Court the power to review decisions of state courts in cases arising under the Constitution or federal law. The Federalist Papers therefore indicate that the power to declare federal laws unconstitutional lies in the federal courts, not in the states. The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions The earliest assertion of the theories of nullification and interposition is found in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798, which were a protest against the Alien and Sedition Acts. In these resolutions, authors Thomas Jefferson and James Madison argued that \\"the states\\" have the right to interpret the Constitution and can declare federal laws unconstitutional when the federal government exceeds its delegated powers. These resolutions are considered the foundational documents of the theories of nullification and interposition. The Kentucky Resolutions of 1798, written by Jefferson, asserted that the states formed the Constitution as a compact, delegating certain specified powers to the federal government and reserving all other powers to themselves. Each state, as a party to the compact, has a \\"right to judge for itself\\" the extent of the federal government's powers. When the federal government acts beyond the scope of its delegated powers, a state may determine that the federal government's \\"acts are unauthoritative, void, and of no force\\".\\"That the several states composing the United States of America ... by compact, under the style and title of a Constitution for the United States ... constituted a general government for special purposes, delegated to that government certain definite powers, reserving, each state to itself, the residuary mass of right to their own self-government; and that whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers, its acts are unauthoritative, void, and of no force; ... that, as in all other cases of compact among powers having no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress.\\" Kentucky Resolutions of 1798. The Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 called on the other states to join Kentucky \\"in declaring these acts void and of no force\\" and \\"in requesting their repeal at the next session of Congress\\". The Kentucky Resolutions of 1799 added the assertion that when a federal law is unconstitutional, the remedy is \\"nullification\\" of the law by \\"the several states\\".\\"[T]he several states who formed [the Constitution], being sovereign and independent, have the unquestionable right to judge of its infraction; and, ... a nullification, by those sovereignties, of all unauthorized acts done under color of that instrument, is the rightful remedy.\\" Kentucky Resolutions of 1799. The Kentucky Resolutions of 1799 did not assert that Kentucky would unilaterally refuse to enforce, or prevent enforcement of, the Alien and Sedition Acts. Rather, these resolutions declared that Kentucky \\"will bow to the laws of the Union\\" but would continue \\"to oppose in a constitutional manner\\" the Alien and Sedition Acts. The resolutions stated that Kentucky was entering its \\"solemn protest\\" against those Acts. The author of the Kentucky Resolutions of 1799 is not known with certainty.See Powell, H. Jefferson, \\"The Principles of '98: An Essay in Historical Retrieval\\", 80 Virginia Law Review 689, 705 n.54 (1994). The Virginia Resolutions of 1798, written by Madison, did not mention nullification. Rather, they introduced the idea of \\"interposition\\". The Virginia Resolutions asserted that when the federal government engages in \\"a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise\\" of powers not granted by the Constitution, \\"the states, who are parties thereto, have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining, within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties, appertaining to them\\".Virginia Resolutions of 1798. The Virginia Resolutions did not explain what form this \\"interposition\\" might take. The Virginia Resolutions appealed to the other states for agreement and cooperation in opposing the Alien and Sedition Acts. The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions did not attempt to prohibit enforcement of the Alien and Sedition Acts within the borders of those states. Rather, these resolutions declared that the legislatures of these states viewed the Alien and Sedition Acts as unconstitutional, called for the repeal of these Acts, and requested the support and cooperation of the other states. The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions were not accepted by any of the other states. Rather, ten states rejected the Resolutions, with seven states formally transmitting their rejections to Kentucky and VirginiaThe seven states that transmitted rejections were Delaware, Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Vermont. See and three other states passing resolutions expressing disapproval.According to Maloy, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey passed resolutions that disapproved the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions, but did not transmit formal responses to Kentucky and Virginia. The remaining four states (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee) did not respond to the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions. At least six states responded to the Resolutions by taking the position that the constitutionality of acts of Congress is a question for the federal courts, not the state legislatures. For example, Vermont's resolution stated: \\"That the General Assembly of the state of Vermont do highly disapprove of the resolutions of the General Assembly of Virginia, as being unconstitutional in their nature, and dangerous in their tendency. It belongs not to state legislatures to decide on the constitutionality of laws made by the general government; this power being exclusively vested in the judiciary courts of the Union.\\" Aside from Vermont, the other states taking the position that the constitutionality of federal laws is a question for the federal courts, not the states, were New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania. The Governor of Delaware and a committee of the Maryland legislature also took this position. Virginia responded to the criticism of the other states by issuing the Report of 1800, written by Madison. The Report of 1800 affirmed and defended the Virginia Resolutions. The Report of 1800 also said that a declaration of unconstitutionality by the states would be only an expression of opinion designed to spur debate, rather than having the authoritative effect of a federal court decision.\\"The declarations, in such cases, are expressions of opinion, unaccompanied with any other effect than what they may produce on opinion, by exciting reflection. The expositions of the judiciary, on the other hand, are carried into immediate effect by force.\\" Report of 1800 During the Nullification Crisis of the 1830s, Madison denounced as unconstitutional the concept of nullification of federal law by a state.Madison, James \\"Letter to Mathew Carey\\", Library of Congress, July 27, 1831.Madison, James \\"Letter to Nicholas P. Trist\\", Library of Congress, December, 1831.Madison, James \\"Letter to Nicholas P. Trist\\", Library of Congress, December 23, 1832. Madison wrote, \\"But it follows, from no view of the subject, that a nullification of a law of the U.S. can as is now contended, belong rightfully to a single State, as one of the parties to the Constitution; the State not ceasing to avow its adherence to the Constitution. A plainer contradiction in terms, or a more fatal inlet to anarchy, cannot be imagined.\\"Madison, James \\"Notes, On Nullification\\", Library of Congress, December, 1834. Nullification attempts in the 19th century =The Peters case= The Supreme Court first dealt with nullification in 1809 in the case of United States v. Peters, 9 U.S. (5 Cranch) 115 (1809).United States v. Peters, 9 U.S. (5 Cranch) 115 (1809). The Peters case sometimes is called the Olmstead case, after one of the parties. The case involved the entitlement to the prize money for a captured ship. The Court rejected the idea of nullification. The Pennsylvania legislature had passed an act purporting to nullify a federal court's decision. The Pennsylvania statute stated that the federal court had acted unconstitutionally because it did not have jurisdiction, and that the federal court's judgment \\"was null and void\\". The Supreme Court held that the Pennsylvania legislature did not have the power to nullify the federal court's judgment, stating: \\"If the legislatures of the several States may, at will, annul the judgments of the courts of the United States, and destroy the rights acquired under those judgments, the Constitution itself becomes a solemn mockery, and the nation is deprived of the means of enforcing its laws by the instrumentality of its own tribunals.\\" In response, the Governor of Pennsylvania called out the state militia to prevent enforcement of the Supreme Court's judgment. However, the U.S. Marshal summoned a posse, carried out the Supreme Court's order, and arrested the leaders of the state militia. The Pennsylvania legislature passed a resolution declaring the action of the Supreme Court unconstitutional, invoking states' rights, and appealing to the other states for support.Pennsylvania's resolution said that \\"as guardians of the State rights, [the state legislature] can not permit an infringement of those rights by an unconstitutional exercise of power in the United States' courts.\\" The resolution denied the power of \\"the United States' courts to decide on state rights\\". The resolution proposed creating a new tribunal to decide disputes between the federal government and the states regarding the limits of federal authority. Resolution of the Pennsylvania Legislature, April 3, 1809. Eleven states responded by disapproving Pennsylvania's attempted nullification. No state supported Pennsylvania.The Virginia General Assembly passed a resolution rejecting Pennsylvania's position and asserting that the Supreme Court is the tribunal provided by the Constitution to decide disputes between the state and federal judiciary. Acts of General Assembly of Virginia, 1809‚Äì10, p. 102. The Governor of Pennsylvania made a plea to President James Madison to intervene, but Madison affirmed the authority of the Supreme Court. The Pennsylvania legislature backed down and withdrew the militia.A Pennsylvania court later acknowledged the jurisdiction of the federal courts in this matter. Chief Justice Tilghman wrote: \\"[T]he State of Pennsylvania, having ratified the present constitution, did thereby virtually invest the courts of the United States with power to decide this controversy.\\" Olmsted's Case, 1 Brightley 9 (Pa. Nisi Prius 1809). Thus, Pennsylvania's attempt to nullify the federal court judgment failed.These events are described in an article by Justice William O. Douglas, Interposition and the Peters Case, 1778‚Äì1809, 9 Stanford L. Rev. 3 (1956), and in Treacy, Kenneth, The Olmstead Case, 1778‚Äì1809, 10 Western Political Quarterly 675 (1957). =New England's protests against federal authority= Several New England states objected to the Embargo Act of 1807, which restricted foreign trade. The Massachusetts legislature passed a resolution stating that the embargo \\"is, in the opinion of the legislature, in many respects, unjust, oppressive and unconstitutional, and not legally binding on the citizens of this state\\". The Massachusetts resolution did not purport to nullify the Embargo Act, but instead stated that \\"the judicial courts are competent to decide this question, and to them every citizen, when aggrieved, ought to apply for redress\\". Massachusetts called on Congress to repeal the act, and proposed several constitutional amendments. Connecticut passed a resolution declaring that the act was unconstitutional and declaring that state officials would not \\"assist, or concur in giving effect to the aforesaid unconstitutional act\\". Connecticut joined in the call for constitutional amendments. Neither Massachusetts nor Connecticut attempted to ban enforcement of the act within the state. A federal district court ruled in 1808 that the Embargo Act was constitutional.U.S. v. The William, 28 Fed. Cas. 614 (D. Mass. 1808). Congress repealed the Embargo Act in 1809 because it had been ineffective in achieving its goal of bringing economic pressure on England and France. Neither state attempted to block enforcement of the Embargo Act, so nullification did not come to a legal test. The War of 1812 was harmful to New England's commercial interests and was unpopular in New England. The New England states objected to putting their state militias under federal control, arguing that the Constitution did not give the federal government authority over state militias in those circumstances. There was some discussion in New England about making a separate peace with Britain or even seceding from the Union. At the Hartford Convention of 1814, delegates from several New England states met to discuss their disagreements with the federal government's policies. The final report and resolutions from the Hartford Convention asserted that \\"acts of Congress in violation of the Constitution are absolutely void\\" and asserted the right of a state \\"to interpose its authority\\" to protect against unconstitutional government action. The final resolutions did not attempt to ban enforcement of any act of Congress. Rather, the resolutions recommended to state legislatures that they protect their citizens from unconstitutional federal action, called on the federal government to fund the defense of New England, and proposed a series of amendments to the Constitution.Report and Resolutions of the Hartford Convention, January 4, 1815. No state legislature followed up by attempting to nullify a federal act. The end of the war made the issue moot. =Virginia's opposition to Supreme Court review= In 1813, the Supreme Court reversed a decision of the Virginia Court of Appeals, basing its decision on the terms of a federal treaty.Fairfax's Devisee v. Hunter's Lessee, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 603 (1813). The Virginia Court of Appeals refused to accept the Supreme Court's decision, stating that under the Constitution, the Supreme Court did not have authority over state courts. The Virginia court held that as a matter of state sovereignty, its decisions were final and could not be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Virginia court found unconstitutional the federal statute providing for Supreme Court review of state court judgments. This decision would have allowed each state's courts to decide for themselves whether federal actions were unconstitutional, effectively giving state courts the right to nullify federal law. In Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304 (1816), the Supreme Court rejected this view. The Supreme Court held that Article III of the Constitution gives the federal courts jurisdiction in all cases arising under the Constitution or federal law, and gives the Supreme Court final authority in such cases. The Supreme Court stated that the people, by providing in the Constitution that the Supreme Court has final authority in such cases, had chosen to limit the sovereignty of the states. The Supreme Court therefore found that the federal courts, not the states, have the final power to interpret the Constitution. Virginia again challenged the Supreme Court's authority in Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264 (1821). The question was whether the Supreme Court had authority to hear an appeal in a criminal case decided by a state court based on violation of a state law, where the defense was based on federal law. The Virginia legislature passed resolutions declaring that the Supreme Court had no authority over it due to principles of state sovereignty.The Virginia General Assembly resolved \\"That the Supreme Court of the United States have no rightful authority under the Constitution to examine and correct the judgment\\" in the Cohens case. Acts of Virginia 1820-21, 142, 143. See The Supreme Court held that under Article III of the Constitution, the federal courts have jurisdiction over all cases involving the Constitution or federal law, including state cases in which a federal defense arises. Because the defendants in the case claimed that their actions were authorized by a federal statute, there was a disputed issue of federal law and the Supreme Court had authority to review the state court's judgment. Thus, the Supreme Court again found that the final power to interpret federal law lies in the federal courts, not the states. These two cases established the principle that the federal courts, not the states, have the final power to interpret the Constitution and to determine the Constitutional limits of federal power. These cases rejected the state's attempt to determine the limits of federal power. =Ohio and the Bank of the United States= In 1819, Ohio imposed a tax on the federally chartered Bank of the United States. The Supreme Court already had ruled that such taxes were unconstitutional in McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819). Despite the Supreme Court's decision, Ohio seized $100,000 from the Bank to satisfy the tax. O resolutions declaring that it did not accept the result of the McCulloch case and denying that the Supreme Court had the final authority to interpret the Constitution. The Ohio legislature's resolutions, relying on the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, asserted that the states \\"have an equal right to interpret that Constitution for themselves\\". The resolutions declared that Ohio had the legal power to tax the Bank.The Ohio resolutions were transmitted to Congress and reported in Annals of Congress, 16th Congress, 2d session, pp. 1694, 1714 The controversy eventually reached the Supreme Court in Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 738 (1824). The Supreme Court held that Ohio's tax on the Bank was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court stated: \\"[T]he act of the State of Ohio ... is repugnant to a law of the United States, made in pursuance of the Constitution, and therefore void.\\" The Supreme Court thus rejected Ohio's attempt to nullify federal law. =Georgia and the Cherokees= In the 1820s, Georgia passed an act making Georgia state law applicable on all Cherokee lands and declaring all laws of the Cherokee nation void. This contradicted federal treaties with the Cherokees, effectively nullifying those federal treaties. Georgia's actions were reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515 (1832). While the case was pending in the Supreme Court, the Georgia legislature passed a resolution asserting that under the Tenth Amendment, the federal government had no jurisdiction over Georgia criminal law and the Supreme Court's review of the case was unconstitutional.\\"Resolved ... that any attempt to reverse the decision of the superior court of Gwinnett county, in the case of Samuel A. Worcester and Elizur Butler, by the supreme court of the United States, will be held by this state, as an unconstitutional and arbitrary interference in the administration of her criminal laws, and will be treated as such.\\" Acts of Georgia, 1831, 259‚Äì261; Niles' Weekly Register, XLI, 335, 336. The Supreme Court rejected Georgia's attempt to nullify the federal treaties with the Cherokees. The Court held that \\"according to the settled principles of our Constitution\\", authority over Indian affairs is \\"committed exclusively to the government of the Union\\". The Court held that under the federal treaties with the Cherokees, \\"the laws of Georgia can have no force\\" on Cherokee land. The Court held that Georgia's laws regulating Cherokee land were \\"void, as being repugnant to the constitution, treaties, and laws of the United States\\".Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515, 561-62 (1832). The case involved the conviction of two missionaries under a Georgia law restricting their presence on Cherokee land. The Supreme Court thus asserted final authority to interpret the Constitution and federal treaties, rejecting Georgia's nullification attempt. Georgia refused to accept the Supreme Court's decision. President Andrew Jackson did not believe Georgia had the right to nullify federal law, but was sympathetic to Georgia's goal of forcing the Cherokees to relocate to the west. He took no immediate action against Georgia. Before the Supreme Court could hear a request for an order enforcing its judgment, the Nullification Crisis arose in South Carolina. Jackson wanted to avoid a confrontation with Georgia over states' rights. A compromise was brokered under which Georgia repealed the law at issue in Worcester. Despite the Court's decision finding Georgia's actions unconstitutional, Georgia continued to enforce other laws regulating the Cherokees. Ultimately the Cherokees were forced to agree to a treaty of relocation, leading to the Trail of Tears. =The nullification crisis= The idea of nullification increasingly became associated with matters pertaining to the sectional conflict and slavery. The best known statement of the theory of nullification during this period, authored by John C. Calhoun, was the South Carolina Exposition and Protest of 1828. Calhoun asserted that the Tariff of 1828, which favored the northern manufacturing states and harmed the southern agricultural states, was unconstitutional. Calhoun argued that each state, as \\"an essential attribute of sovereignty\\", has the right to judge the extent of its own powers and the allocation of power between the state and the federal government. Calhoun argued that each state therefore necessarily has a \\"veto\\", or a \\"right of interposition\\", with respect to acts of the federal government that the state believes encroach on its rights.Calhoun wrote: \\"If it be conceded ... that the sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, ... it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself ... [T]he existence of the right of judging of their powers, so clearly established from the sovereignty of States, as clearly implies a veto or control, within its limits, on the action of the General Government, on contested points of authority ... To the States respectively each in its sovereign capacity is reserved the power, by its veto, or right of interposition, to arrest the encroachment.\\" South Carolina Exposition and Protest, 1828. In the Webster‚ÄìHayne debate in the Senate in 1830, Daniel Webster responded to this nullification theory by arguing that the Constitution itself provides for the resolution of disputes between the federal government and the states regarding allocation of powers. Webster argued that the Supremacy Clause provides that the Constitution and federal laws enacted pursuant thereto are superior to state law, and that Article III gives to the federal judiciary the power to resolve all issues relating to interpretation of the Constitution. Under the Constitution, the federal courts therefore have the last word, said Webster. Webster said that the Constitution does not give the states a power of constitutional interpretation, and that any such power would result in as many conflicting interpretations of the Constitution as there are states.Webster said: \\"[T]he people have wisely provided, in the Constitution itself, a proper, suitable mode and tribunal for settling questions of constitutional law ... by declaring, Sir, that 'the Constitution, and the laws of the United States made in pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme law of the land, any thing in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.' ... No State law is to be valid which comes in conflict with the Constitution, or any law of the United States passed in pursuance of it. But who shall decide this question of interference? To whom lies the last appeal? This, Sir, the Constitution itself decides also, by declaring, 'that the judicial power shall extend to all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.' These two provisions cover the whole ground. They are, in truth, the keystone of the arch! With these it is a government; without them it is a confederation. ... [H]ow is it that a State legislature acquires any power to interfere? ... [C]ould any thing have been more preposterous, than to make a government for the whole Union, and yet leave its powers subject, not to one interpretation, but to thirteen or twenty-four interpretations?\\" Webster's Second Reply to Hayne, January 26, 1830 Therefore, said Webster, under the Constitution, the states do not have the power to nullify federal laws. In 1832, South Carolina undertook to nullify the Tariff of 1828 and the Tariff of 1832, as well as a subsequent federal act authorizing the use of force to enforce the tariffs. South Carolina purported to prohibit enforcement of these tariff acts within the state, asserting that these acts \\"are unauthorized by the constitution of the United States, and violate the true meaning and intent thereof and are null, void, and no law, nor binding upon this State, its officers or citizens\\".South Carolina Ordinance of Nullification, 1832 President Andrew Jackson denied that South Carolina had the power to nullify federal statutes, and prepared to enforce federal law forcibly if necessary. In his Proclamation to the People of South Carolina, Jackson said: \\"I consider, then, the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which It was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.\\"President Jackson's Proclamation Regarding Nullification, December 10, 1832. No other state supported South Carolina. James Madison, author of the Virginia Resolution, also weighed in at this time, stating that the Virginia Resolution should not be interpreted to mean that each state has the right to nullify federal law. The issue was made moot by an enactment of a compromise tariff bill. While the nullification crisis arose over a tariff law, it was recognized that the issues at stake had application to the slavery question as well.Calhoun wrote in a letter in 1830: \\"I consider the tariff act as the occasion, rather than the real cause of the present unhappy state of things. The truth can no longer be disguised, that the peculiar domestick institution of the Southern States [i.e. slavery] and the consequent direction which that and her soil and climate have given to her industry, has placed them in regard to taxation and appropriations in opposite relation to the majority of the Union, against the danger of which, if there be no protective power in the reserved rights of the states they must in the end be forced to rebel, or, submit it to have their paramount interests sacrificed, their domestick institutions subordinated by Colonization and other schemes, and themselves and children reduced to wretchedness. Thus situated, the denial of the right to the State to interpose constitutionally in the last resort, more alarms the thinking, than all the other causes.\\" Letter, John C. Calhoun to Virgil Maxcy, Sept. 11, 1830. =Nullification attempts and the Fugitive Slave Laws= Northern states in the mid-19th century attempted to block enforcement of the pro-slavery federal Fugitive Slave Acts of 1793 and 1850. Several northern states passed personal liberty laws that had the practical effect of undermining the effectiveness of the federal fugitive slave statutes and preventing slave owners from recovering runaways. For example, a Pennsylvania law enacted in 1826 made it a crime for any person to forcibly remove a black person from the state with the intention of keeping or selling him as a slave. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the validity of the federal Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 in the case of Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 41 U.S. 539 (1842). The Court rejected Pennsylvania's argument that Congress had no constitutional authority to enact the Fugitive Slave Act, finding that the Act was authorized by the Constitution's fugitive slave clause (Article IV, Section 2). The Court found that Pennsylvania's personal liberty law was unconstitutional because it conflicted with the Constitution's fugitive slave clause.\\"The act of Pennsylvania upon which this indictment is founded is unconstitutional and void. It purports to punish as a public offense against that State the very act of seizing and removing a slave by his master which the Constitution of the United States was designed to justify and uphold.\\" Prigg, 41 U.S. at 625‚Äì26. The Court thus rejected Pennsylvania's attempt to nullify the Fugitive Slave Act. However, the Supreme Court implied that states might be able to pass laws denying the assistance of state officials in enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act, leaving enforcement to federal officials.The Supreme Court said that \\"the States cannot, therefore, be compelled to enforce\\" the Fugitive Slave Act. Prigg, 41 U.S. at 615.Justice John McLean, writing in concurrence, stated: \\"Where the Constitution imposes a positive duty on a State or its officers to surrender fugitives, Congress may prescribe the mode of proof and the duty of the state officers. This power may be resisted by a State, and there is no means of coercing it. In this view, the power may be considered an important one. So, the supreme court of a State may refuse to certify its record on a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the Union under the 25th section of the Judiciary Act.\\" http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2013/08/25/a-supreme-court-justices- affirmation-of-nullification/ The Supreme Court again dealt with a northern challenge to the federal fugitive slave statutes in the case of Ableman v. Booth, 62 U.S. 506 (1859). The courts of Wisconsin held the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 unconstitutional and ordered the release of a prisoner who was prosecuted in federal district court for violation of the Act. The Wisconsin court declared that the Supreme Court had no authority to review its decision. The Wisconsin legislature passed a resolution declaring that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction over the Wisconsin court's decision. In language borrowed from the Kentucky Resolution of 1798, the Wisconsin resolution asserted that the Supreme Court's review of the case was void.\\"That we regard the action of the Supreme Court of the United States, in assuming jurisdiction in the case before mentioned, as an arbitrary act of power, unauthorized by the Constitution. That this assumption of jurisdiction by the federal judiciary ... is an act of undelegated power, and therefore without authority, void, and of no force.\\" General Laws of Wisconsin, 1859, 247‚Äì248. The Supreme Court held that Wisconsin did not have the power to nullify federal law or to prevent federal officials from enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act. The Court held that in adopting the Supremacy Clause, the people of the United States had made federal law superior to state law and had provided that in the event of a conflict, federal law would control. Further, the Court found that the people had delegated the judicial power, including final appellate authority, to the federal courts with respect to cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.\\"[N]o power is more clearly conferred by the Constitution and laws of the United States than the power of this court to decide, ultimately and finally, all cases arising under such Constitution and laws.\\" Ableman, 62 U.S. at 525. Therefore, the people gave the federal courts final authority to determine the constitutionality of federal statutes and to determine the boundary between federal power and state power.The Court held that the Constitution grants \\"final appellate power\\" to the Supreme Court to decide \\"controversies as to the respective powers of the United States and the States\\". Ableman, 62 U.S. at 520. Accordingly, the Court held that the Wisconsin court did not have the power to nullify a federal statute that had been upheld by the federal courts or to interfere with federal enforcement of that statute. Ableman v. Booth was the Supreme Court's most thorough examination yet of the theory of nullification. Like the decisions that preceded it, Ableman found that federal law was superior to state law, and that under the Constitution, the final power to determine the constitutionality of federal laws lies in the federal courts, not the states. Ableman found that the Constitution gave the Supreme Court final authority to determine the extent and limits of federal power and that the states therefore do not have the power to nullify federal law. The Civil War put an end to most nullification attempts. Nullification relied on principles of states' rights that were viewed as no longer viable after the Civil War.\\"The Civil War terminated the possibility of states serving as constitutional guardians.\\" Farber, Daniel A., \\"Judicial Review and its Alternatives: An American Tale\\", 38 Wake Forest L. Rev. 415, 415, 444 (2003).In Jefferson Davis farewell address to the Senate in 1861, he argued that there was a difference between the theories of nullification and secession. \\"I hope none who hear me will confound this expression of mine with the advocacy of the right of a State to remain in the Union, and to disregard its constitutional obligation by the nullification of the law. Such is not my theory. Nullification and secession, so often confounded, are indeed antagonistic principles. Nullification is a remedy which it is sought to apply within the Union, and against the agent of the States. It is only to be justified when the agent has violated his constitutional obligation, and a State, assuming to judge for itself, denies the right of the agent thus to act, and appeals to the other States of the Union for a decision; but when the States themselves, and when the people of the States, have so acted as to convince us that they will not regard our constitutional rights, then, and then for the first time, arises the doctrine of secession in its practical application. ... I well remember an occasion when Massachusetts was arraigned before the bar of the Senate, and when the doctrine of coercion was rife and to be applied against her because of the rescue of a fugitive slave in Boston. My opinion then was the same that it is now. Not in a spirit of egotism, but to show that I am not influenced in my opinion because the case is my own, I refer to that time and that occasion as containing the opinion which I then entertained, and on which my present conduct is based. I then said, if Massachusetts, following her through a stated line of conduct, chose to take the last step, which separates her from the Union, it is her right to go, and I will neither vote one dollar nor one man to coerce her back; but I will say to her, God speed, in memory of the kind associations which once existed between her and the other States.\\" http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/farewell-speech/ Nullification attempts and school desegregation in the 1950s Nullification and interposition resurfaced in the 1950s as southern states attempted to preserve racial segregation in their schools. In Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the Supreme Court decided that segregated schools were unconstitutional. At least ten southern states passed nullification or interposition measures attempting to preserve segregated schools and refusing to follow the Brown decision. The advocates of these nullification and interposition measures argued that the Brown decision was an unconstitutional infringement on states' rights, and that the states had the power to prevent that decision from being enforced within their borders. The Supreme Court explicitly rejected nullification in the case of Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1 (1958). The state of Arkansas had passed several laws in an effort to prevent the integration of its schools. The Supreme Court, in its only opinion to be signed by all nine justices, held that state governments had no power to nullify the Brown decision. The Supreme Court held that the Brown decision and its implementation \\"can neither be nullified openly and directly by state legislators or state executive or judicial officers nor nullified indirectly by them through evasive schemes for segregation whether attempted 'ingeniously or ingenuously'.\\"Cooper, 358 U.S. at 17. Thus, Cooper v. Aaron directly held that states may not nullify federal law. The Supreme Court rejected interposition in a similar context. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of a federal district court that rejected Louisiana's attempt to use interposition to protect its segregated schools. The district court found that interposition by the states is inconsistent with the Constitution, which gives the power to decide constitutional issues to the Supreme Court, not the states. The court held: \\"The conclusion is clear that interposition is not a constitutional doctrine. If taken seriously, it is illegal defiance of constitutional authority. Otherwise, 'it amounted to no more than a protest, an escape valve through which the legislators blew off steam to relieve their tensions.' ... However solemn or spirited, interposition resolutions have no legal efficacy.\\" Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 188 F. Supp. 916 (E.D. La. 1960), aff'd 364 U.S. 500 (1960).The district court rejected the argument that state legislatures are free to follow their own interpretation of the Constitution in defiance of a Supreme Court decision: \\"[T]he Constitution itself established the Supreme Court of the United States as the final tribunal for constitutional adjudication.\\" Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 188 F. Supp. 916 (E.D. La. 1960), aff'd 364 U.S. 500 (1960). The Supreme Court affirmed this decision, thus holding that interposition cannot be used to negate federal law. Nullification vs. interposition In theory, nullification differs from interposition in several respects. Nullification is usually considered to be an act by a state finding a federal law unconstitutional, and declaring it void and unenforceable in that state. A nullification act often makes it illegal to enforce the federal law in question. Nullification arguably may be undertaken by a single state.Jefferson's original draft of the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 indicated that nullification may be undertaken by a single state. \\"[E]very State has a natural right in cases not within the compact, (casus non f≈ìderis) to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits.\\" Draft version of the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798, 8th resolution. However, this passage was dropped from the resolutions before they were adopted, perhaps in part because Kentucky did not want to take unilateral action. A year later, the Kentucky Resolutions of 1799 indicated that nullification may be undertaken by \\"the several states\\", apparently contemplating joint action. Later advocates of nullification, such as Calhoun, contemplated nullification by a single state. South Carolina acted alone in enacting its Ordinance of Nullification in 1832. Interposition also involves a declaration that a federal law is unconstitutional. There are various actions that a state might take to \\"interpose\\" once it has determined that a federal law is unconstitutional. In the Virginia Resolutions of 1798, Madison did not describe the form or effect of interposition. But two years later in the Report of 1800, Madison described a variety of actions that states might take to \\"interpose\\": communicating with other states about the unconstitutional federal law, attempting to enlist the support of other states, petitioning Congress to repeal the law, introducing Constitutional amendments in Congress, or calling a constitutional convention. Madison did not argue that a state could \\"interpose\\" by legally nullifying a federal law and declaring it unenforceable. Madison contemplated that interposition would be a joint action by a number of states, not an action by a single state. Interposition is considered to be less extreme than nullification because it does not involve a state's unilateral decision to prevent enforcement of federal law. In practice, nullification and interposition often have been confused, and sometimes have been used indistinguishably. John C. Calhoun indicated that these terms were interchangeable, stating: \\"This right of interposition, thus solemnly asserted by the State of Virginia, be it called what it may ‚Äì State- right, veto, nullification, or by any other name ‚Äì I conceive to be the fundamental principle of our system.\\"Calhoun, John C., The Fort Hill Address, July 26, 1831. During the fight over integration of the schools in the south in the 1950s, a number of southern states passed so-called \\"Acts of Interposition\\" that actually would have had the effect of nullification.See, for example, the Louisiana act of interposition, set out in the appendix to Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 188 F. Supp. 916 (E.D. La. 1960), aff'd 364 U.S. 500 (1960). As noted above, the courts have rejected both nullification and interposition. Nullification compared to other actions by the states States sometimes have taken various actions short of nullification in an effort to prevent enforcement of federal law. While nullification is an attempt to declare federal law unconstitutional and to forbid its enforcement within the state, some other actions by the states do not attempt to declare federal law invalid, but instead use other means in an effort to prevent or hinder enforcement of federal law.See Dinan, John, \\"Contemporary Assertions of State Sovereignty and the Safeguards of American Federalism\\", 74 Albany Law Review 1635 (2011) =State lawsuits challenging federal law= Nullification should be distinguished from the situation in which a state brings a lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of a federal law. A state may challenge the constitutionality of a federal statute by filing a lawsuit in court seeking to declare the federal law unconstitutional. Such a lawsuit is decided by the courts, with the Supreme Court having final jurisdiction. This is the accepted method of challenging the constitutionality of a federal statute.\\"To seek the federal Judiciary's determination of a constitutional issue in a controversy between a state and the federal government is the traditionally accepted means of resolving such disputes.\\" Claiborne, Robert S., \\"Why Virginia's Challenges to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Did Not Invoke Nullification\\", 46 U. Richmond Law Review 917, 949 (2012). In Federalist No. 39, James Madison wrote that the Supreme Court is \\"the tribunal which is ultimately to decide\\" controversies between the federal government and the states \\"relating to the boundary between the two jurisdictions\\". In McCulloch v. Maryland, Chief Justice John Marshall said: \\"[T]he defendant, a sovereign State, denies the obligation of a law enacted by the legislature of the Union. ... [T]he conflicting powers of the Government of the Union and of its members, as marked in [the] Constitution, are to be discussed, and an opinion given. ... [B]y this tribunal alone can the decision be made. On the Supreme Court of the United States has the Constitution of our country devolved this important duty.\\" McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819). This is not nullification, even if the courts uphold the state's position and declare the federal statute unconstitutional. The theory of nullification is that the states have the unilateral power to determine the constitutionality of federal laws, and that a state's determination of unconstitutionality cannot be reviewed or reversed by the courts. Thus, nullification involves a declaration by a state that a federal statute is unconstitutional and cannot be enforced within the state. Under the theory of nullification, such a declaration by a state is final and binding, and cannot be overruled by the courts. On the other hand, when a state files a lawsuit in court challenging the constitutionality of a federal statute, the decision on constitutionality is made by the courts and ultimately can be decided by the Supreme Court, not by the state legislature or state courts. Because such a lawsuit recognizes the authority of the Supreme Court to make the ultimate decision on constitutionality, it is not a use of nullification. =State refusals to assist in enforcement of federal law= As noted above, the Supreme Court indicated in Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 41 U.S. 539 (1842), that the states cannot be compelled to use state law enforcement resources to enforce federal law. The Supreme Court reaffirmed this principle in cases such as Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997) and New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992), which held that the federal government may not enact a regulatory program that \\"commandeers\\" the state's legislative and administrative mechanisms to enforce federal law. States therefore may refuse to use their legislative or administrative resources to enforce federal law. This should be distinguished from nullification. States that withhold their enforcement assistance, but do not declare the federal law unconstitutional or forbid its enforcement by the federal government, are not declaring federal law invalid and therefore are not engaging in nullification. As Prigg held, the federal law still is valid and federal authorities may enforce it within the state. The states in this situation, rather than attempting to legally nullify federal law, are attempting to make enforcement of federal law more difficult by refusing to make available their legislative and administrative resources.The states may not withhold the assistance of their courts in enforcing federal law because the Supremacy Clause explicitly states that \\"the judges in every state shall be bound\\" by federal laws. =State legalization of acts prohibited by federal law= Some states have legalized acts that are prohibited by federal law. For example, several states have legalized recreational marijuana use under state law. An act's legality under state law does not affect its legality under federal law. An act may be legal under state law and, at the same time, illegal under federal law. The states that have legalized marijuana use have not attempted to declare that federal marijuana laws are invalid or unenforceable. Rather, federal marijuana laws still are valid and enforceable even in states that have made marijuana legal under state law. Thus, these states have not attempted to nullify federal law.Dinan, \\"Contemporary Assertions of State Sovereignty and the Safeguards of American Federalism\\", 74 Albany Law Review at 1637-38, 1665 (\\"these recent state measures regarding... medicinal marijuana fall short of invoking the clearly discredited doctrine of nullification embodied in the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798, the resolutions of several New England states in response to the Embargo of 1807, the South Carolina Nullification Ordinance of 1832, Wisconsin's nullification of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1859, and interposition acts adopted by eight southern states in 1956 and 1957 in response to the Supreme Court's school desegregation rulings. ... [T]hey partake of something short of, and other than, nullification.\\") However, for practical purposes, the federal government lacks the resources to enforce its marijuana laws on a large scale and so the legalization of marijuana under state law significantly reduces the ability of the federal government to enforce the marijuana laws. Both that and the US Attorney General's statement that the federal government will not intervene if following certain guidelines laid down by the attorney general make marijuana de facto and de jure legal at the state level and de facto legal but de jure illegal on the federal level.

The triad was first proposed by psychiatrist J. M. Macdonald in \\"The Threat to Kill\\", a 1963 article in the American Journal of Psychiatry. Small-scale studies conducted by psychiatrists Daniel Hellman and Nathan Blackman, and then FBI agents John E. Douglas and Robert K. Ressler along with Dr. Ann Burgess, claimed substantial evidence for the association of these childhood patterns with later predatory behavior. Although it remains an influential and widely taught theory, subsequent research has generally not validated this line of thinking.Criminal & Behavioral Profiling. . Curt R. Bartol, Anne M. Bartol, 2013, Sample Materials: Chapter 2: Crime Scene Profiling. SAGE Publications, Inc.Childhood firesetting, enuresis and cruelty to animals as cultural lore. Published on May 2, 2012 by Karen Franklin, Ph.D. The triad links cruelty to animals, obsession with fire-setting, and persistent bedwetting past a certain age, to violent behaviors, particularly homicidal behavior and sexually predatory behavior. However, other studies claim to have not found statistically significant links between the triad and violent offenders. Further studies have suggested that these behaviors are actually more linked to childhood experience of parental neglect, brutality or abuse. Some argue this in turn results in \\"homicidal proneness\\". The \\"triad\\" concept as a particular combination of behaviors linked to violence may not have any particular validity ‚Äì it has been called an urban legend.Skrapec, C. and Ryan, K., 2010-11-16, \\"The Macdonald Triad: Persistence of an Urban Legend\\". Paper presented at the annual meeting of the ASC Annual Meeting, San Francisco Marriott, San Francisco, California. Arson In Singer and Hensley (2004), arson, or fire-setting, is theorized to be a less severe or first shot at releasing aggression. Extensive periods of humiliation have been found to be present in the childhoods of several adult serial killers. These repetitive episodes of humiliation can lead to feelings of frustration and anger, which need to somehow be released in order to return to a normal state of self- worth. However, the triad combination has been questioned in this regard also, and a review has suggested that this behavior is just one that can occur in the context of childhood antisocial behavior and isn't necessarily predictive of later violence.Firesetting as a predictor of violence. Bushfire arson bulletin no. 36 ISSN 1832-2743 Canberra: Australian Institute of Criminology, September 2006. Cruelty to animals FBI special agent Alan Brantly believed that some offenders kill animals as a rehearsal for killing human victims.Barnard, N. D., Hogan, A. R. (1999 June 6). Moving up the chain of abuse pattern shows cruelty to animals is one predictor of violent behavior in adults. Seattle Post-Intelligencer, p. C.1. Cruelty to animals is mainly used to vent frustration and anger the same way firesetting is. Extensive amounts of humiliation were also found in the childhoods of children who engaged in acts of cruelty to animals. During childhood, serial killers could not retaliate towards those who caused them humiliation, so they chose animals because they were viewed as weak and vulnerable. Future victim selection is already in the process at a young age. Studies have found that those who engaged in childhood acts of cruelty to animals used the same method of killing on their human victims as they did on their animal victims. Wright and Hensley (2003) named three recurring themes in their study of five cases of serial murderers: As children, they vented their frustrations because the person causing them anger or humiliation was too powerful to take down; they felt as if they regained some control and power over their lives through the torture and killing of the animals; they gained the power and control they needed to cause pain and suffering of a weaker, more vulnerable animal ‚Äì escalating to humans in the future. In a study of 45 male prison inmates who were deemed violent offenders, McClellan (2003) found that 56% admitted to having committed acts of violence against animals. It was also found that children who abused animals were more often the victims of parental abuse than children who did not abuse animals.McClellan, J. (2007). Animal cruelty and violent behavior: Is there a connection? Journal of Security Education. 2. In a 2004 study, which considered not one-off events but patterns of repeat violence, Tallichet and Hensley found a link between repeated animal cruelty and violence against humans. They examined prisoners in maximum or medium security prisons. However, over-generalizing possible links between animal violence and human violence can have unwanted consequences such as detracting focus from other possible predictors or causes. Enuresis Enuresis is \\"unintentional bed-wetting during sleep, persistent after the age of five\\".Serial Murderers and Their Victims. (E. W. Hickey). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Cengage Learning (2009) (page 101). The bed-wetting must continue twice a week for at least three consecutive months. Some authors continue to speculate that enuresis may be related to firesetting and animal cruelty in some way. One argument is that because persistent bed-wetting beyond the age of five can be humiliating for a child, especially if he or she is belittled by a parental figure or other adult as a result, this could cause the child to use firesetting or cruelty to animals as an outlet for their frustration. One researcher notes that enuresis is an \\"unconscious, involuntary, and nonviolent act and therefore linking it to violent crime is more problematic than doing so with animal cruelty or firesetting\\". According to Douglas and his fellow researchers however, the triad behaviors are not causal when examining a relationship with later predatory behavior, but rather, are predictive of an increased likelihood of future behavior patterns, and give professionals a chance to halt some patterns before they progress.

He was one of the Queen's chief confidants and often served as an intermediary in her problems and conflicts. In Church appointments he was sensitive to the Queen's preferences: he avoided recommending the appointment of either High Churchmen or teetotallers.

It contains genera such as Psilophyton. This group is probably paraphyletic, and is believed to be the ancestral group from which both the ferns and seed plants evolved. Different authors have treated the group at different taxonomic ranks using the names Trimerophyta, Trimerophytophyta, Trimerophytina, Trimerophytophytina and Trimerophytales. Taxonomy At first most of the early land plants other than the bryophytes (i.e. the polysporangiophytes) were placed in a single class Psilophyta, established in 1917 by Kidston and Lang. As additional fossils were discovered and described, it became apparent that the Psilophyta were not a homogeneous group of plants. In 1968 Banks first proposed splitting this taxon into three groups, which he put at the rank of subdivision; he clarified his proposal in 1975. One of the three groups was the Trimerophytina., cited in The subdivision is based on the type genus Trimerophyton, which might be expected to produce 'Trimerophytophytina' as the name of the subdivision, but the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants allows the 'phyton' part of a genus name optionally to be omitted before '-ophyta', '-ophytina' and '-opsida'., Article 16.4 The group has also since been treated as a division under the name Trimerophyta, p. 227 or Trimerophytophyta, as a class under the name Trimeropsida or Trimerophytopsida (as here),See, e.g., and as an order under the name Trimerophytales., p. 57 * Subphylum ‚Ä†Trimerophytina Banks 1975  Class ‚Ä†Trimerophytopsida Foster & Gifford 1974 [Trimeropsida Banks 1975; Psilophytopsida Kidston & Lang 1917; Psilophytidae Nemejc 1963] * Order ‚Ä†Trimerophytales Banks ex Kasper et al. 1974 [Psilophytales Pia 1924]  Family ‚Ä†Trimerophytaceae Banks 1967 [Psilophytaceae Hirmer 1927; Hostinellaceae Pia 1924; Dawsonitaceae Nemejc 1963] * Genus ‚Ä†Dawsonites Nemejc 1963 * Genus ‚Ä†Hostinella Barrande ex Stur 1882 * Genus ‚Ä†Oocampsa Andrews, Gensel & Kasper 1975 * Genus ‚Ä†Euphyllophyton Hao & Beck * Genus ‚Ä†Pauthecophyton Xue et al. 2012 * Genus ‚Ä†Psilophyton Dawson 1859 emend.

In this case, if all lien holders agree to accept less than the amount owed on the debt, a sale of the property can be accomplished. A short sale has two intrinsic and inseverable components. A Short Sale is successful when (1) a lienholder(s) (a.k.a. Mortgage Company) is agreeable to net less than the amount owed on the note (debt) as the result of (2) an arm's length sale at or below the Appraised Value for that property. The agreeable selling price is intrinsically defined to be at or less than the appraised value allowing the process to be attainable. A prudent buyer will not pay greater than the appraised value, and a Bank or Finance company will not provide a mortgage for greater than the appraised value, thus limiting the Short Sale proceeds to a maximum gross yield of the property's Appraised Value. A short sale may occur when the lienholder expects that a mortgage will likely never be repaid and the home's value (due to the home's condition, such as if a prior homeowner vacated the property and left it damaged or trashed, or general economic conditions in the area or nationwide) will not (either quickly or at all) regain equity to allow full payment of the mortgage. It's important to understand that a Lien holder is not bound to accept the Appraised value and can demand a greater selling price. In this case, a \\"Sale\\" with a prudent arm's length buyer is no longer a reasonable or attainable expectation. Instead the demand for greater than the Appraised Value (but less than the amount owed on the debt) is called a \\"Short Settlement\\". Some Lien holders will agree to a Short Sale but not a Short Settlement while demanding greater than the Appraised Value. This is a paradox as neither is achievable and both predestined for failure. Therefore, a \\"Short Sale\\" can only be accomplished when a Lien Holder is willing to accept less than what is owed on the debt while also agreeing to accept a sales price that is at or below the appraised value for the property. Creditors holding liens against real estate can include primary mortgages, second mortgages, home equity lines of credit (HELOC), homeowner association liens, mechanics liens, IRS and State Tax Liens, all of which will need to approve the sale in return for being paid less than the amount they are owed. The lien holders do not have to agree to accept less, but they often do since the alternative is to let the property go to foreclosure. A short sale is a more beneficial alternative to foreclosure and has become commonplace in the United States since the 2007 real estate recession. Other countries have similar procedures. For instance, in the UK the process is called Assisted Voluntary Sale. While both short sale and foreclosure result in negative credit reporting against the property owner, because the owner acted more responsibly and proactively by selling short, credit impact is less.  Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternative Program (HAFA)  The HAFA program expired December 31, 2016. In 2009 the government implemented the Making Home Affordable Program (MHA) to address the real estate recession and the need to help homeowners deal with their real estate loans. Its primary components are loan modification (Home Affordable Modification Program known as HAMP) and foreclosure alternatives (Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives known as HAFA). HAFA provides homeowners the opportunity to exit their homes and be relieved of the remaining mortgage debt through a short sale. It also provides homeowners or their tenants with up to $10,000 in relocation assistance. Through HAFA, you can short sell your primary residence or rental property. Once you complete a HAFA short sale, there is a waiver of deficiency, meaning you are released from any remaining mortgage debt. You may be eligible for HAFA if you meet the following basic criteria: ¬∑ You are struggling to make your mortgage payments due to financial hardship. ¬∑ You are delinquent or in danger of falling behind on your mortgage. ¬∑ You obtained your mortgage on or before January 1, 2009. ¬∑ Your property has not been condemned. ¬∑ You owe up to $729,750 on your primary residence or one-to-four unit rental property (loan limits are higher for two- to four-unit properties). The short sale process The Short Sale Facilitation Process consists of the following. 1\\\\. Contact the Primary Lien holder and submit an application to be accepted into their Short sale Program. Lenders will not entertain any short sale contract with a buyer unless the home owner has first been approved for their program. 2\\\\. The Lender should verify that any government programs, such as Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) eligibility, are explored, including relocation assistance to the borrower. 3\\\\. Once approved the Lender should provide the terms of the short sale. Terms can include forgiveness of any deficiency, money incentive for a successful closing, property must be listed by a certain date, and many other incentives. 4\\\\. Interviewing real estate agents and selecting the most qualified person to handle your short sale (if you have not already selected a listing agent). 5\\\\. It can be helpful to obtain Broker Price Opinion letter to establish an estimate (not an appraisal) of the property's current market value. This BPO's must use comps in your immediate market. The property should be listed at a greater price to show the Lender you are trying to get the highest possible price. 6\\\\. Monitoring the listing to ensure that it is proactively handled. 7\\\\. Negotiate with Junior Lien holders for a reduced payoff. Junior Lien holders will get nothing in the event of a foreclosure (that qualifies for a short sale) therefore they have every incentive to settle for something rather than nothing. Junior Lien holders are permitted to pursue a personal money judgment due to any deficiency this creates. Negotiating to eliminate this is paramount for the borrower. 8\\\\. Submitting the short sale offer to all lien holders and negotiating with them to obtain approval of the sale. 9\\\\. Working with the lien holders to obtain release of any deficiency liability. Parties to a short sale  Some junior lien holders and others with an interest in the property may object to the amounts other lien holders are receiving. It is possible for any one lien holder to prevent a short sale by refusing to agree to negotiate a reduction in their payoff to release their lien. If a creditor has mortgage insurance on their loan, the insurer will likely also become a third party to these negotiations, since the insurance policy may be asked to pay out a claim to offset the creditor's loss. The wide array of parties, parameters and processes involved in a short sale can make it a complex and highly specialized form of debt renegotiation. Short sales have a high risk of failure for the many reasons stated, but have the best chance of success if the right professional is hired to facilitate.  Deficiency judgments  Any unpaid balance owed to creditors above the pay off they receive at short sale is known as a deficiency. Short sale agreements do not necessarily release borrowers from their obligations to repay any shortfalls on the loans, unless specifically agreed to between the parties or provided by law. Most states allow lenders to obtain a deficiency judgment following a short sale, but a few states including Arizona, California, Nevada and Oregon, prohibit this. In those states allowing deficiency judgments after short sale, it is imperative that the Short Sale Agreement between the borrower and the lien holders include a clear deficiency release agreement.  Credit and tax implications  A short sale will result in negative credit reporting to the borrower. However, the borrower who has short sold a property has a much shorter waiting period for a loan than the borrower who let the property go to foreclosure. With the FHA Back to Work Program some borrowers can qualify for a new loan a year after a short sale. It has become the norm that the borrower who acted responsibly by short selling is rewarded. The short sale borrower will receive a 1099-C (C meaning Cancellation of Debt) following a short sale. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act may give you an exemption from tax liability if the property sold short was your principal residence. Otherwise the property can be itemized on a Schedule D as a total loss and deducted accordingly (see your tax professional).

The mission of Martha's Table is to support strong children, strong families, and strong communities by increasing access to high-quality education, healthy food, and family and community supports. Martha's Table believes that every child - regardless of zip code - deserves the opportunity for their brightest future and a deeply engaged family and community committed to their success. Many of the organization's endeavors are accomplished through the work of its service program‚Äîhosting more than 14,000 volunteers annually.  History  Martha's Table started in 1980 as a safe place for children to receive free sandwiches and food after school. The organization was named after the Martha of The Bible, a follower and friend of Jesus. The Martha‚Äôs Table name comes from an admirable individual in the Bible: Martha! When Jesus and his disciples were on their way to Jerusalem, they stopped in a village, where a woman named Martha and her sister Mary opened their home to them. While Mary sat with the apostles and listened to their teachings, Martha was consumed by preparations in the kitchen for her honored guests. While Martha's Table is not a religiously-based organization, the founders Veronica Maz, a social worker, and Father Horace McKenna, a Jesuit Priest, choose the name ‚ÄúMartha‚Äôs Table‚Äù to represent the dignity in being the one who serves. Martha's Table gradually grew to address the additional needs of the community through its onsite early childhood education programs and expanded food distribution programs. left = Veronica Maz (1980‚Äì1987) = Veronica Maz served as the first president and CEO of Martha's Table. Maz, was a sociology professor at Georgetown when she began working with Jesuit priest, Horace B. McKenna, in an attempt to turn concerns about poverty in the District into action. Before founding Martha's Table, Maz worked with McKenna to create S.O.M.E. (So Others Might Eat), a soup kitchen to help feed the city's destitute citizens, and House of Ruth, a home for abused and neglected women. Maz realized that the city's children were not protected from the violence and drugs plaguing DC streets at the time, especially in the dangerous 14th Street corridor. She joined with McKenna once more to found Martha's Table, a haven where children could go after school for a meal and a place to read and play. In 1980, they named the agency Martha's Table. Together, the pair chose the name Martha from the Bible. Martha was known for opening her home to Jesus and his disciples and feeding them. This is what Maz wanted her organization to be known for and soon thereafter, Martha's Table was born. = Veronica Parke (1987‚Äì2004) = Satisfied that Martha's Table had reached organizational stability, Maz departed to pursue other endeavors. She was succeeded by long-time volunteer and change agent, Veronica Parke. Under Parke's leadership, the programs at Martha's Table expanded to serve children along the entire age spectrum, from 3 months to 18 years. The children's program expanded into three areas: a brand new daily program for preschoolers and their mothers focusing on learning and social skills; daily provision of breakfast, lunch, and snack; extensive education and play activities for children both during the school year and summer vacation, as well as activities on weekends. Programs were also created for youth in the critical preteen and teen years. Patty Stonesifer (Current President and CEO) = Lindsey Buss (2004‚Äì2012) = After nearly two decades of service to Martha's Table, Parke handed over leadership in 2004 to Director of Development Lindsey Buss. A lawyer and lifelong volunteer, Buss expanded enrollment access to students in the Child Development Center, creating a series of parenting workshops, and further developing the after-school program. Divided into three age categories, the after-school programs served as a way for students to focus on literacy and math enhancement, acquire tutoring or homework help, and participate in college-driven workshops. = Patty Stonesifer (2013‚Äìpresent) = In April 2013, Martha's Table hired the former CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Patty Stonesifer, as the new President and CEO. Upon taking her new position, Stonesifer feared what the overall reaction might be. \\"I was really worried that people would think I was a bit of a carpetbagger ‚Äî that I just came in from outside and thought I knew everything,\\" she said.https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/catching-up-with- patty-stonesifer/2014/04/11/e7dc9806-c03d-11e3-bcec-b71ee10e9bc3_story.html Stonesifer joined the organization with the commitment to stand with DC residents in the struggle to end the cycle of poverty. Patty's vision for Martha's Table was illustrated using a model she employed from Jim Collins, author of Good to Great and the Social Sectors. \\"You have to decide what is real greatness and move that over to the nonprofit side,\\" Stonesifer said. \\"And for me the biggest form of greatness is knowing what you're trying to do and being very ‚Äî holding really tightly to that.\\" Stonesifer's focus is on deepening and expanding Martha's Table to become a national model for service- based nonprofits, to help kids succeed in school, help parents contribute to their children's success, and end childhood hunger. Since joining the organization, Martha's Table has added a training center for parents with children enrolled in the organization's education programs, and piloted a mobile market partnership plan with Arcadia foods. The organization has also launched a number of pop up, free grocery markets throughout the city, and has teamed up with the Capital Area Food Bank on its Joyful Food Markets initiative, which brings fresh, healthy produced and groceries to elementary schools in Wards 7 and 8. Martha's Table also began collecting new data and employed new assessments for its data-based performance management.  Programs  Since 1980, Martha's Table has evolved and enhanced its programs in order to meet the growing demands for healthy food, affordable clothing, and quality education in the DC area. = Food =  McKenna's Wagon  right McKenna's Wagon, the organization's mobile food truck, rolls out 365 days a year to feed the District's homeless and hungry population. The Wagon is named after the founder of Martha's Table, Horace McKenna. Volunteers stop at locations around the D.C. metro area and serve hot meals, sandwiches, homemade muffins, fresh fruit and refreshments.McKenna's Wagon McKenna's Wagon also provides holiday meals during Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Churches, synagogues, workplaces, and schools work with Martha's Table to help run McKenna's Wagon by serving meals, donating food, making sandwiches, etc. Martha's Table's emergency food programs provide help to vulnerable populations by providing lunch and dinner daily to hundreds of homeless and low-income people, emergency grocery bags and weekday meals to 300 children and youth.  Martha's Markets  Since August 2011, Martha's Table has partnered with Target to provide groceries to students and families at eight local elementary schools. Martha's Table also partners with schools in the District of Columbia and Maryland; Garrison Elementary and Powell Elementary in the northwest, Browne Education Campus, Smothers Elementary, and John Burroughs Education Campus in the northeast, Amidon-Bowen in the southwest, Hendley in the southeast and Thomas Stone Elementary in Mount Rainier, Maryland. Similar to the markets offered directly at Martha's Table, these \\"healthy grocery markets\\" are based on a choice model system that allows parents to select the nutritious foods their families need.  Mobile Markets  rightDuring the school year, Martha's Table serves thousands of families through their \\"Martha's Market\\" choice grocery program set up in eight local elementary schools. These markets serve each school once per month, bringing free groceries and the opportunity for children and parents to fill their shopping bags with a variety of fresh produce and shelf-stable foods‚Äîall while enjoying cooking demonstrations, tastings, and information tables. On July 1, Martha's Table and Arcadia Foods launched a new weekly mobile farmer's market that offers a combination of free and for-sale produce and groceries to low-income families across the Metro D.C. area. Through this partnership, a bright, green truck full of fresh produce, proteins, and healthy diet staples is setting up pop-up farmer's markets Monday through Friday, twice each day, in eight neighborhoods currently receiving food support from Martha's Table. Because of this new partnership, the weekly mobile market program will provide reliable access to healthy groceries for families in eight locations throughout the summer‚Äîwhen children lose access to free and reduced-price meals at school. = Education = left  Early Child Education  Martha's Table is a nationally accredited Child Development Center. It is a fully bilingual program for children ages 3 months to 3 years. The center explores a \\"Learn through Play\\" approach with its infants, toddlers and preschoolers. The educational components of the program are broad-based and teach the children about nature, reading, different cultures, science, art and computers. The Child Development Center also provides help to children with special needs through partnerships with other organizations, making sure that each child is either at the appropriate development level or receiving intervention services.  Elementary to Career Program (5‚Äì13 years)  rightNationally accredited through the National After-School Association, the after-school programs for younger children offers students a range of academic and enrichment opportunities, including tutoring, homework assistance, and developing literacy and math skills. The enrichment program for elementary and middle school students focus on the following general areas: * Helping meet children's basic needs such as food and clothing. * Providing a safe, supervised, and supportive program that promotes and nurtures learning, and addresses any special needs. * Assisting children dealing with family challenges and engaging parents. * Facilitating the participants' personal growth and development. = Opportunity =  Martha's Outfitters  rightMartha's Outfitters is a second-hand thrift store that originally started in 2004 as a clothes closet. Today, the store serves roughly 50,000 customers a year, generating more $425,000 in revenue. Martha's Outfitters also offers brand-name and vintage men's, women's and children's clothing, shoes, jewelry, housewares, accessories and linens at affordable prices. Revenue from purchases are dedicated to the education, food and clothing programs. Martha's Outfitters also offers a free clothing distribution program to clients referred by one of the 100 agency partners throughout the Washington, DC area, allowing them access to free casual and work clothing, interview attire, housewares, and linens.  Success Center  In 2014, Martha's Table launched its Success Center in order to engage parents in their children's academic success.  Achievements/Accreditation  Martha's Table has been granted accreditation status through the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) for their Child Development Center. Charity Navigator gave Martha's Table a four-star rating in 2017, recognizing their staff for maintaining low overheads, efficient spending, and smoothly running programs. Charity Navigator's website reflects that, \\"Martha's Table executes its mission in a fiscally responsible way and outperforms most other charities in America.\\"  References   External links   Bush Speaks at Martha's Table.

The policy covers the building, with the option of insuring any contents that belong to the landlord that are inside. Landlords' insurance is often referred to as buy-to-let insurance, however buy-to-let insurance is a type of landlords' insurance. It is important to distinguish between buy-to-let insurance which generally covers one property that has been purchased with a buy-to-let mortgage, and multi-property insurance, which covers two or more properties. Each of these types of landlords' insurance covers different things. Landlord insurance is separate from landlords' emergency cover. The policy will normally cover standard perils such as fire, lightning, explosion, storm, escape of water/oil, subsidence, theft and malicious damage. Each insurance policy is different and may or may not include all these items. Optional coverage might include accidental damage, malicious damage by tenant, terrorism, legal protection, alternative accommodation costs, contents insurance, rent guarantee insurance, and liability insurance. Landlords' insurance policies typically do not cover any personal property belonging to tenants, or otherwise protect the interest of tenants; although a liability policy protecting a landlord or property manager will be of benefit to tenants should they incur a loss for which the landlord is responsible.

The show was broadcast in the United Kingdom under the title Chief of Detectives. In (Western) Germany the show ran in 1980 under the title Schauplatz New York.  Synopsis  The series stars Joe Don Baker as tough, brilliant, southern-bred New York City Police Department Chief of Detectives Earl Eischied. His complimentary catchphrase was \\"Ya done good,\\" which was usually directed at one of the younger detectives or officers in his command. His pet cat was named \\"PC\\" (as in \\"police commissioner\\"). Eischied was tough and did not hesitate to work the streets with his detectives. He used a Smith & Wesson Model 10 .38 Special, snub-nosed revolver, which he carried \\"old school\\" style, inside his waistband, concealed by his vest and/or suit jacket. He was not afraid to bend the rules in pursuit of a case, but would never break the law. His southern drawl concealed a sharp intellect and encyclopedic knowledge of criminology and police work. Although Eischied was physically imposing, he had great empathy and compassion for victims of crime and others less fortunate.

(1972) Paraprofessional Educator Manager: A New Professional Role in Early Childhood Education. Illinois Univ., Urbana. Inst. of Research for Exceptional Children. ERIC # ED064816.  By country  Paraprofessionals are widely employed in schools in the United States and Canada, and in some European countries. In the United States these educators have over 30 titles, but a recent national trend has encouraged states to title these positions as \\"paraeducators\\" under their various job positions (example: Support Staff>Paraeducator>Special Education). In England and Wales, the term used for education paraprofessionals is Teaching Assistant (TA). In recent years, legislation has been introduced which enables teachers to delegate a range of tasks to their TAs. Teaching Assistants in England and Wales can apply for Higher Level Teaching Assistant (HLTA) status, which requires them to document the ways in which their work meets a set of specified criteria. Those with HLTA status can substitute for teachers and (where appropriate) supervise other TAs. Scotland uses the term \\"classroom assistant\\" rather than \\"teaching assistant\\" as teaching is strictly not part of an assistant's responsibilities there. In Canada, they are widely known as Educational Assistants to emphasize their role in educating special needs students. In Japan, foreign native speakers employed as paraprofessional language educators (primarily English) are known as Assistant Language Teachers. Similar institutions exist in Germany and France where they are known as Foreign Language Assistants. Duties Paraprofessional educators generally assist teachers in the classroom, supervise students outside of the classroom, or provide administrative support for teaching.Teacher Assistants in the Occupational Outlook Handbook 2010-11 Edition Job duties range from filling teaching positions to supplementing regular classroom curriculum with additional enrichment activities for students. Other positions include classroom aides, special education aides, school library technical assistants, and tutors. Some paraprofessionals work directly with students, in which case they may listen to students practice reading aloud, help students understand and complete their assignments, or assist students with special needs. Many paraprofessionals are assigned to supervise groups of students who are eating, playing outside, or on field trips. They may be assigned to perform clerical work for a teacher, in which case they may grade assignments, type up records for attendance or grades, set up equipment, and help prepare materials for instruction, e.g., by making photocopies of worksheets. Many teacher assistants work primarily or exclusively with students who have special educational needs. Their duties vary according to the needs of the student, and may include physical care for students who are unable to care for themselves (such as feeding, lifting, moving, or cleaning), behavioral management, or academic assistance. Some paraprofessionals don't work with the school directly, rather the school district, mental health agencies, early childhood programs or transitional life agencies after a student graduates. Paraprofessionals can work in other programs that the school district provide, such as school aged childcare and recess/ lunch duties. This links the paraprofessional to the students, but not the teacher or schools itself. The role of the paraprofessional educator is constantly evolving. Today, more than ever, paraprofessionals are teaching lessons, working with small groups for remediation, leading extracurricular clubs/sports and are no longer simply the \\"teacher's aide\\" of the past. Requirements Requirements to become a paraprofessional vary widely, normally ranging from a high school diploma, G.E.D., two years of college education, or an associate degree.

It stars Nandamuri Balakrishna, Simran, Reema Sen in the lead roles and music composed by Mani Sharma. The film met with mixed reviews from critics and was recorded as Average at the box office. Plot The movie starts with a fight in which Durga Prasad (Nandamuri Balakrishna) bashes up police for occupying a poor woman's house. Dhanunjaya Rao (Raghuvaran) comes to know of Durga's heroism and tells him his flashback. Dhanunjaya Rao and Chandra Sekhar (Charan Raj) are best friends. They each have a child. Dhanunjaya Rao is a business magnate, whereas Chandra Sekhar is a police officer. Chandra Sekhar arrests a dreaded goon, and the goon's supporters kidnap Dhanunjaya Rao's son, hold him hostage, and want to exchange him for the goon's release. If Chandra Sekhar does not release the goon, he would be getting a promotion and prize money worth 5 lakhs from the government. At the last spurring moment, Chandra Sekhar becomes selfish, which results in Dhanunjaya Rao's son's death. Due to this incident, Chandra Sekhar becomes an enemy of Dhanunjaya Rao. Dhanunjaya Rao's wife gets paralyzed. Dhanunjaya Rao's aim is to kill Chandra Sekhar's son. Dhanunjaya Rao asks for Durga's help in killing Chandra Sekhar's son. Durga accepts to be the contract killer. In the process, Durga cures Dhanunjaya Rao's wife's paralysis by killing Chandra Sekhar's son named Simha Prasad (Sai Kumar). Charulatha (Reema Sen), Dhanunjaya Rao's niece, falls in love with Durga. Dhanunjaya Rao is impressed with Durga as he got rid of Simbhu and cured his wife's paralysis. He wants to adopt Durga as his son and marry off Charulatha to him, but it is revealed that Durga is a big enemy of Charulatha's parents back in their Nizam area. Then there is a remote village in Telangana, which is dominated by the family of an MP named Kaaleswara Rao (P. Vasu). There are no doors for houses in that village. This arrangement is done because the sons and goons of Kaleeswara Rao can run into any home and take hostages. Durga is a hardworking and heroic IPS officer who is sent on a special duty to get hold of the goons and set the village right. Hema (Simran) falls in love with Durga after observing his daring personality. Durga's father is Visweswara Rao (K. Viswanath). Hema proposes to Durga's parents, and all the elders accept the match. In a particular fight, Durga's hand gets paralyzed. Hema's parents cancel the alliance with Durga.

It's revealed that Durga's younger brother is Simha Prasad, who faked his death. Basically, Durga's real father is Chandra Shekar. Viswesara Rao only has one son, who is actually Simha Prasad. Durga and Simha were only trying to cure Dhanunjaya Rao's wife's paralysis. Durga plans to sacrifice himself to Dhanunjaya Rao, but Dhanunjaya Rao's wife convinces Dhanunjaya Rao not to do it.

He began life as chaplain and tutor in the family of Sir John Gell at Hopton, Derbyshire. He was subsequently chaplain at Normanton to Samuel Saunders, upon whose death he married and settled as Presbyterian minister of Findern, Derbyshire, being ordained on 10 October 1688. In 1693 he opened a school at Findern, and for so doing was cited into the bishop's court. Knowing William Lloyd, then bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, he went to remonstrate with him. Lloyd stayed the prosecution, and discussed nonconformity with Robinson till two o'clock in the morning; they afterwards corresponded. John Howe recommended him to a congregation at Hungerford, Berkshire, to which he removed from Findern in 1693. Here also, in 1696, he set up a school which developed into an academy for training ministers ; students were sent to him by the Presbyterian fund. It was his aim to inspire them with proper sentiments and dispositions to allure them to habits of study. Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, being at Hungerford on a visitation, sent for Robinson, who defended his course and gained Burnet's friendship. Subsequently he and Edmund Calamy had several interviews with Burnet in 1702, when nonconformist matters were before parliament. It was said the \\"he could do as much in an hour as another man could in a day\\".

It includes household chemicals and other substances for which the owner no longer has a use, such as consumer products sold for home care, personal care, automotive care, pest control and other purposes. These products exhibit many of the same dangerous characteristics as fully regulated hazardous waste due to their potential for reactivity, ignitability, corrosivity, toxicity, or persistence. Examples include drain cleaners, oil paint, motor oil, antifreeze, fuel, poisons, pesticides, herbicides and rodenticides, fluorescent lamps, lamp ballasts, smoke detectors, medical waste, some types of cleaning chemicals, and consumer electronics (such as televisions, computers, and cell phones). Certain items such as batteries and fluorescent lamps can be returned to retail stores for disposal. The Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation (RBRC) maintains a list of battery recycling locations and your local environmental organization should have list of fluorescent lamp recycling locations. The classification \\"household hazardous waste\\" has been used for decades and does not accurately reflect the larger group of materials that during the past several years have become known as \\"household hazardous wastes\\". These include items such as latex paint, non-hazardous household products and other items that do not generally exhibit hazardous characteristics which are routinely included in \\"household hazardous waste\\" disposal programs. The term \\"home generated special materials\\" more accurately identifies a broader range of items that public agencies are targeting as recyclable and/or should not be disposed of into a landfill. United States HHW is not regulated by the EPA. Many states and local solid waste management departments have created and funded Household Hazardous Waste collection programs to offer safe disposal options. These programs may include home collection service, permanent facilities and one day collection events. Although most U.S. states and federal regulations continue to permit homeowner disposal of some household hazardous waste into the solid waste stream, state agencies are becoming more stringent in enforcing existing hazardous waste regulations at the retail level. The most extensive overview of this topic including history, policy and technical issues is contained in the 2008 book Handbook on Household Hazardous Waste, Amy Cabaniss, Editor.https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780865871632 An additional HHW overview resource is in Chapter 10 of the Handbook of Solid Waste Management, George Tchobanoglous and Frank Kreith, Editors.https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Solid-Waste-Management- Kreith/dp/0071356231 The professional organization most focused on HHW issues is the North American Hazardous Materials Management Association, NAHMMA.http://www.nahmma.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr;=1 NAHMMA has chapters in many states, holds an annual conference,http://www.nahmma.org provides training and offers professional publications. In collaboration with the Solid Waste Association of North America (SWANA) NAHMMA offers certification to HHW collection professionals. =State regulation= In Florida,Summary of Hazardous Waste Regulations ¬ª Waste Management ¬ª Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and in other United States states, responsibility for proper disposal of retail hazardous waste falls upon the generator. Depending on the state, \\"proper disposal\\" either encourage, or in some states require, that small business hazardous waste not be disposed of through the solid waste stream, but must only be transported in accordance with DOTlicensed carriers and EPA (RCRA) regulations to a properly permitted hazardous waste TSDRF (Treatment Storage Disposal and/or Recycling Facility). Some states allow collection of small business hazardous wastes at the same location as household hazardous wastes. However, it is more common for public collection facilities to limit hazardous waste collection to households. In 1992 the US EPA issued a policy that allowed states the option to collect and mix household hazardous wastes with conditionally exempt hazardous wastes from small businesses.http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/swfa/mrw/epaguides/CESQGmixingHHW.htm This has encouraged a trend of local collection programs evolving from household hazardous waste only to also include small business hazardous waste collection. California has introduced an Electronic Waste Recycling Act. While most states recognize the exemption for home generated hazardous waste in 40 CFR, California has established Section 25218 of the Health and Safety Code to regulate all aspects of home generated special materials (HHW). 25218 details the types of programs e.g. Door-to-Door, Permanent HHWCF, Curbside, Mobile etc. Public agencies must sponsor (as the generator) all HHW programs as their EPA ID number is used. All HHW programs are monitored by DTSC and/or the local CUPA organization. A Permit-by-Rule must be obtained from DTSC or the CUPA before implementing most HHW collection activities. Pennsylvania has introduced the Covered Device Recycling Act. European Union Similar regulations, such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive are being introduced in the countries of the European Union.

He was best known for being the ringmaster of the International Circus at Belle Vue, Manchester, England, and Blackpool Tower Circus. Early career George Claude Lockhart (real name Locker) was the son of George William Lockhart, the famous elephant trainer. According to various accounts he broadcast on radio and in his book \\"Grey Titan\\", George was brought up around elephants. However, he made his first independent performance at the age of four in a child-only cast of the pantomime Cinderella along with other music hall/circus children. He apparently played the role of the prince. When he was not at school, George spent a lot of his time with the elephants Boney, Molly and Waddy and toured all over Europe with them. His father sold his original troupe of elephants in 1901 and bought four more from the animal dealer Carl Hagenbeck. This group would be known as \\"Lockhart's Cruet\\" and would become notorious for causing the death of George William Lockhart. According to George Claude Lockhart, they regularly stampeded and it was in one of these stampedes at Walthamstow station on 24 January 1904 that they killed their owner. The elephants were sold by his widow and George Claude Lockhart went to pursue a career not involving animals. He worked for George Hengler in Glasgow with his water productions undertaking various roles until 1914. Ringmaster On 14 July 1914 Lockhart began his career as a ringmaster at Blackpool Tower during their summer seasons. This was interrupted when he did military service in World War I. He returned to work at Blackpool and continued to work there until 1945. He worked for the Bertram Mills Circus at Olympia for the 1923‚Äì24 Christmas season. He began working as the Belle Vue International Circus ringmaster in 1928 and worked there until he retired at the age of 90 in 1970. Elephants These were told in various newspaper interviews and articles plus his Essays in Adventure radio broadcast and his book with Willan Bosworth, Grey Titan. The elephant Waddy apparently almost killed him when he and his father were transporting the act across Europe by train. He was present when his father was killed during the stampede at Walthamstow station and was interviewed at the inquest. He saw the surviving members of this group of elephants, Salt and Saucy, when they worked at Belle Vue in 1938. This reunion was remarked upon in the World's Fair newspaper. When he was seventy The Express newspaper reported that George Lockhart had his arm crushed by the elephant Burma whilst he was taking visitors around the circus stables. According to the report he continued presenting the circus throughout the second half before being admitted to hospital for his injuries. Trademarks and legacy Lockhart adopted the \\"pink\\" huntsmen tails, black hat, white shirt and gloves upon the advice of Bertram Mills when he worked for them in 1928. This has become the standard uniform of the stereotypical circus ringmaster. He also used to smoke a cigar when introducing the various acts and this, also, became an instantly recognisable characteristic of his showbusiness persona. Lockhart was also famous for the various accounts he gave on his time spent with his father's elephants. According to a new book on his father's elephants, The Legend of Salt and Sauce by Jamie Clubb, much of George Lockhart's accounts on the elephants are romanticised versions of what actually happened, which alter in each progressive version. George Claude Lockhart has been immortalised by having a road named after him. Lockhart Close was built by Wimpy Homes in 1987 on the former site of his beloved Belle Vue Zoo in Manchester. The small residential close is adjacent to Hoskins Close, named after Johnnie Hoskins and are both located off Ellen Wilkinson Crescent.
