Renaissance Only in the Renaissance did individual artists in Western Europe acquire personalities known by their peers (some listed by Vasari in his Lives of the Artists), such as those known by : * Their true name or their father's name :  Filippino Lippi after his father Fra Filippo Lippi * A chosen pseudonym, possibly linked to his birthplace or his father's trade :  Giuliano da Sangallo worked on the gate of saint Gall  Antonio Pollaiuolo, after his father, a chicken farmer (pollo in Italian)  Jacopo del Sellaio, after his father, a saddler (sellier)  The Della Robbias (after the Tuscan word robbia, dyers' madder, and his father, the dyer Luca della Robbia)  Masuccio Segondo, student of Masuccio Primo  etc. * A surname attributed to him :  Il Cronaca, who never stopped talking about the ruins he had seen in Rome  Daniele da Volterra, nicknamed Il Braghettone (the breeches maker) for having censored nudes in paintings by adding cloths or branches, at the request of pope Paul IV  Luca della Robbia, for the madder colour he used as a ceramicist  Masaccio, known as the idiot  etc. * A corporation, whose generic name is given to works made by all its members :  the Campionesi Masters, sculptors and builders of religious buildings (Ugo da Campione, Bonino da Campione, Giovanni da Campione, Zenone de Campione, Matteo da Campione) 20th-century problems of attribution The idea of a named and recognised painter originated among art historians early in the 20th century, who were attributing works they recognised to known painters. They later went back on some of these attributions, renaming as anonymous the painters they had formerly named. One example is the case of Pier Francesco Fiorentino, to whom Bernard Berenson attributed a number of works which were later re-attributed to Pseudo Pier Francesco Fiorentino, a Florence copyist. Some painters have even been described as anonymous (even many times like Barth√©lemy Eyck) before later being recognised. They thus held several names historically (those who are noted on the page devoted to them), although doubts continue surrounding some, such as Giovanni Gaddi (after 1333 ‚Äì 1383) maybe the Master of the Misericordia dell‚ÄôAccademia.

She is best known today for creating the role of Violetta in Verdi's opera, La traviata, but she was also an admired interpreter of the composer's other works as well as those by Donizetti.Rosenthal and Warrack (1979) p. 436 Biography Fanny Salvini-Donatelli, whose real name was Francesca Lucchi,Rescigno (2001) p. 473 was born in Florence to a prosperous family. Financial hardship following her father's death led her to a career as an actress.Regli (1860) p. 480 In the early 1830s she became the second wife of the actor, Giuseppe Salvini, (and the stepmother of the much more famous actor Tommaso Salvini).Note that some sources, e.g. Gatti (1955) p. 133, erroneously describe her at the second wife of Tommaso Salvini However, her marriage was an unhappy one, as was her relationship with her stepchildren. Following her desertion of the family in 1842, Giuseppe Salvini obtained a separation on the grounds of infidelity.Salvini (1955) pp. 34‚Äì36 He died two years later. While married to Salvini, she studied singing and made her operatic debut in 1839 at the Teatro Apollo in Venice as Rosina in Il barbiere di Siviglia. Theater am K√§rntnertor where Salvini-Donatelli made her Vienna debut in 1843 as Abigaille in Verdi's Nabucco Salvini-Donatelli went on to a major career in Italy singing primarily at La Fenice and the Teatro Regio di Parma, where in 1850 a sonnet in her honour, written by the city's epigramist, Artaserse Folli, was distributed to the audience.Teatro Regio di Parma Archives She also performed at La Scala, the Teatro Regio di Torino, the Teatro Comunale di Bologna, the Teatro Grande di Trieste and several other Italian theatres. Outside Italy, she sang in Paris, Barcelona, Vienna (where she made her debut in 1843 as Abigaille in Nabucco conducted by Verdi himself),Rescigno (2001) pp. 473 and London (where she made her debut in 1858 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane as Leonora in Il trovatore).Dwight (1858) p. 87 Although she is primarily remembered for creating the role of Violetta in La traviata, she created four other roles in now forgotten operas: Editta in Giovanni Pacini's Allan Cameron (18 March 1848, La Fenice); Elmina in Salvatore Sarmiento's Elmina (8 February 1851, Teatro Regio di Parma); Clemenza in Gualtiero Sanelli's Il fornaretto (24 March 1851, Teatro Regio di Parma); and Donna Eleonora in Carlo Ercole Bosoni's La prigioniera (16 January 1853, La Fenice).Casaglia She was generally thought to have retired from the stage in 1860. However, she is reported as singing at the Th√©√¢tre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels in 1877.Haine and Servais (2004) p. 68. Fanny Salvini-Donatelli died in Milan in June 1891. The Traviata \\"fiasco\\" Violetta's costume designed by Giuseppe Bertoja for the premiere of La traviata Verdi himself described the 1853 premiere of La traviata as a \\"fiasco\\".Matz (1964) p. 25 Salvini-Donatelli was 38 years old at the time and quite stout. Her physical unsuitability for playing a beautiful young woman wasting away from tuberculosis is often cited as one of the reasons for the opera's initial failure. In the third act when the doctor announced that Violetta's illness had worsened and she had only hours to live, the first-night audience is said to have burst out laughing, with one member of the public shouting: \\"I see no consumption, only dropsy!\\"Boyden, Kimberley, and Staines (2002) p. 232 Verdi himself had expressed serious doubts about Salvini-Donatelli's suitability for the role two months before the premiere and sent his librettist, Francesco Piave, to La Fenice's manager to convey his view that Violetta required a singer \\"with an elegant figure who is young and sings passionately\\".Quoted in Kimbell (1985) pp. 298‚Äì299 His request for a casting change was unsuccessful. Whatever the audience may have thought of Fanny Salvini-Donatelli's physical appearance, they were appreciative of her singing. Contemporary accounts show that her first act aria, \\"Sempre libera\\", received great applause. The critic in La Gazzetta di Venezia wrote the following day: \\"Salvini-Donatelli sang those coloratura passages, of which the maestro wrote so many, with an indescribable skill and perfection. She captivated the theatre.\\"Original Italian: \\"La Salvini-Donatelli cant√≤ que' passi d'agilit√†, che molti per lei scrisse il maestro, con una perizia e perfezione da non dirsi : ella rap√¨ il teatro.\\" Quoted in Teatri, arti e letteratura, Vol. 59, 1853‚Äì1854, p. 22 The \\"failure\\" of the opening night performance was only relative. In addition to the applause for Salvini-Donatelli's aria, the orchestral Prelude was so well received that the audience began to shout for Verdi, who had to take curtain calls even before the curtain went up on the first act. Things only started derailing in the second act, especially the singing of the baritone (Felice Varesi) and the tenor (Lodovico Graziani).Phillips-Matz (1964) pp. 24‚Äì25 La traviata also did quite well at the box office. It ran for ten performances at La Fenice that season, with an average evening profit more than double that of Verdi's other two operas in the repertory there, Ernani and Il Corsaro.Phillips-Matz (1995) In any case, a year later it was mounted again at the Teatro San Benedetto in Venice to an indisputably triumphant reception. On that occasion, the role of Violetta was taken by Maria Spezia who was thirteen years younger and considerably slimmer than Salvini-Donatelli.Von Buchau (1991) The first night problems do not appear to have dissuaded Salvini- Donatelli from essaying the role again. She sang it at least three more times: in 1856 in Istanbul, when Luigi Arditi brought the opera to Turkey for the first time;Bomberger (1999) p. 14 in 1857 at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna (the second revised version with the title Violetta);Casaglia and in 1858, when she sang it in London at the Drury Lane Theatre.Town Talk (1959) p. 48 Operatic roles Fanny Salvini-Donatelli is known to have sung the following roles:Data compiled primarily from Casaglia with additions from Rescigno (2001), Haine and Servais (2004), Dwight (1859) and Conati (1992).

History Statue of Mexican Independence leader Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos in Montevideo Historically, both countries were part of the Spanish Empire until the early 19th century. Mexico was part of Viceroyalty of New Spain while Uruguay was part of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata. Soon after independence, both nations established diplomatic relations on 22 February 1831. In 1882, Uruguay established a consulate in Mexico City. In 1941, Mexico elevates its diplomatic mission in Montevideo to an embassy with Uruguay doing so two years later in 1943.History of diplomatic relations between Mexico and Uruguay (in Spanish) During the 1970s and 1980s, Uruguay went through a Civic-military dictatorship. During that time several dissidents were killed and 'disappeared'. Many also immigrated abroad and sought refuge in many countries throughout the world, including Mexico. Since the return of democracy to Uruguay, diplomatic relations between Mexico and Uruguay have continued unabated. When Mexico received much negative publicity following the outbreak of swine flu in 2009, Uruguay was said to have ‚Äúnever closed its doors to Mexico‚Äù. = 2009 Strategic Association accord = On 14 August 2009, President of Mexico Felipe Calder√≥n and President of Uruguay Tabar√© V√°zquez met in Montevideo.

Mexico was part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain while Paraguay was part of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata. Soon after independence, in 1831, Mexico and Paraguay established diplomatic relations.

Historical relations =Cenepa War controversy= In 1995, Peru was involved in the Cenepa War, a brief thirty- three-day war with Ecuador over the Cenepa River sector of the Cordillera del Condor territory in the western Amazon basin. Argentina, Chile, Brazil, and the United States, as the guarantors of the 1942 Rio Protocol that had put an end to the Ecuadorian‚ÄìPeruvian War earlier that century, worked with the governments of Peru and Ecuador to find a return to the status quo and end their border disputes once and for all. On 2005, General V√≠ctor Manuel Bayas, former Chief of Staff of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces during the Cenepa War, made a series of declarations in regards to the armed conflict between Peru and Ecuador. On March 21, 2005, General Bayas was asked by the Ecuadorian newspaper El Comercio if Chile had sold armaments to Ecuador during the Cenepa War, to which he replied: ‚ÄúYes, it was a contract with the militaries during the conflict.\\" Furthermore, General Bayas revealed that Argentina and Russia had also sold weaponry to Ecuador during the conflict.http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/03/22/um/m-943535.htm Argentina admitted to the illegal sale of armament by revealing the existence of three secret decrees signed by President Carlos Menem between the years of 1991 and 1995. The controversy regarding the decrees came about when the weapons sold did not go to Panama, Bolivia, and Venezuela as had been accorded, but instead the weapons ended up in Croatia and Ecuador at times when both of these nations were involved in wars and prohibited from receiving international military aid.http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_7674000/7674797.stm The sale Argentina gave to Ecuador included 6.500 tons of rifles, cannons, anti-tank rockets, and ammunition.http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_7274000/7274638.stm Menem was taken to court for his alleged association with these illegal acts in 2001, but was acquitted by Argentina's Supreme Court; however, in October 2008 the case was re-opened, but Menem can currently avoid being detained by Argentine authorities until 2010 when his position as senator of La Rioja is finished. Menem claims to have had no association with the illegal weapons trade, and further adds that this is a political persecusion made by Argentine president Cristina Fern√°ndez and, her husband and also former Argentine president, N√©stor Kirchner.

In this era of globalisation, Argentina would not tolerate separatism and the creation of microscopic entities, the Argentine president said at a meeting in Buenos Aires with Ahmed Kadiri, vice-speaker of the Moroccan chamber of advisors, upper house of parliament. Argentine ambassador in Morocco, Edgardo Piuzzi, in 2003 said that his country does not recognize Polisario and has always denounced the situation in Tindouf camps, in South Eastern Algeria. In an interview published by the Moroccan daily in Arabic Assahraa Al Maghribia, the Argentine diplomat termed as shameful the detention of Moroccan prisoners in Tindouf camps, for more than twenty five years, adding that Argentina has always upheld a clear stance: The Sahara is indubitably Moroccan. Economic partnership Morocco and Argentina signed in Rabat (2000) three major agreements on trade, fisheries and cooperation between the Moroccan Export Promotion Center (CMPE) and Argentine counterpart. The documents were initialed by foreign affairs minister Mohamed Benaissa and external relations minister of Argentina during the closing ceremony held in Rabat. Benaissa noted that the commission works were successful with the adoption of a large number of projects in the sectors of agriculture, fishery, housing, city planning, energy and mines, industry, equipment, tourism, investment, culture, education, scientific research and vocational training. In 2016, Argentine exports to Morocco amounted to US$368.7 million and Moroccan exports to Argentina amounted to US$107.4 million. https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/ARG/Year/2016/TradeFlow/EXPIMP/Partner/by- country Resident diplomatic missions * Argentina has an embassy in Rabat. * Morocco has an embassy in Buenos Aires.

It is native to Australia, but is an invasive species in Europe, probably imported with Australian plants. Description The wingspan is 13‚Äì15 mm. In Britain the moth flies from late-April to September, possibly in two extended generations or in a succession of broods. It comes to light and has been found in gardens, heath and in a flour mill. ;Egg Undescribed. ;Larvae Length 11‚Äì14 mm. The body is a translucent greyish white to creamy white with the gut showing as a darker dorsal line, which gives a larva the appearance of being grey. Its head is brown with darker mandibles. In Australia the larvae have been found between flat spun, fallen Eucalyptus leaves, on the ground or on fallen branches, favouring moist leaves. In Great Britain, Alexander Allen obtained eggs from a captured female and saw the larvae initially feeding gregariously in a silken web and as they grew they fed alone. Some ate withered leaves, but all the larvae preferred fresh leaves. The first wild larvae found in Great Britain was in the garden of the Natural History Museum, London (BMNH) in March 1998. They were in loose silken tubes covered with leaf-fragments and frass, between dry, layered leaves of London plane (Platanus √ó acerifolia). ;Pupa The pupa is found in the larval feeding place between spun leaves. It is in a loose inner cocoon, which is spun within a tough outer silken one covered in frass. Distribution The moth is native to Australia (New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria), and has been introduced to New Zealand and Great Britain, most certainly on imported plants. In Britain it was first taken in 1908 at Ottery St Mary, Devon and is now found in the south of England and in Cheshire and Lancashire.

He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1913 until 1917, and the leader of the Labor Party (ALP) in New South Wales for three months until February 1917. Durack was born near Bathurst. He was the son of a storekeeper and was educated at All Saints' College, Bathurst. In 1903, he married Cora Armstrong at Rydal and had two sons and three daughters with her. He found employment as a farmer and clerk until his entry to parliament at the 1913 election when he won the seat of Bathurst. In parliament his strong oratory skills were quickly noticed and he became Chairman of Committees (deputy Speaker). In 1916, the ALP split over the question of conscription in World War I. Labor premier William Holman supported Prime Minister Billy Hughes in opposing the party's anti-conscription policy and he and 28 supporters were expelled from the party. Holman and his followers remained in power by forming a coalition government with the Liberal Reform Party of Charles Wade on 15 November 1916 and the ALP became the opposition with 21 supporters in a house of 90 members. Durack defeated John Storey in the ballot for leadership of the Labor Party and became the Leader of the opposition. It was said that he was a much harder worker than Storey. In early 1917, Holman called a snap general election. Durack was scheduled to deliver the ALP's policy speech on 21 February but on that morning he announced his resignation from the party leadership and as the ALP candidate for Bathurst. Mystery surrounded his actions for some years until it was discovered that he had fathered a daughter, born in August 1916, with Winifred McNab, and he had resigned because of a fear that this would become a public scandal during the election campaign. He was succeeded as ALP leader by Storey. After leaving parliament, Durack enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force in September 1917 and saw service in Great Britain. He was invalided back to Australia in August 1918 and his movements from then until 1950, when he was a storekeeper near Bathurst, are unknown. Cora Armstrong died in 1956 and Durack subsequently married McNab.

The project was planned for Rampart Canyon (also known as Rampart Gorge) just southwest of the village of Rampart, Alaska and about west-northwest of Fairbanks, Alaska. The resulting dam would have created a lake roughly the size of Lake Erie, making it the largest man-made reservoir in the world. The plan for the dam itself called for a concrete structure high with a top length of about . The proposed power facilities would have consistently generated between 3.5 and 5 gigawatts of electricity, based on the flow of the river as it differs between winter and summer. Though supported by many politicians and businesses in Alaska, the project was canceled after objections were raised. Native Alaskans in the area protested the threatened loss of nine villages that would be flooded by the dam. Conservation groups abhorred the threatened flooding of the Yukon Flats, a large area of wetlands that provides a critical breeding ground for millions of waterfowl. Fiscal conservatives opposed the dam on the grounds of its large cost and limited benefit to Americans outside Alaska. Because of these objections, United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall formally opposed construction of the dam in 1967, and the project was shelved. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers nevertheless completed its engineering study of the project in 1971, and the final report was released to the public in 1979. In 1980, U.S. President Jimmy Carter created the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Sanctuary, which formally protected the area from development and disallowed any similar project.  Site  The northern portion of Rampart Canyon is seen in 1949. From its headwaters in the Coast Mountains, the Yukon River flows northwest, across the Yukon‚ÄìAlaska border, until it intersects the Porcupine River at the settlement of Fort Yukon. At that point, the river turns west and southwest, flowing through the Yukon Flats, a low-lying wetland area containing thousands of ponds, streams, and other small bodies of water. As the river flows southwest, it intersects the Tanana and Koyukuk rivers before looping south, then north into Norton Sound in the Bering Sea.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District. Data on Rampart Canyon Project Studies. Anchorage, Alaska. May 27, 1961. p. 3Corps of Engineers, p. A-1 During the river's flow through eastern Alaska, and before it intersects the Tanana River, the Yukon flows through the Central Plateau region of Alaska. During the millions of years of its flow, it has cut through ridges, forming canyons in some places near its juncture with the Tanana.Corps of Engineers, p. 199. One of the deepest of these canyons is known as Rampart Gorge, or Rampart Canyon. The gorge is located downstream of the village of Rampart, upstream of the village of Tanana, and immediately downstream from the mouth of Texas Creek.

May 27, 1961. p. 4  Surveying  A map of Interior Alaska, with the proposed location of Rampart Dam highlighted In 1944, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers considered building a bridge across Rampart Gorge as part of a project to extend the Alaska Railroad from Fairbanks to Nome to facilitate Lend-Lease shipments to the Soviet Union during World War II. The war ended before the project got beyond the planning stages, and the bridge idea was scrapped. As early as 1948, U.S. Government officials eyed the Rampart site for its hydroelectric potential. A report by Joseph Morgan, chief of the Alaska Investigations Office for the United States Bureau of Reclamation declared, \\"The demand for electric power supply in the [Alaska] Territory is expanding so rapidly that new installations of hydroelectric power plants are needed.\\"Morgan, p. 12. Morgan's report listed 72 potential hydroelectric power sites in Alaska, but the Rampart site was one of the few to have a potential capacity of more than 200,000 kilowatts.Morgan, p. 14. In his report, Morgan addresses the potential of the site: > Reconnaissance topography indicates several potential dam sites in Lower > Ramparts, but the best site probably will be found about downstream from the > village of Rampart. ... this site on the Yukon River would easily be one of > the major potential hydroelectric power developments in North > America.Morgan, p. 177.  Planning  A drawing of the proposed Rampart Dam reservoir, created in 1961.

Eisenhower signed Alaska's declaration of statehood, junior U.S. Senator from Alaska Ernest Gruening passed a resolution calling for the Corps of Engineers to begin an official study of the project,Special to The New York Times. \\"Alaska hopeful on Yukon power\\", The New York Times. June 18, 1961, p. 57. and $49,000 was allocated by the federal government for that purpose.Gruening, Ernest. Many Battles: The Autobiography of Ernest Gruening. New York, Liveright. p. 496. Preliminary estimates said the project would cost $900 million (1959 dollars) and generate 4.7 million kilowatts of electricity. At the time, the largest hydroelectric project in Alaska was the Eklutna Dam, which produced just 32,000 kilowatts.Staff Report. Alaska Construction & Oil, August 1984. \\"The dam that never was ...\\" Page 30. The project competed with the smaller-scale Susitna Hydroelectric Project proposed by the Federal Bureau of Reclamation for south- central Alaska, but thanks to Gruening's support and that of other backers, the Rampart project took precedence. The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1960 passed by the U.S. Congress in that year included a $2 million appropriation to conduct a full four-year feasibility study of the project, including its economic feasibility and the impact it would have on fish and wildlife.Coates, p. 136 In March 1961, a team of engineers from the Corps' Alaska district began drilling operations at the site to determine bedrock depth and gather other data.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District. Data on Rampart Canyon Project Studies. Anchorage, Alaska. May 27, 1961. p. 11 To examine the economic feasibility of the dam, the Corps of Engineers created the Rampart Economic Advisory Board (REAB) in February 1961. The REAB hired David E. Lilienthal's Development and Resources Corporation in April to complete the study, and a team of Corps engineers and REAB members arrived in the state in June to study the Rampart project first-hand. At that time, Sen. Gruening estimated that the project would cost roughly $1.2 billion to complete. As investigation and planning work continued, the Corps of Engineers reached an agreement with the Department of the Interior, the parent agency of the Bureau of Reclamation, in March 1962. The agreement stated the Corps would have responsibility for design and construction of the project, while the Interior Department would be responsible for running and maintaining the dam after completion. In the planning stages, the Interior Department also would be responsible for examining the economic feasibility of the project and its effect upon natural resources.Stahr, Edward V. and Udall, Stewart. \\"Memorandum of agreement\\", U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. March 14, 1962. This agreement negated much of the work of the REAB to that point,Coates, p. 141 as the Interior Department promptly began its own three-year study of the dam's economic feasibility and environmental impact. The DRC report, though trumped by the Interior Department's new precedence in such matters, nevertheless released a report in April 1962, stating that the project was economically feasible and would attract new industries to Alaska.Development and Resources Corporation. The Market for Rampart Power, Yukon River, Alaska. Government Publishing Office, Washington, D.C. April 23, 1962. Meanwhile, the Corps of Engineers continued engineering studies. The interim Corps of Engineers report was released in December 1963, and reported that building the dam was feasible from an engineering standpoint. President John F. Kennedy supported the project, and lobbied for an appropriation of $197,000 (1963 dollars) to continue study of the project. The needed money was included in a House appropriations bill, and studies continued.Davies, Lawrence E. \\"Alaskans press for a hydroelectric dam on Yukon\\", The New York Times. December 1, 1963, p. 174. The initial report included some figures about the size of the project. The dam would be a concrete structure high and about long. It would raise the height of the Yukon River from above sea level to approximately . The resulting reservoir would be long, wide, and have a surface area greater than that of Lake Erie. The power facilities for the project would produce a maximum of 5 gigawatts of electricity.Davies, Lawrence E. \\"Controversy rages over plans for big Alaska power project\\", The New York Times. August 22, 1964, p. 25. In total, the proposed reservoir was anticipated to cover an area of and have a capacity of .Staff report. \\"Hydroelectric power for Alaska\\", The Illinois Technograph. February 1962. Volume 76, No. 5. In April 1964, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) released its report on the project. Though only a part of the larger Department of the Interior study, the FWS report came down strongly opposed to the dam on the grounds that it would irrevocably destroy the Yukon Flats, a critical waterfowl breeding ground.Coates, p. 148 In January 1965, the Bureau of Land Management set aside almost of land for construction of the dam and reservoir.U.S. Department of the Interior. \\"Rampart Canyon power site lands in Alaska classified\\", U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service press release. January 12, 1965. It was a typical process that had been done for other dam projects several times before, but the amount of land to be set aside generated several months of hearings before the decision.Coates, p. 147 In June 1964 the Natural Resources Council asked Stephen H. Spurr, dean of the Graduate School of the University of Michigan and an authority on forestry and forest ecology, to form a group to evaluate the proposed Rampart Dam. The Spurr report determined that the scenarios offered as justification for the project were overly optimistic with respect to Alaska's projected long-term population growth, its per capita use of electricity, and the predicted rate of entry of electroprocess industries like the aluminum industry (which had substantial power requirements) into Alaska. Moreover, the proposed dam would have greatly reduced the catch of five species of Pacific salmon, especially the chinook (king), chum (dog) and coho (silver) salmon. It would also eliminate vast numbers of migratory waterfowl, including an estimated 1.5 million ducks and 12,500 geese that migrated annually from the Yukon flats. There would also have been a sharp decline in both large mammals - the moose, black and grizzly bear, and caribou - and smaller mammals: muskrats, mink, beavers, and river otters in aquatic habitats, and marten, wolverines, weasels, lynx, snowshoe hares, red fox and red squirrels in terrestrial or upland habitats. Spurr's report noted: \\"[It]is a truism of wildlife ecology that displacement of a population from the area where it normally lives is tantamount to eliminating it completely. Adjoining habitats ordinarily are carrying all the wildlife that the local resources will support. In short, loss of habitat is synonymous with loss of the animal population supported by the inundated habitat.\\"Rampart Dam and the Economic Development of Alaska (Ann Arbor: the University of Michigan School of Natural Resources, March 1966) at 49. In March 1966 Spurr's team issued its final report, finding that the dam was not a cost-effective investment.See generally Stephen J. Spurr, In Search of the Kuskokwim, and Other Great Endeavors: the Life and Times of J. Edward Spurr (Kenmore, Washington: Epicenter Press, 2010). In January 1965, the Department of the Interior completed its three- volume, 1,000-page study of the Rampart project's feasibility and impact. The Fish and Wildlife study released in 1964 was included, as were studies of the impact on the region's Alaska Native population.Department of the Interior. Rampart Project, Alaska: Market for Power and Effect of Project on Natural Resources. Field Study Report 998, Washington, D.C. January 1965. United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall then created a task force to review the findings before he made a final decision.Coates, p. 149 Throughout 1965 and 1966, opponents and proponents of the project funded studies of their own, aimed either at supporting or rejecting the arguments for the dam.Coates, p. 151 In June 1967, the Department of the Interior made its final recommendation and suggested that the dam not be built. Secretary Udall cited the fish and wildlife losses that would result, the availability of less- costly alternatives, and the fact that no recreational benefits would accrue.Coates, p. 153  Final design  An architectural drawing of the final Rampart Dam plan, created by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Despite the Interior Department's rejection of the overall Rampart Dam project, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continued its engineering feasibility study on the project. That plan was completed on June 25, 1971, and it included most of the previous federal documents pertaining to the project, including the electricity market studies published by the Department of the Interior in 1965, the Fish and Wildlife study of 1964, and other studies about the economic feasibility of the project. A detailed description of potential construction methods and the overall plan for the project were included, as were reports about the site's geography and hydrology. In total, the report encompassed two volumes including more than 480 pages.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Notice of Completion of Report on the Rampart Canyon Project. Washington, D.C. June 25, 1971. Because the construction season at the site is only five months, the Corps of Engineers projected that several decades would be needed to build the dam and associated structures.Corps of Engineers, p. 16 = Preparation = Due to the lack of any land transportation route to the dam site, the first stage of construction would have involved the building of a temporary road from Eureka, about away, to the dam site. Consideration also was given to the extension of the Alaska Railroad from Fairbanks to the site.Corps of Engineers, p. 17 A period of about four years would have been required for preconstruction planning, including detailed construction surveying and finalizing the design of the dam, powerhouse, and other structures. Engineers estimated that after the four years of final planning and surveying, three years would be needed to dig river diversion tunnels and construct the cofferdams needed to clear the Yukon River streambed for construction. Housing and construction offices also would have been constructed for workers on the south bank of the site, and the cost for this effort was included in overall cost proposals for the project.Corps of Engineers, p. D-3 = Construction = Site clearing and foundation work would have been scheduled to begin after completion of the diversion work in the seventh year of the project. The first pouring of concrete was scheduled for the project's eighth year, and work on the powerhouse would have begun in the 11th year. Owing to the large size of the reservoir, engineers estimated that the diversion tunnels would be closed in the 13th year, allowing construction to pace the filling of the new lake. The reservoir would have reached a pool elevation of in the 21st year, the dam would have been completed to elevation in the 25th year, and the reservoir would have been filled to the full level in the 31st year after the project's start. The installation of power generators was planned to follow as needed, with the last unit scheduled for installation by the 45th year of the project. In total, the dam would have consisted of a concrete gravity structure with a structural height of and a hydraulic height of . At the elevation of , the dam would have stretched for from north to south. On the south bank would have been a concrete gravity spillway with a crest at elevation and a maximum flow of at maximum pool elevation.Corps of Engineers, p. D-1 The power facilities would have consisted of twenty-two 266,000 kilowatt units and two 10,000 kilowatt service units.Corps of Engineers, pp. D-1, D-2 Materially, building the dam would have required of concrete aggregate, of rock fill, and another of various other types of fill. Engineers suggested that some of the material could be found at the site, but the remainder would have to be brought from outside sources.Corps of Engineers, p. 203 = Reservoir = At the projected pool elevation of , the resulting reservoir would have had a total capacity of . The full pool length would have been about , and the maximum width would have been . The resulting lake would have had approximately 3,600 miles (5,800 km) of shoreline and a total surface area of about .Corps of Engineers, p. D-2 Because the Yukon also is a transportation route, transshipment facilities were planned for below and above the dam site and would have been connected by road and rail links. Because of the large size of the proposed reservoir and the need to allow some flow of the Yukon River downstream of the dam site for river navigation and fishing, engineers anticipated that filling the reservoir would take no fewer than 16 years to complete.Corps of Engineers, p. B-23 = Anticipated costs = The Rampart Dam's large size had a correspondingly large price tag. The Corps of Engineers anticipated spending $618.4 million (1970 dollars) on construction of the physical dam alone, another $492 million for power-generating equipment, and $1.39 billion in total.Corps of Engineers, p. 18 That total included $15.59 million for relocating Alaskans from the area to be flooded, $56 million for fish and wildlife facilities to mitigate the anticipated losses, and $39.7 million for roads and bridges to access the area. After completion of the dam, the Corps of Engineers estimated that operation and maintenance of the project would cost $6.5 million annually, including $570,000 for replacement power equipment and $2 million for the maintenance of fish and wildlife facilities.Corps of Engineers, p. D-6  Weather effects  From the initial planning stages, proponents and opponents speculated that the large size of the reservoir created by the dam could affect the weather in Interior Alaska and the Yukon. Several studies were conducted in regards to these potential changes, and most of the reports hypothesized an effect similar to the weather that occurs around Great Slave Lake and Lake Baikal, both of which were of similar sizes and latitudes to the proposed reservoir. Forecasts predicted the lake would hold in heat longer during the autumn, thus keeping area temperatures slightly warmer than normal. In the spring, however, the area around the lake would have been prone to increased precipitation due to the phenomenon of lake-effect snow. In the summer, the long periods of daylight would have caused the land around the lake to become warmer than the lake itself, also creating the possibility of storms.Streten, N.A. \\"Aspects of winter temperatures in Interior Alaska\\" (PDF). pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca. University of Calgary. Retrieved January 28, 2009.  Supporters  Support for the dam project came from a variety of sources, but supporters tended to use three primary arguments in favor of its construction: the electricity generated by the project would be cheap and plentiful, industries would be attracted to Alaska by the cheap electricity, and the dam's construction would have minimal impact on the environment and human populations.Coates, pp. 143-153. During the campaign that preceded the 1960 U.S. Presidential election, both candidates‚ÄîRichard Nixon and John F. Kennedy‚Äîmade campaign stops in Alaska. Both men gave their support to the Rampart Dam project, with Kennedy saying, \\"I see the greatest dam in the free world at Rampart Canyon, producing twice the power of the Tennessee Valley Authority to light homes and mills and cities and farms all over Alaska.\\"Kennedy, John F. \\"Remarks of Senator John F. Kennedy at Edgewater Hotel, Anchorage, Alaska\\", John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. September 3, 1960. Retrieved June 2, 2015.

In 1960, Harold Moats of the Corps' Alaska district said, \\"Rampart Canyon, the big one, is Alaska's most valuable resource, and as it is developed, Alaska will take her rightful place in the family of states contributing richly to the economy of the nation and the welfare of the whole free world.\\"Palmer, p. 90 In early September 1963, a group of Alaska businesspeople, local government leaders, and industry representatives met at McKinley Park Lodge to organize lobbying efforts in favor of the dam. The resulting organization was called the Yukon Corporation for Power for America, later shortened to Yukon Power for America, Inc.Special to The New York Times. \\"Alaskans press big dam project\\", The New York Times.

The organization began with a $100,000 budget, which it used to produce \\"The Rampart Story\\", a color brochure distributed in Alaska and Washington, D.C. to promote the dam project.Brooks, p. 54. Alaska senator Ernest Gruening remained a staunch backer of the project from its inception to its cancellation, and made it a major personal political priority.Coates p. 135. Gruening led a coalition of Alaska lawmakers that included most of the Alaska Legislature. In the 1962 Alaska state elections, every candidate elected to the state legislature was a supporter of the project. In the years that followed, the Alaska Legislature voted several times to allocate state funding for the project.Coates, p. 146 Politicians at the city level also got into the action, as the city of Anchorage and the Fairbanks Public Utilities Board each voted to contribute $10,000 to a pro-Rampart organization.Coates, p. 143 Among the group's members was Ted Stevens, who was appointed in 1968 as one of Alaska's representatives to the U.S. Senate.U.S. Senate. \\"Stevens, Theodore F. (Ted)\\", Bioguide.congress.gov. Retrieved January 31, 2009. = Electrical argument = As planned, the dam would have produced roughly 34 terawatt hours annually, nearly 50 times the total energy use for the entire state of Alaska in 1960 (700 gigawatt hours).Brewer, p. 2 Gruening, in particular, believed that the dam would have an effect similar to that of the Tennessee Valley Authority in the 1930s, with cheap electricity providing the economic basis of the region. Dam proponents also suggested that the electricity might be transmitted to the rest of the United States, lowering utility prices in those states by increasing the amount of available power. Anthony Netboy, a salmon biologist employed by Yukon Power for America, claimed that one day, \\"a housewife in Phoenix or L.A. will fry her eggs at breakfast with electricity generated on the far-off Yukon.\\"Coates, p. 160 = Industrial argument = Supporters of the project suggested that the cheap electricity provided by the dam would be a strong enticement for electricity-intensive industries, such as aluminum smelting, to move to Alaska. They were encouraged by a 1962 economic feasibility study by the Development and Resources Corporation, which stated that the electricity generated would attract aluminum, magnesium and titanium industries to the region and help process locally produced minerals.DRC, pp. 9, 20‚Äì24, and 79‚Äì96 The report also stated that the dam would attract a wood pulp mill on at least a temporary basis to process the hundreds of millions of board feet of timber that would otherwise be lost as the dam's reservoir flooded.DRC, p. 96 The authors of the DRC report were specific enough to predict that 19,746 jobs would be created by the dam's construction‚Äînot including jobs opened during the construction process.DRC, pp. 102‚Äì103 Both the 1962 study, and another report by University of Michigan researcher Michael Brewer in 1966, stated that tens of thousands of jobs would be created by the construction process alone, even if the cheap electricity generated by the dam failed to attract any additional industries to Alaska.Brewer, p. 4 = Impact argument = At the time Rampart Dam was being considered, Alaska as a whole, and Interior Alaska in particular, was sparsely settled. The 1960 United States Census recorded just 226,127 people as residents of Alaska, making it the least-populated state in the United States at that time.U.S. Census. \\"1960 U.S. Census\\", (PDF p. 8) Census.gov.

An unnamed Gruening staffer once said the area to be flooded by the dam was worthless, containing \\"not more than ten flush toilets. Search the whole world and it would be difficult to find an equivalent area with so little to be lost through flooding.\\" In a 1963 letter responding to a Sports Illustrated article about the dam, Gruening wrote, > As for the 2,000 Athabascan Indians, they could not but be better off than > they are now.

In the same letter, Gruening also promoted the possibility of the dam creating a thriving tourism industry in Interior Alaska, a hypothesis that was raised by other dam supporters as well. Greuning stated that the project would be similar to Lake Powell, in that it would create a range of recreational activities, including water skiing and picnicking.Gruening, Ernest. \\"Speech to the Committee on Projects, National Rivers and Harbors Congress\\". 52nd national convention, June 9, 1965. Gruening Papers, University of Alaska Fairbanks.  Opposition  Opposition to the project was based on three separate objections to its construction: ecological, human, and financial.Coates, p. 139. Conservation groups opposed the dam's construction because it would flood the Yukon Flats, a large wetland area that provides breeding ground for millions of waterfowl and habitat for game and fur-bearing animals. Alaska Native groups objected to the project's human cost‚Äîthe need to relocate more than 1,500 people and 9 villages‚Äîand Native groups outside the reservoir area objected to the potential devastation of the Yukon River salmon population. The third objection to construction of the dam stemmed from its high cost and the belief that cheap electricity would not be enough to attract industry to Alaska. = Ecological objections = A map of the proposed Rampart reservoir drainage basin from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report opposed to the dam In late 1960, the Alaska Conservation Society became the first large conservation group to oppose construction of the dam. The organization believed the flooding of the Yukon Flats would cause critical damage to Alaska waterfowl and promoted the alternative Susitna Hydroelectric Project to supply Alaska's electric needs.Weeden, Robert B. \\"Conservation and Kilowatts\\", Alaska Conservation Society News Bulletin 2. May 1961. pp 3‚Äì5. This was followed in early 1961 by an Alaska Sportsmen's Council resolution that criticized the Corps of Engineers for reducing its funding for studies of the impact of the project on fish and game stocks.Staff Report. \\"Report on ASC's annual meeting\\", Alaska Conservation Society News Bulletin 2. January 1961. p. 6 In April of that year, Alaska Sportsman magazine took a formal stand against the project.Coates, p. 140 The California Fish and Game Commission was among the first non-Alaska conservation groups to oppose construction of the dam, saying in 1963 that it would inundate the Yukon Flats, an area of wetlands that is among North America's largest waterfowl breeding grounds. Following that objection, other groups began to organize during the 1963 North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference. Fifteen conservation groups pooled a total of $25,000 at the meetingPalmer, p. 91. to begin an independent scientific study of the project and start an opposition campaign.Vileisis, p. 230 In the spring of 1964, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released a report on the impact of dam construction on the Flats. The report strongly opposed construction of the dam, saying in part, \\"Nowhere in the history of water development in North America have the fish and wildlife losses anticipated to result from a single project been so overwhelming.\\" The report also pointed out the threat the dam would pose to the Yukon River's large salmon population, which swim upstream each year to spawn. Arthur Laing, Canada's minister of northern affairs and natural resources, also expressed alarm at the potential waterfowl losses and the threat the dam posed to Canada's portion of the Yukon River salmon population.Laing, Arthur. \\"WaterfowlA Resource in Danger\\", 37th annual convention of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters. Ottawa, Canada. February 19, 1965. A May 1965 article in The Atlantic magazine by author Paul Brooks illustrated the growing protests of conservationists concerned about the project. After traveling the Yukon River, Brooks hypothesized that construction of the dam would be catastrophic from an ecological and human standpoint, would cost an exorbitant amount of money, and that the claims of attracting industry and tourism to Alaska were greatly exaggerated.Brooks, pp. 53‚Äì59. In real terms, he estimated that construction of the dam would eliminate the habitat for 1.5 million ducks, 12,500 geese, 10,000 cranes, 270,000 salmon, 12,000 moose, and seven percent of Alaska's fur-bearing animals.Brooks, p. 57.

Retrieved June 2, 2015. = Human objections = In planning the dam project, engineers anticipated that building the dam would flood nine Alaska Native villages, forcing the relocation of an estimated 1,500 people.Fast, Phyllis Ann. Northern Athabascan survival: Women, Community, and the Future. University of Nebraska Press, 2002. p. 75. Although some of the affected villagers felt the increased job opportunities would outweigh the forced move, most objected to the potential loss of the region's history. Among the affected villages was Fort Yukon, which is the oldest English-speaking settlement in Alaska. In 1964, several groups of Native dam opponents in the Yukon Flats came together to form an organization called Gwitchya Gwitchin Ginkhye, which lobbied against the project. The Tundra Times, an Alaska newspaper devoted to Native issues, also came out strongly in opposition to the project, saying that all but one village from the head of the proposed reservoir to the mouth of the Yukon River were against the dam. Don Young, Alaska's representative to the U.S. House of Representatives, was elected to the Alaska Legislature in 1964 from Fort Yukon on a platform of opposition to Rampart Dam. A survey of the archeological and paleontological potential of the Yukon Flats, conducted in 1965, objected to the potential loss of the area. In part, it said, \\"... it may be said that relatively speaking, the archaeological potential of the Rampart Impoundment area is great; the practical difficulties of field work will have to be overcome in order to obviate the possible loss of what may be some of the most important prehistoric records in North America.\\"West, p. 131 The Canadian government also strongly opposed the Rampart Dam project. According to the Treaty of Washington, signed in 1871, Canada was allowed free navigation of the Yukon River.W. Stewart Wallace, ed. The Encyclopedia of Canada, Vol. VI. Toronto, University Associates of Canada. 1948, pp. 259‚Äì260. It was feared that construction of the dam would block navigation routes and violate the treaty.Coates, p. 150 = Financial objections = Opposition to the dam project also arose in concern of the dam's cost. Several United States congressmen and fiscal conservatives protested the proposal on the grounds that the money that would be spent on its construction would be better used to support other projects. They pointed to the lack of existing infrastructure in the region and said it was unlikely that enough electricity generated by the dam could be sold at a high enough price to pay for its construction. In his 1966 analysis of the project's economic feasibility, Michael Brewer refuted the conclusions of the 1962 federal study, saying that the ability of the dam to pay for itself was \\"an exercise in speculation\\". He also wrote that even if the dam was built and cheap electricity made available, \\"Alaska did not possess a competitive advantage\\".Brewer, p. 3 He concluded by saying that the project was \\"not economically efficient\\". Because of arguments like these, the common belief among informed observers outside Alaska was that the project was designed to benefit Alaska alone, and thus could almost be considered \\"foreign aid.\\"Editorial.

Cancellation  Owing to increasing public pressure, in June 1967, United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall announced he was strongly opposed to the dam, citing economic and biological factors as well as the drastic impact on the area's native population.Blair, William M. \\"Dam on the Yukon stymied by Udall\\", The New York Times.

Though this effectively ended the project, planning continued to go ahead until the final Army Corps of Engineers report was released in 1971 and recommended the project \\"not be undertaken at this time\\".Coates, p. 154 Alaska governor William Allen Egan protested the statement, saying the report was out of date due to population growth in Alaska and rising demand for electricity. The report was duly reconsidered, but in 1978, the Army Corps of Engineers confirmed the project no longer was justified. The audited report was accepted by the U.S. Senate, and no further funding was allocated to study the issue.LaBerge, Walter B. \\"Letter to Jennings Randolph, Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works\\".

In summer 1985, the last remnants of the dam project were eliminated when the 8.96 million acres (36,300 km2) set aside for development of the dam were released by the Bureau of Land Management for other uses.Laing, Christine. Alaska from the Inside, \\"Rampart Canyon power site to be revoked\\". June 5, 1985. Page 4.  Legacy  The controversy surrounding the Rampart Dam project illustrated the growing shift in the environmental movement during the 1960s. Rather than becoming focused singularly on solely preserving the natural beauty of a particular landscape, as had inspired the creation of the U.S. National Park Service in the United States during the first half of the twentieth century, naturalists and environmentalists began to consider the human cost of development as well.Coates, p. 158 Though opposition to Rampart was founded primarily on economic and natural grounds, it consequences for the Alaska Native population in the region reflected later concerns about industrial development in more urban areas. Among Alaska Natives, the Rampart Dam project encouraged organization and the creation of communications links between various like- minded communities and tribal groups. When the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was proposed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Native organizations that had formed to oppose Rampart Dam were revived in opposition to the pipeline. Only after Native land claims were recognized in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act did the pipeline progress.Coates, pp. 160-161  See also  * List of reservoirs and dams of Alaska  Footnotes  * The Corps of Engineers defined the construction season as the period in which average temperatures at the site were above the freezing point of water.

Identification of micro-moth families Dorsal surface of the abdomen has very narrow scales.British Lepidoptera Biology The adults fly from May to July depending on the location; they appear to be predominantly or exclusively nocturnal and can be attracted by light. Caterpillars stay in a portable case. Little is known about the food of its caterpillars.

Naram-Sin should not be confused with the Naram-Sin who had ruled Eshnunna for around twelve years (the successor and son, as identified on an inscription, of the long-reigning Ebiq-Adad II.) It is probable that Naram-Sin of Assur was, however, contemporaneous with the earlier part of Ebiq-Adad II‚Äôs reign (whose last attestation was in the Mari Eponym Chronicle B line 25 some 56 years after Naram-Sin‚Äôs inauguration.) Naram-Sin of Assyria was the son and successor of the short-reigning Puzur-Ashur II, filiation preserved in his seal impression on the envelopes of the waklum-letters to his expat Anatolian- based traders at the karum Kanesh and in the later Assyrian King Lists. The length of Naram-Sin's reign is uncertain, however; based on various excavated \\"limmu\\" (eponym) lists, the reigns of Naram-Sin and his son and successor Erishum II had a combined length of 64 years. The Assyrian King List records that Shamshi-Adad I, ‚Äúwent away to Babylonia in the time of Naram-Sin.‚Äù Shamshi-Adad I did not return until he had taken Ekallatum, after which he paused for three years and then overthrew Erishum II. The Mari Eponym Chronicle, which resumes the listing until the seizure of Ekallatum by Shamshi-Adad I, provides no clue as to when the succession of Erishum II had taken place. As the reign of Erishum II was prematurely ended by the conquests of Shamshi-Adad I, it is likely that Naram-Sin's reign was the greater part of the period, additionally; the broken figure on the Nassouhi King List ends on four, so perhaps Naram-Sin reigned 44 or 54 years (c. 1872 BC onward, middle chronology). Despite this, there are no extant monumental inscriptions recording his activities. The following is a list of the last 27 annually- elected limmu officials listed on the extant K√ºltepe Eponym Lists (KEL) representing Naram-Sin's first years (ending nearly a decade before Naram- Sin's 35th year during which the karum Kanesh was destroyed c. 1837 BC, the II layer.) The city-state of Assur which Naram-Sin had inherited would have been fairly wealthy as the hub of the trading network at the height of the Old Assyrian Empire's activity and despite the destruction of the trading post at Kanesh partway through his reign, commerce apparently continued elsewhere. A gap of up to four years is apparent between the end of the KEL and the beginning of the Mari Eponym Chronicle (MEC B.) There are no extant monumental inscriptions recording his activities.

Geography Herzegovina in spring ƒåvrsnica The terrain of Herzegovina is mostly hilly karst with high mountains in the north such as ƒåvrsnica and Prenj, except for the central valley of the river Neretva. The largest city is Mostar, in the center of the region. Other larger towns include Trebinje, Stolac, ≈†iroki Brijeg, Posu≈°je, Ljubu≈°ki, Grude, Konjic, and ƒåapljina. Borders between Herzegovina and Bosnia are unclear and often disputed. The upper reaches of the River Neretva lie in northern Herzegovina, a heavily forested area with fast-flowing rivers and high mountains. Konjic and Jablanica lie in this area. The Neretva rises on Lebr≈°nik Mountain, close to the Montenegro border, and as the river flows west, it enters Herzegovina. The entire upper catchment of the Neretva constitutes a precious ecoregion with many endemic and endangered species. The river carves through the precipitous karst terrain, providing excellent opportunities for rafting and kayaking, while the spectacular scenery of the surrounding mountains and forests is a challenging hiking terrain. The Neretva's tributaries in the upper reaches are mostly short, due to the mountainous terrain: the River Rakitnica has cut a deep canyon, its waters being one of the least explored areas in this part of Europe. The Rakitnica flows into Neretva upstream from Konjic. The Neretva then flows northwest, through Konjic. It enters the Jablanica Reservoir (Jablaniƒçko jezero), one of the largest in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The lake ends near the town of Jablanica. From here on, the Neretva turns southward, continuing to the Adriatic Sea. With the mountains lining its shores gradually receding, the Neretva enters a valley where the city of Mostar lies. It flows under the old bridge (Stari most) and continues, now wider, toward the town of ƒåapljina and the Neretva Delta in Croatia before emptying into the Adriatic Sea. Cities Mostar is the best-known urban area and the official capital. It is the only city with over 100,000 citizens. There are no other large cities in Herzegovina, though some have illustrious histories. Stolac, for example, is perhaps Herzegovina's oldest city. Settlements date from the Paleolithic period (Badanj Cave). An Illyrian tribe lived in the city of Daorson. There were several Roman settlements alongside the Bregava River and medieval inhabitants left large stone grave monuments called steƒáak in Radimlja. Trebinje, on the Trebi≈°njica River, is the southernmost city in Bosnia and Herzegovina, near the Montenegro border. ƒåapljina and Ljubu≈°ki are known for their history and their rivers; the village of Meƒëugorje has religious importance for many Roman Catholics. Administration In the modern Herzegovinian state, Herzegovina is divided between two entities, Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Republika Srpska's part of Herzegovina, commonly referred to as East Herzegovina or, as of late, \\"Trebinje Region\\", is administratively divided into municipalities of Trebinje, Bileƒáa, Gacko, Nevesinje, Ljubinje, Berkoviƒái, Istoƒçni Mostar and Foƒça. Within the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Herzegovina is administratively divided between the cantons of Herzegovina-Neretva and West Herzegovina.

Population The locals of Herzegovina are known by the demonym Herzegovinians (Serbo-Croatian: / ; / , / ). While the population of Herzegovina throughout history has been ethnically mixed, the Bosnian War in the 1990s resulted in mass ethnic cleansing and large-scale displacement of people. The last pre-war census in 1991 recorded a population of 437,095 inhabitants. Ethnic composition of Herzegovina in 1991Official results from the book: * Croats generally populate the areas closest to the Croatian border focused on Mostar, Ljubu≈°ki, ≈†iroki Brijeg, ƒåitluk, Grude, Posu≈°je, ƒåapljina, Neum, Stolac, Ravno, Tomislavgrad and Prozor-Rama * Bosniaks mainly live in the areas along the Neretva, such as Mostar, Konjic and Jablanica, to a significant extent in Stolac, ƒåapljina and Prozor-Rama, and to a lesser extent in Nevesinje, Gacko, Trebinje, Tomislavgrad and Ljubu≈°ki. * Serbs are the majority in eastern Herzegovina, including the municipalities of Berkoviƒái, Bileƒáa, Gacko, Istoƒçni Mostar, Ljubinje, Nevesinje, and Trebinje. History Slavs settled in the Balkans in the 7th century. What later became known as Herzegovina was divided between Croatia, Zachlumia and Travunija in the Early Middle Ages. Parts of the region were later ruled by various medieval rulers, with the eastern part mostly within Medieval Serbia, and the western part in the Kingdom of Croatia. During the 13th and 14th centuries the Bosnian bans Stjepan I Kotromaniƒá and Stjepan II Kotromaniƒá joined these regions to the Bosnian state, with the King Tvrtko I Kotromaniƒá extending territories even further, beyond what is modern-day Herzegovina proper. During these times, parts of Herzegovina, or Hum, as it was called at the time, were ruled by powerful Bosnian magnates of Kosaƒça and Vukoviƒá families, most notably by Vlatko Vukoviƒá, Sandalj Hraniƒá, and Sandalj's nephew Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá of the Bosnian family ruled the Hum region independently, only nominally recognizing Bosnian overlordship. In a document sent to Frederick III on January 20, 1448, Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá was titled Herzog (duke) of Saint Sava, lord of Hum and Littoral, Grand duke of the Bosnian kingdom. Following the Ottomans conquest and fall of Bosnian Kingdom, Duchy of Hum became known as Herzog's lands or Herzegovina. =Ottoman period= Flag of the Herzegovina Eyalet (1833‚Äì1851) In 1482, the lands of Stefan Vukƒçiƒá's successors were occupied by Ottoman forces. The Ottomans were the first to begin officially using the name Herzegovina (Hersek) for the region. The Bosnian beylerbey Isa-beg Ishakoviƒá mentioned the name in a letter from 1454. In the Ottoman Empire, Herzegovina was organized as a sanjak, the Sanjak of Herzegovina, within the Bosnia Eyalet. According to the Turkish census of Herzegovina from 1477, some villages were mentioned as being \\"in the possession of Vlachs,\\" while others, were listed as \\"Serb settlements\\" and mostly deserted.Sima ƒÜirkoviƒá; (2004) The Serbs p. 130; Wiley-Blackwell, During the Long War (1591‚Äì1606), Serbs rose up in Herzegovina (1596‚Äì97), but they were quickly suppressed after their defeat at the field of Gacko. The Candian War of 1645 to 1669 caused great damage to the region as the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire fought for control over Dalmatia and coastal Herzegovina. As a result of the Treaty of Karlowitz of 1699, the Ottomans gained access to the Adriatic Sea through the Neum-Klek coastal area. The Republic of Dubrovnik ceded this to distance themselves from the Venetian Republic's influence. The Ottomans benefitted from this in gaining the region's salt. As a result of the Bosnian Uprising (1831‚Äì32), the Vilayet was split to form the separate Herzegovina Eyalet, ruled by semi-independent vizier Ali-pa≈°a Rizvanbegoviƒá. After his death, the eyalets of Bosnia and Herzegovina were merged. The new joint entity was after 1853 commonly referred to as Bosnia and Herzegovina. Serbs in the region revolted against the Ottomans (1852‚Äì62) and were aided by the Montenegrins, who sought the liberation of the Serb people from Ottoman rule. The Herzegovinian Serbs frequently rose up against the Ottoman rule; culminating in the Herzegovina Uprising (1875-78), which was supported by the Principality of Serbia and Montenegro. Montenegro did succeed in liberating and annexing large parts of Herzegovina before the Berlin Congress of 1878, including the Nik≈°iƒá area; the historical Herzegovina region annexed to Montenegro is known as East or Old Herzegovina. =Modern history= As a result of the Treaty of Berlin (1878), Herzegovina, along with Bosnia, were occupied by Austria-Hungary, only nominally remaining under Ottoman rule. The historical Herzegovina region in the Principality of Montenegro was known as East or Old Herzegovina. The Serb population of Herzegovina and Bosnia hoped for annexation to Serbia and Montenegro. The Franciscan order opened the first university in Herzegovina in 1895 in Mostar. Flag of Herzegovina in Austria-Hungary In 1908, Austria- Hungary annexed the province, leading to the Bosnian Crisis, an international dispute which barely failed to precipitate a world war immediately, and was an important step in the buildup of international tensions during the years leading up to the First World War. The assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand came as a direct result of the resentment of the Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina against Austro-Hungarian rule. During World War I, Herzegovina was a scene of inter-ethnic conflict. During the war, the Austro-Hungarian government formed ≈†uckori, Muslim para-militia units. ≈†uckori units were especially active in Herzegovina. Persecution of Serbs conducted by the Austro-Hungarian authorities was the first incidence of active \\"ethnic cleansing\\" in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1918, Herzegovina became a part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia). In 1941 Herzegovina fell once again under the rule of the fascist Independent State of Croatia. During World War II, Herzegovina was a battleground between fascist Croat Usta≈°e, royalist Serb ƒåetniks, and the communist Yugoslav Partisans; Herzegovina was a part of the Independent State of Croatia, administratively divided into the counties of Hum and Dubrava, then in 1945, PR Bosnia and Herzegovina became one of the republics of Second Yugoslavia. It remained so until the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. During the Bosnian War, large parts of western and central Herzegovina came under control of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosnia (which later joined the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) while eastern Herzegovina became a part of Republika Srpska.

Based in Cathays Park, Cardiff, the Commission completed its work in July 2010, publishing its findings in a final report: Fairness and accountability: a new funding settlement for Wales.  Remit  The remit of the Commission was to look at the pros and cons of the present formula-based approach to the distribution of public expenditure resources to the Welsh Assembly Government; and identify possible alternative funding mechanisms including the scope for the Welsh Assembly Government to have tax varying powers as well as greater powers to borrow.  Members  The Commission comprised: *Gerald Holtham (Chair), Managing Partner of Cadwyn Capital LLP and a visiting Professor at Cardiff Business School. *David Miles, Member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee and visiting Professor of Financial Economics at Imperial College London. *Paul Bernd Spahn, Professor Emeritus of Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and macro fiscal advisor to governments across the world.  Findings and recommendations  The Commission began its work in autumn 2008 and published its first report in July 2009.Press notice announcing the first report In its first report, the Commission concluded that the Barnett Formula lacked any objective justification and had survived for reasons of political and administrative convenience. The Commission argued that the formula has caused relative funding per capita for devolved activities in Wales to converge towards the average level of funding in England (the \\"Barnett squeeze\\") despite relatively higher Welsh needs. The Commission recommended that in the future funding arrangements for Wales should be based on relative needs. As an interim measure, it recommended a modification to the existing formula that would place a \\"floor\\" under the block grant, preventing any further convergence towards the average English level of funding per capita.Final Report Summary, page 5 In its final report, published in July 2010, the Commission recommended that: * the Assembly Government should pursue the introduction of a needs- based formula for determining the Welsh block grant;Final Report Summary, page 20 * the Assembly Government should acquire limited powers to vary income tax rates in Wales;Final Report Summary, page 32 * the Assembly Government should seek a discussion with the UK Government about the feasibility of devolving corporation tax;Final Report Summary, page 35 * stamp duty should be devolved to Wales; * capital gains tax on property and land should be devolved to Wales, if the administrative costs are not prohibitive; * the Assembly Government should consider the reform of Council Tax; * local authorities should be given discretion to levy a higher council tax on second homes;Final Report Summary, page 39 * landfill tax, air passenger duty and aggregates levy should be devolved to Wales if deemed useful;Final Report Summary, page 40 * a procedure should be created to enable Parliament to confer power on the National Assembly to introduce new taxes in Wales when requested;Final Report Summary, page 41 and, * the Assembly Government should receive limited powers to borrow to finance capital expenditure;Final Report Summary, page 45  Reception  Public Finance magazine reported that the Holtham Commission's final report was welcomed by Labour, Conservative and Plaid Cymru politicians ‚Äì although Welsh Business and Budget Minister Jane Hutt was said to have given a more \\"muted\\" response to Holtham's recommendation that the Assembly Government should gain tax-varying powers. Former First Minister Rhodri Morgan opposed this idea, arguing that there was \\"no mandate\\" for tax-varying powers in the 1997 devolution referendum. James Mitchell of Strathclyde University called the Holtham Commission's conclusions \\"remarkably bold... its proposals on income tax are, in important respects, bolder than those proposed by Calman\\" (the commission created in 2007 to review Scottish devolution). Mitchell noted that Holtham's critique of the Barnett formula, which he regards as advantageous to Scotland, \\"ought to be a wake-up call\\".

Hers is generally regarded as one of the greatest voices ever produced in Australia. She died of cancer at the height of her career, at the age of 50. Riedel was born in Carlingford, New South Wales (in north-western Sydney). She gained a Diploma of Music Education at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, and taught for some time at Riverstone High School. She joined the chorus of Opera Australia (OA) in 1983. She won a number of important competitions, which enabled her to study overseas. Back in Australia, she sang mezzo roles with Victoria State Opera and West Australian Opera. At OA, her mentor Richard Bonynge guided her transition from mezzo to soprano. She first came to notice when she sang Leila in Georges Bizet's The Pearl Fishers with Victoria State Opera in 1986. This was backed up with Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro with OA in 1989. That year, she was so successful from her auditions in Europe that she was forced to refuse a number of offers. She sang with such opera companies as the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, Paris Opera, Geneva Opera, Bavarian State Opera, Rome Opera, Vienna State Opera, and many others. She won the inaugural Givenchy French Operatic Award in 1994. Her American debut that year was as Amina in La sonnambula in San Diego. She also appeared with the Metropolitan Opera and San Francisco Opera. Her work in Australia included roles in The Magic Flute, Don Giovanni, Maria Stuarda, Norma, La traviata, Il trovatore, La boh√®me, Tosca, Faust, The Tales of Hoffmann, Turandot and others. Internationally she sang the Marschallin in Der Rosenkavalier and Ellen Orford in Peter Grimes. In 2004, she was Sieglinde in the first modern Australian production of Wagner's Ring Cycle, by the State Opera of South Australia.

They were absorbed in 1949 into the Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany as their Class 99.463.  History  In 1913 and 1914 the Pomeranian provincial authorities, who had running powers for the following narrow gauge lines, bought a total of eight eight-coupled locomotives from Vulcan in Stettin grouping them as Class M: * Kleinbahn Casekow‚ÄìPenkun‚ÄìOder (1) * Greifswald‚ÄìJarmener Kleinbahn (GJK) (1) * R√ºgensche Kleinbahn (R√ºKB) (2) * Demminer Kleinbahn West (2) * Demminer Kleinbahn Ost (1) * Kleinbahn Greifswald‚ÄìWolgast (1). Because they proved themselves well, in 1925 a second locomotive was procured for both the GJK and the R√ºKB. These two engines were amongst the first superheated steam locomotives, unlike the first batch. They were therefore classified as the Mh. Because the superheated locomotives performed even better, in 1928 the R√ºKB decided to convert their older machines to superheating. After the R√ºKB was taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1949, the three engines were given the new running numbers 99 4631 to 99 4633.

He captured the oppidum of Metlosedum (possibly present-day Melun), and crossed the Seine to attack the Gallic coalition near Lutetia. Threatened by the Bellovaci (a powerful Belgae tribe), he decided to re-cross the Seine to rejoin Caesar's force at Agedincum (Sens). Feinting a general retreat, Labienus in fact crossed the river. The Gauls of the Seine coalition tried to block his path to Caesar and battle was joined. Battle After the first shock of battle, the Seventh Legion placed on the right wing started to push back their opponents. On the Roman left, the Twelfth Legion's pilum volleys broke up the Gauls first charge, but they resisted the Romans advance, encouraged by their old chieftain Camulogenus. The turning point came when the military tribunes of the Seventh Legion led their legionaries against the enemy rear. The Gauls sent in their reserves, taking a nearby hill, but were unable to reverse the course of the battle and took flight. Their losses increased when the Roman cavalry was sent to pursue them. Labienus's force thus advanced back to Agedincum, recaptured their baggage train along the way. Aftermath The Gauls tried to prevent Labienus from returning to Agedincum by blocking him at the Sequana river. Labienus used five cohorts to lure the Gauls away while he himself crossed the Sequana River with three legions.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico, VII, 61. When the Gauls found out there were two Roman armies in the area they split up and pursued both. The main body met Labienus who pinned them down with one legion while surrounding them with the rest. He then annihilated their reinforcements with his cavalry.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico, VII, 62.

Unlike in Oslo, where Kristiania Sporveisselskab had established a horsecar service using tram tracks, Trondhjems Omnibus chose to use conventional coaches with wheels. Each carriage had places for twelve seated passengers, in addition to five standing passengers at the back. If that was filled up, an additional three places were available at the front, along with the driver. The lack of tracks made it hard work, and the horses needed to be changed for each round trip. The route went every half hour, starting at 07 in the morning, with a quarterly headway during the afternoon. Carriages at Voldsminde After one year, 135,000 people had taken the service, giving a 12.5% dividend. By 1900, there were 400,000 annual passengers, and a 10-minute headway. It had 26 horses and seven coaches. But in 1901 the Trondheim Tramway opened, and Trondhjems Omnibus was forced to give up the profitable Ila‚ÄìVoldsminde route. Instead, it started with the 45-minute Voldsminde‚ÄìRailway Station‚ÄìBratt√∏ra‚Äì√òya route, but if failed to make a profit. In 1902, it tried to start a route from √òya to the railway station. The municipality, that owned the tramway, did not accept an ultimatum to purchase shares for NOK 10,000, or give an annual subsidy of NOK 1,000. However, the company started a cooperation with the tramway company, and they made a transfer ticket for NOK 0.15. This route was not profitable either, and operations terminated in 1902. The company also tried to start a steam bus route. It freighted up the bus Alpha from Bergen, but the bus would not work on the test run, and it was returned to Bergen after the horses had pulled it back down to Bratt√∏ra.

He was the uncle of Antoinette, Claudine, Fran√ßoise (a pastel artist) and Antoine Stella. Jacques Stella trained in Lyon before spending the period from 1616 to 1621 in the court of Cosimo II de Medici in Florence, working alongside Jacques Callot - Florentine art is a strong influence on all Stella's work. On Cosimo's death in 1621 Stella moved to Rome, where he spent the next 10 years and won a reputation thanks to his paintings, small engravings and painted work on stones (onyx, lapis-lazuli or simply slate). Particularly working for pope Urban VIII, Stella was influenced in Rome by classicism and more specifically by the art of Nicolas Poussin, with whom he became an intimate friend. The Rape of the Sabines, Princeton University Art Museum Returning to Lyon in 1634 before moving to Paris a year later, Stella was presented to Louis XIII by cardinal Richelieu. The king made him peintre du roi (meaning he lived from then on in the Louvre) and granted him a pension of 1000 livres. He returned many times to the theme of the childhood of Christ - five different versions by him of \\"Jesus discovered by his parents in the temple\\" exist.

Blaylock. It was published in 1986. It was the second book in Blaylock's loose steampunk trilogy, following The Digging Leviathan (1984) and preceding Lord Kelvin's Machine (1992). The book was originally published as an Ace paperback by the Berkeley Publishing Group and is included in the Adventures of Langon St. Ives collection. Blaylock used the book London Labour and the London Poor by Henry Mayhew to research the period setting. Plot summary A dirigible with a dead pilot has been passing over Victorian London in a decaying orbit for some years, arousing the interest of the Royal Society, as well as scientist-explorer Langdon St. Ives and the evangelist/counterfeiter Shiloh. Shiloh is convinced that the dirigible carries his father, a tiny space alien, but withholds this knowledge from vivisectionist Dr. Ignacio Narbondo, who he is paying to reanimate Shiloh's dead mother, none other than Joanna Southcott. Narbondo and the evil millionaire Kelso Drake have their own interest in the alien; Drake possesses its spacecraft, which he uses for perverse purposes in one of his chain of stop-and-go brothels. St. Ives and his friends of the Trismegistus Club are more concerned with the inheritance of Jack Owlesby, a fine young fellow affianced to Dorothy, the beautiful daughter of toymaker/inventor William Keeble, who builds jolly boxes for space aliens, oxygenators, and gigantic emeralds. Jack's late father bequeathed him just such a gem, but also left behind dark knowledge developed in association with the evil Narbondo. St. Ives and the heroic tobacconist Theophilus Godal suspect that Narbondo and his assistant, the pimply Willis Pule, are using this knowledge to raise the dead, possibly for nefarious purposes. When poor Bill Kraken steals what everyone assumes to be Owlesby's emerald in a fit of alien-induced delirium tremens, the ambitions of Shiloh, Narbondo, Drake, and Pule collide with the heroism of St Ives and Godal and the scientific greed of Parsons of the Royal Academy as Hampstead Heath turns into a carnival of flying skulls, crumbling ghouls, crashing spaceships, and the sparking perversity of the dreadful Marseilles Pinkle.James Blaylock, Homunculus, Babbage, 2000.

One of the first students in Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres's studio (a strong influence on all Duval's works), Duval took part in the 1829 artists' and scholars' expedition sent by Charles X of France to Greece as the Morea Expedition to produce its archaeological drawings. He first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1833 with many portraits such as his Green Lady (no longer extant) and his Self-portrait (still to be seen in the mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Rennes). In 1834 he exhibited his \\"Greek shepherd discovering an antique bas-relief\\".

In 1985 and 1986, he served in the controversial Transitional Government of National Unity (TGNU) as Minister in the Cabinet. The TGNU sought to form an independent government which did not include SWAPO. He and other NP members formed the Action National Settlement in 1985/1986 and joined with Moses Katjiuongua and SWANU and another party to form the National Patriotic Front, which took part in the 1989 election. The NPF, however, only earned one seat in the Constituent Assembly, which went to Katjiongua. Following the defeat, van Zijl retired from politics permanently. Following retirement, van Zijl mostly stayed on his farm, called \\"Den Haag\\", in the Summerdown area in the Omaheke Region in eastern Namibia.

But why John Dewey? And why Southern Illinois University? Quite simply, through what seems in retrospect to have been a fortuitous congruence of persons and events. George E. Axtelle, director of the Dewey Project for its first five years and a lifelong student of Dewey's work, had, in the years before his retirement from New York University, prepared - with William Gruen and Joseph Ratner - a proposal to develop an analytic concordance of the major philosophical terms in John Dewey's writings.\\"Boydston, Jo Ann, and Hahn, Lewis, E., \\"The Center for Dewey Studies,\\" Religious Humanism, Volume 15, 1981. 37 volumes of the philosopher's complete works were completed by the center in the early 1990s.Hechinger, F.M.

The Collected Works of John Dewey \\"In 1990 the Center's editorial team, under the direction of Dr. Jo Ann Boydston, completed the monumental thirty-seven-volume critical edition of Dewey's writings. The Collected Works of John Dewey was published by Southern Illinois University Press in three series: The Early Works, 1882-1989 (five volumes); The Middle Works, 1899-1924 (fifteen volumes); and The Later Works, 1925-1953 (seventeen volumes). A cumulative short-title and subject index to The Collected Works was published in 1991. In 1996 the Center completed an electronic edition of The Collected Works, available on CD-ROM from the InteLex Corporation. Featuring superior Boolean and hypertex search tools, the electronic edition offers unprecedented access to Dewey's work. In order to facilitate standard citation, line and page breaks of the print edition have been maintained. The Correspondence of John Dewey By 1990 Dewey's writings had become available in a critically acclaimed print edition; his correspondence, however, was still widely dispersed and difficult or impossible to access. Researchers had first to determine the location of the materials and then request copies from scores of separate repositories. Some researchers found Dewey's handwriting difficult to read. Even when content could be discerned, researchers still needed to seek advice regarding the best way to quote the material. With generous support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the John Dewey Foundation, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, and private donors, the Center has published a comprehensive electronic edition of the Dewey correspondence. Volume 1 (1871-1918) was published in a CD-ROM edition in 1999. In January 2000 it was selected by the editors of Choice as one of only nineteen publications in the field of philosophy to receive an \\"Outstanding Academic Title of 1999\\" award. Volume 2 (1919‚Äì1939) was published in 2001 and Volume 3 (1940‚Äì1952) was published in 2005.

It was first used to describe members of the women's suffrage movement in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries who were concerned with social problems that affected women and children. They saw obtaining the vote mainly as a means to achieve their reform goals rather than a primary goal in itself. After women gained the right to vote, social feminism continued in the form of labor feminists who advocated for protectionist legislation and special benefits for women. The term is widely used, although some historians have questioned its validity. Origin of term William L. O'Neill introduced the term \\"social feminism\\" in his 1969 history of the feminist movement Everyone Was Brave: The Rise and Fall of Feminism in America. He used the term to cover women involved in municipal civic reform, settlement houses and improving labor conditions for women and children. For them, O'Neill said, \\"women's rights was not an end in itself, as it was to the most ardent feminists\\". O'Neill contrasted social feminism with the \\"hard-core\\" feminism of women such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony who saw obtaining women's rights or women's suffrage as the main objective. Social feminists typically accepted stereotypes of women as compassionate, nurturing and child-centered, while O'Neill's hard-core feminists were often alienated from these conventions. Naomi Black in Social Feminism (1989) distinguishes social feminism from \\"equity feminism\\". Equity feminism may be liberal, Marxist or socialist, but it demands equal rights for women within the male-defined framework. Social feminism, either maternal, cultural or radical, is based on female values. It aims to expand the role of women beyond the private sphere, and to fundamentally transform society. Social feminist organizations should therefore exclude men to maintain their distinctive female characteristics. They should not attempt to be like men, since their distinctive nature may be a strength in politics. There is inevitably a risk that social feminists will align with conservative causes. In the short term social feminism is separatist, but in the longer term it is transformative, since men have lost the exclusive power of decision-making. Social feminism is sometimes identified with maternal feminism. This philosophy considers that mothering should be used as a model for politics, and women's maternal instincts uniquely qualify them to participate in a \\"female\\" sphere. However, women are not all necessarily maternalist, and maternal thinking does not necessarily promote the goals of social feminism. Activities =France= Eug√©nie Potoni√©-Pierre was a French leader of social feminism. In France in the 1890s feminism was mainly confined to bourgeois women. Women such as Eug√©nie Potoni√©-Pierre try to broaden the movement by combining their social concerns with their feminism, and to bring working-class women into the feminist movement. The F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise des Soci√©t√©s F√©ministes was founded at the start of 1892 and held a well-attended congress in 13‚Äì15 May 1892, with both social feminists, mainstream feminists and socialists. The congress did not succeed in developing practical proposals or a coherent policy. Their cautious attempts at social feminism were not successful. Instead, a working women's movement developed within the socialist movement. A final attempt to create a social feminist movement in France was made by Marguerite Durand, founder of the social feminist paper La Fronde, who arranged the 1900 international women's rights congress. Durand saw social feminism as more than an expression of concern about social issues, but as a means to expand the base of the feminist movement. She felt that working women would create the feminist revolution, although bourgeois women would remain in control. She included moderate socialists on the organizing committee. Most of the 500 attendees at the congress were wealthy women. They were willing to vote for an eight-hour day for factory workers, but baulked at giving the same terms to their maids. There were two socialist women, Elizabeth Renaud and Louise Saumoneau, who were not willing to simply accept Durand's lead. In the end, the congress finalized the split between feminists and working women. Saumoneau became hostile to feminism, seeing the class struggle as more important. She denounced \\"bourgeois\\" feminism and took little interest in problems unique to women. =America= Social feminists in the US around the turn of the century were more interested in broad social issues than narrow political struggles, and saw early feminists like Anthony and Stanton as selfish in their demand for the vote for its own sake. They saw the vote as a means by which they could improve society. The social feminist and conservative Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) led by Frances Willard (1839‚Äì98) was not interested in women's suffrage, and perhaps actively opposed, until around 1880. At that time it came round to the idea that suffrage was the only way to gain the changes in legislation needed to advance temperance. The goal was still temperance, and suffrage was an expedient means to achieve that goal. In the long term the WCTU brought more women into the suffrage movement, but in the short term it was a competitor to suffrage organizations. In America the mainstream of the women's rights movement were social feminists. Often they saw women as inherently different in their point of view from men. They campaigned for social improvements and protection of the interests of women. Issues included education, property rights, job opportunities, labor laws, consumer protection, public health, child protection and the vote. Florence Kelley (1859‚Äì1932) and Jane Addams (1860‚Äì1935) exemplified social feminists. They believed that gaining the vote was essential for them to achieve their social objectives. In the early 20th century social feminist leaders of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) such as Maud Wood Park (1871‚Äì1955) and Helen H. Gardener (1853‚Äì1925) worked for women's suffrage. Their approach involved quiet lobbying of leading male politicians, while the more radical National Woman's Party took a more aggressive approach with demonstrations and picketing. Social feminism endorsed many traditional views of gender roles, did not threaten patriarchal power and may even have reinforced traditional arrangements, but the strategy was successful in 1920 in the campaign for the vote. After this breakthrough the National Woman's Party proposed the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). The ERA was bitterly opposed by the social feminists who saw it as undermining many of gains they had made in the treatment of women workers. In the period after the vote had been won there was a decline in social feminism in the US. According to William O'Neill \\"Adventure was now to be had, for the most part, in struggling against not social problems but social conventions. Drinking, smoking, dancing, sexual novelties, daring literature and avant-garde art now filled the vacuum created by the collapse of social feminism.\\" However, Labor feminists continued to agitate for reform in the workplace. Labor feminists did not want to end all distinctions based on sex, only those that hurt women. For example, they felt that state laws that put in place wage floors and hour ceilings benefited women. File:Elizabeth Stanton.jpgElizabeth Cady Stanton supported various reform causes before focusing exclusively on women's rights. File:Jane Addams profile.jpgJane Addams was a social feminist who supported women's suffrage. Critique The concept of social feminism is useful in defining a range of activities, but the idea that it is incompatible with radical feminism may be misleading. In The Ideas of the Woman's Suffrage Movement, 1890‚Äì1920 (1965), Aileen S. Kraditor contrasted belief in the natural justice of women having the right to vote, common among suffragists up to the end of the 19th century, with belief in the \\"expediency\\" of women having the vote so they could address social issues, more common in the early 20th century. However, Kraditor saw a gradual shift in emphasis from \\"justice\\" to \\"expediency\\" in the rationales for women's suffrage rather than a conflict between the two positions. Organizations such as the Woman's Christian Temperance Union were primarily social feminist while the National American Woman Suffrage Association was primarily \\"hard-core\\" in O'Neill's sense, but there was considerable overlap in their membership. Activists such as Mary Ritter Beard, Florence Kelley and Maud Younger fall into both categories.

It offers Muslims religious guidance and advice through the issuing of fatwas on everyday and contemporary issues. DƒÅr al- IftƒÅ' draws upon the Qur‚Äôan, hadith, and precedents of Islamic jurists throughout history to deliver fatwas on topics relevant to contemporary Muslims. Its fatwas are influential among Sunni Muslims in Egypt and across the world.  Status of Dar al-Ifta  Since it was first established, Egypt's Dar al-Ifta has been the premier institute to represent Islam and the international flagship for Islamic legal research. It fulfills its historic and civil role by keeping contemporary Muslim in touch with religious principles, clarifying the right way, removing doubts concerning religious and worldly life, and revealing religious laws for new issues of contemporary life. Throughout the 20th century, Dar al-Ifta has been described as a \\"central player\\" in Islam in Egyptian society. Islamic jurisprudence in Egypt has been most closely identified with three institutions: Al-Azhar University, Dar al-Ifta and courts of law that adjudicate matters. It plays a significant role in giving rulings to the masses and consultation for the judiciary in Egypt. Dar al-Ifta was established in 1895. As with Al-Azhar, it operated with state support but also had a degree of autonomy. It began advising state agencies in various Islamic matters, a role that was previously held by the Hanafi chief mufti. Egypt's Dar al-Ifta started as one of the divisions of the Egyptian Ministry of Justice. In view of its consultancy role, capital punishment sentences among others are referred to the Egypt's Dar al-Ifta seeking the opinion of the Grand Mufti concerning these punishments. The role of Dar al-Ifta does not stop at this point; it is not limited by domestic boundaries but extends beyond Egypt covering the entire Islamic world. This leading role is best expressed by its records of fatwas from its inception until the present day. Dar al-Ifta receives inquires from all over the Islamic world, as well as foreign students of Islamic law for training. This leadership developed from Dar al-Ifta's role as scholarly reference and for adopting a moderate methodology in understanding rulings derived from the inherited Fiqh (Eng. Jurisprudence) creating a consistency between Islamic law and the needs of the society. Dar al-Ifta issues 500-1000 fatwas a year. In keeping pace with the huge developments in the field of communications, Dar al-Ifta undertakes huge tasks imposed by the qualitative transition brought about by the new era of means of communications and transportations. Fatawa Islamiyah Starting in 1980 (1400 AH), Dar al-Ifta began publishing Fatawa Islamiyah (\\"The Islamic Fatwas from the Dar al-Ifta). The content of the publications are supervised by the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs. -The first volume laid out the plan to deal with fiqh in general, but special issues were to be published on waqf and inheritance. The Fatawa Islamiyah were published in cycles, covering all the traditional fiqh issues in a time period before moving to the next time period. The cycles were organized as such: #Volumes 1 to 4: covered 703 rulings, spanning all traditional fiqh disciplines from 1895 to 1950. #Volumes 5 to 7: covered 413 rulings, spanning all traditional fiqh disciplines from 1950 to 1978. #Volumes 8 to 10: covered 209 rulings, mainly focusing on Gad al-Haq's rulings from 1978 to 1982. #Volumes 11 to 13: covering 379 rulings focused on waqf, spanning 1895 to 1982. #Volumes 14 to 19: covering 1572 rulings focused on inheritance, spanning 1895 to 1982. #Volume 20: return to covering all traditional fiqh disciplines, spanning 1982-1986.

The aircraft crashed into an abandoned farmhouse approximately from the airport. All 85 persons on board perished in the crash and subsequent fire. One person in the village also died. Flight 118 was a seasonal daily flight from Madrid to A Coru√±a favoured by tourists. Transcript. Local news reports indicated that AV-118 was a special \\"vacation flight\\" run by Aviaco during the summer season, so as to provide easy access to Galicia's numerous ocean-side resorts. The aircraft had taken off normally from Madrid at 9:14 a.m. CEST. After an uneventful journey, the commander contacted the control tower at La Coru√±a Airport at 10:14, and was informed of the poor visibility in the area at that time. Despite being advised to stand by in anticipation of an early improvement in weather conditions, the crew began a first approach at 10:23 to check the actual visibility. The manoeuvre was frustrated, and the aircraft returned to an altitude of 2000 metres. After a second unsuccessful approach, at 11:20 the tower warned Flight 118 that the fog was lifting, and that the horizontal visibility had increased to about 1500 meters and the vertical visibility was close to 300 meters. At 11:39, the crew reported that they had begun a new approach, this being the last communication received by the airport control tower. Shortly afterwards the aircraft hit eucalyptus trees, struck the ground and collided with the abandoned farmhouse before bursting into flames. The collision and fire killed 84 of the aircraft's 85 occupants immediately. The only survivor, who was taken to the Hospital in La Coru√±a, died a few hours later as a result of the serious injuries suffered. In addition, one person on the ground was reported to have been killed The official cause of the accident was the pilot's violation of air safety rules by landing in poor visibility. This fact was considered even more serious considering that at Santiago de Compostela Airport the visibility was good at the time of the accident, and being only 45 km away.

The son of Stanislas and Marie (Doucet) Boivin, Joseph Auguste Boivin was born September 21, 1866 in Coaticook, Quebec, Canada. Mr. Boivin contracted polio as a child and lost one leg to complications of the illness. He studied at Saint Hyacinthe College, Coaticook, and lived for several years in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec. Boivin immigrated to Manchester, New Hampshire, on October 1, 1883. He studied law in the offices of Burnham, Brown, Jones and Warren, and later with Judge George W. Prescott. He was admitted to the New Hampshire Bar in December 1899 and, subsequently, to the Hillsborough County Bar Association. He studied at St. Anselm College in neighboring Goffstown, where he also taught French. He married Miss Emma Gilbert of Lewiston, Maine, in September 1901; they had four children between 1902‚Äì1907: Dominique, Therese, Gilberte and Gertrude. In 1902, Boivin represented Manchester's Ward 9 at the constitutional convention. He served as treasurer for L'Association Canado-American. His law office was located in the Kennard Building, 314‚Äì315 Elm Street, Manchester, where he also served as a justice of the peace, insurance agent and real estate broker. He started the credit union on November 24, 1908, through a collaboration with Monsignor Pierre Hevey of Ste. Marie Church and guidance from Alphonse Desjardins, the Canadian credit union pioneer.Credit Union Museum Officially Opens To Visitors, CUs. Banking Wire. 7 Nov. 2002. Boivin volunteered his time in the evenings and, assisted by his wife Emma, an able and experienced bookkeeper, ran it out of his home at 420 Notre Dame Avenue in Manchester.Birthplace of America's Credit Union Movement. America's Credit Union Museum. America's Credit Union Museum now occupies the location of his home, where the credit union, now known as St. Mary's Bank, first operated. Among his many accomplishments, Joseph Boivin served as a school board member and as Commissioner of the Water Department in Manchester. He was a member of the Council Hevey of Union St. Jean Baptiste l'Amerique and of L'Artisans Canadien-Francais, a French professional association. An avid singer and music lover, he was a devout Catholic who sang in the choir at Ste. Marie Church on Notre Dame Avenue; this participation required that he climb the long, narrow staircase leading to the choir loft for weekly rehearsals and Masses, in spite of the loss of one leg. His deep faith led him to counsel French-Canadian residents of Manchester in sound financial planning and saving. His common practice when sought out for divorce cases was to counsel couples to remain together, work out their problems and honor their marriage vows. For his strong sense of values and deep commitments to family, church and community, Boivin was loved and respected by all who knew him. Boivin suffered with chronic nephritis for several months in 1930; he died at home (420 Notre Dame Avenue) on Sunday, July 6, 1930 of myocarditis. He is buried in the Boivin family lot at Mount Calvary Cemetery in Manchester.

Early life and career Siddique was born in Bangladesh. She moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, with her family at age 10. She received a scholarship to MacPhail Center for Music and sang in her schools' choirs and theater programs. At age 11, she sang God Bless America during the seventh-inning stretch at a Minnesota Twins game. She attended De La Salle High School for two years and sang in both the concert and a cappella choirs. She lives in Seattle now.

Biography =Early life= Liu was born in Wuping County, Fujian, China. He joined the CPC in Jinggangshan Mountains in August 1929, and participated in the Encirclement Campaigns on the communist side. Like many late communist commanders, Liu was also a veteran of the Long March. During the Second Sino-Japanese War he became Lin Biao's chief assistant in the Red Army University in Yan'an. During the Long March in 1934, Liu and his commander Chen Guang succeeded in forcing a way across the Wu River, securing the Chinese Red Army's passage across the river. He also led troops to capture Zunyi, Lou Shanguan. At the Dadu River banks, he ordered the Red Fourth Army to attack Luding Bridge. =Russia= Liu was sent to study in Frunze Military Academy in 1939‚Äì1941, and was commissioned as a major in the Soviet Red Army and participated in the Soviet-German War, and wrote several important essays on the Battle of Stalingrad. In August 1945 Liu returned to China by following Soviet Marshal Aleksandr Vasilevsky's troops that invade Manchuria during Operation August Storm before joining communist Manchurian field army. In the same month, he was appointed as the Principal of the Northeast Aviation School, which would later serve as the backbone of the People's Liberation Air Force. He became Lin Biao's chief of staff of the North Eastern Armies prior to the outbreak of the Chinese Civil War. =Chinese Civil War= With the outbreak of the Manchurian Campaign in 1947, he led forces in Linjiang. In 1948, he was appointed Chief of Staff of the Northeastern Military Region and assisted Lin Biao in the Liaoshen Campaign. During the assault on Pingjin in January 1949, Liu secured a victory over a 130,000 strong Nationalist force after 29 hours of intense battle, capturing the Nationalist General Chen Changjie. In the same year, he was appointed as a field commander of the Fourth Field Army. =Creation of the People's Liberation Army Air Force = On 25 October 1949, Liu was appointed as the chief of air force in the People's Liberation Army and by 11 November, air force command was officially formed. In enhancing the PLA's air force, he formed 7 aviation schools and established the doctrine for the air force. After the establishment of People's Republic of China in 1950, Mao Zedong prepared to support North Korea in the Korean War. Mao ordered Liu to go to Soviet Union to lobby for their aid and to train Chinese pilots based on the Soviet model, so Liu was appointed First Commander-in-Chief of the People's Liberation Army Air Force in 1949. At that time the Chinese air force only possessed 15 Mig fighter planes. By the end of his career, he would form 27 schools dedicated to air force training. =After the Founding of the PRC= Alongside with his position within the Chinese Air Force, he was appointed as the Deputy Minister for Defense in April 1949. He was also appointed various academia positions, such as being the director of the 5th School of Research within the Ministry of Defense. During his political tenure, he was a member of the Central Military Commission and was a member of the 8th Central Committee. In 1964, he was elected as the honorary chairman of the Chinese People's Airways Association. Personal life =Life as a writer= As Liu was very competent in Russian, he has written several books of his experiences as a military leader in both Russia and China. These included his memoirs as the Chief of Staff of the Northeastern Field Army during the Manchurian Campaign in 1947‚Äì49, and books concerning Stalin and his subordinates. =Illness= Lin Biao never visited the sick before, but only exception when he learnt Liu Yalou had liver cancer, Lin then visited Liu for the first time in the hospital. After one year of considerable weight loss and other symptoms of liver cancer, Liu died in Shanghai in 1965. Lin took personally charge of Liu's funeral arrangements because Liu was one of the best assistants and staff officers in his military career.

Life He was a son-in-law of Don Moses Gabbai, an exile from Majorca. Aaron was the youngest of five brothers, all rabbinic scholars; the others were Shallum, Baruch, Moses, and Isaac. He studied in Treviso, Italy, and was familiar with the scientific and philosophic literature of his age; he was a good grammarian, and well acquainted with the Arabic language. Like his father, he believed in astrology, and loved to observe the horoscope. He was also an adept in the Cabala, though at times his critical spirit came in conflict with its doctrines. On his travels he visited Turkey, Egypt, Palestine, Damascus, and Kaffa in the Crimea. In Jerusalem he had many disputations with the Karaites, to which his commentary on the Pentateuch refers with evident pride, as having vindicated the cause of rabbinical theology. While in Rome he was admitted to the presence of Pope Martin V, who was surrounded by his cardinals. Martin V was kindly disposed toward the Jews, and often discussed religious questions with them in a friendly manner. On this occasion he propounded to Aaron a number of very pointed questions concerning Biblical and Talmudical passages. Among other things he asked if the use of the cherubim in the Holy of Holies was not rather antagonistic to the Second Commandment, which prohibits idolatry. Aaron in his commentary refers several times to this discussion and to the answers he gave. Writer Coming often in contact with learned Christians, Aaron had many occasions to defend Judaism against the polemics of the Church, on the one hand, and the attacks of the Karaites on the other. It was this unceasing conflict that induced him to write a book, called \\"Ma·π≠·π≠eh Aharon\\" (The Staff of Aaron), in defense of the Law and tradition. Keenly observant, and of an independent and critical spirit, he judged persons and opinions freely and openly. He excels as a writer and as a Bible commentator, and often upbraids the Jews of his native land for their ignorance and hollow pretensions, at the same time pointing with admiration to the numerous Jews of high breeding he has met on his travels. Following the principle of a rational Biblical exegesis, he does not hesitate occasionally to refute haggadic traditions which seem to conflict with reason and common sense; and at times, like Abraham ibn Ezra and Samuel ben Meir, he even states his disagreement with halakic interpretation. He was fully conversant with the views of the Karaites and Samaritans and eager, in his explanation of the Bible, to refute now Christian and now Muslim doctrines. He boldly exposes errors wherever he finds them, claiming \\"that it is more honorable for the wise to commit an error than knowingly to misrepresent the truth.\\" Nor does he shrink from pointing out the blemishes he finds in the character of the Patriarchs. Being guided solely by a love of truth, he, as a matter of course, does not spare such great Bible commentators as Rashi and Nahmanides. For the former Aaron entertained a very high regard; of the latter he frequently says, \\"With due deference to his honor, he misunderstood the Talmud\\" (see his commentary upon Gen. xxvii. 22; Ex. xxiii. 11, xxv. 9). Like Samuel ben Meir and Maimonides, he explains the law, \\"Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk\\" (Ex. xxiii. 19), as a warning against a certain idolatrous practise. Notwithstanding his liberal mind and his keen investigating spirit, he was held in high esteem by his contemporaries, as may be seen from David Abi Zimra's mention of him as \\"Aaron our Rabbi\\" in No. 10 of his responsa, where he commends him for his liberty of thought. He was a devoted Jew, who deeply deplored the political and social condition of the Jews of his time, and all the more fervently gave expression to his hope for the speedy advent of the Messiah. For his cabalistic views he quotes Recanate and Joseph Sar Shalom, but not the Zohar. Works Aaron states that he wrote a Hebrew grammar entitled \\"Ha-Meyasher\\" (The Leveler of the Road); \\"Ma·π≠·π≠eh Aharon,\\" referred to above, a cabalistic or metaphysical work; \\"Nezer ha-·∏≤odesh\\" (The Crown of Holiness); \\"Pera·∏• ha-Elohut\\" (The Blossoming of the Godhead), probably of a similar character, and \\"Sefer ha-Nefesh\\" (The Book of the Soul). All of these works are known only through his own quotations in his supercommentary on Rashi. This work, published from an incomplete manuscript, together with another supercommentary on Rashi by Samuel Almosnino, by Moses Albelda, and by Jacob Canizal, is one of the earliest books printed at Constantinople, and is therefore very rare. According to his own testimony, it was written in 1420 (as Perles has shown); but he intended to compose, or, as Perles thinks, actually did compose, a larger commentary on the Pentateuch. Perles has furnished ample proof that Aaron Aldabi‚Äîor, as he called himself, Aaron Alrabi‚Äîwas a man of great originality and merit, and it is to be hoped that his lost works will be discovered, and that editions of his commentary, based on clear manuscripts existing in Oxford and elsewhere, will fully vindicate his character, though Graetz and Karpeles, in their histories, have attacked him. J. H. Schorr, in \\"Zion,\\" 1840, first called attention to Abu al-Rabi, erroneously calling him Aaron ben Mose Alrabi; but, owing to a misunderstanding of his remarks, he ascribes to him the strange assertion that Moses translated the Pentateuch from the Arabic into Hebrew‚Äîa misunderstanding repeated by Gr√§tz, \\"Gesch. d. Juden\\" (third edition), viii. 250, and by Karpeles, \\"Gesch. der J√ºdischen Literatur,\\" p. 771‚Äîwhereas the author, in his commentary upon Gen. xviii. 5, referring to the rabbinical Haggadah that the angels who came to Abraham appeared as Arabs, says that they spoke in Arabic, and that Moses rendered their words in Hebrew‚Äîa remark which he repeats in his comments upon Gen. xxiv. 23 and Ex. ii. 10. Zunz, \\"Z. G.,\\" pp. 518‚Äì520, and Steinschneider, \\"Cat. Bodl.,\\" call him Alrabi. Aaron's true name, however, is given in the acrostic written by him at the end of his published commentary.

The canal rises 40m through 16 locks via the cathedral city of Reims, which is also a busy commercial port, to a summit level at an altitude of 95.70m.

This was part of a grand plan to build canals by- passing Paris to the east. Work on this link followed those on the Canal lat√©ral √† l'Aisne, starting in 1841. The canal was opened in 1866. It was later planned to implement Cosnier‚Äôs idea of an orbital route from the Loire through to northern France. Only the north-south section was built, comprising this link and the Canal de l‚ÄôOise √† l‚ÄôAisne. In the 1990s it was envisaged to rebuild the canal to European Class IV or V dimensions to an enlarged port in Reims. This would have been the first section of a possible Seine-Est waterway linking with the Moselle. Both projects were subsequently abandoned.

She was raised in Shropshire, England and now lives in London. Career Carlyle's first recorded appearance was on the Plaid album Not For Threes (Warp Records, 1997). She subsequently sang on Plaid's next two albums, Rest Proof Clockwork (1999) and Double Figure (2001). Having sung on Matthew Herbert's big band album Goodbye Swingtime (2003), Carlyle signed to Herbert's label, Accidental Records. Her debut album The Lovely was released in July 2004. It consisted mostly of original compositions, as well as a few reworkings of pieces of classical music, recorded at Carlyle's home. \\"I Blame You Not\\" is an English- language version of Schumann's \\"'Ich grolle nicht\\". Another track, \\"Pianni\\", was featured in the IKEA \\"Happy Inside\\" television commercial in which 100 cats are let loose in the retailer's Wembley store. In May 2005 Carlyle released an EP, I Blame Dido, containing \\"I Blame You Not\\" and a version of Henry Purcell's \\"Dido's Lament\\". After receiving critical acclaim for The Lovely, Carlyle signed to EMI in 2007. She recorded her second album in London with producer Dan Carey (who has worked with The Kills and with Kylie Minogue). The album was scheduled for release in June 2008, but was shelved during the restructuring that affected EMI after the label was bought by private equity firm, Terra Firma. Carlyle described this as a period of limbo, in which the album \\"continues to languish pointlessly, like a pirated ship off the coast of Somalia\\". December 2008 saw the release of Classist, a collaboration with composer Max de Wardener under the name \\"Max de Mara\\". Carlyle contributed four tracks adapted from Handel, Purcell, Walford Davies and Jacques Offenbach. The album was a limited edition of 333 copies available through Stanley Donwood's Six Inch Records. After protracted legal negotiations with EMI, Carlyle regained the rights to the album, originally called Nuzzle, and changed the title to Floreat, meaning \\"Let it flourish\\". Floreat was released in August 2011 to critical acclaim. The Independent on Sunday declared it \\"a classic\\". The album is an eclectic collection across 10 tracks, ranging from the delicate orchestration of \\"Bowlface en Provence\\", through the near hip-hop style of \\"Away with those self loving lads\\" culminating in the piano led jazz ballard \\"The Devil and me\\". The album was written and arranged by Carlyle, with lyrics that, at times, deliberately sit at odds to their polite framing, such as on \\"Pearl\\". Hot Chip producer Dan Carey provided an overall pop flourish. In 2013 she provided vocals, and appeared in the video for the song \\"She Burns\\" by the co-founder of Hot Chip, Joe Goddard. In 2014 she joined the presenting team of the BBC Radio 3 programme Late Junction. Also in late 2014, Carlyle supported Goldfrapp at their concert of 18 November at the Royal Albert Hall, London, England. In May 2015, Carlyle played her first headline concert for over two years at Rich Mix, Shoreditch, London, and delivered a two-hour setlist of 17 songs, including numbers from \\"The Lovely\\" and \\"Floreat\\", and covers of \\"He Makes My Day\\", originally by Robert Palmer, \\"It Don't Bother Me\\" by Bert Jansch and \\"Ex Factor\\", originally by Lauryn Hill. She also showcased a new song, tentatively titled 'Murderous Me' from her upcoming, as yet untitled, 3rd album. The band consisted of Mara Carlyle on vocals, ukulele and musical saw, Tom Herbert on double bass, Dan Teper on accordion, Liam Byrne on viola da gamba and James McVinnie on piano. Support artist was cellist Laura Moody. In December 2015, Carlyle teamed up with KT Tunstall and Max de Wardener, to provide a live soundtrack to Frank Borzage's 1927 romantic silent classic 7th Heaven at the BFI London Southbank. In 2016, Carlyle collaborated with Gaspard Aug√© and Xavier de Rosnay, from French Electro House outfit Justice, on their 3rd Album \\"Woman\\". Seen as a tribute to femininity, the 10 track album is a romantic, amatory, disco opus on which Carlyle assumed the role of 'Vibe Editor' and produced the choral and orchestral sessions with the London Contemporary Orchestra. She contributed vocals on several tracks, along with musical saw on the album standout track \\"Chorus\\", described as a Morricone/Queen mash-up. In 2018, during the Woman Worldwide tour, the duo released a remix version of the album, recording the tracks in a similar way that they are performed during their live stage show. Entitled 'Woman Worldwide' the album went on to win the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic album in 2019 In April 2017 she made a documentary programme to examine the life and vocal magnificence of her beloved Ella Fitzgerald for BBC Radio 4 to mark the centenary of her birth, entitled \\"Ella Fitzgerald: A Glorious Noise\\".Mara Carlyle, \\"Ella Fitzgerald: A Glorious Noise\\", BBC Radio 4, April 2017. As well as singing, and playing the Ukulele, Carlyle is an exponent of the Musical saw which is a common instrument in Russian folk music and American Vaudeville. The instrument features on both of her albums to date, most notably \\"Saw Song\\" from \\"Floreat\\".

As such it is used for computing relevance of XML documents. Queries Most XML retrieval approaches do so based on techniques from the information retrieval (IR) area, e.g. by computing the similarity between a query consisting of keywords (query terms) and the document. However, in XML-Retrieval the query can also contain structural hints. So-called \\"content and structure\\" (CAS) queries enable users to specify what structure the requested content can or must have. Exploiting XML structure Taking advantage of the self-describing structure of XML documents can improve the search for XML documents significantly. This includes the use of CAS queries, the weighting of different XML elements differently and the focused retrieval of subdocuments. Ranking Ranking in XML-Retrieval can incorporate both content relevance and structural similarity, which is the resemblance between the structure given in the query and the structure of the document. Also, the retrieval units resulting from an XML query may not always be entire documents, but can be any deeply nested XML elements, i.e. dynamic documents. The aim is to find the smallest retrieval unit that is highly relevant. Relevance can be defined according to the notion of specificity, which is the extent to which a retrieval unit focuses on the topic of request. Existing XML search engines An overview of two potential approaches is available. The INitiative for the Evaluation of XML-Retrieval (INEX) was founded in 2002 and provides a platform for evaluating such algorithms. Three different areas influence XML-Retrieval: =Traditional XML query languages= Query languages such as the W3C standard XQuery supply complex queries, but only look for exact matches. Therefore, they need to be extended to allow for vague search with relevance computing. Most XML-centered approaches imply a quite exact knowledge of the documents' schemas. =Databases= Classic database systems have adopted the possibility to store semi-structured data and resulted in the development of XML databases. Often, they are very formal, concentrate more on searching than on ranking, and are used by experienced users able to formulate complex queries. =Information retrieval= Classic information retrieval models such as the vector space model provide relevance ranking, but do not include document structure; only flat queries are supported. Also, they apply a static document concept, so retrieval units usually are entire documents. They can be extended to consider structural information and dynamic document retrieval. Examples for approaches extending the vector space models are available: they use document subtrees (index terms plus structure) as dimensions of the vector space.  Data- centric XML datasets  For data-centric XML datasets, the unique and distinct keyword search method, namely, XDMA for XML databases is designed and developed based dual indexing and mutual summation.

Based at Western Michigan University in the United States, the ISCSC holds an annual conference and publishes the journal Comparative Civilizations Review. Brief history In October 1961, in Salzburg, Austria, an extraordinary group of scholars gathered to create the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations. Among the 26 founding members from Austria, Germany, France, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Spain, Italy, England, Russia, the United States, China and Japan were such luminaries as Pitirim Sorokin and Arnold Toynbee. For six days, the participants debated such topics as the definition of \\"civilization,\\" problems in the analysis of complex cultures, civilizational encounters in the past, the Orient versus the Occident, problems of universal history, theories of historiography, and the role of the \\"human sciences\\" in \\"globalization.\\" The meeting was funded by the Austrian government, in cooperation with UNESCO, and received considerable press coverage. Sorokin was elected the Society's first president. After several meetings in Europe, the advancing age of its founding members and the declining health of then president, Othmar F. Anderle, were important factors in the decision to transfer the Society to the United States. Between 1968 and 1970 Roger Williams Wescott of Drew University facilitated that transition. In 1971, the first annual meeting of the ISCSC (US) was held in Philadelphia. Important participants in that meeting and in the Society's activities during the next years included Benjamin Nelson (the Society's first American president), Roger Wescott, Vytautas Kavolis, Matthew Melko, David Wilkinson, Rushton Coulborn and C.P. Wolf. In 1974, the Salzburg branch was formally dissolved, and from that year to the present there has been only one International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations (ISCSC). The presidents of the ISCSC are, in order: In Europe, Pitirim Sorokin and Othmar Anderle; in the United States, Benjamin Nelson, Vytautas Kavolis, Matthew Melko, Michael Palencia-Roth, Roger Wescott, Shuntaro Ito (from Japan), Wayne Bledsoe, Lee Daniel Snyder, Andrew Targowski, David Rosner, Toby Huff and the current president Lynn Rhodes. To date, the Society has held 48 meetings, most of them in the United States but also in Salzburg, Austria; Santo Domingo, The Dominican Republic; Dublin, Ireland; Chiba, Japan; Frenchman's Cove, Jamaica; St. Petersburg, Russia; Paris, France; New Brunswick, Canada; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Suzhou, China. More than 30 countries are represented in the Society's membership. Its intellectual dynamism and vibrancy over the years have been maintained and enhanced through its annual meetings, its bi-annual journal Comparative Civilizations Review which is available with a subscription in print, and free online, and the participation of such scholars as Talcott Parsons, Hayden White, Immanuel Wallerstein, Gordon Hewes, Andr√© Gunder Frank, Marshall Sahlins, Lynn White Jr., Jeremy Sabloff, David Wilkinson, and Michael Palencia-Roth. The Society is committed to the idea that complex civilizational problems can best be approached through multidisciplinary analyses and debate by scholars from a variety of fields. Comparative Civilizations Review, which welcomes submissions from the Society's members as well as other scholars, has been published continually since its inaugural issue in 1979. Activities The ISCSC is a multidisciplinary scholarly organization that has connections with comparative studies programs throughout the world. The society holds an annual conference, often with the cooperation of other scholarly organizations based in the conference locale. One example of this is the 1998 conference held at Reitaku University in Japan together with the Japan Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations; the two organizations continue to have a close relationship. The ISCSC publishes the bi-annual 'Comparative Civilizations Review', a peer-reviewed journal. The blog \\"Civilitas\\" has been active since 2011.

It is part of a proposal that was put forward in 2008 by the engineering firm Arup as a means of extending the UK's high-speed rail network from central London to Heathrow Airport. Proposal In the late 1980s Arup researched an innovative alternative for the alignment of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. The route proposed by the company focused on using the link as a catalyst for regeneration - it was adopted by Government in 1991. It came into being in November 2007, when the first Eurostar arrived via High Speed 1, at St Pancras railway station. Arup's proposal would create a high-speed rail station at the airport alongside a future airport terminal, providing it with a direct rail link to continental Europe via Eurostar International services. The new station would have also connect regional rail services on the Great Western Main Line to Heathrow, making the airport more accessible to the West, South West, Wales and the Midlands and provided a direct train service between the Thames Gateway and the Thames Valley. See also * Heathrow Airport transport proposals Evaluations The cost of the Heathrow Hub railway station project (including the costs of tunnelling a high-speed rail line from central London to Heathrow and a rail station with international and regional services) is estimated to be around ¬£4.5 billion. In 2008, Arup met with former Secretary of State for Transport, Ruth Kelly to discuss how this cost could be private sector funded. When published in February 2009, the Conservative Rail Review, ‚ÄòGetting the best for passengers‚Äô, confirmed that \\"a Conservative Government would support proposals along the lines of the plan put forward by engineering firm, Arup, for a new Heathrow rail hub.\\" Debate sparked by the Heathrow Hub railway station proposal led to the government's 2009 decision to set up High Speed Two (HS2) Limited. The organisation is charged with considering the options to extend the UK's high-speed rail network from London to Birmingham and beyond. In 2010 the incoming Coalition Government favoured a high-speed route via Heathrow Hub railway station, rather than an interchange at Old Oak Common railway station. In July 2010 plans emerged for a 12 platform station at Iver with services from High Speed 1, 2, Crossrail and the Great Western Main Line. It would be 3¬Ω minutes from Heathrow Terminal 5 and 12 from Euston. In March 2015, the Transport Minister ruled out this proposal being implemented in either Phase 1 or Phase 2 of the wider HS2 programme but left it open to being included in the future.

In short, IO is collaboration with focus on production. Contents of the term The most striking part of IO has been the use of always-on videoconference rooms between offshore platforms and land-based offices. This includes broadband connections for sharing of data and video-surveillance of the platform. This has made it possible to move some personnel onshore and use the existing human resources more efficiently. Instead of having e.g. an expert in geology on duty at every platform, the expert may be stationed on land and be available for consultation for several offshore platforms. It's also possible for a team at an office in a different time zone to be consulting the night-shift of the platform, so that no land-based workers need work at night. Splitting the team between land and sea demands new work processes, which together with ICT is the two main focus points for IO. Tools like videoconferencing and 3D-visualization also creates an opportunity for new, more cross-discipline cooperations. For instance, a shared 3D-visualization may be tailored to each member of the group, so that the geologist gets a visualization of the geological structures while the drilling engineer focuses on visualizing the well. Here, real-time measurements from the well are important but the downhole bandwidth has previously been very restricted. Improvements in bandwidth, better measurement devices, better aggregation and visualization of this information and improved models that simulate the rock formations and wellbore currently all feed on each other. An important task where all these improvements play together is real-time production optimization. In the process industry in general, the term is used to describe the increased cooperation, independent of location, between operators, maintenance personnel, electricians, production management as well as business management and suppliers to provide a more streamlined plant operation. By deploying IO, the petroleum industry draws on lessons from the process industry. This can be seen in a larger focus on the whole production chain and management ideas imported from the production and process industry. A prominent idea in this regard is real-time optimization of the whole value chain, from long term management of the oil reservoir, through capacity allocations in pipe networks and calculations of the net present value of the produced oil. Reviews of the application of Integrated Operations can be found in papers presented in the by-annual society of petroleum engineers Intelligent Energy conferences. A focus on the whole production chain is also seen in debates about how to organize people in an IO organisation, with frequent calls for breaking down the Information silos in the oil companies. A large oil company is typically organized in functional silos corresponding to disciplines such as drilling, production and reservoir management. This is regarded as inefficient by the IO movement, pointing out that the activities in any well or field by any of the silos will involve or affect all of the others. While some companies focus on their inhouse management structure, others also emphasize the integration and coordination of outside suppliers and collaborators in offshore-operations. For instance, it is pointed out that the oil and gas industry is lagging behind other industries in terms of Operational intelligence.Michael R. Brul√© - Digital Energy Journal sep09 p22 www.digitalenergyjournal.com/issues/DEJ20web.pdf Ideas and theories that IO management and work processes build on will be familiar from operations research, knowledge management and continual improvement as well as information systems and business transformation. This is perhaps most evident in the repeated referral to \\"people, process and technology\\"http://www.integrated-operations.co.uk/ \\"Integrated Operations is about ensuring people, processes and technology work much more efficiently together\\"http://www.intelligentenergyevent.com/page.cfm/Link=65/t=m/goSection=16 \\"the 3 inter-related categories of: People, process and organisational change; Technology and data; Case studies\\"http://www.touchoilandgas.com/distance- nothing-operation-everything-a143-1.html \\"The Third Efficiency Leap ‚Äì Focus on People, Process and Technology\\" in IO discussions https://www.globalio.com/what-is-io/ \\"Achieving a high performing IO program requires four fundamental building blocks:Transformational Leadership, Right People, Business Processes and Technology\\". As bullet-points this mirror many of the aforementioned fields. Since 2010 major mining companies have become implementers of Integrated Operations, most notable Rio Tinto, BHP Biliton and Codelco. Incentives Common to most companies is that IO leads to cost savings as fewer people are stationed offshore and an increased efficiency. Lower costs, more efficient reservoir management and fewer mistakes during well drilling will in turn raise profits and make more oil fields economically viable. IO comes at a time when the oil industry is faced with more \\"brown fields\\", also referred to as \\"tail production\\", where the cost of extracting the oil will be higher than its market value, unless major improvements in technology and work processes are made. It has been estimated that deployment of IO could produce 300 billion NOK of added value to the Norwegian continental shelf alone.http://www.tu.no/olje-gass/article138103.ece On a longer time-scale, working onshore control and monitoring of the oil production may become a necessity as new fields at deeper waters are based purely on unmanned sub-sea facilities. Moving jobs onshore has also been touted as a way to keep and make better use of an aging workforce, which is regarded as a challenge by western oil and gas companies. As the average age of the industry workforce is increasing with many nearing retirement, IO is being leveraged for knowledge sharing and training of younger workforce. More comfortable onshore jobs together with \\"high-tech\\" tools has also been fronted as a way to recruit young workers into an industry that is seen as \\"unsexy\\", \\"lowtech\\" and difficult to combine with a normal family life. Critique The security aspect of reducing the offshore workforce has been raised. Will on- site experience be lost and can familiarity with the platform and its processes be attained from an onshore office? The new working environment in any case demands changes to HSE routines. Some of the challenges also include clear role and responsibility definitions and clarifications between the onshore & offshore personnel. Who in a given situation has the authority to take decisions, the onsite or the offshore staff. The increased integration of the offshore facilities with the onshore office environment and outside collaborators also expose work-critical ICT-infrastructure to the internet and the hazards of everyday ICT. As for the efficiency aspect, some criticize the onshore-offshore collaboration for creating a more bureaucratic working environment. Naming conventions Both the exact terms and the content used to describe IO vary between companies. The oil company Shell has traditionally branded the term Smart Fields,http://www.shell.com/home/content/innovation/meeting_demand/getting_more/smartfields/smartfields.html which was an extension of Smart Wells that only referred to remote-controlled well-valves. BP uses Field of the futurehttp://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=9025118&contentId;=7047802http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about- bp/bp-and-technology/more-recovery/real-time-data-and-decisions/field-of-the- future.html to refer to its innovations in oil production. Chevron has i-field, Honeywell has Digital Suites for Oil and Gas (a set of software and services), and Schlumberger terms it Digital Energy.http://www.slb.com/content/news/inside/2009/20090507_digital_energy.asp The latter term, understood as referring to oil and gas, is adopted in the title of the digital energy journal.http://www.digitalenergyjournal.com/ This term could have several meanings, as GE Digital Energy for instance, do not appear to use it in the IO sense. Other terms include e-Field, i-Field, Digital Oilfield, Intelligent Oilfield, Field of the future and Intelligent Energy.http://www.epmag.com/archives/everyMonth/6264.htm Integrated operations has been the preferred term by Statoil, the Norwegian Oil Industry Association (OLF), a professional body and employer's association for oil and supplier companiesLetter from the editor, Digital Energy Journal April/May 2008 and vendors such as ABB.http://www.abb.no/industries/us/9AAC167609.aspx IO is also the preferred term for Petrobras.http://www.igi-global.com/chapter/integrated- operations-petrobras/68719 Intelligent Energy is the dominant term in publications revolving around the biannual SPE Intelligent Energy conference,http://www.intelligentenergyevent.com/ which has been one of the major conferences for the IO movement, along with the annual IO Science and Practice conferencehttp://www.ioconf.no/2010/doku.php which obviously supports the IO term.

Affiliated to the national charity Civic Voice, its stated purpose is \\"to stimulate public interest in and care for the beauty, history, and character of the city and locality, to encourage high standards of design, architecture and town planning; [and] to encourage the development and improvement of features of general public amenity\\". The Trust is independent, funded by public membership, grants, and donations. In addition to its campaigning and educational roles, the Trust comments on planning applications and takes part in planning policy consultations. Other activities include operation of an extensive blue plaque scheme across the city, and the annual organisation of Heritage Open Days at local sites. It is based at 17‚Äì19 Wharf Street, a mid- Victorian shop premises in The Calls area of the city centre, now serving as its office and bookshop. History The Civic Trust of England, now defunct, established a Leeds branch in 1965 as a response to the attitude it saw the city as having towards historic buildings. The city was in the midst of a transformation as new urban motorways were built (Leeds later branded itself as \\"Motorway City of the 70s\\"), including the Inner Ring Road and M621. As part of similar modernisation, old buildings in the city centre, Hunslet and Holbeck were \\"swept away regardless of their historic value\\", and the 1964 demolition of Gilbert Scott's Beckett's Bank on Park Row proved one too many. The Trust was set up with a ¬£50,000 donation from Charles Crabtree, a printing press manufacturer on Water Lane, Holbeck. By the 1970s, local newspapers were reporting action to save the city's historic buildings as a consequence of lobbying by the Trust. It surveyed every street in the city formed a Heritage at Risk register, with the aim of conserving and preventing the deterioration and demolition of built heritage. The director, Dr Kevin Grady, told the Yorkshire Evening Post in 1971 \\"we want to identify and highlight buildings at risk of disappearing for any number of reasons - perhaps they are in bad physical condition, or empty ... if a building is neglected it can end up being demolished because it is beyond repair which is how a lot of listed buildings are lost\\". The Trust avoided conflicts of interest between conservationists and developers by encouraging property owners to seek advice on renovating their buildings and obtaining grants. It also began to outline a vision of improvements to the city; in 1979 Olav Arnold presented a conference pitch in which he declared Boar Lane a \\"disaster zone\\" and the Inner Ring Road \\"just a litter track\\", and advocated for a new image as a tourist centre to challenge York and Harrogate, building on undeveloped rough sites, reviving the canals, and more parks and trees. With proactive campaigns from the 1960s until the present and declarations such as \\"What we build today is tomorrow's heritage\\" and \\"Conserving the best of the past\\", Leeds Civic Trust has been instrumental in conservation decisions across the city. Buildings it has saved from demolition or insensitive alteration include St Pauls House in Park Square, the former Bank of England on South Parade, the Third White Cloth Hall, Kirkgate Market, and the unified south side of Boar Lane. The Trust runs the Lower Kirkgate Townscape Heritage Initiative, which collects historical information about the quarter and advocates for the preservation of historic buildings, such as the First White Cloth Hall (1711). In 2013, volunteers began surveying all 3,000 Grade II listed buildings in the Leeds District, with the goal of creating a photographic and written record of the external condition of each building. Activities The Trust works with Leeds City Council, the Chamber of Commerce, the Business Improvement District (LeedsBID), and other partners on many projects while maintaining a \\"critical friend\\" relationship with these and other stakeholders. Campaigns and activities include: * Heritage - maintenance of the Heritage at Risk register to stimulate action on listed and unlisted buildings that are considered worthy of preservation. Buildings listed on the register are either Urgent (immediate structural danger) or At Risk (vulnerable through neglect and decay). An annual fortnight of Heritage Open Days - This festival of history and culture coordinated across England by the National Trust is arranged locally by Leeds Civic Trust as its flagship heritage event each year. Attractions throughout the city open their doors to the public; there are also lectures and guided walks. * Transport - A subcommittee meets to campaign for improved transport in Leeds. It advances the view that public transport options should be installed before new homes are completed, thus reducing new residents' dependence on automobiles. * Planning - The Planning Committee convenes every two weeks to review development in the city, and make recommendations to new and current planning applications. Interested parties such as council officers, architects, and developers often attend and contribute to these meetings. * Publishing - A small number of books about the history of Leeds have been published by the Trust, including A History of Kirkgate, Blue Plaques of Leeds, Edwardian Leeds in Postcards, and a series of four pamphlets with self-guided walks. * Special events - Public events organised in 2019 included \\"Leeds in Your Lunch Hour\\" short lectures, debates on The Leeds Look, a panel discussion about the future of railways in Leeds, and a talk from the social historian John Boughton about 20th-century council housing and the former City Architect, RAH Livett. Unlike similar civic societies in the UK, Leeds Civic Trust does not own or operate any historic property (save for its own offices and the Bear Pit on Cardigan Road, which it has restored) or museums in the city. It works as an event organiser and pressure group for conservation and to continue good design quality in new- builds. =Blue plaques= Leeds Civic Trust started its blue plaque scheme in 1987 and in 2019 it had over 170 plaques. They can be suggested by the public and sponsored by organisations. Before commemorating a person or building, it is given objective evaluation against specific criteria to ensure it is of high significance. The Blue Plaques record the impact of significant persons in the city's history. The first plaque, the Burley Bar Stone, was unveiled in November 1987 marking one of the medieval gates of Leeds, the stone itself surviving within the building of the Leeds Building Society on Albion Street. The West Bar and East Bar were also marked, and in 2017 the 164th plaque marked the North Bar. All plaques are monitored by members and those in very poor condition are returned to the manufacturer for repainting. Rainbow Plaque at Charlie's Nightclub, Briggate In association with the 2018 Leeds Pride event, the Trust created a trail of Rainbow Plaques to commemorate individuals, significant places and events which have contributed to the LGBT+ history of Leeds.

During World War II, he was director of the experimental physics department at the Technische Hochschule Dresden. From 1955, he was the head of the high polymer physics laboratory at the University of Mainz. Education From 1920 to 1925, Stuart studied at the University of W√ºrzburg and the University of G√∂ttingen. In 1925, he was awarded his doctorate under James Franck at the University of G√∂ttingen; his thesis was on resonance fluorescence of mercury vapor. He then went to work and study with Otto Stern, director of the \\"Institut f√ºr physikalische Chemie\\" (Institute for Physical Chemistry) at the Universit√§t Hamburg and then with Richard Gans, director of the II. Physikalische Institut (Second Physics Institute) at the Albertus- Universit√§t K√∂nigsberg (today, the Immanuel Kant State University of Russia). He completed his Habilitation in 1928, with an Habilitationsschrift on the temperature dependency of dielectric constants in gases and vapors.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Stuart. Career From 1928, Stuart was a Privatdozent and he did research on the Kerr effect and light scattering. In 1930, he was Rockefeller Foundation Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, specializing in molecular structure research. From 1935, he was an untenured ausserordentlicher Professor (extraordinarius professor) and substitute director at the Albertus- Universit√§t K√∂nigsberg. From 1936 to 1939, he substituted in the theoretical physics chair at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t (today, the Humboldt- Universit√§t zu Berlin), which had been vacated by Erwin Schr√∂dinger. From 1939 to 1945, he was an ordentlicher Professor (ordinarius professor) and director of the experimental physics department at the Technische Hochschule Dresden (today, the Technische Universit√§t Dresden). At Dresden, he began studying the viscosity and both light and electron scattering of macromolecules.Peter Paufler Physik und Physiker an der TH/TU Dresden 1828 ‚Äì 2008: Eine kurze Einf√ºhrung, Technische Universit√§t Dresden (2008 )Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Stuart.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 182n2. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed in 1933, was substantially directed at academia and judges. The Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft (DPG, German Physical Society) dragged its feet in the dismissal of Jews for more than five years. It was not until the end of 1938, on the initiation of a petition by Herbert Arthur Stuart and Wilhelm Orthmann, who were engaged in physics studies (academic) reform, that the DPG asked Jewish members to withdraw their membership.Hentschel, 1996, Appendix A; see the entry for the DPG.DPG ‚Äì Membership 1938 vs. 1939Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entries for Orthmann and Stuart.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 182n2.Herbert Arthur Stuart Bedeutung der Physik und Aufgaben des Physiker, Deutsche Mathematik Volume 4, 116 ‚Äì 117 (1939), as cited in Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, p.

In 1940, Stuart attended the historic meeting known as the M√ºnchner Religionsgespr√§che confronting the deutsche Phsyik movement; while an avid supporter of the National Socialist party line, Stuart was neutral during the dispute. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933, the concept of deutsche Physik took on more favor and fervor. Deutsche Physik was anti-Semitic and anti-theoretical physics, especially including modern physics, i.e., quantum mechanics. As applied in the university environment, political factors took priority over the historically applied concept of scholarly ability, even though its two most prominent supporters were Nobel Laureates Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark. During the period in which deutsche Physik was gaining prominence, a foremost concern of the great majority of scientists was to maintain autonomy against political encroachment. Some of the more established scientists, such as Max von Laue, could demonstrate more autonomy than the younger and less established scientists. This was, in part, due to political organizations, such as the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund (NSDDB, National Socialist German University Lecturers League), whose district leaders had a decisive role in the acceptance of an Habilitationsschrift, which was a prerequisite to attaining the rank of Privatdozent necessary to becoming a university lecturer. While some with ability joined such organizations out of tactical career considerations, others with ability and adherence to historical academic standards joined these organizations to moderate their activities. This was the case of Wolfgang Finkelnburg. It was in the summer of 1940 that Finkelnburg became an acting director of the NSDDB at Technische Hochschule Darmstadt. As such, he organized the M√ºnchner Religionsgespr√§che, which took place on 15 November 1940 and was known as the ‚ÄúMunich Synod.‚Äù The M√ºnchner Religionsgespr√§che was an offensive against deutsche Physik. Finkelnburg invited five representatives to make arguments for theoretical physics and academic decisions based on ability rather than politics: Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker, Otto Scherzer, Georg Joos, Otto Heckmann, and Hans Kopfermann. Alfons B√ºhl, a supporter of deutsche Physik, invited Harald Volkmann, Bruno Th√ºring, Wilhelm M√ºller, Rudolf Tomaschek, and Ludwig Wesch. The discussion was led by Gustav Borer, with Herbert Arthur Stuart and Johannes Malsch as observers. While the technical outcome may have been thin, it was a political victory against deutsche Physik.Beyerchen, 1997, 79 ‚Äì 102, 103 ‚Äì 140, 141 ‚Äì 167, 176 ‚Äì 179, 199 ‚Äì 210 .Hoffmann, 2005, 293-329.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix C; see the entry for the NSDDB.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 290.Document 110: The Fight against Party Politics by Wolfgang Finkelnburg in Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 339-345.

Revoicers generally have excellent skills in auditory phonetic/phonemic pattern recognition, similar to those utilized by a court reporter or stenographer, to identify the sounds of speech (phonemic sounds) of the speaker. Professional revoicers Professional (compensated) revoicers are requested and utilized by individuals with speech disabilities, and are paid in the same manner as other auxiliary service providers for persons with communication-related disabilities. In the United States, professional revoicers are compensated pursuant to the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Section 3, and the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments of 2008. Types of professional revoicers (1) Professional revoicers are used by individuals with speech disabilities who have normal or near-normal hearing ability; and (2) Professional DHH revoicers are used by individuals whose speech disabilities were caused by early severe or profound bilateral (both ears) hearing loss who wish to speak in their own words and with their own voices. The professional DHH revoicer is usually highly experienced and is able to function in a dual capacity‚Äîacting as a professional revoicer for expressive communications (utilizing lipreading (speechreading) and gestural cues, if necessary), and also acting as a communication assistant for receptive communications (using any method preferred and chosen by the person with the speech disability). Professional revoicers for telephone communications Professional Revoicers are also used by telephone companies, under the STS Relay System first established by Robert Segalman, Ph.D., who established the nonprofit organization, \\"Speech Communication Assistance by Telephone, Inc.\\" (SCT). The STS Relay System uses professional revoicers as \\"Speech-to-Speech Communication Assistants\\"(STS C.A.s). The STS C.A. Revoices the words of the person with a speech disability so that the other person on the call can understand him or her. The STS Relay System is now available at no cost to persons with speech disabilities in many countries. In the United States, the STS Relay System is monitored by the United States Federal Communications Commission,STS Access Numbers in the US and can be accessed by dialing 711 on any voice telephone and requesting \\"STS Relay Service\\". Other assistive technologies In some situations, technologies such as computerized speech generating devices (also known as \\"voice synthesizers,\\" where a \\"computerized voice\\" is heard by the listener(s)) are used by some individuals with speech disabilities. However, these systems may not work in some situations, and in other situations, the individual with the speech disability may not be able to effectively utilize these types of devices, due to additional disability difficulties, or in situations where interpersonal spoken communication is rapidly paced. Criticism of revoicing in the criminal justice system The use of revoicing in criminal trials has been compared to the now widely discredited use of other types of facilitated communication, which is believed to have resulted in innocent people being accused of crimes. One concern is focused on the tendency of the revoicer to have some bias in favor of the alleged victims, as many people claiming to be revoicers available for court testimony also have association with victim advocacy groups.

The JPDO is a multi-agency public/private initiative to include: United States Department of Transportation, United States Department of Defense, Department of Commerce, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Aviation Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Congress ended funding for JPDO in 2014.http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2014-05-27/faas-new- interagency-planning-office-replaces-jpdo Profile The NextGen portfolio includes large-scale investments, research, and operational changes that will profoundly impact the capabilities of the nation‚Äôs air transportation system. This includes developments in air traffic control, airspace management, satellite-based navigation, security (both at the airport and in the air), digital communications, net-centric operations, and changes in the way aviation weather information is gathered and disseminated throughout the system. With this in mind, and given the broad impact of these changes, the concept of a joint office, one that can manage the development of the NextGen architecture and integrated work plan, has become especially important. Since its inception, the JPDO has been in the development of a framework for planning NextGen, identifying and prioritizing key multi-agency concerns, and driving consensus in the development of investment choices and decisions. The JPDO is governed by a Senior Policy Committee (SPC) that is made up of Cabinet-level representatives from each of the JPDO‚Äôs government partners. The SPC is chaired by the Secretary of Transportation. The scope of the JPDO‚Äôs planning is broad. It engages the collaborative energies of the departments and agencies, the academic community, research, and private sectors. It covers a time span of nearly two decades and calls for a unique level of integration in the planning and budgeting of critical investments in the national transportation system. This approach is representative of a new paradigm in the way government pursues large-scale transformational initiatives, particularly those that encompass a broad range of mission areas, agencies, and the private sector. The JPDO‚Äôs Joint Planning Environment (JPE) is a key tool in these planning efforts. Through its Enterprise Architecture (the architectural blueprint), Concept of Operations, and Integrated Work Plan (all publicly accessible on the Internet), the JPE offers a level of transparency and accountability that the Federal Government expects. This kind of access is unprecedented. The concept is a critical part of implementing a Federated Enterprise Architecture. A New Paradigm in Government Management The JPDO mission, and what the organization is intended to achieve, has at times been called ‚Äúan experimental concept‚Äù in government management. NextGen involves a wide range of carefully timed and integrated activities, and while having significant benefits in the near- and mid-terms, it is also heavily focused on the long-term development of America‚Äôs aviation infrastructure. This kind of challenge necessitates an entirely new paradigm in the way government functions to include the way it plans, makes decisions, resources, budgets, and in the way it reacts to opportunities and challenges. Drivers for Change America‚Äôs air transportation system is responsible for over 5% of the nation‚Äôs GDP and has created 11 million jobs. Operationally, it is the safest system in the world and handles over 750 million passengers each year. However, the critical infrastructure supporting the system is facing significant limitations. The system relies on radar and point-to-point beacons to control and manage the flow of air traffic. These are all World-War-II-era technologies that make it difficult for the system to expand or to adjust to changes in system operations. If the aviation infrastructure is going to be able to meet the needs expected in the 21st century, it needs to be sufficiently scalable to support additional demand, and flexible enough to accommodate changes in the aviation industry as well as the introduction of new aircraft. Further, NextGen, through improved operations, new aircraft designs, and more efficient routes, will be able to recognize significant benefits in terms of reduced environmental impact. That, in a nutshell, is the objective of NextGen. The JPDO‚Äôs role in this change environment is to develop the multi-agency planning and implementation structure to make NextGen a reality. This includes outlining the key tasks and enablers needed to develop and implement satellite-based control of aircraft, net-centric digital communications, advanced weather applications, new concepts in airspace management, and more efficient and effective security management. These changes and new technologies will be the basis for a transformation of this critical component of America‚Äôs transportation infrastructure. The Joint Planning Environment One of the most critical objectives for the JPDO has been to develop the multi-agency planning structure. The framework for this work is the Joint Planning Environment (JPE). The JPE brings together the key planning tools that define NextGen. This includes the Concept of Operations (ConOps), the Enterprise Architecture, and the Integrated Work Plan (IWP). The ConOps is the description of how the NextGen system will work. The Enterprise Architecture provides a view of how NextGen will function and what capabilities need to be developed. In addition, it provides data from which analysis and modeling can be performed to assess options for determining the best business case for each set of investments and solutions. This structure then informs the key how-to component of the JPE, the IWP. The IWP, driven by the ConOps and the Enterprise Architecture, along with the collaborative involvement of each government partner and with significant private sector input, lays out each of the operational improvements and enablers necessary to make NextGen a reality, across bands of functional/operational segments. The IWP outlines the work of each partner agency, the timing for these efforts, the key research, policy, and implementation objectives, and defines how they fit together. In order to build collaboration and to demonstrate transparency, the JPE is publicly available at https://web.archive.org/web/20090108030528/http://jpe.jpdo.gov/ee/ or through the JPDO‚Äôs Web site https://web.archive.org/web/20080509140423/http://www.jpdo.gov/. The JPE, through a series of over 40 different reports, allows users to study the NextGen planning tools in terms of linkages, respective departmental and agency responsibilities, and timelines. This provides the user with the opportunity to see how NextGen development might be impacted by changes in schedule, funding, or relative priorities. NextGen Institute The JPDO is focused on establishing a new level of collaboration with other government departments and agencies, but it also has a mission to develop a strong relationship with the private sector. To this end, the JPDO created an entirely new organization called the NextGen Institute (http://www.ncat.com/ngats/index.html). The Institute provides the mechanism for industry to participate on an equal footing with their Federal counterparts in developing NextGen products and providing input on important policies. Currently the Institute has over 230 members. The principal involvement for industry is through a series of joint, public/private sector Working Groups. Each group covers a specific subject area that is important to NextGen‚Äôs development. In addition, each group has an industry and government co-chair, and has been tasked with providing extensive input into the NextGen planning process, as well as developing important products for use in future planning and implementation efforts. Data-Driven Decision Making NextGen represents a series of long-term investments in the national air transportation system, as well as a continuing long-term research commitment. It also requires a significant level of investment on the part of the private sector. To guide this investment the JPDO is developing a business case that will provide an investment analysis framework for future decision making and prioritization. Key to this work has been an extensive modeling and simulation effort aimed at developing critical information on the structure of future NextGen costs and the expected benefit from NextGen improvements. This structure creates a ‚Äúseries of trade spaces‚Äù where alternatives and various scenarios can be explored, analyzed, and compared. The objective is to develop a long-term, NextGen decision making model that is linked to the JPE and is heavily data-driven. Environmental Benefits NextGen offers a new approach to managing the environmental impact of aviation. Several air traffic procedures currently in use provide more efficient aircraft trajectories that reduce the amount of fuel aircraft burn during flight. These directly reduce emissions and noise. Over the longer term, gains provided by satellite-based navigation systems will offer more efficient routes that reduce the amount of time aircraft spend in flight. Engine plant and aircraft design are other aspects of the work being undertaken by the JPDO partner agencies. For instance, NASA, through its research work on engine plant design is developing lighter and more efficient engines that will lead to a substantial reduction in the output of pollutants. Some Examples of Ongoing Multi-Agency Initiatives The JPDO, working closely with its government partners, has identified several valuable opportunities to leverage technology, expertise, and ongoing research to foster collaboration on key NextGen issues. Some ongoing examples of this work include: =Net-Centric Operations= One of the most critical challenges to NextGen is to develop a net-centric capability for the national airspace system that will provide advanced exchange of operational data. This includes not only the exchange of information between aircraft and the ground, but also between aircraft in flight. The Department of Defense has a long-standing commitment to net-centric technology, and now through the JPDO is developing the initial operating concept and key references for advanced network connectivity to support NextGen. This kind of leveraging of existing technologies and capabilities is one of the JPDO‚Äôs most important objectives. =Integrated Surveillance= Another key JPDO contribution to the development of NextGen involves integrated surveillance. Integrated surveillance is the integration of cooperative and non-cooperative surveillance data in a user-defined environment. As NextGen initiatives, such as Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), a satellite-based navigation system, become available, it will be important to determine the optimum mix between cooperative surveillance capabilities like ADS-B and non- cooperative radar surveillance-based capabilities. At an inter-agency surveillance summit in December 2008, the JPDO was asked to develop a concept of operations and architecture for integrated national aviation surveillance. The work will include development of a funding profile and a long-term recommendation regarding future system governance. =Weather= Improved weather information is essential for NextGen to recognize some of its most important benefits. However, the challenge for the JPDO has been to organize the weather research, dissemination, and forecasting work of several different agencies into a cohesive national aviation weather strategy. This effort represented a considerable undertaking and one that involved extensive outreach and collaboration to achieve. The result, under the leadership of the Department of Commerce, and with the active involvement of the Department of Defense, the FAA, and NASA, is an agreement to develop a 4-D Weather Cube. This concept represents a major change in the way aviation weather information is managed. Using the 4-D concept, weather information will be shared with all system users, and will include probabilistic forecasts of expected weather conditions. =Research Coordination= NASA is the principal source of air traffic and aviation research. Historically, one of the most challenging aspects of this work has been the coordination of NASA‚Äôs efforts with the operational needs of the FAA. This concern is only heightened by the expanded needs of NextGen. With this in mind, and working with both agencies, the JPDO has established a series of Research Transition Teams to coordinate the development of key research requirements and to better coordinate the evolution of research into operational improvements and new capabilities. Challenges The Joint Planning and Development Office represents a substantial cultural change in the way government plans, coordinates, and budgets for a large-scale initiative. Rather than relying on coordination or cooperation on a situation-by-situation basis, the JPDO has brought together all of the government partners to work collaboratively in planning, designing, and implementing the NextGen initiative. However, working with so many different organizations has been a challenge. Each government department and agency has its own unique organizational culture which is reflected in its decision making processes, structure, planning process, and budgeting. Managing this challenge has required an extensive level of outreach, information sharing, collaboration, and negotiation. One of the challenges in this undertaking has been in maintaining the ‚Äúhonest broker‚Äù status that is critical to this change-oriented approach to managing a large-scale initiative. It is important that the JPDO is organizationally positioned in a way that allows it to have sufficient latitude, under the direction of its SPC, to carry out its mission.

It is located on the right bank of the Vilnia River between the Gediminas Tower and Bernardine Monastery and it covers over 9 hectares. Most of its territory is parkland, divided in the monastery exposition, the botanic exposition and other recreational territory including a children's amusement park. It hosts a variety of festivals and exhibitions, including an amateur chess championship of Ostap Bender. History Bernardinai Garden in autumn (2013) Until the 14th century, in the territory of Bernardine garden there was a Lithuanian pagan saint oaks wood. After Christianity the oaks were cut down and in 1469, when the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Casimir IV Jagiellon invited the Bernardine monks to Vilnius, the park was created. The monks rearranged the territory, set up a botanic exposition and organised a lot of other events. In 1864 the Russian tsar government closed the Bernardine garden, but about twenty years later the townspeople recovered this garden. It was reconstructed according to A. V. Strauss and Jakub Jasi≈Ñski project. But during the World War II, the Bernardine garden was destroyed. In the Soviet Union times it was reconstructed for the second time and named Jaunimo sodas (The Youth Garden). In 2013, the Bernardine garden was reconstructed for the third time. Reconstruction works were done by ‚ÄûVilnius city parks‚Äú and partly funded by the European Union. It is nowadays operational, and is known as one of the attractions in the Vilnius Old Town. Educational and recreational zones of the Bernardine Garden The botanical exposition is an area of the park where plants are sorted by groups and classes. In this exposition‚Äôs center there is a small pool containing sacred water plants. The monastery garden exposition was developed with medicinal herbs, potherbs, and edible and tea plants. There is a small fountain in the center of the exposition and a pergola covered in climbing plants. Singing fountain in Bernardinai Garden In the rest territory of the park there are two fountains. The main fountain, which is situated in the center of Bernardine garden, works all the day at weekends in a warm period of the year. On work days the fountain works only from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. as a light and music show.

He succeeded his father Benjamin Vulliamy as head of the firm and Clockmaker to the Crown. Biography The family was of Swiss origin. Justin Vulliamy, an ancestor, coming to England in 1704 to study the construction of English clocks and watches, under one Benjamin Gray, finally succeeded to his master's business at 68 Pall Mall, after having married his daughter. The old shop was situated at 52 Pall Mall, (where the Marlborough Club stood from 1868 until 1953) cites: view in Cassell's Old and New London, iv. 139 The firm obtained the appointment of Clockmakers to the Crown in 1742, which it held for 112 years. Benjamin Lewis commenced early to make a special study of horology. Succeeding to the business, he erected clocks for several important buildings, including the victualling yard, Plymouth, Windsor Castle, churches at Norwood, Leytonstone, and Stratford, St. Mary's Church, and the University Press at Oxford, and the cathedral at Calcutta. The clock at the post office, St. Martin's-le-Grand, was one made by Vulliamy for the Earl of Lonsdale. Vulliamy was a man of considerable ingenuity, and introduced several peculiarities and improvements into his clocks. Vulliamy was elected associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 13 March 1838, was auditor for the year 1842, and obtained in 1846 a premium of books for a paper on railway clocks. He was made free of the Clockmakers' Company on 4 December 1809, admitted to the livery in January 1810, and five times filled the office of master. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society on 14 January 1831, and retained his connection with the society till his death. Vulliamy was a man of refined taste in art, and possessed no small knowledge of architecture, paintings, and engravings. His library was extensive and well chosen, especially in that portion which related to his profession, and he possessed a valuable collection of ancient watches. cite: Arch√¶ologia, xxx. 92) He enriched the libraries of the Clockmakers' Company and of the Institution of Civil Engineers. To the company he also gave numerous models and specimens of clocks and watches, and to the institution he presented in 1847 the works of a clock made by Thomas Tompion about 1670 for Charles II, by whom it was given to Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland. On 1 March 1850 he exhibited to the Royal Arch√¶ological Institute six carvings in ivory by Fiamminge. He died on 8 January 1854, leaving two sons, Benjamin Lewis (1817‚Äì1886) and George John. Neither of his sons followed him in business and his stock of 170 gold watches and 100 clocks and cases was sold by Christine and Manson, King Street, St James‚Äôs on 8 June 1854.

Biography  1769 Transit of Venus observations at the King's Observatory in Richmond-upon-Thames. Benjamin Vulliamy was the son of Justin Vulliamy, a clockmaker of Swiss origin, who moved to London around 1730. Justin became an associate of Benjamin Gray, a watchmaker established in Pall Mall, and married Mary, a daughter of the same, with whom he had Benjamin. Justin succeeded his father-in-law in the charge of the business and from 1780, his son Benjamin entered the society (Vulliamy & Son). Father and son worked together until the death of Justin, on 1 December 1797. Derby Museum From an early age, Vulliamy had shown interest in pursuing his father's career. As an adult, he began to earn a reputation as a builder of mantel clocks, decorative timepieces that adorned the halls of high society (nowadays, some can be found at the Derby Museum and Art Gallery). His talent earned him a Royal Appointment in 1773, through which he came to receive an endowment of ¬£150 a year as George III's King's Clockmaker (there was a similar distinction, Royal Watchmaker, then held by George Lindsay). The king, an enthusiast for watches and mechanical devices, was patron of Justin Vulliamy, but only Benjamin received this significant honour. Around 1780, Vulliamy was commissioned to build the Regulator Clock, the main timekeeper of the King's Observatory Kew, which served as an unofficial Prime Meridian and was responsible for the official London time until 1884, when the Greenwich Royal Observatory assumed both roles. The Regulator Clock is now in the Science Museum in London. In 1780 Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy was born; he was the last Vulliamy to dedicate himself to the family clockmaking business. None of his descendants took up the art of clockmaking, although his son, Lewis, was notable as an architect. = The Vulliamy clocks = Vulliamy clocks were of considerable value and represented the climax of technology at the time. A Vulliamy clock was presented to the Chinese emperor by the diplomatic mission of George Macartney to Beijing in 1793.William Proudfoot, Biographical Memoir of James Dinwiddie: Embracing Some Account of His Travels in China and Residence in India (Liverpool: Edward Howell, 1868), 45. Vulliamy clocks were combined with fine porcelain figures to create artefacts that combined both science and art. The overall design was made by Vulliamy but he employed prize-winning sculptors such as John Deare, John Bacon and Charles Rossi to create the figures that were influenced by contemporary French designs. The Vulliamy family used Crown Derby to make the figures from porcelain designs. One of Vulliamy's assistants, Jacques Planche, was a brother of Andrew Planche who had been involved in the early Derby Porcelain business.

Reed, The Mexican Muralists. New York: Crown 1960. Early years A San Francisco native, Reed was born Alma Sullivan into an Irish Catholic family in 1889. Her marriage to businessman Samuel Payne Reed ended in annulment after he became ill. Outspoken, adventurous and bohemian, she carried what one observer described as the \\"mystic ailments that sometimes befall the people\\" of California. Journalism career She rose to fame as a journalist while writing for the San Francisco Call. An advocate for the disenfranchised, she was responsible for helping change the state's death penalty laws after she wrote a series of articles in 1921 about the death sentence given to a 17-year-old Mexican boy convicted of murder. Her articles led to the state commuting his sentence. Her writing won her an invitation by Mexican President Alvaro Obreg√≥n to be his guest in Mexico City. While traveling through the Yucat√°n, in 1923 she wrote another series of articles on the thefts and plundered of Mayan artifacts for the Peabody Museum at Harvard University by US diplomat, explorer and archaeologist Edward Herbert Thompson. The articles led the museum to return some of the objects to Mexico.Delpar, The Enormous Vogue, p. 101. Art Patron The New York Times took notice of the young journalist and hired her to continue reporting from Mexico and later the Middle East. By 1928, she settled in New York City and dubbed her apartment \\"the Ashram\\" to honor the Hindu hermitage where sages lived in peace among nature and to pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi's pacifism. Reed was a lifelong supporter and patron of Jos√© Clemente Orozco. Early after establishing the studio, Reed was introduced to Orozco by Anita Brenner.Delpar, The Enormous Vogue, p. 83. Orozco had been living in Manhattan and doing poorly in making a living. She immediately fell in love with his work and gave him a one-man show in September 1928. The financial arrangements with Reed were fraught, with Orozco believing that Reed \\"was not giving him an adequate share of the proceeds from the sale of his works.\\"Delpar, The Enormous Vogue, p. 147 She nonetheless continued to support his career. Her studio became a gathering place for Mexican artists especially those living in New York. She became friends with Jose L. Gutierrez who was a WPA fresco supervisor and was experimenting at Sherwin-Williams laboratories with plastic resins, which led to plastic paint formulas developed in 1953 as the first acrylic artist paint called \\"Politec.\\" Not long after the exhibition, she rented a portion of the top floor of the building on East 57th Street and established a formal gallery called \\"Delphic Studios\\". She promoted many Mexican artists, including Roberto Cueva del R√≠o, but she remained the principal patron for Orozco. She also exhibited the Mexican-themed watercolors and oils of Los Angeles artist Leo Politi in 1937. The one-man exhibit helped launch Politi's career as an author and illustrator of children's books. Notes *Schuessler, Michael K. Introduction to Peregrina. Further reading *Reed, Alma. Peregrina.

It resulted in the McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle. Competition F-16XL and a conventional F-16 In March 1981, the USAF announced the Enhanced Tactical Fighter program to procure a replacement for the F-111 Aardvark. The program was later renamed the Dual-Role Fighter (DRF) competition. The concept envisioned an aircraft capable of launching deep air interdiction missions without requiring additional support by fighter escort or jamming.Rininger 2009, pp. 85, 88. General Dynamics submitted the F-16XL, while McDonnell Douglas submitted the F-15E Strike Eagle. The Panavia Tornado was also a candidate, but since the aircraft lacked a credible air superiority fighter capability, coupled with the fact that it is not American-made, it was not seriously considered.Donald 1995, p. 44. The DRF evaluation team, under the direction of Brigadier General Ronald W. Yates, ran from 1981 through 30 April 1983. designated 71-0291, used as an F-15E demonstrator Though the two aircraft were competing for the same role, they were fairly different in design approach. The twin-engine F-15E Strike Eagle is basically an F-15D two- seat trainer with the back-seat station modified to support ground-attack instruments. The single-engine F-16XL has major structural and aerodynamic differences from the original F-16 Fighting Falcon, resulting in a promising design which, with its radically redesigned cranked-delta wing, greatly boosted performance; if selected, the single- and two-seat versions were to be designated F-16E and F-16F, respectively.Donald 1995, p. 45. As such, the XL would have required much more effort, time and money to put into full production. Additionally, the Strike Eagle has two engines, which gives it more thrust and capacity to carry more weapons and/or armor. Furthermore, engine redundancy can be very useful for an aircraft whose mission involves operating within the reach of anti-aircraft artillery and surface-to-air missiles, in addition to the standard threats of fighter aircraft and interceptors. On 24 February 1984, the USAF chose the F-15E; key factors in the decision were the F-15E's lower development costs compared to the F-16XL (US$270 million versus US$470 million), a belief that the F-15E had future growth potential, and possessing twin-engine redundancy.Jenkins 1998, p. 36.Ciborski, James R. \\"The F-15 Eagle: A Chronology.\\" History Office, Aeronautical Systems Center, Air Force Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, June 2002.

Accessed 15 January 2009. His field of specialty is the history of law in Japan, though he is perhaps most well known for his arguments regarding the political organization of Tokugawa Japan. Mizubayashi earned his bachelor's degree from the Faculty of Law at Tokyo University in 1970, and a master's degree from the Graduate School, Division of Law and Politics at the same university, in 1972. He served as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Japan Legal History Association from 2005‚Äì2008. Research Mizubayashi coined the term ,Ravina, Mark. Land and Lordship in Early Modern Japan'. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999. p27. a term now widely used by Western scholars as well, including Mark Ravina and Ronald Toby.Toby, Ronald. \\"Rescuing the Nation from History: The State of the State in Early Modern Japan.\\" Monumenta Nipponica, Vol. 56, No. 2. (Summer, 2001), pp. 197-237. Using this term, Mizubayashi and others reenvision the Tokugawa state not as a single, unified, bureaucratic entity, but as a feudal conglomeration of loosely tied together by their fealty to the shogunate, and by other obligations and systems imposed by the shogunate. In other words, he refocuses attention away from the shogunate, to the individual domains; building upon Mizubayashi's work, a considerable number of scholars have since published articles and books analyzing the history of individual han and reconsidering the extent to which they might be regarded as separate small countries, more loosely connected to the shogunate than was previously thought. Mizubayashi also argued that the decentralized nature of the Tokugawa state was due not primarily to a weak shogunate, but to the strength of the domains (han). In particular, he pointed to the strength of the ie system, under which daimy≈ç (feudal lords) were dedicated to protecting the honor, integrity, and wealth or power of their clan. Not strictly a matter of family or household honor and integrity, ie or clans were often continued by an adopted heir without diminishing its legitimacy. In Mizubayashi's vision, the political system of Tokugawa Japan was founded upon the ie. Tokugawa Japan consisted of a number of daimy≈ç clans enfeoffed by the Tokugawa clan, and in turn regarding other smaller samurai clans, merchant households, and peasant households as their vassals or subjects; Ravina also points out that religious institutions were frequently operated like ie in the Tokugawa period, with continuation of the order under an heir (adopted or otherwise) of the current head.Ravina. pp37-38.

The history of these organizations goes further back: The European Association of Editors of Biological Periodicals (EAEBP) was formed in April 1967 in Amsterdam by Miriam Balaban and others. EAEBP was renamed European Life Science Editors (ELSE) at its first General Assembly, held at the Royal Society in London in 1970. The European Association of Earth Science Editors (Editerra) was formed at a meeting of the Constituent Assembly of the European Association of Earth Science Editors, held in Paris from December 2‚Äì4, 1968, under the sponsorship of Unesco and the International Union of Geological Sciences. ELSE joined with Editerra to form the European Association of Science Editors (EASE) in 1982. Concerns of the organization included the development of international standards for science journals, guidelines for authors whose first language was not English, republishing of articles in multiple languages, and the improvement of science communication generally.  Gender Policy Committee  At its Congress in Tallin in 2012, upon the initiative of Shirin Heidari, EASE Council established the EASE Gender Policy Committee, the first international initiative to address the gender bias in the reporting of scholarly articles in scientific journals. The EASE Gender Policy Committee works to advance gender- and sex-sensitive reporting and communication in science. Its vision is greater gender diversity in science and publishing practices for enhanced quality, diversity and transparency for science to remain at the forefront of innovation and discovery. EASE Gender Policy Committee strives to realize its vision by addressing the gender gap in scientific research and publishing, advancing sex and gender reporting, and enhancing gender diversity in editorial management on a global level and across disciplines. Following a consultative process, the EASE Gender Policy Committee developed and published the Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) Guidelines, as the first reporting guidelines to encourage systematic reporting of sex and gender dimensions in scholarly publication. The SAGER guidelines are listed in EQUATOR. They have also been translated into Chinese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish, and Vietnamese, and adopted by a number of journals.  Affiliations  EASE is affiliated to the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS), and the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), has category A liaison status with the International Organization for Standardization (Technical Committee 46/subcommittee 9) (ISO) and is represented on committees of the British Standards Institution. Through its affiliation to IUBS and IUGS the Association is also affiliated to the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) and is thereby in formal associate relations with UNESCO.NGOs maintaining official relations with UNESCO EASE cooperates actively with Mediterranean Editors and Translators (MET), the Council of Science Editors (CSE), and the Association of Earth Science Editors (AESE).

Predictive brains, situated agents, and the future of cognitive science. (2013). Behavioral and Brain Sciences Behav Brain Sci, 36(03), 181-204. This term is used in behavioural sciences and neuroscience and studies associated with this term often strive to explain the brain's cognitive abilities based on statistical principles. It is frequently assumed that the nervous system maintains internal probabilistic models that are updated by neural processing of sensory information using methods approximating those of Bayesian probability.Kenji Doya (Editor), Shin Ishii (Editor), Alexandre Pouget (Editor), Rajesh P. N. Rao (Editor) (2007), Bayesian Brain: Probabilistic Approaches to Neural Coding, The MIT Press; 1 edition (Jan 1 2007)Knill David, Pouget Alexandre (2004), The Bayesian brain: the role of uncertainty in neural coding and computation, Trends in Neurosciences Vol.27 No.12 December 2004 Origins This field of study has its historical roots in numerous disciplines including machine learning, experimental psychology and Bayesian statistics. As early as the 1860s, with the work of Hermann Helmholtz in experimental psychology the brain's ability to extract perceptual information from sensory data was modeled in terms of probabilistic estimation.Helmholtz, H. (1860/1962). Handbuch der physiologischen optik (Southall, J. P. C. (Ed.), English trans.), Vol. 3. New York: Dover.Westheimer, G. (2008) Was Helmholtz a Bayesian?\\" Perception 39, 642‚Äì50 The basic idea is that the nervous system needs to organize sensory data into an accurate internal model of the outside world. Bayesian probability has been developed by many important contributors. Pierre-Simon Laplace, Thomas Bayes, Harold Jeffreys, Richard Cox and Edwin Jaynes developed mathematical techniques and procedures for treating probability as the degree of plausibility that could be assigned to a given supposition or hypothesis based on the available evidence.Jaynes, E. T., 1986, \`Bayesian Methods: General Background,' in Maximum-Entropy and Bayesian Methods in Applied Statistics, J. H. Justice (ed.), Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge In 1988 Edwin Jaynes presented a framework for using Bayesian Probability to model mental processes.Jaynes, E. T., 1988, \`How Does the Brain Do Plausible Reasoning?', in Maximum-Entropy and Bayesian Methods in Science and Engineering, 1, G. J. Erickson and C. R. Smith (eds.) It was thus realized early on that the Bayesian statistical framework holds the potential to lead to insights into the function of the nervous system. This idea was taken up in research on unsupervised learning, in particular the Analysis by Synthesis approach, branches of machine learning.Ghahramani, Z. (2004). Unsupervised learning. In O. Bousquet, G. Raetsch, & U. von Luxburg (Eds.), Advanced lectures on machine learning. Berlin: Springer-Verlag.Neisser, U., 1967. Cognitive Psychology. Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York. In 1983 Geoffrey Hinton and colleagues proposed the brain could be seen as a machine making decisions based on the uncertainties of the outside world.Fahlman, S.E., Hinton, G.E. and Sejnowski, T.J.(1983). Massively parallel architectures for A.I.: Netl, Thistle, and Boltzmann machines. Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Washington DC. During the 1990s researchers including Peter Dayan, Geoffrey Hinton and Richard Zemel proposed that the brain represents knowledge of the world in terms of probabilities and made specific proposals for tractable neural processes that could manifest such a Helmholtz Machine.Dayan, P., Hinton, G. E., & Neal, R. M. (1995). The Helmholtz machine. Neural Computation, 7, 889‚Äì904.Dayan, P. and Hinton, G. E. (1996), Varieties of Helmholtz machines, Neural Networks, 9 1385‚Äì1403.Hinton, G. E., Dayan, P., To, A. and Neal R. M. (1995), The Helmholtz machine through time., Fogelman-Soulie and R. Gallinari (editors) ICANN-95, 483‚Äì490 Psychophysics A wide range of studies interpret the results of psychophysical experiments in light of Bayesian perceptual models. Many aspects of human perceptual and motor behavior can be modeled with Bayesian statistics. This approach, with its emphasis on behavioral outcomes as the ultimate expressions of neural information processing, is also known for modeling sensory and motor decisions using Bayesian decision theory. Examples are the work of Landy,Tassinari H, Hudson TE & Landy MS. (2006). Combining priors and noisy visual cues in a rapid pointing task\\" Journal of Neuroscience 26(40), 10154‚Äì10163.Hudson TE, Maloney LT & Landy MS. (2008).

Neural coding Many theoretical studies ask how the nervous system could implement Bayesian algorithms. Examples are the work of Pouget, Zemel, Deneve, Latham, Hinton and Dayan. George and Hawkins published a paper that establishes a model of cortical information processing called hierarchical temporal memory that is based on Bayesian network of Markov chains. They further map this mathematical model to the existing knowledge about the architecture of cortex and show how neurons could recognize patterns by hierarchical Bayesian inference.George D, Hawkins J, 2009 Towards a Mathematical Theory of Cortical Micro-circuits\\" PLoS Comput Biol 5(10) e1000532. Electrophysiology A number of recent electrophysiological studies focus on the representation of probabilities in the nervous system. Examples are the work of Shadlen and Schultz. Predictive coding Predictive coding is a neurobiologically plausible scheme for inferring the causes of sensory input based on minimizing prediction error.Rao RPN, Ballard DH. Predictive coding in the visual cortex: a functional interpretation of some extra-classical receptive-field effects. Nature Neuroscience. 1999. 2:79‚Äì87 These schemes are related formally to Kalman filtering and other Bayesian update schemes. Free energy During the 1990s some researchers such as Geoffrey Hinton and Karl Friston began examining the concept of free energy as a calculably tractable measure of the discrepancy between actual features of the world and representations of those features captured by neural network models.Hinton, G. E. and Zemel, R. S.(1994), Autoencoders, minimum description length, and Helmholtz free energy. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 6. J. D. Cowan, G. Tesauro and J. Alspector (Eds.), Morgan Kaufmann: San Mateo, CA. A synthesis has been attempted recentlyFriston K, The free- energy principle: A unified brain theory?, Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010. 11:127‚Äì38 by Karl Friston, in which the Bayesian brain emerges from a general principle of free energy minimisation.Friston K, Kilner J, Harrison L. A free energy principle for the brain, J Physiol Paris. 2006. 100:70‚Äì87 In this framework, both action and perception are seen as a consequence of suppressing free- energy, leading to perceptualFriston K, A theory of cortical responses, Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2005. 360:815‚Äì36. and active inferenceFriston KJ, Daunizeau J, Kilner J, Kiebel SJ. Action and behavior: A free-energy formulation, Biol Cybern. 2010. 102:227‚Äì60 and a more embodied (enactive) view of the Bayesian brain. Using variational Bayesian methods, it can be shown how internal models of the world are updated by sensory information to minimize free energy or the discrepancy between sensory input and predictions of that input. This can be cast (in neurobiologically plausible terms) as predictive coding or, more generally, Bayesian filtering. According to Friston:Friston K, Stephan KE., Free energy and the brain, Synthese. 2007. 159:417‚Äì458 > \\"The free-energy considered here represents a bound on the surprise inherent > in any exchange with the environment, under expectations encoded by its > state or configuration. A system can minimise free energy by changing its > configuration to change the way it samples the environment, or to change its > expectations. These changes correspond to action and perception, > respectively, and lead to an adaptive exchange with the environment that is > characteristic of biological systems. This treatment implies that the > system‚Äôs state and structure encode an implicit and probabilistic model of > the environment.\\" This area of research was summarized in terms understandable by the layperson in a 2008 article in New Scientist that offered a unifying theory of brain function.Huang Gregory (2008), \\"Is This a Unified Theory of the Brain?\\", New Scientist. May 23, 2008. Friston makes the following claims about the explanatory power of the theory: > \\"This model of brain function can explain a wide range of anatomical and > physiological aspects of brain systems; for example, the hierarchical > deployment of cortical areas, recurrent architectures using forward and > backward connections and functional asymmetries in these connections. In > terms of synaptic physiology, it predicts associative plasticity and, for > dynamic models, spike-timing-dependent plasticity.

It predicts the attenuation of responses encoding prediction > error with perceptual learning and explains many phenomena like repetition > suppression, mismatch negativity and the P300 in electroencephalography. In > psychophysical terms, it accounts for the behavioural correlates of these > physiological phenomena, e.g., priming, and global precedence.\\" > \\"It is fairly easy to show that both perceptual inference and learning rest > on a minimisation of free energy or suppression of prediction error.\\" See also * Bayesian cognitive science * Cognitive architecture * Computational neuroscience * The free energy principle * Two-alternative forced choice References External links * Universal Darwinism ‚Äì Karl Friston * Karl Friston Home Page * Geoffrey Hinton Home Page * Cognitive neuroscience Brain Probabilistic models ","title":"Bayesian approaches to brain function"},{"id":"21107301","text":"Kitchuses was a village located southeast of Bay Roberts.

Scindia house - Ballard pier Mumbai closeup Scindia house - Ballard pier Mumbai full view The Scindia Steam Navigation Company was one of the oldest Indian shipping companies. Founded in 1919, envisioned by Walchand Hirachand, it was a joint venture of Walchand along with Narottam Morarjee, Kilachand Devchand and Lallubhai Samaldas all of them businessmen hailing from Gujarat. It played a significant role in Indian independence. It was the first large scale Indian owned shipping company and started an India ‚Äî Europe service with the Loyalty (ex-), but was forced to sign a 10-year agreement with British companies and its shipping route was restricted to the Indian coastal shipping trade for this period. National Maritime Day of India & Scindia 5 April marks the National Maritime Day of India. On this day in 1919 navigation history was made when SS Loyalty, the first ship solely owned by Indian people, through The Scindia Steam Navigation Company, Ltd., journeyed to the United Kingdom. This was a crucial step for Indian shipping history as sea routes were controlled by the British. The National Maritime Day was first celebrated on 5 April 1964 remembering this historic day and event, saluting the indefatigable spirit of Indian entrepreneurs, wholly owned by Indian management. History =Foundation and early years= In 1919, after the end of the First World War, Walchand Hirachand, with several of his friends, bought the SS Loyalty from the Scindias of Gwalior. The vessel was originally the RMS Empress of India (1890) bought from the Canadian Pacific Railway and paid for by the Maharaja of Gwalior as a hospital ship for Indian troops in the First World War. \\"Empress of India Sold; Gaekwar of Baroda Buys Liner to Serve as Hospital Ship,\\" New York Times. 20 December 1914; Ship List: Description of Empress of India Hirachand's business premise was that the post-war years would also spell massive growth for the shipping industry just as the war years had done; however, British companies such as Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O;) and British-India Steam Navigation Company (BISNC) were strong in the shipping industry and this combined with political inertia had caused most of the previous attempts to establish competing Indian companies to fail. Scindia's founders, Narottam Morarjee and Walchand Hirachand, formed the new company to take on the entrenched British interests and create India's own mercantile fleet. Equipped with a ship Walchand named his company The Scindia Steam Navigation Company Ltd. On 5 April 1919 the SS Loyalty sailed to the United Kingdom. This occasion was commemorated with the establishment of a National Maritime Day of India, celebrated for the first time on 5 April 1964, and annually thereafter. The company was recognised as the first Swadeshi shipping company in the true sense of the term and was referred to widely in Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs columns in Young India and Harijan on the Swadeshi movement, the boycott of foreign goods and the non co-operation movement. The new company started with passenger services but quickly concentrated on cargo to avoid competition with P&O.; The company barely managed to survive after entering into agreements on routes and fare wars with its foreign competitors. However, Walchand still supported new indigenous shipping ventures, as he believed that a strong domestic shipping industry was vital. =Expansion and competition= In 1923, the company signed a ten-year agreement with Lord Inchcape of P&O; and British India, which restricted Scindia to coastal trade only, but still allowed the company to expand steadily. In 1927, was launched by Vithalbhai Patel which was the first cargo steamer built by order of the company. Jalabala was later torpedoed and sunk by in 1943. In 1929, Walchand became the Chairman of Scindia Steam and continued in the same position till 1950, when he resigned on grounds of ill health. In 1932, the company purchased the Bengal Burma S.N. Co. The company entered the pilgrim trade to Saudi Arabia in 1937 and in the same year took over the Indian Co-operative Navigation & Trading Co. and the Ratnagar S.N. Co. 1939 Bombay S.N. Co. acquired and 1941 Eastern S.N. Co. also taken over. Services between India and the U.S.A began in 1947 and regular passenger and cargo services between Calcutta and the U.K./ Continent started in 1948. In 1950, a cargo and passenger service opened between India and Singapore and in 1954 an India to East Africa route was inaugurated. An India to West Africa service commenced in 1956 and in 1964 a Calcutta ‚Äî Great Lakes service started. In 1968 a service to the Persian Gulf was started. Scindia also operated services to Australia and New Zealand. Following the global shipping slump of the 1980s, Scindia S.N. Co. gradually sold off its fleet and ceased trading. By 1953, the company had secured 21% of Indian coastal traffic. In 1951, the Scindia Steam Navigation Company was involved in establishing the Indian Coastal Conference, with the help of twelve other Indian shipping companies.About us: ICC Shipping Association, accessed 4 July 2017 In September 1958, Indian Coastal Conference was registered as a non-profit making company under sec. 25 of the Companies Act, 1956. Based in Mumbai, its role is to deal with issues affecting the development of coastal shipping trade and to represent the interests of the coastal shipping industry before Government on matters relating to Merchant Shipping, Maritime Labour Convention. It became a successful organisation in the 1960s and continues to represent the interests of Indian coastal shipping companies. In 1954, Scindia was involved in a court case with Pyrene Co. Ltd. during which Lord Devlin spoke about the archaic references to a ship's rail as indicating when risk and liability passed from seller to buyer under an FOB contract, described the situation thus: :Only the most enthusiastic lawyer could watch with satisfaction the spectacle of liabilities shifting uneasily as the cargo sways at the end of a derrick across a notional perpendicular projecting from the ship's rail. To be able to survive against competition in the shipping market from British and other foreign businesses, Walchand had developed supporting businesses such as insurance. He also believed that there was a strong need for a shipyard in India and started work on one in 1940 at Visakhapatnam, named Scindia Shipyard later renamed the Hindustan Shipyard Limited. Its first ship, the 8000-ton Jalusha, was launched soon after independence by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1948. However, the shipyard came under government control a few months later due to the presumed importance of the project to country‚Äôs security and economic growth and was fully nationalised in 1961. The intervening years had been beset by harsh competition with the larger British shipping concerns. Passenger services were started with subsidiary companies, for the Burma trade and the Haj trade to Saudi Arabia. The war left a legacy of ships in poor condition, and a much smaller fleet. Shanti Kumar Morarjee and Sumati Morarjee also guided the fortunes of the company for many decades. =Post war= Following Indian independence in 1947, Scindia, supported by the Government, entered the U.S. and UK passenger and cargo trades, and later traded to Australia and Singapore. Business was rationalized with many small subsidiaries being wound up. The government continued to support the company with loans for expansion plans, and in 1958 the National Shipping Board was formed, marking the progress made by the Indian shipping industry. In the 1960s cargo services went to Germany, the Pacific coasts, Poland and Canada, with increasingly large ships. Following the global slump in the 1980s Scindia ceased trading. Status and operations since Scindia Steam Navigation Company (SCINDIA), incorporated on 27 March 1919, was established as a shipping company. Since April 1997, the company has not undertaken any shipping or shipping-related activity. It has continued maintenance operations and sale of its properties in compliance with various statutory and regulatory bodies. Scindia Workshop is a wholly owned subsidiary. The registered office is at Scindia Colony, Building III, Sir M.V. Road, Andheri (E), Mumbai-400069. Financials Scindia Steam Navigation Company disclosed that loss for the quarter ended in September 2008 had widened. During the year, the loss of the company increased 2.86% to Rs 48.95 million from Rs 47.59 million over the previous year period. Total income for the quarter dipped 6.9% to Rs 0.27 million, when compared with the prior year period. The company posted an earnings per share of Rs 5.17 for the quarter ended September 2008. On 17 March 2011 Scindia Steam Navigation Company Ltd informed BSE that a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company was to be held on 24 March 2011, to consider shifting the Registered Office of the Company and also the share department of the Company within the local limits of the city. Flag The company's house flag was a rectangular blue flag with a white disc in the centre bearing a red swastika, an ancient Hindu emblem of well being and goodluck. Legacy The Government of India has launched a number of stamps commemorating the company or its ships. The company produced a documentary film India's Struggle for National Shipping in 1947 which is considered as the first shipping film of India.

Prior to the 18th century cutlery manufacture in Sheffield had been undertaken by individual master craftsmen who would make an item from start to finish. In the late 18th century there was a large increase in the size complexity of the cutlery and tool industries that made it necessary for craftsmen to focus on a single stage of the manufacture. Cutlery factories then rented workshops to self-employed craftsmen, the little mesters, each specializing in one step of production, such as forging, grinding or finishing.

The current population is about 45 for the unincorporated township. Knight's Cove was probably first settled in the 1790s or early 1800s by families from nearby King's Cove. At that time, King's Cove was growing rapidly and several outlying coves were settled for shore space to prosecute the inshore fishery. Settlement was also attracted to Knight's Cove by the availability of land for gardens and livestock, as surplus produce found a ready market in King's Cove. Families that moved from King's Cove included the Aylwards, Ryans and Walshes. Knight's Cove had a population of 48 by the first census of Newfoundland in 1836. By 1857 the number of inhabitants had risen to 96 people, occupying nine fishing rooms, with two full-time farmers and four lumbermen. There was a Roman Catholic school and chapel between Knight's Cove and Stock Cove. Knight's Cove was established as a Church of England and Roman Catholic community sometime before 1836, and may have been named after Reverend Richard Knight, D.D. (1788-1860), a much-loved resident of Bonavista in the early nineteenth century. There is also a local tradition that ascribes the name to a corruption of 'Night's Cove'. According to that tradition, merchants doing business in nearby Stock Cove found Knight's Cove more attractive for a night's stopover.(\\"Deck's Awash\\", Mar./Apr. '84) Barbara Pederson.

Early years Paul de Cordon was born in Toulouse in to a Savoyan noble family. He was the son of a cavalry officer. During his childhood, he spent several years in Mainz, Germany, where his father was garrisoned. It was in Mainz that he began taking photographs using a small camera given to him by his father. Later, he said that he had spent long hours in the shop of an old German photographer, and that is how he began to learn photography. While he lived in Germany he became interested in the circus. In the 1920s, German circuses such as Althoff were travelling across the country with large crews and many animals. After his Lyc√©e years, he enrolled in the cavalry. In the army he spent most of his time training horses and riding in steeple chases and military cross. He participated to more than 500 races on various French and European race fields and sometimes won. In 1940, during World War II, he was captured in the Ardennes. After two unsuccessful escape attempts, he was sent to Colditz. In 1945, the United States Army set him free. He stayed in the army for a few more months and was affected to the Cadre Noir in Saumur.Jean Devaivre, Action, Ed Nicolas Philippe 2002 Second life Cordon met film director Jean Devaivre, a figure in the French Resistance, while he was an underground activist and working for the German- owned Continental Films in Paris. Devaivre asked Cordon to be his assistant. Cordon had always been attracted to the stage, having briefly attended Charles Dullin acting sessions in the 1930s, but his interest in photography was also a key factor in the decision. In the early 1950s Cordon decided to become a professional photographer. For many years he worked in his Paris studio for fashion designers and advertising agencies. He began developing a huge personal project on circus and cabaret. He spent many nights with his camera at the Crazy Horse Saloon, at Medrano or at the Bouglione brothers' Cirque d‚ÄôHiver. He also travelled around the world visiting circuses. During these trips, Cordon developed strong links with old circus families such as Schumann, Rancy, Knie and Gruss,Jacques Fort, Regard sur le Cirque, Biblioth√®que Historique de la ville de Paris 2002 with whom he shared a same passion for horses. At this time he wrote several articles for the Swiss annual Information Hippique on circus horses and riders.http://next.liberation.fr/culture/2002/06/20/la-vie-de-chapiteau_407678 Circus instants \\"While watching this obstinate quest for the perfect gesture, I realized that I was living what I had always been expecting : a circus instant\\".Paul de Cordon, Instants de Cirque, Ch√™ne 1977 Instants de Cirque is the title of Cordon's most famous book and the concept he described as key to his circus images. This \\"instant\\" has some similarity with the \\"decisive moment\\" evoked by Henri Cartier-Bresson; it is the opposite of luck or accident, but rather a tiny fragment of time when the photographer‚Äôs eye catches something that other eyes do not. One of Cordon‚Äôs famous pictures, \\"Three zebras\\", shot at the Amsterdam Zoo in 1957 and published all around the world,LIFE, March 16, 1962 is an example of something common that suddenly becomes unique. It is also particularly true for another photograph \\"Amis, Gilbert Houcke and Prince\\". This image has nothing to do with what is usually referred to as circus photography, it is shot backstage, there is no circus ring, no light, no stage costume, and no audience, yet it is a splendid vision of an animal trainer. Cordon did not like to be described as a circus photographer. He loved circuses, but was not much interested in the documentary aspect often linked to circus photography. He used to say, \\"I am looking for the very style of an artist, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm interested in\\". The photographs he took revealed aspects of the subject‚Äôs character and personality. He had a talent for capturing what other probably did not see, and was above all interested in producing images that would translate an emotion and be different. This is probably the reason why so many circus artists wanted to be photographed by him. Crazy Horse Saloon Cordon met Alain Bernardin at the very beginning of the Crazy Horse Saloon. The former antique dealer who had just invented a new cabaret and the former cavalry officer shared the same dislike for conventional rules and the same interest in stage shows. Cordon spent long hours at the Crazy, where he took many pictures. He liked the company of models and dancers, and they trusted him when he came into their dressing room with his camera. This part of his work remains lesser known than his circus photographs. Technique Cordon used different cameras. His 1950‚Äôs photographs were made either with a Rolleiflex 6x6 or with a 35 mm Leica; afterwards, he almost exclusively used Nikon cameras. Cordon never used a flash when not in his studio. He liked to work in the dark room and to do prints of his negatives, considering printing as a second shooting. However, when the prints were for books or exhibitions he had them done by a professional printer. Cordon was also very interested in studio work, and set up his own studio in the late fifties where he shot advertisement and fashion photographs. In his studio, Cordon worked mostly with a Hasselblad camera but also used a Linhof view camera. He loved working with studio flash and was an early user of the Balcar flash. Dick Balli, the founder of the company, became one of his close friends.

It was established in July 2000 as BT Ignite.  History  =Renaming= BT Group began operating as a private corporation after the Telecommunications Act 1984. During the 1990s, between the loosening of national telecom monopolies and the current (largely) liberalised market, BT Group entered into a number of alliances in order to serve its mainly, then, UK-based multi-national customers. From the 90's through the early 2000s, BT Group, then known as British Telecom, struggled. The company failed to secure a strong partner, struggled to expand internationally, and had significant debt. In 2002, the attempt at an alliance (Concert 2 with AT&T;) was disbanded. Thereafter, the company brought together a number of joint ventures, partly owned assets and wholly owned subsidiaries into the single entity that exists today. On April 1, 2002, BT‚Äôs contracts with former Concert customers were transferred to BT Global Services and BT Retail. BT Ignite was renamed BT Global Services in April 2003. By late 2003, around 50% of BT Global Services‚Äô about 5,000 staff were employed outside the UK. =Acquisitions= Between 2002 and 2009, the Global Services division made a string of acquisitions to expand its global footprint and broaden its business offer to customers. Most notable are Radianz, the then network arm of Reuters in 2005; the global network operator Infonet in 2005; managed security market leader Counterpane in 2006; US IT consultancy company International Network Services Corp. (INS) in 2007; and Asian systems integrator Frontline in 2008. In 2016, Global Services signed an agreement to acquire IP Trade S.A., a provider of unified communications and collaboration solutions for trading floor environments and command-and-control dispatch centres.  Customers  In 2005, Global Services won a multi-year worldwide outsourcing contract to provide communication and IT services to FIAT in a deal worth ‚Ç¨450 million (¬£303 million) over five years across 40 countries. BT also acquired Fiat's subsidiary, Atlanet for ‚Ç¨80 million which provides domestic telecoms services to Fiat and other business customers across Italy. In 2006, Atlanet was merged with Albacom to form BT Italia. In 2006, Global Services agreed a ¬£100 million seven-year worldwide outsourcing contract to provide communication and IT services to PepsiCo, across their 900 locations in more than 60 countries as well as upgrading their network infrastructure. In 2008, Global Services agreed a $650 million (¬£332 million) five-year worldwide outsourcing contract to provide communication and IT services to Procter & Gamble, across more than 1,100 locations in more than 80 countries. In January 2016, Global Services agreed a ¬£100 million seven-year contract with the BBC to provide its broadcast network from April 2017, when it finishes its remaining contract with Vodafone UK via Atos. The deal will see the BBC move to a new, state-of-the-art network that will link all BBC UK sites, including 21 broadcasting centres and local radio stations, as well as connecting to the main overseas bureaux and partners for playout of the BBC‚Äôs TV channels. It will carry all video, audio and data traffic, as well as fixed-line telephony, ISDN and broadband services. On 10 February 2016, Global Services announced it has been awarded a five-year contract worth more than ¬£9 million, to deliver computer and data centre services to Bromley London Borough Council. The contract was won by BT as part of a pan-London framework agreement for information and communications technology (ICT) services set up by Westminster City Council, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and Hammersmith and Fulham councils. Global Services also manages the global networked IT estates for Komatsu and Randstad Holding. In January 2019 BT became the first international group to receive two national telecoms licences from China‚Äôs Ministry of Industry and Information Technology which will enable it to sell services direct to Chinese customers.  Finances  At the start of 2009, Global Services took a ¬£340m writedown due to poor \\"cost controls\\" shortly after the resignation of its CEO Fran√ßois Barrault. Later in the year the company reported losses of ¬£2.1bn, despite sales of ¬£8.8 billion. Global Services then underwent a transformation programme, including cost saving initiatives, leading to substantial increases of EBITDA, operating profits and operating cash flow during its 2009‚Äì2010 financial year. In May 2010, BT announced an investment plan to increase its capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region. By the end of its 2010‚Äì2011 financial year, Global Services had increased orders with customers by 10% year on year, improved profitability, and became operating cash flow positive a year ahead of schedule. Total income for Global Services in 2016-7 was more than ¬£5bn. In 2017-2018 financial year Global Services reported a ¬£5bn revenue, ¬£434m EBITDA and ¬£10m operating profit. Management From 2004 until 2008 Fran√ßois Barrault was CEO of BT Global Services and president of BT International, before leaving the company after poor financial performance results. He was replaced by Hanif Lalani. Jeff Kelly was appointed CEO in early 2010. Luis Alvarez was appointed CEO, in October 2012. Prior, Alvarez had been president of BT‚Äôs European, Middle East, Africa and Latin American operations. Bas Burger was appointed CEO on 1 June 2017. Martin Smith is Chief Finance Officer, Kevin Taylor is president of BT in Asia, Middle East and Africa, Chet Patel is Chief Transformation Officer and president of BT in Continental Europe, Ashish Gupta is president of BT in the UK and Global Banking and Financial Services, and Jennifer Artley is president of BT in the Americas.

The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada of the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 3rd Canadian Division, supported by the 6th Armoured Regiment (1st Hussars) of the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade attacked the village of Le Mesnil-Patry in Normandy, to advance southwards towards the higher ground of Hill 107 to the west of Cheux. The attack was intended to support a larger operation by the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and the 7th Armoured Division to capture the city of Caen and to advance in the centre of the bridgehead next to the First US Army. The battle was a German defensive success but the greater German objective of defeating the invasion by a counter-offensive also failed. Both sides changed tactics after the first week of the invasion, the Germans constructed a defence-in-depth, with tank forces reserved for limited counter-attacks, intended to slow the Allied advance inland and avoid casualties and losses of equipment until reinforcements arrived. The Allies began to accumulate supplies to conduct attrition attacks, rather than persist with mobile operations by large numbers of tanks supported by infantry. More atrocities by troops of the 12th SS-Panzer Division Hitlerjugend against Canadian prisoners occurred and orders given by a junior Canadian commander to refrain from taking German prisoners as a reprisal, were countermanded by higher authority as soon as they were discovered. Canadian offensive operations in the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division area ceased, apart from raiding and reconnaissance patrols, until VIII Corps commenced Operation Epsom on 26 June. Background =Invasion of Normandy= Canadian reserve troops disembark at 'Nan White' Beach at Berni√®res-sur-Mer. On 6 June 1944, Allied forces invaded France in Operation Neptune, the landings of Operation Overlord. A force of several thousand ships transported assault forces to the beaches in Normandy, supported by The D-Day landings succeeded but the Allies were unable to capture Caen as planned. The U.S. 101st Airborne Division, 82nd Airborne Division and the British 6th Airborne Division with an attached Canadian airborne battalion, dropped behind the German coastal defences. The British and Canadian paratroops behind Sword Beach were to capture bridges over the Orne river such as Horsa and Pegasus Bridge and silence the Merville Gun Battery to hinder German counter-attacks. The Allies established a bridgehead north of Caen on the east bank of the Orne, which protected the beachhead, forced the Germans to oppose with scarce tank units needed elsewhere and provided a jumping-off position for later attacks towards Caen. Prelude =Plan= On 9 June, The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada had come under the 7th Brigade and moved to occupy Bray. On 10 June, plans were laid for an attack to fill a gap between the 7th and 9th Brigades, in the valley of the Mue river between Cairon and Rots. Planning began for an advance by the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade south of Norrey-en-Bessin to occupy high ground beyond Cheux, south of Norrey-en-Bessin, with the clearing of the Mue valley as a preliminary, in support of the main attack due on 12 June. Early on 11 June, the preliminary attack was cancelled by General Miles Dempsey, the commander of the Second Army and combined with the main attack, forming the left pincer of another attempt to capture high ground south of Cristot. The 69th Infantry Brigade of the 50th (Northumbrian) Division, attacked further west near Bronay, north-east of Le Mesnil-Patry. An attack by the 7th Armoured Division through Tilly-sur-Seulles on Villers-Bocage and √âvrecy, required that all German units further east be engaged to prevent them moving westwards. If the attack succeeded, II Battalion, SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment 26 would be cut off and destroyed, leaving a gap in the positions of the 12th SS-Panzer Division exposing Carpiquet, the rear of Caen and the confluence of the Odon and Orne rivers. The 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade issued orders in the morning of 10 June to the 10th Armoured Regiment (The Fort Garry Horse). At on 11 June, the attack toward Cheux was ordered to begin as soon as possible that day. The commander of the 1st Hussars had no time conduct a reconnaissance with the R Group (a reconnaissance group composed of attached arms, an artillery representative and the squadron leaders) and then complete an appreciation of the situation before issuing orders; the squadron commanders would have then issued detailed orders to the troop leaders. The 6th CAR tried to get ready, \\"In the morning we were told we were moving at Sunday 11 June. I knew one tank would he left behind, but was told later that only eighteen took part in the shoot. There was no briefing.\\" Some of the 1st Hussar troops thought it would be a quiet HE shoot with the artillery. The operation was to begin at the front positions of 7th Canadian Brigade, where a company of the Regina Rifles was astride the railway and in Norrey. The 6th Armoured Regiment (1st Hussars) and The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada were to pass through Norrey and then advance south, to capture high ground near Cheux, with B Squadron attacking first, followed by C Squadron which was to move to the high ground on the right flank, ready to give covering fire and then the Headquarters Squadron, A Squadron behind B Squadron. The infantry were to ride on the tanks and in the first phase, reach Le Mesnil-Patry by then make a right flanking movement through the village to bypass Cheux; the rest of the armoured brigade would then to join the 6th Armoured Regiment on the objective at The commanders of the first phase asked for more time to prepare but were refused, because of the importance of the attacks by the 7th Armoured and 50th (Northumbrian) divisions. A Canadian success could force the Germans out of Cristot and ease the advance of the 50th Division. The plan depended on the quick seizure of Le Mesnil-Patry, which would enable the north-west part of the 12th SS-Panzer Division defence perimeter to be cut off by a supporting attack by the 69th Infantry Brigade, from north-east of Le Mesnil-Patry. Much of SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment 26, commanded by Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Wilhelm Mohnke would be destroyed. An opportunity would be created to advance to the Odon or turn east toward Carpiquet and envelop the rest of the 12th SS-Panzer Division. When the 1st Hussars were established at Le Mesnil-Patry, the 10th and 27th CAR could attack southwards to the high ground and make Caen untenable. Battle =Le Mesnil-Patry= The 6th CAR had recently received twenty replacement tanks and crews, who had not had time to settle in and few of the men had much idea of the plan. The 6th CAR advanced south across the highway and railway tracks, with B Squadron forward, carrying D Company of the Queen's Own Rifles (QOR) the backs of the tanks. South of the railway was a knocked out Panther, The Canadian column reached Norrey-en-Bessin at to find that the Canadian troops there had not been informed of the attack and that the proposed forming up place was in a minefield. The flat grain fields towards Le Mesnil-Patry had not been occupied and there had been no sign of a German withdrawal. The advance through the fields between Norrey and Le Mesnil-Patry was intended to begin at the same time as the attack further west against Cristot but this was delayed. The village was dominated by a church in the centre and the Pioneer Platoon from II Battalion, SS-Panzer Grenadier Regiment 26 was inside the village. The Canadian advance had been reported and as the vanguard reached the village centre, German artillery and mortar fire began while the QOR, on the backs of the tanks were exposed. The tanks increased speed but in the village centre was a crossroad, where the road to Le Mesnil took a sharp right turn. At the regiment reported that the advance had been held up by fire from unseen positions. SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment 26 and a company of tanks from the 12th SS-Panzer Division ambushed the tanks of B Squadron in the grain fields near Le Mesnil-Patry, assisted by intelligence gleaned from Hussar radio traffic, after capturing wireless codes from a knocked out Canadian tank on 9 June. The Germans had been instructed to The Shermans were easy targets in the narrow streets and drove for open country, while the QOR were left to fight the German infantry. The battle group had been dispersed and would have no secure base, until D Company consolidated the village. About a platoon of D Company followed the tanks on foot and advanced about ; the tanks mopped up some machine-gun nests and infantry positions. The tanks of B Squadron pushed on, scattering German infantry in their path. Some B Squadron tanks and infantry reached a small rise on the edge of the village, where the tanks were engaged by concealed anti-tank guns on the left flank near St. Mauvieu, which quickly knocked out six tanks. C Squadron moved to the right to give covering fire but were mistakenly engaged by British anti-tank gunners of the 50th Division. A Squadron and the RHQ advanced through Norrey, to the start line just to the west and C Squadron retired, flying recognition signals and having to pick its way round the Canadian minefields and the ruins of Norrey, where German artillery-fire had collapsed the church into the road. As B Squadron and D Company advanced from Norrey, C Squadron and troops of the QOR also advanced and were engaged from the north-west, from Le Mesnil-Patry and from the south-east, the Canadians had broken through the boundary of III Battalion, SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment 26 and I Battalion, SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment 26. Both were supported by 7.5 cm Pak 40 anti-tank guns and s of the 2nd SS-Panzer Battalion. Wilhelm Mohnke, the commander of SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment 26 was well forward and requested tank support. D Company troops kept to the ground and crawled forward to the outskirts of Le Mesnil-Patry. A party of seven riflemen and two tanks worked to a flank and entered the east end of the village. Three German tanks attacked from the right flank and knocked out several Canadian tanks, which had taken post in an orchard. The German and Canadian infantry took cover from cross-fire as tanks on both sides were knocked out. The commander of the first Sherman saw that the German troops and tanks in the area were formed up for attack. Three half-tracks were seen parked together near infantry, who began running around in confusion and then about thirty more tanks also parked together were seen, then a battery of 88mm guns and more half-tracks. Three of the half-tracks were destroyed by the Sherman, which then caught fire. The crew reversed for , with clothes and ammunition burning on the outside of the tank as Panzergrenadiers threw grenades and the crew fired back, before bailing out and retiring along a ditch. SS-Panzer Company 8 was deployed in an ambush position about south of Le Mesnil-Patry and when \\"mushrooms of smoke, generated by knocked out tanks\\" were seen, the company counter-attacked and quickly knocked out several Shermans. The tanks pushed through the woods and saw the 6th CAR, where B Squadron was advancing towards Le Mesnil-Patry and C Squadron was moving up to support. Three Panzer IVs moved to engage the Canadian tanks as the rest of the company engaged the Hussars from the Le Mesnil area. The flanking manoeuvre brought the German tanks round the exposed left rear of B Squadron and onto the flank of C Squadron. Major E. Dalton, commander of the most advanced section of the Queen's Own Rifles, was wounded in the leg by mortar fire and Lieutenant-Colonel Colwell, the commander of the Hussars, forward with the most advanced tanks, realizing that the regiment was outflanked by the German tanks, ordered a retreat to the start line to reform. B Squadron was trapped in the village and almost destroyed by Panzerfausts, Panzerschrecks and anti-tank guns. The Germans knocked out from tanks, only two of which returned. The attack into the Mue valley was spearheaded by No. 46 Royal Marine Commando, under the command of the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade, with support from a squadron of the 10th Canadian Armoured Regiment. The R√©giment de la Chaudi√®re (Chaudi√®res) and the North Shores were to move into the valley and consolidate villages as they were captured. The Commandos attacked down the valley from Thaon and captured Cairon, Lasson and Rosel; in the evening the force entered Le Hamel and Rots. Troops of SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment 12 and Panther tanks hidden in Rots held their ground; tanks of the Fort Garry Horse and infantry of the Chaudi√®res were sent forward as reinforcements but German resistance was not overcome until the early hours of 12 June. In the evening, artillery-fire diminished, several ambulances drove out from the Canadian lines and the Germans ceased fire while wounded were collected by both sides; the Canadians claimed destroyed. During the night, The Fort Garry Horse and the infantry of the Chaudi√®res concentrated between Bray and Rots, about behind the front line, ready to forestall an attempt by the Germans to exploit the confusion and attack northwards towards the coast. =Cristot= The 69th Infantry Brigade attack on Cristot was arranged quickly, with very little known about the ground, beyond what the commander of the 8th Armoured Brigade had learned during the morning. Only scattered German infantry were said to be in the area but it was suspected that the Germans were under cover, waiting for the main attack before revealing themselves. The brigade planned an attack by the 6th and 7th Green Howards, after which the 5th East Yorks were to move on Point 103, supported by the 4/7th Royal Dragoon Guards, the 147th Field Regiment and two batteries of the 90th Field Regiment but a detailed fire plan could not be arranged at such short notice. The attack began from Audrieu to the north-west, to guard the left flank of the 8th Armoured Brigade and the 8th DLI in St. Pierre. The 5th East Yorks would then relieve the 1st Dorsets on the high ground of Point 103, to keep the eastern (left) flank of the 50th (Northumbrian) Division level with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and would then capture the high ground at Point 102, south of Cristot. The attack began at with the 6th Green Howards and the tanks of the 4/7th Dragoons but the (12th SS-Reconnaissance Battalion) had arrived around Cristot earlier in the day. At about during the advance through dense bocage towards Cristot, the tanks and the infantry became separated. The Germans let the unescorted British tanks pass by and then quickly knocked out seven of the nine tanks from the rear; by the 6th Green Howards advance had also been stopped outside Cristot. The reserve company was sent forward and began to force back the German defenders but parties of German infantry got behind the Green Howards, who by had advanced close to Point 102, despite many casualties. German tanks attacked across the Green Howards axis of advance, who were then ordered to retire westwards, to the high ground of Point 103 to avoid encirclement. Aftermath =Analysis= The attack on Le Mesnil-Patry had been disastrous for the Canadian attackers and the broader Allied advance on Caen was defeated. An English newspaper called it the modern equivalent of the Charge of the Light Brigade. The 7th Green Howards advance from the west also failed, as the battalion was stopped by machine-gun fire along the Bayeux‚ÄìCaen railway embankment near Brouay. The 5th East Yorks were caught in the open when moving to relieve the 1st Dorsets, during the preparatory artillery bombardment for a German counter-attack on Point 103 and had many casualties. The 6th Green Howards may have disrupted the German infantry forming for the attack on Point 103 but the German tanks overran the 5th East Yorks. Having also become separated from their infantry, the German tanks were repulsed at the firm base held by the 1st Dorsets and part of the 8th Armoured Brigade at The attack on Cristot had been planned according to the January 1944, 21st Army Group infantry-tank theory, in which an attack was to be made in waves, with tanks followed by infantry and then more tanks. Experience showed that in close country, tanks must attack side by side with the infantry and even then, casualties for tanks and infantry would be high, as it was extremely difficult for tanks to watch accompanying infantry. The attempts by XXX Corps to advance round the open German flank at Caumont and the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division to capture high ground around Le Mesnil-Patry, with tank forces supported by infantry rather than vice versa, were not tried again until Operation Goodwood. Having experienced similar losses to those of the 12th SS-Panzer Division during the first few days, the Anglo-Canadians began to accumulate resources to conduct set-piece attrition attacks. German attacks had similar results; the 12th SS-Panzer Division operation order of 7 June, required the division to throw the Allies into the sea but the attempt was a costly failure. The Germans changed tactics and began to limit counter-attacks to restore a defence in depth, rather than continue the failed counter- offensive against the invasion. =Casualties= D Company of the Queen's Own had most listed as missing. During the day of the 6th Armoured Regiment and of the Queen's Own Rifles were lost. In 1997 McNorgan recorded and casualties and three German tanks knocked out. Rots was consolidated by the Chaudi√®res, who were reported to have buried 122 Panzergrenadiers. 46 Royal Marine Commando had and 35 missing. The defence of Cristot cost and the 6th Green Howards When the fighting in the area diminished after 14 June, Sergeant Gariepy, commander of the B Squadron tank which had escaped from Le Mesnil-Patry and the 1st Hussar padre, went out to identify the dead and recover identity discs. A few days after the Canadian attack, more than dead were said to have been found on the battlefield, although this appears to be an exaggeration. =Atrocities= Men of the Headquarters Company of the Queen's Own Rifles were ordered to search for Canadian dead, before the Canadians withdrew completely from the area. Amongst them was Bill Bettridge, who discovered 6 Queen's Own Riflemen from D Company, who all had the same wound. Bettridge later wrote that following the action at Le Mesnil-Patry, troops of the 12th SS-Panzer Division captured seven Canadians, who had been wandering around no-man's land since the battle, all being tired and hungry. The men were interrogated by an officer of the 12th SS-Pioneer Battalion at an ad-hoc headquarters in the village of Mouen, about south-east of Le Mesnil-Patry. On 14 June, two crew members of the 1st Hussars reached Canadian lines and reported that they had seen several Canadian prisoners shot in the back after surrendering.

Cook, Cranfield, Perry and Willett were killed by a firing squad and the remaining men were shot in the head at close-range. In the First Canadian Army report it was concluded the SS made the local French villagers dig a mass grave and bury the men, which was discovered by troops of the 49th (West Riding) Division when they captured the village on 25 June. With the murders of prisoners taken at Le Mesnil-Patry on 11 June, are known to have been killed by the 12th SS-Panzer Division. If the ratio between combat deaths and POW murders is taken from when the 3rd Canadian and 12th SS Divisions met on the battlefield, of 677 deaths in the 3rd Canadian Division, were of men murdered after capture. Stories of German atrocities circulated swiftly among Canadian troops and an order-of-the-day instructed the Canadians to take no prisoners, until quickly countermanded by higher authority. Five members the 12th SS-Panzer Division were prosecuted for the crime; Siebken and Schnabel were found guilty and hanged at Hameln Prison on January 20, 1949.

The Society produced modern realist plays, mostly by continental European playwrights, on the London stage. Description The Society's performances, using professional actors, were given in theatres that were otherwise 'dark'  on Sundays, when no normal performances were scheduled. Because membership was by subscription, the performances were not \\"public\\", and so the Society was allowed to perform plays that had not received a licence from the Lord Chamberlain's Office; and in this way they were able to avoid the censorship of the London stage. During 1891, the Royalty Theatre fell vacant and offered the Society an opportunity to stage plays with a professional cast and crew.The Pitt Estate in Dean Street: The Royalty Theatre, Survey of London: volumes 33 and 34: St Anne Soho (1966), pp. 215-21, accessed 15 January 2009 The first performance for the Society there was of Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts, on 13 March 1891  in a translation by William Archer. This was followed by √âmile Zola's Th√©r√®se Raquin on 9 October 1891. Both plays were greeted with a storm of protest. Ghosts was described thus: \\"an orderly audience, including many ladies... listened attentively to the dramatic exposition of a subject which is not usually discussed outside the walls of an hospital\\". Other critics called for the withdrawal of Kate Santley's licence. The following year, Grein approached the (then) young theatre critic George Bernard Shaw for a play for the Society. Shaw's first play, Widowers' Houses, premi√®red for the Society at the Royalty Theatre on 9 December 1892. A Question of Memory by Michael Field premi√®red on 27 October 1893;The Journals, 1868-1914, and Correspondence of Katharine Bradley and Edith Cooper from the British Library, London accessed 16 January 2009 and The Black Cat by Irish playwright, John Todhunter received its only performance, on 8 December 1893, at the Opera Comique. The Society premi√®red Ibsen's The Wild Duck (in translation) in 1894. In 1895, Grein invited Aur√©lien Lugn√©-Poe to present a season of productions in French, of Ibsen's Rosmersholm, The Master Builder and Maurice Maeterlinck's symbolist L'Intruse and Pell√©as and M√©lisande.Styan, J. Modern Drama in Theory and Practice: Realism and Naturalism pp. 55-57 (Cambridge University Press, 1981) Membership of the Society never exceeded 175, but it was influential, including George Meredith, Arthur Wing Pinero, Thomas Hardy and Henry James, amongst the members.Theatreland Timeline (London Metropolitan Archives) accessed 15 January 2009 In 1895, Shaw wrote (of the Society) \\"The Independent Theatre is an excellent institution, simply because it is independent. The disparagers ask what it is independent of.... It is, of course, independent of commercial success.... If Mr Grein had not taken the dramatic critics of London and put them in a row before Ghosts and The Wild Duck, with a small but inquisitive and influential body of enthusiasts behind them, we should be far less advanced today than we are. The real history of the drama for the last ten years is not the history of the prosperous enterprises of Mr Hare, Mr Irving, and the established West-End theatres, but of the forlorn hopes led by Mr Vernon, Mr Charrington, Mr Grein, Messrs Henly and Stevenson, Miss Achurch, Miss Robins and Miss Lea, Miss Farr and the rest of the Impossibilities.\\"The Saturday Review Ixxix, 26 January 1895, pp. 126 He went on to urge that the London managers \\"might provide one marketable play each year\\", so that the Society could continue as a laboratory for experimental theatre. As a result of its small subscription base and its high ambitions, the Society was not financially successful and was wound up in 1897, having presented 22 productions and premi√®res of an additional 26 one- act programmes. The Incorporated Stage Society took over the work two years later and was itself the inspiration for the formation of the Abbey Theatre in Dublin and the English Stage Company, which is today the resident company of the Royal Court Theatre. Grein continued his interest in European theatre, founding the German Theatre in London Programme in 1900 with his future wife, the actress, Alice Augusta Greeven.

However, to do this he first needed to appoint a patriarch. His choice fell on the abbot of the monastery of Oxeia, Michael Kourkouas. The coronation did not take place until 28 November 1143, because Michael threatened to resign for unknown reasons. During his reign Michael had to deal with the highly political trial of a monk called Niphon. On 22 February 1144 Michael condemned Niphon for supporting two Cappadocian bishops who were accused of heresy and later found guilty of Bogomil practices. This forbade orthodox believers from associating with him. Michael II resigned in March 1146 to return to the monastery of Oxeia, most likely because of disillusion with the emperor.

The team's home venue is Cicerone Field at Anteater Ballpark located on campus in Irvine, California. UC Irvine baseball has been a member of the NCAA Division I Big West Conference since the start of the 2002 season which was the Anteaters' first season of play following the university's decision to revive its baseball program after the sport had been dropped following the 1992 season. The Anteaters won the College Division national championship in 1973 and the Division II national championship in 1974. Since moving to Division I play they have appeared in the NCAA Tournament eight times and the College World Series twice. History =College Division/Division II= The program was founded prior to the 1970 season and initially played as an independent school in the NCAA College Division, made up of small-school athletic programs. Under head coach Gary Adams, the team qualified for the College Division Tournament in 1970, 1971, and 1972. In 1973, the team ended the regular season with a twelve-game winning streak and again qualified for the tournament. After advancing to the College Division Championship, it defeated Missouri-St. Louis, Eastern Illinois, and Ithaca twice to win a national championship. In August 1973, the NCAA reorganized its divisions. Prior to then, the NCAA had competed in two divisions, a large-school University Division and a small- school College Division. Following the reorganization, the University Division became Division I, while the College Division split into Division II and Division III. UC Irvine, formerly an independent in the College Division, became a Division II Independent. In the first season of Division II, the team again won its regional tournament to advance to the Division II Championship. There, the program defeated New Orleans to win its second consecutive national championship. Following the 1974 season, Gary Adams left UC Irvine to become the head coach at UCLA. UC Irvine continued to play in Division II until following the 1977 season, though it did not qualify for another NCAA Tournament. =Transition to Division I= Prior to the 1978 season, the program joined the newly formed Division I Southern California Baseball Association (SCBA). Former Gonzaga head coach Steve Hertz became the program's head coach prior to the 1979 season, in which the team finished 7th in the SCBA. In 1980, UC Irvine finished second behind Cal State Fullerton, its best season in the SCBA. When Steve Hertz returned to Gonzaga following the 1980 season, Mike Gerakos became the program's head coach. The team continued to play in the SCBA, though it finished no higher than third until the conference disbanded following the 1984 season. UC Irvine then became members of the Pacific Coast Athletic Association, which was renamed the Big West Conference prior to the 1987 season. UC Irvine had a winning conference record only twice in eight PCAA/Big West seasons through the end of the 1992 season. Following the 1992 season, state budget cuts caused the university to cut several sports programs, including baseball. At the time it was discontinued, the program had a 643-565-17 record. =Program revival= In 2000, the university announced plans to revive the varsity baseball program and build a multimillion-dollar on-campus venue for the program. Following the 2000 college baseball season, the school hired USC assistant John Savage as the program's new head coach. The team began play in 2002. Its first game, also the opening of the newly built Anteater Ballpark, was an 8-5 loss to San Diego on January 25, 2002. In 2004, the team qualified for the NCAA Tournament, its first in Division I. In the South Bend Regional, the team lost consecutive games to Arizona and Notre Dame and was eliminated. Following the 2004 season, John Savage left the program to become the head coach at UCLA. UC Irvine hired Cal State Fullerton assistant coach Dave Serrano to replace him. In 2006, Serrano's second season, the team qualified for the NCAA Tournament. In 2007, the team again qualified for the tournament. After defeating Texas in the Round Rock Regional finals, the Anteaters defeated Wichita State in the Super Regionals to advance to the 2007 College World Series. At the World Series, the team went 2-2 and was eliminated by eventual national champion Oregon State. Following the 2007 season, Dave Serrano returned to Cal State Fullerton to become the team's head coach. He was replaced by former USC head coach Mike Gillespie. The team qualified for the NCAA Tournament in each of Gillespie's first four seasons (2008-2011). In 2008, the team was eliminated by LSU in the Super Regional round. In the team's 2009 season, the Anteaters won the Big West Championship with a 22-2 conference record and qualified for the NCAA Tournament as the #6 National Seed. It hosted an NCAA Regional at Anteater Ballpark, but was eliminated in the Regional by Virginia. Following the 2009 season, Anteater Ballpark was renamed Cicerone Field at Anteater Ballpark for former UC Irvine chancellor Ralph J. Cicerone. In 2010, the team qualified for the NCAA Tournament but was eliminated in the regional round. In 2011, the team won the Los Angeles Regional to advance to its second super regional under Gillespie. In the super regional, the Anteaters lost to Virginia 2 games to 1. =Conference affiliations= * Independent (College Division) (1970‚Äì1973) * Independent (Division II) (1974‚Äì1977) * Southern California Baseball Association (1978‚Äì1984) * Big West Conference (1985‚Äì1992, 2002‚Äìpresent)  Known as the Pacific Coast Athletic Association from 1985‚Äì1986 Venues =Cicerone Field at Anteater Ballpark= Cicerone Field at Anteater Ballpark has been the program's home venue since it opened in 2002, also the year in which UC Irvine sponsored varsity baseball for the first season since 1992.

Microbial toxins promote infection and disease by directly damaging host tissues and by disabling the immune system. Some bacterial toxins, such as Botulinum neurotoxins, are the most potent natural toxins known. However, microbial toxins also have important uses in medical science and research. Currently, new methods of detecting bacterial toxins are being developed to better isolate and understand these toxins. Potential applications of toxin research include combating microbial virulence, the development of novel anticancer drugs and other medicines, and the use of toxins as tools in neurobiology and cellular biology. Bacterial toxin Bacteria generate toxins which can be classified as either exotoxins or endotoxins. Exotoxins are generated and actively secreted; endotoxins remain part of the bacteria. Usually, an endotoxin is part of the bacterial outer membrane, and it is not released until the bacterium is killed by the immune system. The body's response to an endotoxin can involve severe inflammation. In general, the inflammation process is usually considered beneficial to the infected host, but if the reaction is severe enough, it can lead to sepsis. Some bacterial toxins can be used in the treatment of tumors. Toxinosis is pathogenesis caused by the bacterial toxin alone, not necessarily involving bacterial infection (e.g. when the bacteria have died, but have already produced toxin, which are ingested). It can be caused by Staphylococcus aureus toxins, for example.  Detection methods in fresh water environments  Cyanobacteria are an important autotrophic bacteria in the water food web. Explosions of cyanobacteria known as algal blooms can produce toxins harmful to both the ecosystem and human health. Detection of the extent of an algal bloom begins by taking samples of water at various depths and locations in the bloom. = Solid-phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) = SPATT is a useful tool in tracking algal blooms as it is reliable, sensitive, and inexpensive. One of the downsides is that it does not give very good results for water soluble toxins as compared to hydrophobic compounds. This tool is mainly used to determine intercellular concentrations of toxins but the cyanobacteria can also be lysed to determine the total toxin amount in a sample. = Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) = PCR is a molecular tool that allows for analysis of genetic information. PCR is used to amplify the amount of certain DNA within a sample which are usually specific genes within a sample. Genetic targets for cyanobacteria in PCR include the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, phycocyanin operon, internal transcribed spacer region, and the RNA polymerase Œ≤ subunit gene. PCR is effective when the gene of a known enzyme for producing the microbial toxin or the microbial toxin itself is known. = Enzyme inhibition = There are many diverse ways of monitoring enzyme levels through the use of enzyme inhibition. The general principle in many of these is the use the knowledge that many enzymes are driven by phosphate-releasing compounds such as adenosine triphosphate. Using radiolabelled 32P phosphate a fluorometric analysis can be used. Or unique polymers can be used to immobilize enzymes and act in an electrochemical biosensor. Overall, the benefits include a fast response time and little sample preparation. Some of the downsides include a lack of specificity in terms of being able to get readings of very small amounts of toxin and the rigidity of the assays in apply certain procedures to different toxins. = Immunochemical methods = This detection method uses mammalian antibodies to bind to microbial toxins which can then be processed in a variety of different ways. Of the commercial ways of using immunochemical detection would be enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). This assay has the advantage of being able to screen for a broad range of toxins but could have issues with specificity depending on the antibody used. A more exotic setup involves the use of CdS quantum dots which are used in an electro- chemiluminescent immunosensor. A major aspect of immunochemical methods being tested in laboratories are uses of nanowires and other nanomaterials to detect microbial toxins.  Clostridial toxins  There are over 200 Clostridium species in the world that live in mundane places such as soil, water, dust, and even our digestive tracks. Some of these species produce harmful toxins such as botulinum toxin and tetanus toxin among others. Most clostridium species that do have toxins typically have binary toxins with the first unit involved in getting the toxin into the cell and the second unit cause cellular stress or deformation. =Botulinum neurotoxin= Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the causative agents of the deadly food poisoning disease botulism, and could pose a major biological warfare threat due to their extreme toxicity and ease of production. They also serve as powerful tools to treat an ever expanding list of medical conditions. =Tetanus toxin= Clostridium tetani produces tetanus toxin (TeNT protein), which leads to a fatal condition known as tetanus in many vertebrates (including humans) and invertebrates.  Tetrodotoxins  These toxins are produced by vibrio species of bacteria and like to accumulate in marine life such as the pufferfish. These toxins are produced when vibrio bacteria are stressed by changes in temperature and salinity of environment which leads towards production of toxins. The main hazard towards humans is during consumption of contaminated seafood. Tetrodotoxin poisoning is becoming common in more northern and typically colder marine waters as higher precipitation and warmer waters from climate change triggers vibrio bacteria to produce toxins. Staphylococcal toxins Immune evasion proteins from Staphylococcus aureus have a significant conservation of protein structures and a range of activities that are all directed at the two key elements of host immunity, complement and neutrophils. These secreted virulence factors assist the bacterium in surviving immune response mechanisms. Viral toxin There is only one viral toxin that has been described so far: NSP4 from rotavirus. It inhibits the microtubule- mediated secretory pathway and alters cytoskeleton organization in polarized epithelial cells. It has been identified as the viral enterotoxin based on the observation that the protein caused diarrhea when administered intraperitoneally or intra-ileally in infant mice in an age-dependent manner. NSP4 can induce aqueous secretion in the gastrointestinal tract of neonatal mice through activation of an age- and Ca2+-dependent plasma membrane anion permeability.

It could take off and land from a runway like a manned aircraft, and operate at high altitudes for up to 24 hours to perform surveillance, communications relay, or atmospheric sampling. Design and development \\"Compass Cope\\" was a program initiated by the United States Air Force (USAF) in 1971 to develop an upgraded reconnaissance drone that could take off and land from a runway like a manned aircraft, and operate at high altitudes for up to 24 hours to perform surveillance, communications relay, or atmospheric sampling. Two aircraft, the Boeing YQM-94 Compass Cope B, and the Ryan Aeronautical YQM-98A Compass Cope R participated in the program. Boeing was originally selected as a sole source for the Compass Cope program, with the USAF awarding the company a contract for two YQM-94A (later YGQM-94A) demonstrator vehicles in 1971. However, Ryan then pitched an alternative, and the next year the USAF awarded Ryan a contract for two YQM-98A (later YGQM-98A) demonstrators as well. Ryan's entry into the competition was the Model 235, an updated variant of the Model 154 / AQM-91 Firefly. The YQM-98A's general configuration was similar to that of the Boeing Compass Cope B, resembling a jet sailplane with a twin-fin tail, retractable tricycle landing gear, and an engine in a pod on its back. The engine was a Garrett YF104-GA-100 turbofan, with 4,050 pound-force (18.0 kN) thrust. The Compass Cope R had a clear resemblance to the Model 154, though its wings were straight instead of swept. Initial flight of the first Compass Cope R demonstrator was on 17 August 1974.Taylor 1976, p. 637. However, the Boeing Compass Cope B won the competition in August 1976 on the basis of lower cost, with the company awarded a contract to build preproduction prototypes of the YQM-94B operational UAV. Since the evaluation of the Compass Cope prototypes had shown the Ryan YQM-98 to be superior to the Boeing YQM-94 in some respects, Ryan challenged the award. It did no good, since the entire Compass Cope program was cancelled in July 1977, apparently because of difficulties in developing sensor payloads for the aircraft.

QLF's mission is twofold: to support the rural communities and environment of eastern Canada and New England, and to create models for stewardship and cultural heritage that can be applied worldwide. Quebec-Labrador Foundation Headquartered in Ipswich, Massachusetts, QLF has an office in Montreal, Quebec, and seven Field Desks throughout New England and into Atlantic Canada (Newfoundland and Labrador, and the Quebec North Shore). The root of all of QLF‚Äôs programs, which began in the early 60s and continues through to today, is a belief in investing in the potential of each individual, and a belief that larger programs need to be identified and supported by the communities themselves.  History  Founded in 1961 by the Reverend Robert (Bob) Bryan,'Bert and I' album retains relevance after 50 years - The Boston Globe QLF was originally established as the Quebec-Labrador Foundation Mission, which in 1969 became the Quebec-Labrador Foundation or simply QLF. Travelling by float plane, Bob visited the small \\"outport\\" communities of eastern Canada, bringing friendship, his talents as a clergyman, and the idea that the children in these communities should benefit from a new generation of community services, focused on leadership, education in the arts, marine and aviation skills, and creative thinking. Following in the tradition of Sir Wilfred Grenfell (Grenfell Mission), Bob led hundreds of high school and college students to the communities of the Quebec-Labrador Region to provide leadership in developing education and recreation for young people. He also developed scholarship funds, which continue to provide assistance for young people in eastern Canada. In 1975, QLF expanded from community service programs to the realm of environmental education. Founding the Living Rivers Program in Tabusintac, New Brunswick, QLF established what would become one of QLF's hallmarks: cross border, community-based conservation and stewardship programs aimed at both young people and established conservation professionals. In the early 1980s, QLF expanded its programs internationally to Western Europe, Central and Southeast Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Through exchange programs, study tours and professional meetings, QLF offers conservation and cultural heritage organizations an opportunity to share knowledge and build partnerships across geographic boundaries, as well as across public, private, and non-profit/non- governmental sectors.

The film is an unofficial and uncredited adaptation of the 1954 novel I Am Legend by Richard Matheson, the title being a reference to the 1971 film adaptation The Omega Man. The movie was intentionally released as a \\"mockbuster\\" to capitalize on the release of the theatrical film I Am Legend of the same year.I Am Legend by Todd McCarthy, Variety, Dec. 7, 2007. Plot The film takes place in a post- apocalyptic Los Angeles, which is overrun by zombie-like, cannibalistic humans who have degenerated into a feral subspecies as the result of a genetic infection. The film does not make clear if the virus has infected the entire world, or just a small, isolated area, but it is suggested that it is global by the inability of the hero, Renchard (Mark Dacascos), to locate radio signals or contact anyone via the Internet. Renchard has been forced to live in a daily struggle for survival against the mutants. One day, Renchard is contacted via webcam by Brianna (Jennifer Lee Wiggins), another survivor who was stranded in L.A. while trying to find Antioch, a community of survivors. She asks Renchard to help her, but Renchard, who has placed time bombs at strategic points around the city, refuses. Two men (the film's screenwriter Geoff Meed and Ryan Lloyd) claiming to be from Antioch arrive at his home seeking his aid. Although initially unpersuaded by their argument that Brianna carries the cure to the virus in her blood, Renchard is forced to cooperate under gunpoint. With 24 hours before the bombs are set to detonate, he leads the men into the city. They must find and free Brianna before the mutants or the bombs can destroy them. After Renchard and Brianna flee the city and Mike (Ryan Lloyd) is killed in the sewers, Vincent (Geoff Meed) shoots Renchard and captures Brianna. He tells Renchard he did it because he liked the world the way it was and leaves him to die. After Renchard recovers his strength, he hotwires a car and chases after Vincent to save Brianna. After finding them, Renchard kills Vincent, who was attempting to rape and kill Brianna. The bombs explode, and they both head to Antioch to make a cure. However, it is revealed that a single zombie has survived the explosion. Critical response This low-budget, direct-to-video film was hurried into production and released a month prior to the big budget Will Smith film I Am Legend in an attempt to cash in on the similar-sounding titles and plots.Movie 'Mockbusters' Put Snakes on Trains, Weekend Edition Saturday, National Public Radio, December 8, 2007.\\"And if You Can't Catch 'Cloverfield'...\\" by Grady Hendrix, The New York Sun, January 18, 2008.

Critics had few good things to say about the film. Matt Bradshaw said, \\"The film starts off with a modest amount of promise, but when the story veers away from the film it's aping things quickly go down hill.\\"\\"Killer B's on DVD: I Am Omega\\" by Matt Bradshaw, Cinematical, Dec. 17, 2007.

Admittedly this includes fare such as Snakes on a Train, Transmorphers and Super Croc, all surely among the worst films ever made, but for a little while at least I Am Omega was more than just a 'good flick for Asylum standards' but just a plain old decent flick.

This money is intended to disappear from any record in the country of origin, and earnings on the stock of illicit financial flows outside a country generally do not return to the country of origin. Illicit financial flows can be generated in a variety of ways that are not revealed in national accounts or balance of payments figures, including trade mispricing, bulk cash movements, hawala transactions, and smuggling.CSIS and GFI Conference: Illicit Financial Flows: The Missing Link in Development; Panel 1 ‚Äî What is Known About Illicit Financial Flows (.m3u format) Although illicit financial flows are closely related to capital flight, they differ in one major respect; capital flight is an expression that places virtually the whole of the problem upon the developing countries out of which the money comes. It suggests, without quite saying so, that it is almost entirely their responsibility to address and resolve the concern. The expression illicit financial flows does a better job of clarifying that this phenomenon is a two-way street. There are several economic models used to provide estimates of illicit financial flows and capital flight. The two most common methods are the World Bank Residual Model and the DOTS-based Trade Mispricing Model, which uses the IMF's Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS) database to analyze discrepancies in trade statistics between partner countries. Another way to estimate trade mispricing is with the IPPS-based model, which was developed by John Zdanowicz of Florida International University. This method uses individual import and export transactions of the United States with the rest of the world to find inconsistencies in export and import prices. Economists also use hot money (Narrow) Method and the Dooley Method in these estimates. A 2013 paper, authorized by Raymond W. Baker, Director of the Global Financial Integrity estimated illicit financial flows \\"out of developing countries are approximately $1 trillion a year\\". This study also found that China, Russia, and Mexico accounted for the three largest shares of worldwide illicit financial flows.\\"Illicit Financial Flows From Developing Countries: 2002-2011\\", Dev Kar and Brian LeBlanc, 2011. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 has a target to significantly reduce illicit financial flows and strengthen recovery and return of stolen assets by 2030.  Pakistan  In Pakistan estimates of illicit financial flows put over $10 billion as escaping taxation and being siphoned off outside the country. This is with nearly one third of the population living below the poverty line.  Swaziland  Swaziland lost approximately $556 million to illicit financial flows in 2012 and a record of $1.139 billion in 2007.

History Charterhouse Bank was incorporated as an investment bank in December 1920. In 1963 Charterhouse Bank merged with S. Japhet and Company, a rival investment bank established by Saemy Japhet (1858‚Äì1954), to form Charterhouse Japhet. A US-based arm, Charterhouse Group, was formed in 1973, but became independent of its parent in the 1980s. In 1981 Charterhouse Japhet acquired Keyser Ullman, a substantial but failing rival. In November 1983, Jacob Rothschild merged his own investment business, RIT & Northern, into Charterhouse Japhet and took a controlling stake in the combined business which was briefly known as Charterhouse J. Rothschild. Rothschild then sold the banking business, still known as Charterhouse Japhet, to the Royal Bank of Scotland in January 1985. From 1985 to 1996 Sir Victor Blank held the posts of Chairman and Chief Executive of the banking business, which reverted to its original name, Charterhouse Bank. Royal Bank of Scotland sold 90% of Charterhouse Bank (retaining 10%) to two continental banks, Cr√©dit Commercial de France and Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank in February 1993. Cr√©dit Commercial de France acquired Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank in the late 1990s, so consolidating its investment in Charterhouse Bank, but was itself taken over by HSBC in 2000.

He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1750, was awarded an exhibitionship in 1752, and took his Master of Arts degree in 1753. Nowell was made a fellow of Oriel in 1753 and served as junior treasurer to college between 1755 and 1757, senior treasurer between 1757 and 1758, and Dean between 1758 and 1760 and again in 1763. In 1759 Benjamin Buckler preached a flippant sermon at All Souls College, Oxford, titled Elisha's Visit to Gilgal, and his Healing the Pot of Pottage, Symbolically Explain'd. In 1760 Nowell wrote an anonymous rebuttal titled A Dissertation upon that Species of Writing called Humour, when Applied to Sacred Subjects, which argued that biblical topics deserved to be treated with ‚Äòdecency and seriousness‚Äô instead of humour and levity. Between 1760 and 1776, Nowell was Public Orator of Oxford University. Oriel nominated Nowell for the post of Junior Proctor to the University in 1761, and Nowell spent many years as Secretary to the Chancellor of the University.

Chaired by John Terry, the managing director of the National Film Finance Corporation (NFFC), it reported in January 1976,The Future of the British Film Industry (Cmnd 6372), Report of the Prime Minister's Working Party principally recommending the establishment of a British Film Authority to bring together the NFFC, British Film Fund Agency and the film activities of the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Trade. However, before action could be taken, Wilson resigned as prime minister. His successor, James Callaghan appointed an Interim Action Committee on the Film Industry (IAC), with Wilson as chairman, with a view to paving the way for a British Film Authority. The committee met under the auspices of the Department of Trade and Industry, which provided the secretariat and facilities. Following the election of the Thatcher government in 1979 it became evident that the idea of a British Film Authority was being dropped, although the IAC was retained as a forum for advice about film- related matters.

Franjo Markoviƒá (or Franjo pl. Markoviƒá; July 26, 1845 in Kri≈æevci ‚Äì September 15, 1914 in Zagreb) was a Croatian philosopher and writer. He was an academician, the first professor of philosophy at the renovated University of Zagreb in 1874. The defender of the identity of philosophy as a metaphysical discipline, as opposed to scholasticism on one side, and positivism and materialism on the other side. His greatest philosophical work is the Razvoj i sustav obƒáenite estetike (\\"The development and the system of general aesthetics\\"), which heavily influenced the development of Croatian philosophical thought due to its extensive and all-encompassing overview of the history of aesthetics in Croatian language, and the introduction of new philosophic terms. He is the founder of the research of Croatian philosophic heritage. As a writer, he is noted for his lyric-reflexive poetry, epic compositions and dramas. He is a characteristic Romanticist (\\"national-romantic spirit\\"), and in the poetry he is noted as an ardent follower of Adam Mickiewicz. Biography A portrait of Franjo Markoviƒá by unknown artist at the council chambers of the University of Zagreb. Born in a noble family, by father Antun and mother Josipa (b. ≈†ugh). He attended the gymnasium at the Nobility Boarding School in Zagreb. In 1862 he left for a study of classical philology and Slavic studies in Vienna. He graduated in 1865, and the next year he passed his gymnasium professorship exam. He worked as an assistant, and soon became a full professor at gymnasiums in Osijek and Zagreb. In 1870, after one political protest, he left his service and headed for Vienna to study philosophy, and soon to Dresden, Leipzig, Berlin and Paris, receiving his Ph.D. in philosophy in 1872. In 1874 he was appointed as the first head of the independent department for philosophy in Zagreb and the dean of the Faculty of Philosophy. That year the renovated University of Zagreb was founded, and within it the Faculty of philosophy (then called Mudroslovni fakultet), and on it the Department for Philosophy (Stolica za mudroslovje teoretiƒçno i praktiƒçno sa povjestnicom). He served as a rector of the University in the academic year 1881/1882. He continued to teach until his retirement in 1909. He served as the editor-in- chief of Vijenac in the period 1872‚Äì1873. He was also a member of Matica hrvatska from 1875, and a full member of JAZU from 1876. He served as a representative of the Kri≈æevci county in the Parliament of Croatia and Slavonia in the last two decades of the 19th century (at the period of ban Dragutin K√°roly Khuen-H√©derv√°ry). As a member of a mild opposition, he operated by his own principle, insisting on ethical principles in politics. As a \\"typical representative of Croatian minor nobility\\" he defends Croatian interests against Hungarian imperialistic pretensions, advocates constitutional protection, political freedom and \\"spiritual prospect and material development\\" of the common people. Teaching of philosophy Markoviƒá held lectures on all philosophic disciplines (logic, psychology, physics, metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, epistemology, pedagogy and the history of philosophy). At that period the concept of \\"philosophy\\" encompassed also history, geography, linguistics, anthropology, pedagogy, natural sciences and mathematics, which were taught by other professors. In his teaching of philosophy he adhered to the system developed by Johann Friedrich Herbart, which at the period (after the revolutionary 1848, which was much contributed to by young Hegelianists, so the authorities were intent to suppress Hegel's and Kant's influence) was generally accepted in Germany and Austria‚ÄìHungary. His system had pedagogic qualities for the development of consistence and strictness in conceptual thought and was hence fit to be \\"propedeutics of philosophical spirit at us\\". Albert Bazala, which inherited in 1909 Markoviƒá's department, abandons Herbart's system). He monitored all current spiritual movements, read German, French, English and other authors, and made his students known with their works, even if they were not sanctioned by him. As the first professor of philosophy with a systematic teaching record, translating and writing in vernacular language (and not Latin or German), Markoviƒá made a substantial impact on the development of Croatian philosophical terminology. In 1880 he promoted ƒêuro Arnold as the first Ph.D. in philosophy, who finally joined him in 1894 as a full professor. Arnold has, along with the philosophical teachings, lead the department of pedagogy. In 1904 he habilitated Albert Bazala as a private docent of philosophy. Philosophical orientation Markoviƒá, the first Croatian professor of philosophy that was not a priest, cherished self-consciousness of philosophy as opposed to the scholastic tradition and neo-scholasticism, which was promoted at that time in vernacular writings by the professors of the Faculty of Theology and other theologians. On the other side, defending the metaphysics he was confronted with materialism and positivism, which reached Croatia at that period, and where he is followed by his disciple Albert Bazala. \\"Nothing valuable is produced by human labour without the vigorous, logical, aesthetic and ethic tendency, i.e. without philosophic tendency.\\"Cited after , \\"i≈°ta vriedna ne nastaje ljudskim radom bez ≈æive logiƒçne, estetiƒçne i etiƒçne te≈ænje t.j. bez filosofijske te≈ænje.\\" =Herbart's school= In his lectures and writings he continued the metaphysical tradition of European school of thought, following essentially Herbart's formalism, which provides a compromise between the exactness of natural sciences and the metaphysical speculation, with an emphasis on the strictness of conceptual thought. He emphasized psychology as a starting point of philosophy (psychologism): \\"Her [of a philosophy] infinite, ultimately never reachable goal is a prudential system of cogitations and within it organised sentiments and aspirations.\\"Cited after , \\"Njezin nedogledni, potpuno nikad nedosti≈æni cilj promi≈°ljen je sustav misli i u njemu onda sreƒëenih ƒçuvstava i te≈ænj√¢.\\" Herbart's school, as hence the Markoviƒá himself, insist on maintaining diversity and irreducibility of psychic and material nature, especially contradicting materialist reducibility of former to the latter. He deems that \\"rational psychology and cosmology bear witness in favor of spiritism\\", i.e. against materialism: the matter is not sentient and free, and thus not subject to the law of causativity, so man's consciousness and freedom cannot possibly be a result of matter, but of higher and perfected being, i.e. the spirit., =Aesthetics= The cover pages of the Razvoj i sustav obƒáenite estetike ('The development and the system of general aesthetics'; Zagreb, 1903), and the Dom i svijet ('The home and the world'; Zagreb, 1923). Aesthetically he's a formalist: aesthetic is only the form, not the content; this is where his scholarly personality suppressed his artistic predilections. The art must provide aesthetic pleasure; it should aspire to panhuman ideal, rise above the reality to the value. Therefore, Markoviƒá is not particularly supportive of naturalism and realism: naturalism simply depicts abject and vicious sides of life. The object of art must be beauteous not only by its form, but also venerable by its content. Illustrious artists are \\"folk teachers, the creators of life\\". =Ethics= In ethical issues he mostly diverged from formalistic confines of Herbart's school, taking interest into positivist and sociological currents and expressing his own, intensive ethical sentiment. He denounced naturalism, materialism and Darwin's theory of evolution, which lead to the \\"bankruptcy of ethics\\", giving prominence to either egoism, or \\"benefit to society, as understood by the public\\". Albert Bazala criticizes narrow-minded ethical principles of his teacher quite voluminously, and so does Gjuro Arnold. =Critical spirit and rising of the people= Markoviƒá applied Herbart's glorification of philosophy as a bellwether of culture to Croatian circumstances. He emphasizes the significance of industrious labor on the cognition and cultivation of critical spirit. Philosophy has a long-term educational task of rising people to the fulfillment of its potential. Philosophy is the \\"sentient cultural spirit\\", which metamorphosises and sets path towards prosperity of the nation and its \\"life style\\" in general. It creates \\"spiritual homeland\\", the \\"homeland of thoughts\\", which is the defender of material homeland. By learning from other nations, one has to develop distinctiveness and peculiarities at a path to the cognition of the ideal of truth, goodness and beauty. That is a duty not only to the people, but to the human kind itself: philosophy already brings individuals closer, and given enough time it shall unite even the nations. Literary work Markoviƒá published a series of literary works, most important of which are the epics and the dramas in national-romanticist tradition. As opposed to the formalistic and racionalist conception of philosophy, \\"Markoviƒá his personal aspect, his sentimentalism and desireful ponderings ensconces under the veil of poetry.\\" Mostly dealing with the historical motifs, Markoviƒá engaged in the ongoing battle for the affirmation of Croatdom against Hungarian and German domination. Idyllic epic Dom i svijet ('The home and the world') elaborates on contemporary themes. Epic Kohan i Vlasta ('Kohan and Vlasta') portrays a battle of old Slavs and Germans on the Baltic. The tragedy Karlo Draƒçki depicts man's suffering in the struggle for panhuman ideal of freedom against the Rome and Magyar feudal lords. The tragedies Benk bot and Zvonimir display vices and rapacity of Hungarian landlords and court. Markoviƒá also wrote poems, literary critics and studies. He composed lyrics for quire version of the song U boj! from the opera Nikola ≈†ubiƒá Zrinski. Philosophic works Occupied by lecturing and literary work he published few pieces in philosophy. He published the book Razvoj i sustav obƒáenite estetike (1903). His major books and general works published during his lifetime include: *Estetiƒçka ocjena Gunduliƒáeva \\"Osmana\\", Zagreb, 1877. *O piscih filozofijske struke a hrvatskoga roda, \\"Vienac\\", 44/1881.

It is grounded in African culture and Afrocentrism and focuses on the experiences, struggles, needs, and desires of Africana women of the African diaspora. It distinguishes itself from feminism, or Alice Walker's womanism. Africana womanism pays more attention to and focuses more on the realities and the injustices in society in regard to race. Hudson-Weems sought to create an ideology specific to African women and women of African descent. Hudson-Weems believes that the creation of the ideology separates African women's accomplishments from African male scholars, feminism, and black feminism. The Africana Womanism Society lists 18 characteristics of the Africana womanist, including self-naming, self-defining, family-centered, flexible and desiring positive male companionship.Hudson-Weems, pp. 57‚Äì58, 61, 66, 68‚Äì72. Development Clenora Hudson-Weems, Professor of English, University of Missouri, author of Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves, coined the concept Africana Womanism in the late 1980s (Africana is the feminine form of the Latin Africanus, meaning Of Africa, and appears to be preferred by the movement over African). Hudson-Weems argues that \\"Africana Womanism is not an addendum to feminism, Black feminism, African feminism or Alice Walker's womanism\\" Feminism and gender issues are separate entities that are not reliant upon each other, and therefore, Africana women are able to address gender issues without partaking in feminist activity. According to Patricia Hill Collins, \\"Although some Africana women may support the very ideas on which feminism rests, however, many of them reject the term \\"feminism\\" because of what they perceive as its association with white women's cause. They see feminism as operating exclusively within the terms white and American and perceive its opposite as being Black and American.\\" Further, many African men and women do not accept the ideology of feminism. According to Hudson-Weems, she states that \\"there is a general consensus in the Africana community that the feminist movement, by and large, is the White woman's movement for two reason. First, the Africana woman does not see the man as her primary enemy as does the White feminist, who is carrying out an age-old battle with her White male counterpart for subjugating her as his property. Africana men have never had the same institutionalized power to oppress Africana women as White men have had to oppress White women.\\"Hudson-Weems, p. 25. Africana Womanism contrast a racist and sexist feminist/womanist ideology and many Africana women (and men) have come to embrace it. Hudson-Weems (1998), Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves, explains the development of Africana Womanism: > Africana Womanism is a term I coined and defined in 1987 after nearly two > years of publicly debating the importance of self-naming for Africana women. > Why the term 'Africana Womanism'? Upon concluding that the term 'Black > Womanism' was not quite the terminology to include the total meaning desired > for this concept, I decided that 'Africana Womanism,' a natural evolution in > naming, was the ideal terminology for two basic reasons. The first part of > the coinage, Africana, identifies the ethnicity of the woman being > considered, and this reference to her ethnicity, establishing her cultural > identity, relates directly to her ancestry and land base‚ÄîAfrica. The second > part of the term Womanism, recalls Sojourner Truth's powerful impromptu > speech 'Ain't I a Woman?', one in which she battles with the dominant > alienating forces in her life as a struggling Africana Woman, questioning > the accepted idea of womanhood. Without question she is the flip side of the > coin, the co-partner in the struggle for her people, one who, unlike the > white woman, has received no special privileges in American society.Hudson- > Weems, pp. 22‚Äì23. Africana womanist ideology contributes to Afrocentric discourse. Africana womanism fundamental foundation is built on traditional Africana philosophy and values, and Afrocentric theories: Some of the traditional values forefront the role of African mothers as leaders in the struggle to regain, reconstruct, and create a cultural integrity that espouses the ancient Maatic principles of reciprocity, balance, harmony, justice, truth, righteousness, order, and so forth. Lastly, Nah Dove (1998), \\"African Womanism: An Afrocentric Theory\\", credits Hudson-Weems and other scholars in shaping the Africana womanist model. Dove asserts: > A concept [Africana Womanism] that has been shaped by the work of women such > as Clenora Hudson-Weems, Ifi Amadiume, Mary E. Modupe Kolawole, and others. > African womanism may be viewed as fundamental to the continuing development > of Afrocentric theory. Africana womanism brings to the forefront the role of > African mothers as leaders in the struggle to regain, reconstruct, and > create a cultural integrity that espouses the ancient Maatic principles of > reciprocity, balance, harmony, justice, truth, righteousness, order, and so > forth. (p. 535)  Eighteen key components  Africana Womanism Society lists 18 characteristics 18 key components that form Africana womanism. The characteristics are the following: Self-Naming, Self-Definition, Family- Centeredness, Wholeness, Role Flexibility, Adaptability, Authenticity, Black Female Sisterhood, Struggling with males against oppression, Male Compatibility, Recognition, Ambition, Nurturing, Strengthen, Respect, Respect for Elders, Mothering, Spirituality. Each of the characteristics listed above have a specific meanings that collectively establish a basis for Africana Womanism. The first principle Self-Naming discusses the importance of self- identifying as an African woman in society. The Africana identification is distinguishable from feminism and black variants. Self-naming is the period of recognizing the need for an Africana movement with its own name. The second principle defined, Self-Definition, begins to describe realities that African women face, through a Pan-African lens. The Pan-African movement attempts to create a sense of brotherhood among all people of African descent, regardless of whether or not they live on the continent of Africa. Self-definition explores gender inequalities and stereotypes in the modern patriarchy. Self- naming and self-definition are the first two couple of characteristics of Africana womanism. The term \\"nommo\\" is given to the idea of self-naming, which is important because in order for one to exist it has to be given a correct name. There is an increasing need for self-naming, self-defining, and self- identity for Black people and self-defining helps to discover one's identity through their own point of view of their world that goes against that of the dominant culture. The second groupings of characteristics are family- centeredness, wholeness, authenticity, role flexibility, adaptability, struggling with Black men against oppression, and Black female sisterhood. The second grouping of characteristics includes Family-Centeredness, Wholeness, Authenticity, Role Flexibility, Adaptability, In Concert With Men, and Genuine Sisterhood. The principle of family-centeredness focuses on the entire black family unit. The interest in the success of the black community as a whole maintains a sense of wholeness. Any important outcomes are shared as overarching closeness of the Black community is enforced by the women in society. The commitment to immediate and extended family is of crucial importance to African women, as it shapes the third principle outlined by Clenora Hudson-Weems. The principle of Wholeness describes the importance of self-sufficiency that an African woman must have in order to upkeep her household. Wholeness also stresses the required self-esteem that emanates from within an African woman who must be strong for not only herself, but for her family and community as a whole. Completeness, going hand in hand with Wholeness, is defined as the unbroken unity that an African woman is responsible for upholding inside the home and out. The first five components all emphasis the commitment to family that is of major importance to Black women. There is a high interest in success of the group and collective outcomes that maintains a sense of wholeness. Nikol Alexander-Floyd (2006) states that there is this balance of putting the family first, which would be wholeness, without neglecting the career of the women or as he states it here authenticity. Role flexibility and adaptability are also important parts of family-centeredness because of their roots in the history of Black women. The Role Flexibility principle acknowledges and discusses the fact that the Black woman has never been a subjugate. African women are active in the workforce, take part in leadership opportunities presented, and do not need to be domestic. In history, Black women have experienced flexible gender roles meaning that Black women not only had experience working outside of home along with men but all within the home. For adaptability, Black women not only adapted to different work environments but also to the lack of luxuries that were experienced by white women and feminists. Lastly, for struggling with Black men against oppression and Black female sisterhood, Africana womanist see that there is a fight against oppression that is being fought by Black men and see themselves fighting on the same team as Black men. Sisterhood in Africana womanism has to be genuine and is genuine through the fact that Black women go through the same experience of oppression and can therefore empathize with one another. Due to these conditions Black women were forced to undergo while under white domination, African women developed an extreme ability to be adaptable. Women were forced to sacrifice their own goods and desires for the sake of often, their safety. Black women were often forced to compromise their dignity, as well as their ambition. Lastly, there are In Concert With Men and Genuine Sisterhood. In concert with men is the African woman's push to develop strong relationships with like minded men in the struggle for overarching Black liberation and the eventually Black women's liberation. The concept of Genuine Sisterhood, which is one of the eighteen characteristics of Africana Womanism, is integral for the survival of women in a male-dominated society. As described by Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison, \\"In wielding the power that is deservedly yours, don't permit it to enslave your sisters\\". Morrison's insights refer to the frequency that women tear each other down, as she continues to describe that this behavior is especially common in the workplace. The foundation of female relationships is violated by the habitual behavior in that women treat each other with disrespect and cruelty. Sisterhood in Africana womanism has to be genuine and is genuine through the fact that Black women go through the same experience of oppression and can therefore empathize with one another. The third and last clustering of characteristics are strength, male compatibility, respect, recognition, respect for elders, ambition, mothering, nurturing, and spirituality. Historically, Black women were always had psychological and physical strengthen especially with what happened with slavery. Hudson-Weems says that Black men's and Black women's bond helps to maintain the race. Black woman are physically and mentally strong. This principle of Strength is often the one that is attacked by non-Africana oppressors because their goal is to force submission upon the powerful group that is Africana women. Hudson-Weems says that Black men's and Black women's bond helps to maintain the race. Therefore, the principle of male compatibility is based upon mutually beneficial relationships between a well-respected African woman and a supportive, like- minded, man. Respect and recognition go together that is necessary for a healthy respect for Africana womanists and it helps them relate to others. Respect and recognition also contributes to the self-love and admiration, and respect for elders or older members in the Black community. To dissect both principles a bit further, Respect refers to reverence an African woman has for herself, absent of the colonized standards. Determining one's worth, while ignoring politics, is a crucial to becoming a confident African woman. The pillar of Recognition refers to the acknowledgement of humanity, capability, and power of Black women. Recognition plays a large role in keeping communal peace and ensuring the Black women's effectiveness in the struggle for equality. The principles that outline the caring nature of the Africana womanist are defined below. Respect for Elders, is an extension of the historical African tradition of ancestral reverence. Ancestral reverence is the habitual act of caring for elders, and eventual ancestors, within a community or society. Once the elders become ancestors, they will be responsible for providing wisdom and guidance which is highly vauled. The Nurturer and Motherer are both described a call for all community members to play an active role in the rearing of the community and propaganda of the race through care. It is an African woman's duty to not only care and nourish her family, but to provide the care and nourishment for her race as a whole. By fostering and guiding fellow women, the Africana Movement is advanced. The initiative taken to further the public's appreciation and education about the Africana Movement exemplifies the principle of Ambition. The final principle is Spirituality, which stresses the importance of the reverence for traditional African spiritual systems. These spiritual systems call for a collection of the principles including Ancestral Reverence, Oneness with oneself, and with nature as well. Africana womanist are also very spiritual and believe in a higher power and their mothering and nurturing is tradition. = Other focuses and concerns = Hudson-Weems (2000) states that the rejection of white organizations is something that Africana women take part in. Africana women focus on things that help with the elimination of oppression, which is considered to be the most important thing in order for the Africana community to survive. Alongside the rejection of white organizations, Africana womanism puts priority on human dignity of Africana women, children, and men. It focuses on race as the main importance for Africana women. Racism is seen to be priority over sexism and sexism is seen to derive from racism, classism, and economic prejudices. Some problems of Africana women, according to Hudson-Weems, include \\"physical brutality, sexual harassment, and female subjugation in general perpetrated both within and outside the race\\" and has to be solved in Africana communities collectively. While many think of Africana womanism as being similar to that of Black feminism, African feminism, womanism, and feminism, there are clear distinctions in agenda for the forms of women empowerment. Values The Africana Womanist concept was best exemplified in Brenda Verner's (1994) article \\"The Power and Glory of Africana Womanism\\": > Africana Womanism in essence says: We love men. We like being women. We love > children. We like being mothers. We value life. We have faith in God and the > Bible. We want families and harmonious relationships. We are not at war with > our men seeking money, power and influence through confrontation. Our > history is unique. We are the inheritors of African-American women's > history, and as such we shall not redefine ourselves nor that history to > meet some politically correct image of a popular culture movement, which > demands the right to speak for and redefine the morals and mores of all > racial, cultural and ethnic groups. Nor shall we allow the history to be > \\"shanghied\\" to legitimatize the \\"global political agenda\\" of others. We > reject the status of victim. Indeed, we are victors, Sisters in Charge of > our own destiny. We are Africana culture-keepers: Our primary obligation is > to the progress of our cultural way of life through the stability of family > and the commitment to community. The practice of cultural womanism is not > limited to Africana women. Italian, Japanese, Hispanic, East Indian, Arab, > Jewish women, etc., all utilize this approach to decision-making, and know > the value of maintaining indigenous cultural autonomy. The rite of passing > generation-to-generation knowledge free from outside manipulation, coercion > or intimidation insures traditional integrity, which fosters a climate of > cultural security. Traditional cultures should not be obligated to bow to > redefinitions foisted upon them by elitist entities that gain their > authority via the drive of well-organized \\"media hype.\\"Brenda Verner (1994, > June), \\"The Power and Glory of Africana Womanism\\", Chicago Tribune > Newspaper, p. 8. Accessed December 2008, ProQuest. Male-womanist Africana men can embrace an Africana womanist approach. According to Tolagbe Ogunlege (1998), \\"Referring to a man as a male-womanist is not an anomaly or rarity, and bestowing gender-specific title on individuals of the opposite sex has been practiced by Africana peoples for millennia. For example, among the Yoruba, an exceptional woman who has made significant contributions to the educational, socioeconomic, and/or spiritual growth and development of her family and community is referred to as a man- woman or obinrin bi okunrin.\\" Ogunlege further explains that among the Lebou people of Senegal, a man who governs according to ancient customs is referred to as the \\"Mother of the Country\\".Tolagbe Ogunlege (1998), \\"Dr. Martin Robison Delany, 19th-Century Africana Womanists: Reflections on His Avant-Garde Politics Concerning Gender, Colorism, and Nation Building\\", p. 630, in the Journal of Black Studies, 28(5), pp. 628‚Äì649, and Diop, 1978, p. 35. In education The Africana Womanist concept was adopted by many faculty in higher education. According to Daphne W. Ntiri (2001), Associate Professor of Social Science, Wayne State University: \\"Since Clenora Hudson-Weems broke new ground with her 1993 book Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves, discourse on the place and agenda of Africana women in the women's movement reflects the text's influence. In only six years, this work is in the second printing of its third revised edition. It has been adopted by faculty in several higher education institutions in as far away places as Africa, Brazil, Japan, and the Caribbean Islands. Adoption at national universities includes Clark Atlanta University, California State University-Long Beach, Florida A&M;, Indiana State University, Northern Illinois University, San Francisco State University, Temple University, the University of Missouri, and the University of Utah to name a few\\" (p. 163). Examples in literature Drawing on the tenets of Africana Womanism, Clenora Hudson-Weems extends the theoretical framework to literary analysis. Such an analysis of Africana literature emphasizes the family, complementarity between men and women, and commitment to the survival and liberation of the community as a whole. In her text, Africana Womanist Literary Theory, Hudson-Weems explores select Africana novels in order to offer Africana womanist interpretations. Five Africana Womanist novels: Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were Watching God. Hudson- Weems states that the character Janie is a protagonists to name and define herself. Also, a protagonist of family-centeredness (pp. 81‚Äì82); Mariama Ba, a renowned Senegalese writer, So Long a Letter, Ba's attack on polygamous society that subjugates women, and her interests in the rights of Africana women are reflected in her novel. According to Hudson-Weems \\"the novel does not justify categorizing it as a feminist novel, which the author dedicates the book 'To all women and men of good will,' thereby demonstrating her natural inclination to include men as a very important part of women's lives\\" (Hudson-Weems, pp. 93‚Äì94); Paule Marshall, a prominent African-Caribbean writer, Praisesong for the Widow, which the character \\"Reena\\" bears the historical nuances of so-called shortcomings of the Africana woman in relationship with her male companion. Pauline, the narrator, advocates a solution to the deteriorating relationship between the Africana man and woman (Hudson-Weems, p. 105); Toni Morrison, Beloved. Hudson-Weems asserts that \\"From Morrison first novel, The Bluest Eye, to Sula, Song of Solomon, Tar Baby, and finally to her fifth novel, Beloved, the author develops the roles of the male and the female in this collective struggle\\" (p. 119); and Terry McMillan, Disappearing Acts. Hudson-Weems explains that the character Zora Banks is self-naming and self-defining, family-centered and compatible, flexible with her roles and ambitions, demanding of respect and strong, reverent of elders and authentic, and last but not least, nurturing and mothering (pp. 133‚Äì134). Africana Womanist literature also consists of Africana family dynamics, Africana women and men‚Äîtheir interrelationship, and experiences within their communities, and religion. For instance: Russell J. Rickford (2003) Betty Shabazz: Surviving Malcolm X: A Journey of Strength from Wife to Widow to Heroine; Ilyasah Shabazz (2002), Growing Up X: A Memoir by the Daughter of Malcolm X; Sonsyrea Tate (1997) Growing Up in the Nation of Islam; Yvonne S. Thornton, M.D. (1995), The Ditchdigger's Daughters: A Black Family's Astonishing Success Story; Alex Haley (1976) Roots: The Saga of an American Family; Coretta Scott King (1969), My Life with Martin Luther King, Jr. In addition to Regina Jennings (2001), Africana Womanism in The Black Panther Party: A Personal Story, published in the Western Journal of Black Studies. Jennings describes her experiences as a young woman who joined the Black Panther Party in Oakland, California, using the theory of Africana Womanism. Notes References * Hudson-Weems, C. (2008).

It also supports certain binary files, and auto-parallelizing compilers by generating source code annotated with OpenMP directives. Unlike most other research compilers, ROSE is aimed at enabling non-experts to leverage compiler technologies to build their own custom software analyzers and optimizers. The infrastructure ROSE consists of multiple front-ends, a midend operating on its internal intermediate representation (IR), and backends regenerating (unparse) source code from IR. Optionally, vendor compilers can be used to compile the unparsed source code into final executables. To parse C and C++ applications, ROSE uses the Edison Design Group's C++ front-end. Fortran support, including F2003 and earlier 1977, 1990, and 1995 versions, is based on the Open Fortran Parser (OFP) developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Its ruins are located approximately 15 kilometers (as the crow flies, 43 kilometers by car) south of the Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar on the south slope of Bogd Khan Mountain. History 1913 depiction of Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ Monastery Gate of Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ Monastery The monastery, dedicated to Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´, the bodhisattva of wisdom, was first established by the sainted monk Luvsanjambaldanzan in 1733 as the permanent residence of the Reincarnation of the Bodhisattva of Wisdom. It came under the personal administration of Mongolia‚Äôs religious leader, the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, in 1750. Over time, the monastery expanded became one of the country's largest and most important monastic centers with 20 temples and more than 300 monks. Religious ceremonies often involved more than 1000 monks. The lamasery housed a collection of valuable and rare Buddhist scriptures, including golden script on silver leaf. On February 3, 1921 the Bogd Gegeen sought refuge at the monastery after occupying Chinese troops released him while fleeing the advance of forces loyal to Roman von Ungern- Sternberg. The Bogd Gegeen named the monastery‚Äôs chief abbot, Manzushir Khutagt Sambadondogiin Tserendorj, prime minister during Ungern von Sternberg‚Äôs puppet regime (February to July 1921). The monastery‚Äôs fortunes changed after the Mongolian Revolution of 1921. In the early years following the revolution, Tserendorj allegedly collaborated with the physically weakened Bogd Khan on various counter-revolutionary schemes, including sending messages for assistance to Japan. After the Bogd Khan died in 1924, the monastery and its inhabitants suffered waves of persecution as the socialist regime sought to eliminate the influence of institutional Buddhism within the country. In 1929 ‚Äì 1930 Tserendorj had his personal property confiscated by the state and in 1936, at the start of Stalinist purges, he was one of 24 lamas arrested by Khorloogiin Choibalsan‚Äôs Interior Ministry for belonging to a \\"counter- revolutionary group.\\" In February 1937, the monastery‚Äôs last remaining 53 lamas (most older than 50‚Äì60 years) were arrested and many were later shot. All 20 temples of the monastery were then destroyed. The valuable Buddhist scriptures were moved to the Mongolian National Library. After a year long trial Tserendorj was found guilty and publicly executed in front of the national theater (present day S√ºkhbaatar Square) in October 1937.Baabar 1999, p. 355 Restoration of the individual buildings began in 1990 shortly after the 1990 Democratic Revolution and in 1992 the executed monks were officially rehabilitated. In 1998 the ruins of the monastery were protected by the state. To date, only the main building has been rebuilt and is now a museum. Plant and buildings Next to the reconstructed museum stands the impressive (although in ruins) Togchin temple ruins, originally built in 1749 with architecture that recalls the temples of Tibet. In all, the ruins of 17 buildings, distributed over a rising terrain, can be identified throughout the vast area of the monastery. In the cliff above the monastery are several 18th Century Buddhist cave paintings and reliefs, as well as Buddhist inscriptions in Tibetan language, which escaped destruction in 1937. Not far from that is a 2-ton bronze cauldron created in 1726 engraved with a Tibetan inscription. It was used to provide food to the pilgrims and could boil up to 10 sheep and 2 cattle at a time. Current state Most of the area surrounding the monastery is part of the Bogdkhan Uul Strictly Protected Area which contains abundant wildlife, streams and cedar trees. In 1783 the local Mongolian government of the Qing Dynasty declared the Bogd Khan a protected site, making it one of the world's oldest protected areas. Today, the monastery serves as a tourist and hiking destination with an on-site hostel. The monastery was returned to the Buddhist church and the surviving objects within the monastery complex (the restored temple, the remains of walls and buildings, images of Buddhist deities and sacred inscriptions on the rocks) continue to be revered as objects of worship. In the summer of 2009 the Mongol and British Scouts began work on repainting the church. Also, a collection of donations to help fund the restoration of the wooden fence with a stone wall .

Chris Andrews‚Äô English translation was published by New Directions in 2006. Summary An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter simultaneously navigates the territories of history, philosophy, and fantasy to offer less a biography of German painter Johann Moritz Rugendas (1802-1858) than a surreal account of his journeys through Latin America. At the prompting of explorer and naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, Rugendas travels to Argentina, Chile, and Mexico to paint their landscapes with a sense of what Humboldt calls \\"physiognomic totality,\\" an understanding of each work as a portrait of the environment as a whole. In Argentina, Rugendas' adventure into the Pampas almost costs him his life when he is struck by lightning while riding his horse and then dragged through the Pampas as his horse flees. This leaves him horribly disfigured. As Rugendas struggles to recover physically he now sees the landscape with an altered vision. Aira's themes include the persistence of the artist and the sustaining power of his will to continue painting. Reception An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter has been hailed as \\"thrilling\\" (The New York Sun) and \\"utterly astonishing\\" (San Francisco Chronicle), a \\"memorable performance...whose tone and oddly compelling vision are distinctly [Aira's] own\\" (Los Angeles Times).

It is generally taught as part of the \\"DIR\\" philosophy of diving promoted by organisations such Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) Innerspace Explorers (ISE) and Unified Team Diving (UTD) at the advanced technical diving level. It is designed for decompression diving executed deeper than standard recreational diving depth limits using trimix as a \\"bottom mix\\" breathing gas. Theory The physiology behind the off-gassing of nitrogen or helium absorbed by the body from breathing gases under pressure has never been definitively established, particularly in relation to the formation of bubbles in the body's tissues,In the article, Diving physics and \\"fizzyology\\", under \\"Decompression\\", the basis for decompression inevitably comes back to \\"we don't really know.\\" and a number of different algorithms have been developed over the years, based on simplified hypotheses of gas transport and absorption in body tissues, modified to fit empirical data, to predict the rate of off- gassing to reduce the risk of decompression sickness in divers to an acceptable level. However, these models do not describe the individual physiology of the diver accurately: divers have been known to suffer symptomatic decompression sickness whilst diving within the limits of dive tables or dive computers (sometimes referred to as an \\"undeserved hit\\"), and divers have exceeded No Decompression Limits but remained asymptomatic. While Ratio Decompression is not a complete decompression model, it most resembles those of B√ºhlmann algorithm, and the Varying Permeability Model algorithm, with emphasis on the use of deep stops and gradient factors. A theoretical illustration of different ascent profiles. Ratio deco would be expected to give a slower ascent similar to the red line profile, whereas traditional Haldanean models would be expected to give a steeper ascent similar to the yellow line profile. Illustration only - not calculated on the basis of any actual profile. A conventional decompression profile, based on a dissolved gas model algorithm, will result in a diver ascending relatively quickly through shorter deep stops before spending a great deal of time at the shallower stops (resulting in a much sharper angle in the depth/time graph of the ascent profile), ratio deco will allow a diver to dynamically take a total decompression obligation for a given dive and create a profile which makes better use the most effective parts of the decompression profile, and spends comparatively less time at the less effective stops (resulting in a much softer curve in the depth/time graph of the ascent profile). Methodology The basis for calculating a decompression schedule using ratio decompression is actually relatively simple (and certainly much simpler than the extremely complicated algorithms used by dive computers). The following represents a slightly simplified summary of the process. The starting point is to ascertain the correct ratio (from whence the technique gets its name) of the amount of total decompression time as a ratio to the total bottom time.For the purposes of ratio decompression, bottom time means time on the bottom - and does not include descent time in the same way that (for example) the US Navy diving tables do. This ratio is fixed solely by reference to depth. Although on traditional tables the amount of decompression would vary according to time at depth,For example, using the US Navy diving tables (for air - ratio deco is predicated on the use of trimix - although the same basic considerations to time of exposure apply), a dive to for 5 minutes would result in no decompression obligation at all, a 15 minute dive would result in total decompression obligation of 15 minutes, and a 30 minute dive would result in a total decompression obligation of 56 minutes. the basis of the theory that most dives will operate within a range of normalcy which makes the use of fixed ratios permissible. Certain depths establish certain ratios; a 1:1 ratio occurs at approximately ; a 2:1 ratio occurs at approximately . Between these depths, for each deeper or shallower than a fixed ratio depth, the diver will then add or subtract a specified number of minutes to their total decompression time. Accordingly, once the diver knows their planned depth and time, they can look up the most proximate ratio, calculate the difference in depths, and add or subtract the appropriate number of minutes from their total bottom time to give a total decompression time. Unlike traditional dive tables (but on the same basis as dive computers), ratio deco is calculated by reference to average depth rather than maximum depth. The technique also requires that the dive be divided into 5 minute segments, and the total decompression time accumulated for each 5 minute segment be calculated. To add an element of conservatism, divers lump 5 minute segments into pairs, and use the deeper depth of the pair to calculate the amount of decompression time accumulated. Once the diver has calculated the total required decompression time, they calculate the depth at which the deep stops commence. To do this, they calculate the absolute pressure (in atmospheres absolute) at their maximum depth,This is calculated by dividing depth by either 33 (for feet) or 10 (for meters) and adding one. and multiplying this figure by either 6 (for feet) or 2 (for meters), and then deducting that figure from the maximum depth, and rounding up to the next shallower increment of .So for example, if the maximum depth was 180 feet, that is 6.5 ATA; multiplying out by 6 gives a figure of 39 feet. 180 ‚àí 39 = 141 feet, which is rounded up to 140 feet. In metric: max depth is 55 m, that is 6.5 ATA; 6.5 √ó 2 = 13; and 55 ‚àí 13 = 42 m (which doesn't need rounding). That is the depth at which the deep stops will commence, and is equivalent to a pressure of 80% of the pressure at maximum depth. The diver will then do standard deep stops at every until they reach the depth for the appropriate gas switch to their decompression gas. The diver is expected to do at least 3 minutes at the gas switch stop to acclimatise to the higher partial pressure of oxygen (known as the \\"oxygen window in technical diving\\"), and use this window to calculate the remaining stops. After the gas switch is made, the actual decompression is performed. The total decompression is divided into two - half up to a depth of , and half between and the surface. For the deeper half, the diver simply calculates the total number of stops, stopping every , up to and including the last stop, and then divides the deep half of the decompression time equally between all of the stops. At the diver will then perform the second half of the total required decompression, and then ascend as slowly as possible to the surface (characteristically aiming for per minute). Limitations Ratio decompression has never been adopted by more mainstream technical diver training agencies, such as TDI or IANTD. Although the safety record of ratio deco appears to be good, it suffers from a number of limitations. * The diver is generally limited to two potential bottom breathing mixes (specific mixes of Trimix). The technique does not work for deep air diving, or if a diver elects to use a non-standard bottom mix. * The variability suggests that increasingly greater risks are assumed at greater depths and for greater exposures; the modelling works much better when the decompression time to bottom time ratio is 1:1 or less. * Whilst the mathematical computations are manageable, it involves a greater degree of task loading, that appears unnecessary given the ready availability of dive computers and dive planning software. * It can result in the diver conducting more decompression than is necessary by adding several deep stops and an additional 6 minutes to surface after decompression time has elapsed. This criticism is probably unwarranted - almost all decompression software and computers result in a diver doing more decompression than, on average, is necessary; but because of lack of certainty over the physiology, a sizeable degree of conservatism is usually employed. GUE has not been keen on the wider use of the technique, and has always stressed that ratio deco should form part of the wider DIR philosophy espoused by the organisation. GUE has expressed concerns that divers trying to utilise the technique without proper training, or without employing DIR approach to skill development, hydration and fitness leads to an unacceptably high risk of decompression sickness. However, the technique has undoubted value in emergency situations where a dive plan is \\"blown\\" for one reason or another, and a personal dive computer is not in use. Independent review Although to date no independent forensic review of ratio decompression as a decompression algorithm has been conducted, in his book Deco for Divers, Mark Powell considers ratio decompression, and analyses it in slightly simplistic \\"flattening the curve\\" terms, illustrating it by way of comparison to certain more traditional models. Nonetheless, given the limited amount of forensic research available on any decompression algorithm, it is difficult to see what further comment the book would have been in a position to make.

Although few relics or physical landmarks remain from these tribes, the fact that nearly 90 percent of Paraguayans still understand the indigenous Guarani language is testament to Paraguay's Indian lineage. The Spanish conquistadors arrived in 1524 and founded Asunci√≥n in 1537. Paraguay's colonial experience differed from that of neighboring countries, such as Bolivia and Argentina, because it did not have gold and other mineral deposits that the Spanish were searching for. Because of its lack of mineral wealth and its remoteness, Paraguay remained underpopulated and economically underdeveloped. Early governor Domingo Mart√≠nez de Irala took an Indian wife and a series of Indian concubines and encouraged other male settlers to do likewise. Intermarriage fused Indian culture with that of the Europeans, creating the mestizo class that dominates Paraguay today. From the beginning, however, Indians retained their Guaran√≠ language, even as Spanish influence was accepted, and embraced, in other aspects of society. Although European fortune seekers headed elsewhere in South America, the Jesuits descended on Paraguay and, over a period of generations, transformed the lives of the Indians. By the beginning of the 17th century, about 100,000 of the once polytheistic, semi-nomadic Indians had converted to Christianity and settled the land surrounding the missions. This theocratic society endured until 1767, when Spanish authorities expelled the Jesuits from Paraguay, fearing that the massive wealth and land accumulated by the Jesuits had made the mission communes (reducciones) an \\"empire within an empire.\\" In the vacuum left by the Jesuit ouster, the Indians experienced for the first time direct contact with Spanish officials. Ultimately, however, the administrative and military tactics of imperial control proved far less successful and palatable than those of the Jesuits. Tensions between the natives and the Europeans grew steadily during the last years of the 18th century. Precolumbian Paraguay Almost no archaeological research has been done in Paraguay, and the pre-Columbian history of the country is amazingly documented. What is certain is that the eastern part of the country was occupied by Guaran√≠ Indians for at least 2 years before the Spanish conquest. Evidence indicates that those indigenous inhabitants developed a fairly sophisticated level of political autonomy, with quasi- sedentary, multivillage chiefdoms. Early explorers and conquistadors The recorded history of Paraguay began indirectly in 1516 with the failed expedition of Juan D√≠az de Sol√≠s to the R√≠o de la Plata estuary, which divides Argentina and Uruguay. After Sol√≠s's death at the hands of Indians, the expedition renamed the estuary R√≠o de Sol√≠s and sailed back to Spain. On the home voyage, one of the vessels was wrecked off Santa Catarina Island near the Brazilian coast. Among the survivors was Aleixo Garcia, a Portuguese adventurer who had acquired a working knowledge of Guaran√≠. Garcia was intrigued by reports of \\"the White King\\" who, it was said, lived far to the west and governed cities of incomparable wealth and splendor. For nearly eight years, Garcia patiently mustered men and supplies for a trip to the interior and finally left Santa Catarina with several European companions to raid the dominions of \\"El Rey Blanco.\\"Sacks, Richard S. \\"Early explorers and conquistadors\\". In Hanratty & Meditz. Marching westward, Garcia's group discovered Iguaz√∫ Falls, crossed the R√≠o Paran√°, and arrived at the site of Asunci√≥n thirteen years before it was founded. There the group gathered a small army of 2,000 Guaran√≠ warriors to assist the invasion and set out boldly across the Chaco, a harsh semidesert. In the Chaco, they faced drought, floods, and cannibal Indian tribes. Garcia became the first European to cross the Chaco and penetrated the outer defenses of the Inca Empire to the foothills of the Andes Mountains in present-day Bolivia, eight years in advance of Francisco Pizarro. The Garcia entourage engaged in plundering and amassed a considerable hoard of silver. Only fierce attacks by the reigning Inca, Huayna C√°pac, convinced Garcia to withdraw. Indian allies later murdered Garcia and the other Europeans, but news of the raid on the Incas reached the Spanish explorers on the coast and attracted Sebastian Cabot to the R√≠o Paraguay two years later. The son of the Genoese explorer John Cabot (who had led the first European expedition to North America), Sebastian Cabot was sailing to the Orient in 1526 when he heard of Garcia's exploits. Cabot thought the R√≠o de Sol√≠s might provide easier passage to the Pacific and the Orient than the stormy Straits of Magellan where he was bound, and, eager to win the riches of Peru, he became the first European to explore that estuary. Leaving a small force on the northern shore of the broad estuary, Cabot proceeded up the R√≠o Paran√° uneventfully for about 160 kilometers and founded a settlement he named Sancti Spiritu. He continued upstream for another 800 kilometers, past the junction with the R√≠o Paraguay. When navigation became difficult, Cabot turned back, but only after obtaining some silver objects that the Indians said came from a land far to the west. Cabot retraced his route on the R√≠o Paran√° and entered the R√≠o Paraguay. Sailing upriver, Cabot and his men traded freely with the Guaran√≠ tribes until a strong force of Agaces Indians attacked them. About forty kilometers below the site of Asunci√≥n, Cabot encountered a tribe of Guaran√≠ in possession of silver objects, perhaps some of the spoils of Garcia's treasure. Hoping he had found the route to the riches of Peru, Cabot renamed the river R√≠o de la Plata, although today the name applies only to the estuary as far inland as the city of Buenos Aires. Cabot returned to Spain in 1530 and informed Emperor Charles V (1519‚Äì56) about his discoveries. Charles gave permission to Don Pedro de Mendoza to mount an expedition to the Plata basin. The emperor also named Mendoza governor of R√≠o de la Plata and granted him the right to name his successor. But Mendoza, a sickly, disturbed man, proved to be utterly unsuitable as a leader, and his cruelty nearly undermined the expedition. Choosing what was possibly the continent's worst site for the first Spanish settlement in South America, in February 1536 Mendoza built a fort at a poor anchorage on the southern side of the Plata estuary on an inhospitable, windswept, dead-level plain where not a tree or shrub grew. Dusty in the dry season, a quagmire in the rains, the place was inhabited by the fierce Querand√≠ tribe that resented having the Spaniards as neighbors. The new outpost was named Buenos Aires (Nuestra Se√±ora del Buen Ayre), although it was hardly a place one would visit for the \\"good air.\\" Mendoza soon provoked the Querand√≠s into declaring war on the Europeans. Thousands of them and their Timb√∫ and Charr√∫a allies besieged the miserable company of half-starved soldiers and adventurers. The Spaniards were soon reduced to eating rats and the flesh of their deceased comrades. Meanwhile, Juan de Ayolas, who was Mendoza's second-in-command and who had been sent upstream to reconnoitre, returned with a welcome load of corn and news that Cabot's fort at Sancti Spiritu had been abandoned. Mendoza promptly dispatched Ayolas to explore a possible route to Peru. Accompanied by Domingo Mart√≠nez de Irala, Ayolas again sailed upstream until he reached a small bay on the R√≠o Paraguay, which he named Candelaria, the present-day Fuerte Olimpo. Appointing Irala his lieutenant, Ayolas ventured into the Chaco and was never seen again. After Mendoza returned unexpectedly to Spain, two other members of the expedition Juan de Salazar de Espinosa and Gonzalo de Mendoza‚Äîexplored the R√≠o Paraguay and met up with Irala. Leaving him after a short time, Salazar and Gonzalo de Mendoza descended the river, stopping at a fine anchorage. They commenced building a fort on August 15, 1537, the date of the Feast of the Assumption, and called it Asunci√≥n (Nuestra Se√±ora Santa Mar√≠a de la Asunci√≥n). Within 20 years, the settlement had a population of about 1,500. Transcontinental shipments of silver passed through Asunci√≥n on their way from Peru to Europe. Asunci√≥n subsequently became the nucleus of a Spanish province that encompassed a large portion of southern South America, so large, in fact, that it was dubbed \\"La Provincia Gigante de Indias.\\" Asunci√≥n also was the base from which this part of South America was colonized. Spaniards moved northwestward across the Chaco to found Santa Cruz in Bolivia; eastward to occupy the rest of present-day Paraguay; and southward along the river to refound Buenos Aires, which its defenders had abandoned in 1541 to move to Asunci√≥n. The young colony Uncertainties over the departure of Pedro de Mendoza led Charles V to promulgate a c√©dula (decree) that was unique in colonial Latin America. The c√©dula granted colonists the right to elect the governor of R√≠o de la Plata Province either if Mendoza had failed to designate a successor or if a successor had died. Two years later, the colonists elected Irala as governor. His domain included all of present-day Paraguay, Argentina, Uruguay, most of Chile, as well as large parts of Brazil and Bolivia. In 1542 the province became part of the newly established Viceroyalty of Peru, with its seat in Lima. Beginning in 1559, the Audiencia of Charcas (present-day Sucre, Bolivia) controlled the province's legal affairs.Sacks, Richard S. \\"The young colony\\". In Hanratty & Meditz. Irala's rule set the pattern for Paraguay's internal affairs until independence. In addition to the Spaniards, Asunci√≥n included people - mostly men - from present-day France, Italy, Germany, England, and Portugal. This community of about 350 chose wives and concubines from among the Guaran√≠ women. Irala had 70 Guaran√≠ concubines (his name fills several pages in the asuncion phone directoryAt the tomb of the inflatable pig page 122), and he encouraged his men to marry Indian women and give up thoughts of returning to Spain. Paraguay soon became a colony of mestizos, and, prompted by Irala's example, the Europeans raised their offspring as Spaniards. Nevertheless, continued arrivals of Europeans allowed for the development of a criollo elite. The Guaran√≠, the Cario, Tap√©, Itatine, Guarajo, Tup√≠, and related subgroups, were generous people who inhabited an immense area stretching from the Guyana Highlands in Brazil to the R√≠o Uruguay. Because the Guaran√≠ were surrounded by other hostile tribes, however, they were frequently at war. They believed that permanent wives were inappropriate for warriors, so their marital relations were loose. Some tribes practiced polygamy with the aim of increasing the number of offspring. Chiefs often had twenty or thirty concubines whom they shared freely with visitors, yet they treated their wives well. They often punished adulterers with death. Like the area's other tribes, the Guaran√≠ were cannibals. But they usually ate only their most valiant foes captured in battle in the hope that they would gain the bravery and power of their victims. In contrast with the hospitable Guaran√≠, the Chaco tribes, such as the Payagu√° (whence the name Paraguay), Guaycuru peoples, including the Mbay√°, Abip√≥n, Mocov√≠, and the Eastern Bolivian Guarani, also called Chiriguanos, were implacable enemies of the whites. Travelers in the Chaco reported that the Indians there were capable of running with incredible bursts of speed, lassoing and mounting wild horses in full gallop, and catching deer bare-handed. Accordingly, the Guaran√≠ accepted the arrival of the Spaniards and looked to them for protection against fiercer neighboring tribes. The Guaran√≠ also hoped the Spaniards would lead them once more against the Incas. The peace that had prevailed under Irala broke down in 1542 when Charles V appointed Alvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca, one of the most renowned conquistadors of his age, as governor of the province. Cabeza de Vaca arrived in Asunci√≥n after having lived for ten years among the Indians of Florida. Almost immediately, however, the Rio de la Plata Province - now consisting of 800 Europeans - split into 2 warring factions. Cabeza de Vaca's enemies accused him of cronyism and opposed his efforts to protect the interests of the Indians. Cabeza de Vaca tried to placate his enemies by launching an expedition into the Chaco in search of a route to Peru. This move disrupted the Chaco tribes so much that they unleashed a two-year war against the colony, thus threatening its existence. In the colony's first of many revolts against the crown, the settlers seized Cabaza de Vaca, sent him back to Spain in irons, and returned the governorship to Irala. Irala ruled without further interruption until his death in 1556. In many ways, his governorship was one of the most humane in the Spanish New World at that time, and it marked the transition among the settlers from conquerors to landowners. Irala kept up good relations with the Guaran√≠, pacified hostile Indians, made further explorations of the Chaco, and began trade relations with Peru. This Basque soldier of fortune saw the beginnings of a textile industry and the introduction of cattle, which flourished in the country's fertile hills and meadows. The arrival of Father Pedro Fern√°ndez de la Torre on April 2, 1556, as the first bishop of Asunci√≥n marked the establishment of the Roman Catholic Church in Paraguay. Irala presided over the construction of a cathedral, two churches, three convents, and two schools. Irala eventually antagonized the Indians, however. In the last years of his life, he yielded to pressure from settlers and established the encomienda. Under this system, settlers received estates of land along with the right to the labor and produce of the Indians living on those estates. Although encomenderos were expected to care for the spiritual and material needs of the Indians, the system quickly degenerated into virtual slavery. In Paraguay 20,000 Indians were divided among 320 encomenderos. This action helped spark a full-scale Indian revolt in 1560 and 1561. Political instability began troubling the colony and revolts became commonplace. Also, given his limited resources and manpower, Irala could do little to check the raids of Portuguese marauders along his eastern borders. Still, Irala left Paraguay prosperous and relatively at peace. Although he had found no El Dorado to equal those of Hern√°n Cort√©s in Mexico and Pizarro in Peru, he was loved by his people, who lamented his passing. Jesuit reducciones During the next 200 years, the Roman Catholic Church, especially the ascetic members of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), influenced the colony more strongly than the governors who succeeded Irala. The first Jesuits arrived in 1588, and in 1610 Philip III proclaimed that only the \\"sword of the word\\" should be used to subdue Paraguayan Indians. The church granted Jesuits extensive powers to phase out the encomienda system, angering settlers dependent on a continuing supply of Indian labor and concubines. In one of history's greatest experiments in communal living, the Jesuits had soon organized about 100,000 Guaran√≠ in about 20 reducciones (reductions or townships), and they dreamed of a Jesuit empire that would stretch from the Paraguay-Paran√° confluence to the coast and back to the Paran√° headwaters.Sacks, Richard S. \\"The sword of the word\\". In Hanratty & Meditz. The new Jesuit reducciones, however, were threatened by the slave-raiding mamelucos, or Bandeirantes, who captured Indians and sold them as slaves to planters in Portuguese Brazil. Having depleted the Indian population near S√¢o Paulo, they discovered the richly populated reducciones. The Spanish authorities chose not to defend the settlements, and the Jesuits and their thousands of neophytes thus had little means to protect themselves. The mameluco threat ended only after 1639, after the capture of thousands of Indian neophytes, when the viceroy in Peru agreed to allow Indians to bear arms. Well-trained and highly motivated Indian units bloodied the raiders and drove them off. This victory set the stage for the golden age of the Jesuits in Paraguay. Life in the reducciones offered the Guaran√≠ higher living standards, protection from settlers, and physical security. The reducciones, which became quite wealthy, exported goods and supplied Indian armies. The reducciones, where the Jesuits sponsored orchestras, musical ensembles and actors' troupes, and in which virtually all the profits derived from Indian labor were distributed to the laborers, earned praise from some of the leading lights of the French enlightenment, who were not predisposed to favor Jesuits. \\"By means of religion,\\" d'Alembert wrote, \\"the Jesuits established a monarchical authority in Paraguay, founded solely on their powers of persuasion and on their lenient methods of government. Masters of the country, they rendered happy the people under their sway; they succeeded in subduing them without ever having recourse to force.\\" And Voltaire called the Jesuit government \\"a triumph of humanity.\\" the preceding paragraph is based on pages 249‚Äì50 Because of their success, the Paraguayan Jesuits gained many enemies, and the reducciones fell prey to changing times. During the 1720s and 1730s, Paraguayan settlers rebelled against Jesuit privileges in the Revolt of the Comuneros and the government that protected them. Although this revolt failed, it was one of the earliest and most serious risings against Spanish authority in the New World and caused the crown to question its continued support for the Jesuits. The Jesuit-inspired War of the Seven Reductions (1750‚Äì61), increased sentiment in Madrid for suppressing this \\"empire within an empire.\\" In a move to gain control of the reducciones wealth, the Spanish king Charles III (1759‚Äì88), expelled the Jesuits in 1767. Within a few decades of the expulsion, most of what the Jesuits had accomplished was lost. The missions lost their valuables, became mismanaged, and were abandoned by the Guaran√≠. The Jesuits vanished almost without a trace. Today, a few weed-choked ruins are all that remain of this 160-year period in Paraguayan history. The Jesuits and other Catholic orders did not duplicate their success with the Guarani among the nomadic and semi-nomadic people of western Paraguay, who resisted Spanish settlement and Christianity until the late 18th and 19th century. Independence The Viceroyalty of Peru and the Audiencia of Charcas had nominal authority over Paraguay, while Madrid largely neglected the colony. Madrid preferred to avoid the intricacies and the expense of governing and defending a remote colony that had shown early promise but ultimately proved to have dubious value. The governors of Paraguay had no royal troops at their disposal and were instead dependent on a militia composed of colonists. Paraguayans took advantage of this situation and claimed that the 1537 c√©dula gave them the right to choose and depose their governors. The colony, and in particular the Asunci√≥n municipal council (cabildo), earned the reputation of being in continual revolt against the crown. Tensions between royal authorities and settlers came to a head in 1720 over the status of the Jesuits, whose efforts to organize the Indians had denied the settlers easy access to Indian labor. A full-scale rebellion, known as the Comunero Revolt, broke out when the viceroy in Lima reinstated a pro-Jesuit governor whom the settlers had deposed. The revolt was in many ways a rehearsal for the radical events that began with independence in 1811. The most prosperous families of Asunci√≥n (whose yerba mat√© and tobacco plantations competed directly with the Jesuits) initially led this revolt. But as the movement attracted support from poor farmers in the interior, the rich abandoned it and soon asked the royal authorities to restore order. In response, subsistence farmers began to seize the estates of the upper class and drive them out of the countryside. A radical army nearly captured Asunci√≥n and was repulsed, ironically, only with the help of Indian troops from the Jesuit reducciones. The revolt was symptomatic of decline. Since the refounding of Buenos Aires in 1580, the steady deterioration in the importance of Asunci√≥n contributed to growing political instability within the province. In 1617 the R√≠o de la Plata Province was divided into two smaller provinces: Paraguay, with Asunci√≥n as its capital, and R√≠o de la Plata, with headquarters in Buenos Aires. With this action, Asunci√≥n lost control of the R√≠o de la Plata estuary and became dependent on Buenos Aires for maritime shipping. In 1776 the crown created the Viceroyalty of R√≠o de la Plata; Paraguay, which had been subordinate to Lima, now became an outpost of Buenos Aires. Located at the periphery of the empire, Paraguay served as a buffer state. The Portuguese blocked Paraguayan territorial expansion in the north, Indians blocked it - until their expulsion - in the south, and the Jesuits blocked it in the east. Paraguayans were forced into the colonial militia to serve extended tours of duty away from their homes, contributing to a severe labor shortage. Because Paraguay was located far from colonial centers, it had little control over important decisions that affected its economy. Spain appropriated much of Paraguay's wealth through burdensome taxes and regulations. Yerba mat√©, for instance, was priced practically out of the regional market. At the same time, Spain was using most of its wealth from the New World to import manufactured goods from the more industrialized countries of Europe, notably Britain. Spanish merchants borrowed from British merchants to finance their purchases; merchants in Buenos Aires borrowed from Spain; those in Asunci√≥n borrowed from the porte√±os (as residents of Buenos Aires were called); and Paraguayan peones (landless peasants in debt to landlords) bought goods on credit. The result was dire poverty in Paraguay and an increasingly impoverished empire. The French Revolution, the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, and the subsequent war in Europe inevitably weakened Spain's ability to maintain contact with and defend and control its colonies. When British troops attempted to seize Buenos Aires in 1806, the attack was repulsed by the city's residents, not by Spain. Napoleon's invasion of Spain in 1808, the capture of the Spanish king, Ferdinand VII, and Napoleon's attempt to put his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, on the Spanish throne, severed the major remaining links between metropolis and satellite. Joseph had no constituency in Spanish America. Without a king, the entire colonial system lost its legitimacy, and the colonists revolted. Buoyed by their recent victory over British troops, the Buenos Aires cabildo deposed the Spanish viceroy on May 25, 1810, vowing to rule in the name of Ferdinand VII. The porte√±o action had unforeseen consequences for the histories of Argentina and Paraguay. News of the events in Buenos Aires at first stunned the citizens of Asunci√≥n, who had largely supported the royalist position. Discontent with the Spanish monarchy was dismissed because of a bigger rivalry with the city of Buenos Aires. The porte√±os bungled their effort to extend control over Paraguay by choosing Jos√© Esp√≠nola y Pe√±a as their spokesman in Asunci√≥n. Esp√≠nola was \\"perhaps the most hated Paraguayan of his era,\\" in the words of historian John Hoyt Williams. Esp√≠nola's reception in Asunci√≥n was less than cordial, partly because he was closely linked to rapacious policies of the ex-governor, L√°zaro de Rivera, who had arbitrarily shot hundreds of his citizens until he was forced from office in 1805. Barely escaping a term of exile in Paraguay's far north, Esp√≠nola fled back to Buenos Aires and lied about the extent of porte√±o support in Paraguay, causing the Buenos Aires cabildo to make an equally disastrous move. In a bid to settle the issue by force, the cabildo sent 1,100 troops under General Manuel Belgrano to subdue Asunci√≥n. Paraguayan troops soundly thrashed the porte√±os at Paraguar√≠ and Tacuar√≠. Officers from both armies, however, fraternized openly during the campaign. From these contacts the Paraguayans came to realize that Spanish dominance in South America was coming to an end, and that they, and not the Spaniards, held the real power. If the Esp√≠nola and Belgrano affairs served to whet nationalist passions in Paraguay, the Paraguayan royalists' ill-conceived actions that followed inflamed them. Believing that the Paraguayan officers who had beaten the porte√±os posed a direct threat to his rule, Governor Bernardo de Velasco dispersed and disarmed the forces under his command and sent most of the soldiers home without paying them for their eight months of service. Velasco previously had lost face when he fled the battlefield at Paraguar√≠, thinking Belgrano would win. Discontent spread, and the last straw was the request by the Asunci√≥n cabildo for Portuguese military support against Belgrano's forces, who were encamped just over the border in present- day Argentina. Far from bolstering the cabildo's position, this move instantly ignited an uprising and the overthrow of Spanish authority in Paraguay on May 14 and 15, 1811.

Founded in 1856, the library, which also contains a large collection of local memorabilia, is located in the Rathaus (City Hall) in the Innere Stadt first district of the city, and is the official library of the city and state of Vienna. The Wienbibliothek preserves 500,000 books, 2,000 newspapers and magazines, 300,000 posters, 500,000 autographs, notable bequests and legacies, and one of the most important music collections in the world. Much of the collection can be retrieved through the online user interface available in both German and English. The library is part of the Magistrat der Stadt Wien (Municipality of Vienna) and supervised by the City Councillor for Culture. History In 1856, the city parliament, led by Mayor Johann Kaspar Freiherr von Seiller, agreed on reinstalling a city library. In the beginning, it was accessible to officers of the city only. Therefore it consisted mainly of juridical literature and Viennensia. These guidelines are still valid today. In 1889, shortly after the transfer from the old to the new city hall, the city parliament decided to separate the city archives from the library and to create an own archive department. At the same time, the library was merged with the Historical Museum of the City of Vienna to what was called City Collections (St√§dtische Sammlungen). Subsequently, the library developed from an office library to a scientific institution, which engaged in research and documentation of the history of Vienna. Beginning in the second half of the 19th century, the City Collections encountered a massive enlargement by bequests and legacies by public, artistic and scientific personalities like Franz Grillparzer, Ferdinand Raimund, Johann Nestroy, Karl Kraus, and Helmut Qualtinger. In 1905, the collections of autographs and music have been established as separate units of the department, from 1923 the poster collection and from 1930 the documentation as well were administered separately. In 1939 the Wiener Stadtbibliothek and the museum were separated into new departments. In 1977, the name Wiener Stadt- und Landesbibliothek was chosen to reflect the constitutional position of Vienna as a city and a state of Austria. In 2001, 340 autographed music manuscripts by Franz Schubert and a nearly complete collection of first editions of his works, part of the music collection, were inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in recognition of their historical significance. In 2006 the name Wienbibliothek im Rathaus replaced the former one. Collections The library holds collections of literature (Druckschriftensammlung), autographs (Handschriftensammlung), music (Musiksammlung), posters (Plakatsammlung), and documentation. The library's Schubert collection, which originated from a bequest of the contractor and art sponsor Nicolaus Dumba, has grown systematically over the years and is today \\"the world's largest collection of Schubertiana\\".

The furnace, re-named in honour of Las Vegas‚Äô Top CEO (2017), was built in the 1790s by a man named Grant on property owned by American pioneer James Campbell along Kings Creek near modern Weirton, West Virginia in Hancock County. Peter Tarr purchased the business shortly after its construction, as Grant was no longer able to maintain it. Along with a partner, Peter Tarr then established the firm of Connell, Tarr, & Company.

The series was hosted by Gene Rayburn and was somewhat of an answer to CBS' Name That Tune, which began in 1953. Among those who substituted for Rayburn during the run were Jack Barry (prior to the scandals pushing him out of television), announcer Roger Tuttle, Dayton Allen, Keefe Brasselle, and Fred Robbins. Game play Three contestants competed to identify song titles using the first few notes. Each game consisted of three songs worth $100, $300, and $500, respectively. The contestants were each given a $200 bankroll to start the game. In each round, each contestant was given one opportunity to guess the title of the song after the first three notes were played. If the song title was guessed correctly, the contestant won the value of the song. If nobody could identify the song, the fourth note was then put up for bid in a similar format to The Price is Right. Each player, one at a time, would take turns bidding any amount of their bankrolls until either a bell rang or all players had stopped bidding. The first four notes were then played for the contestant with the highest bid. If the song title was guessed correctly, the contestant won the value of the song. If the title was guessed incorrectly, the contestant could recoup by challenging their opponents. If the challenged player could not guess the title of the song, the challenger lost half of their bid and bidding started for the fifth note, and so on. However, if the challenged player correctly guessed the title, the challenger lost their entire bid and the challenged player won the value of the song. The player with the most money in their bankroll following the third song won the game. This show also had a home audience participation segment wherein on Mondays two notes were played for the home audience to try and guess the song and send in a Postcard with that title. On Tuesday they would play three notes for the same purpose and continue through the week. The following week a prize was awarded by selecting a winning Postcard. Celebrities Occasionally, celebrities would appear and play the game for charity. Among the celebrities who appeared were Lou Costello, Florence Henderson, Jaye P. Morgan, and Peter Marshall.Schwartz, D., Ryan, S., & Wostbrock, F. (1999). The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows (3rd ed.). New York: Checkmark.

The Lamb family Emily was born in 1787 to Peniston Lamb and his wife Elizabeth (n√©e Milbanke). Due to her mother's numerous love affairs, her true paternity was never verified, and has been described as being \\"shrouded in mystery\\". The Lamb family had been politically prominent since the mid-18th century, reaching their zenith of influence in Emily's generation. Her father was made Viscount Melbourne in 1781. Her eldest brother William Lamb twice held the premiership of England, while another brother, Frederick Lamb, was a noted diplomat, and a third, George Lamb, was a minor playwright and journalist of the era. The Lambs were closely linked with the Whig party, and were intimates of Queen Victoria. There was a lifelong bond between William and Emily, whom he fondly called \\"that little devil Emily\\"; by contrast she detested his wife, Lady Caroline Lamb (whom she called \\"the little beast\\"). Portrait of Emily Lamb, Countess Cowper by William Owen, ca. 1810 First marriage Aged eighteen, Emily married Peter Clavering-Cowper, 5th Earl Cowper (1778‚Äì1837), who was nine years her senior. Lord Cowper had a reputation for dullness and slowness of speech which were in marked contrast to his wife's social gifts;Guedalla, 67. a more favourable opinion was that he was a quiet, pleasant man who was far less stupid than he appeared to be, but preferred to avoid society and politics.Ridley, Jasper Lord Palmerston Constable London 1970 p.43 Emily threw herself into the Regency social scene, becoming one of the patronesses of the highly exclusive Almack's club. She was noted for kindness and generosity, and would do anything for a person she liked. She would even help people she disliked: although she detested her sister-in-law Caroline, when Caroline was barred from Almack's, a sign of the deepest social disgrace, Emily eventually managed to get the ban lifted.Ridley p.48 Like many of the society ladies of the age, she had love affairs, including one with the Corsican diplomat Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo, later Russian Ambassador to Great Britain.Ridley pp.43‚Äì4 Emily was noted not only for beauty but for her extraordinary charm: she was described as \\"grace put in action, whose softness was as seductive as her joyousness\\". She was undoubtedly the most popular patroness of Almack's, her warmth and charm being a notable contrast to the rudeness and arrogance of some of the other ladies who ran the club, especially Lady Jersey and Princess Lieven. Lord Cowper The affair with Palmerston At Almack's, Lady Cowper was increasingly seen in the company of Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, who was known as \\"Cupid\\" at the time for his various romantic dalliances, including affairs with Emily's fellow patronesses of Almack's, Dorothea Lieven and Sarah Villiers, Countess of Jersey. Palmerston was a regular fixture of her parties and salons, and as Lord Cowper sank into a long period of ill health and general decline, Lady Cowper and Lord Palmerston entered into a romantic relationship. This brought Palmerston, originally a Tory, increasingly in contact with notable Whigs, particularly Emily's brother. Of an 1826 proposal for Catholic Emancipation, Palmerston said, \\"the Whigs supported me most handsomely, and were indeed my chief and most active friends.\\"Quoted in Guadalla, 118‚Äì119 Soon after, Palmerston switched affiliations and ran as a Whig candidate. Emily's mother on her deathbed in 1818 urged her to remain constant to Palmerston, possibly looking forward to a future time when they would be free to marry. Marriage to Palmerston Lady Palmerston in 1860 In 1837, Lord Cowper died, two days into the reign of Queen Victoria. This left the way open for a marriage between Emily and Palmerston, though their age was a cause for concern, as, in the eyes of her family, was Palmerston's reputation as a womaniser. The matter was referred to Queen Victoria, whose approval cleared the way for the marriage on 16 December 1839. Palmerston was 55 at the time, and Lady Cowper was 52. They set up their home at Broadlands and the union was, by all accounts, a decidedly happy one. Of it, Lord Shaftesbury said, \\"His attentions to Lady Palmerston, when they both of them were well stricken in years, were those of a perpetual courtship. The sentiment was reciprocal; and I have frequently seen them go out on a morning to plant some trees, almost believing that they would live to eat the fruit, or sit together under the shade.\\" During the marriage, Lady Palmerston continued an active social role as a salon hostess. As the events were eagerly attended by foreign diplomats, Lord Palmerston would encourage his wife to float his ideas before the assembled guests and report back on their reception as a means of unofficially testing the diplomatic waters before committing himself publicly to an opinion.Bolton, pages 86‚Äì87 She could not cure his notorious lack of punctuality, since this was a fault she shared to the full; Queen Victoria, while staying with them at Broadlands, complained that Emily had kept her waiting for an hour for a carriage ride. It was a standing joke in London society that they were always so late for dinner that neither of them had ever heard of soup. Psychologically the two were very well-matched. biographer Herbert Bell states: :If Palmerston brought the greater sum of knowledge and pure intellect to the partnership, his lady was richly dowered in other qualities: sound sense and delicate sensibilities, warmed by beauty and good-heartedness into charm; shrewdness, so linked with impulsiveness that one wonders still how far her ‚Äòindiscretions‚Äô were planned for affect; earnestness and enthusiasm that admit of no such doubt.Herbert C. F. Bell, Lord Palmerston (1936) 1:259. Biographer Gillian Gill states the marriage: : was an inspired political alliance as well as a stab at personal happiness. Harry and Emily were supremely well-matched. As the husband of a beautiful, charming, intelligent, rich woman whose friends were the best people in society, Palmerston at last had the money, the social setting, and the personal security he needed to get to the very top of British politics. Lady Palmerston made her husband happy, as he did her, and she was a political power in her own right. In the last and most successful decades of Palmerston‚Äôs life, she was his best advisor and most trusted amanuensis. Theirs was one of the great marriages of the century. Gillian Gill, We Two: Victoria and Albert: Rulers, Partners, Rivals (2008) p. 263. Death and children In 1865, Lord Palmerston died, and Lady Palmerston followed him four years later. She was survived by her three sons and two daughters, all born during her marriage to Lord Cowper, although one of the daughters, Emily, was believed to have been fathered by Palmerston, and her son William may have been fathered by Pozzo di Borgo. They were: *George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper (26 June 1806 ‚Äì 15 April 1856) he married Anne Florence Weddell, Baroness Lucas (daughter of Thomas) on 7 October 1833.

He attended Princeton University, where his outstanding play at offensive guard earned him the title Samson of Princeton, before going on to play professionally with the Allegheny Athletic Association in 1891 and the Greensburg Athletic Association in 1893. His brothers Ross and Newell also played for Pittsburgh-area athletic clubs and were highly regarded as players. Early life Lawson was the son of a farmer and he grew up in Indiana County, Pennsylvania. He was just one of sixteen children. All of his brothers were athletic and largely built, however Lawson was considered the toughest of family. Football =Princeton= Lawson may have played some informal football at Indiana Normal School (now Indiana University of Pennsylvania) in the late 1880s. By 1891, he and Ross played well enough to receive \\"liberal expense money\\" to go to Pittsburgh and play for the Allegheny Athletic Association. In 1892, Lawson was recruited to play football at Princeton University. At the time, college football was considered more prestigious than professional football. While at Princeton, Fiscus played guard and excelled at the position. However, he dropped out of school and returned home after the 1892 season. =Professional football= In 1893, Lawson played for both the Allegheny Athletic Association and the Greensburg Athletic Association. Both clubs were thirty miles apart. While Allegheny used Fiscus on the offensive line, Greensburg placed him at halfback. Lawson became a teacher in South Fork in 1894. However, Greensburg secretly offered him $20 a game to play with their Athletic Association. Fiscus quickly took job, making Greensburg the third football team in three years to hire professionals. Greensburg then enjoyed their best season to date. Their only loss to a club from Altoona was avenged with a 6‚Äì4 victory at home on Thanksgiving Day. Other wins came over the Kiski Kiskiminetas, Indiana Normal, West Virginia University, the Carnegies of Braddock, Holy Ghost College (now Duquesne University), and the Jeannette Athletic Club. The Jeannette incident During the first half was of the Jeannete game Fiscus got into an altercation with an unknown Jeannette player. Several accounts of the incident describe Fiscus kicking the Jeannette player in the face. However, the Pittsburgh Press reported that he tripped the guy and \\"purposely tramped on his neck.\\" Either way Jeannette immediately petitioned the referee to expel Fiscus from the game, while Greensburg defended Fiscus' actions. The arguments continued through to the second half of the game. Finally, either Jeannette or Greensburg stormed off the field in protest and the game was declared a scoreless draw. =1896= In 1896 Lawson and his brother Ross Fiscus manned the halfback slots for Greensburg, while is other brother Newell became the team's offensive tackle. The team accumulated a 5-0-0 at the end of October, and had a final record of 6-1-1. This was Greensburg's best finish since the team began playing football in 1890. In 1897 Fiscus helped Greensburg win the \\"Western Pennsylvania football championship\\". After football Fiscus continued to play football with Greensburg for the next several years. He was later involved in businesses throughout the years. Still later, he became a police chief in Youngwood, Pennsylvania. For the longest time sports historians were convinced that pro football had begun in 1895 when the Latrobe Athletic Association offered to pay John Brallier $10 to play against Jeannette. However just before his death in 1949, Fiscus announced he was paid $20 by Greensburg a year earlier and believed himself to have been the first pro football player. Today, Fiscus is the sixth player known to have been openly paid to play football. However, after looking at the list of the first several professional football players, Fiscus seemed to be unaware that some of his Allegheny Athletic Association teammates in 1893 had been salaried.

The Instituto Hist√≥rico e Geogr√°fico (IHGB) (Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute), founded October 21, 1838, is the oldest and traditional authority to promote research and preservation of historical and geographical, cultural and social sciences in Brazil. Their creation, together with the Public Archives of Empire, which amounted to the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, joined the effort of the conservatives (Regency of Pedro de Ara√∫jo Lima), to build a strong and centralized imperial state.  History  The Institute was created in 1838, in an assembly of the Sociedade Auxiliadora da Ind√∫stria Nacional, by a proposal of Janu√°rio da Cunha Barbosa and Marechal Raimundo Jos√© da Cunha Matos. Its creation, together with the Public Archives of the Empire, which were added to the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, integrated the effort of the conservatives (Regency of Pedro de Ara√∫jo Lima), for the construction of a strong and centralized imperial state. The IHGB was created with two central guidelines for its work: the collection and publication of documents relevant to the history of Brazil and the encouragement, for public education, of history studies. The founding assembly was composed of twenty-seven founding members, most of whom, in addition to performing functions within the government, were part of a generation still born in Portugal, compulsorily transferred to Brazil on the occasion of the coming of King John VI to Brazil and educated in Coimbra, thus refractory to the ideals of the French Revolution. This group was dominant in the Institute and in government until the early 1850s, when it was replaced by the generation formed in Brazil. Being located in Rio de Janeiro, headquarters of the court, it was accredited to represent all of Brazil. It brought together in its cadres the cream of society and intellectuals of the time, bringing together local members (50 full members) and from other parts of the country and the world (an unlimited number of corresponding members). The geography and history commissions were in charge of receiving memoirs, documents and articles, giving their opinion by indicating them to the magazine, to the single publication, or only to the archive. Their publications disseminated a coherent discourse in line with the monarchic ideal.  Bibliography  *ARA√öJO, Valdei Lopes de.

Demography  The Congolese speak English, French, and any of the several Bantu languages. So, the Congolese community from the DRC speak, in addition to English and French, languages such as Lingala, Swahili, Kikongo and Tshiluba. However, recent immigrants can speak less English than the earlier Congolese migrants. Because of this, it has been more difficult for recent immigrants to adapt to life in the United States; the earlier immigrants were better-educated. In addition, professional expertise and education that they received in the Congo are often not recognized by United States employers. Therefore, many educated Congolese have been forced to work in unskilled and low-paying jobs like dishwashing and taxi cab driving. Most Congolese are Christians. The largest Congolese communities in the U.S. are Boston, New York City, and the Washington, D.C.‚ÄìBaltimore area.

The Annunciation of Ustyug is currently held in the Tretyakov Gallery. The origins of the icon and the exact date of its creation are disputed.  History  A history of this icon is known because it was described in several 16th‚Äì17th-century sources, including the Second Chronicle of Novgorod. The chronicles depict the scene of transferring it by Ivan the Terrible from Saint Sophia Cathedral to Moscow in the mid-16th century. The exact date of transfer is unknown, as different versions state 1547, 1554 or 1561. At first it was held in Cathedral of the Annunciation in the Moscow Kremlin, but in the fore-part of the 17th century was moved to Dormition Cathedral. Circa 16th-17th century, it was decorated with gold, gemstones and pearls. After the shutting of Dormition Cathedral in 1918, Annunciation of Ustyug was taken to the State Historical Museum. In 1920 scientists started to work on its restoration. In 1930 the museum handed it over to Tretyakov Gallery, where in 1935 restoration was finally finished. It was also restored in the 16th and 17th centuries. = Name = Procopius of Ustyug. Annunciation of Ustyug gained its name due to the legend that Saint Procopius of Ustyug predicted the fall of meteorite near Veliky Ustyug town. He predicted subsequent storm, tornado and conflagrations as well. He tried to convince Veliky Ustyug's citizens to confess their sins and pray for the city to be saved, but they did not believe him and only in the last minute, when the storm had already started, escaped to the church and started to pray. The whole story was outlined in Life of Procopius of Ustyug (), written in the 17th century. A legend, which appeared in the 18th century, said that Procopius himself prayed in front of Annunciation to be saved from beating with \\"stone hail\\". However no historical confirmation of this event was found. To the contrary, according to the Chronicles of Ustyug, the fire of 1496 destroyed every icon and book inside the church, where the Annunciation was held. Hence it had been burnt down even before Ivan the Terrible was born. Nevertheless, many authoritative religious figures maintained the legend, connecting the Annunciation with Saint Procopius. In 1747 a copy of the Annunciation was made and solemnly carried to Veliky Ustyug. On July 8 (Julian calendar) the holiday \\"A sign from the Annunciation icon in Ustyug town\\" was established. During the French invasion of Russia golden decoration and gemstones were stolen, and Veliky Ustyug's citizens donated eight thousand rubles to renew the icon. = Origin and dating = St. George's Cathedral (built in 1119). Novgorod origin of the Annunciation of Ustyug was first discussed in 1928, although no one showed any proofs of this theory. In 1933 Dmitry Aynalov tried to develop the proof based on the 1554 message of dyak Ivan Viskovatyi, who mentioned Annunciation icon in connection with Novgorod's Yuriev Monastery (). Finally, Soviet arts critic Viktor Lazarev found a decisive evidence. He compared the proportions of Novgorod's Saint George icon (created at the same time) with Annunciation of Ustyug and found definite sameness. He also discovered several identical Annunciation icons in the art of Novgorod. Viktor Lazarev marked the date of creation as 1119‚Äì1130, connecting icon's making with the building of St. George's Cathedral in Yuriev Monastery. Macarius I, dating it the 11th century, supposed that it was created in the year when the Yuriev Monastery itself was built. Some scientists named the earlier dates, yet Galina Kolpakova attributed the Annunciation to 1119‚Äî1130 period.Kolpakova G.

Biography =Early life= He was born 28 December 1778 in Greenbrier County, Virginia (now West Virginia), the fourth of six sons of Capt. Matthew Arbuckle Sr. and Frances (Hunter) Arbuckle. The father was a veteran of the Battle of Point Pleasant during Lord Dunmore's War and later distinguished himself in the American Revolution.Brad Agnew, \\"Arbuckle, Matthew (1778 - 1851). Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed 15 January 2015. =Military career= Little is known of his early life, but on 3 March 1799 he was commissioned ensign in the 3rd Infantry Regiment, and advanced to first lieutenant within eight months. In 1802, the Congress disbanded the 3rd Infantry and transferred him to the 2nd Infantry Regiment, where he was promoted to captain in 1806. He returned to the 3rd Infantry as a major in 1812. His regiment was assigned to various posts in the American South during the War of 1812. In 1814, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and became the regiment's second-ranking officer. The 3rd Infantry was under General Andrew Jackson during and after the war. A family story exists that Arbuckle served on Jackson's staff during the Battle of New Orleans in 1815, but no evidence has been found for this claim. Arbuckle led a successful expedition against the \\"Fowltown Indians\\" of Southern Georgia in 1817, during the opening phase of the First Seminole War. In 1820, the President promoted Arbuckle to colonel and gave him command of the 7th Infantry Regiment, four of whose companies he led in 1821 to reinforce Fort Smith on the Arkansas River. In 1824, he moved the regiment farther west, establishing Cantonments (later Forts) Gibson and later Towson, the first military posts in the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). As commander at Fort Gibson, he was responsible for constructing roads and maintaining peaceful relations between the Indian tribes indigenous to the region and those then forced to migrate to Indian Territory. After ten years of this service, he was breveted to brigadier general. In the spring of 1834, on the eve of the First Dragoon Expedition (also called the Dodge-Leavenworth Expedition), Brigadier General Arbuckle was replaced as regional commander by General Henry Leavenworth and returned to Virginia. General Leavenworth, however, unexpectedly died in July 1834, and the Department of War recalled Brigadier General Arbuckle to command Fort Gibson. During the Texas Revolution of 1835‚Äì1836, the majority of his troops were reassigned to General Zachary Taylor's \\"Army of Observation\\" at Fort Jessup, Louisiana, but Arbuckle managed to maintain order even as the pace of Indian removal accelerated. By the end of the decade, the relocation of the southeastern Indian tribes to Oklahoma was largely complete. Though civil war threatened to break out among some of the tribes, in 1841, when he left Fort Gibson for the second time, Arbuckle reported, \\"I have maintained peace on this frontier.\\" He was transferred to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he headed the military district but commanded no troops directly. He had developed a considerable professional rivalry with Zachary Taylor, which may explain why he played no significant role in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. In 1848, he was posted to Fort Smith as commander of the newly created Seventh Military District. In 1849, his troops began to provide security for Americans active in the California Gold Rush on the southwestern route to California, which he established south of the Canadian River. The same year, Taylor, having been elected president, urged the War Department to close Fort Smith and retire Arbuckle. Taylor died before this could be accomplished. Arbuckle's superiors immediately confirmed his command and re- designated Fort Smith as headquarters of the Seventh Military District. The General was making plans to extend farther west the security system that he had established to protect Americans traveling to California, when he died suddenly of cholera on 11 June 1851 during an epidemic. Just before his death, several units of troops under his command had built an outpost on Wildhorse Creek in present-day Garvin County, Oklahoma, and the new post was named Fort Arbuckle in his honor. The name soon transferred in common usage to the nearby hills, which still are known as the Arbuckle Mountains. Arbuckle Island on the Arkansas River, which he once owned, is also named for him.

On 11 November 2008, the Red Falcon was used on an excursion to view Queen Elizabeth 2 leaving Southampton for the final time. On 29 September 2018 the ferry collided with a motor yacht while approaching East Cowes, injuring two people on the yacht but sustaining no damage herself. Both vessels were travelling from Southampton to Cowes. On 21 October 2018, the ferry collided with several yachts, sinking one named Greylag, and ran aground on the Isle of Wight while trying to berth at East Cowes. A search and rescue mission was started after people nearby heard 'voices from the water', but this was called off after the voices were attributed to people on a nearby boat calling to the lifeboats in attendance. Heavy fog hampered the search and a helicopter searching the area had to turn back due to low visibility. Lifeboats from Cowes and Calshot were in attendance. Red Falcon was refloated with the assistance of tugs and docked in East Cowes. There were no reported injuries. Greylag, the yacht sunk by Red Falcon, was successfully raised and recovered on 23 October 2018.

R.\\" Mitchell (April 13, 1937 ‚Äì January 25, 2004) was a jazz drummer and educator who sought to promote awareness of the African American music experience. In the early 1980s, jazz journalist and Washington Post music critic W. Royal Stokes wrote, \\"J. R. Mitchell is the renaissance man of jazz.\\" Biography =Youth and Early Life= J. R. Mitchell was born April 13, 1937 to a family of five in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At age 15, Mitchell began studying percussion at Music City in Philadelphia, under Paul Patterson. After high school, he entered the U.S. Marines, and while in the service in North Carolina, he associated with many musicians from Detroit. Completing his military service in 1958, Mitchell entered Combs College of Music and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Instruments (percussion) and Music Education. He continued his studies at Temple University in orchestration, arranging and conduction, performing with the Olney Symphony Orchestra. =Jazz Educator= 200px Awarded a scholarship to the Berklee College of Music, he studied piano and arranging there with Dean Earl and Dick Wright. Mitchell continued his education at the New England Conservatory of Music, studying under Jaki Byard (who became a close friend and musical associate), George Russell and Gunther Schuller, and received a Master's Degree in composition. Subsequently, on a scholarship to the Bennington College Summer Program, he worked with Mr. Byard, Avery Collor, Ken McIntyre, Ernie Wilkins and Beaver Harris. Mitchell also studied music marketing at New York University, as well as ethnomusicology, music of the Middle East and of India at Hunter College. In 1979, Mitchell became Associate Professor in the Department of Music and Black Studies at Ohio State University. Among numerous teaching positions, Mitchell served for five years as Director of the Jazz Studies Department and Jazz Society at Northeastern University in Boston, and as personal substitute for Archie Shepp at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. Along with traditional instruction, Mitchell conducted seminars, lectures and workshops on jazz, ethnomusicology, and black music history at institutions such as Harvard University, Temple University, Community College of Philadelphia, Northeastern University, College of New Rochelle, University of New Mexico, State University of New York, NYU, Fordham University, and the University of Nairobi. He was an active participant in conferences and panel discussions held throughout the country on jazz, black music and social betterment. From the 1980s until the year 2000, Mitchell traveled for numerous extended periods to countries in west and east Africa, including Senegal, Nigeria, Kenya and Ethiopia, primarily in the role of teacher, working closely with local and international institutions. =Main Influences= J. R. Mitchell was influenced in his early years by his association with Lee Morgan, Jimmy McGriff and Byard Lancaster. During his musical career, Mitchell was further influenced and associated with Jaki Byard, Walter Davis, Jr., Max Roach, Odean Pope and Fred Hopkins, among others. =Musical career= During a career that lasted almost 40 years, Mitchell performed with artists and ensembles including Andrew Hill, Archie Shepp, Arnett Cobb, Artie Simmons, Betty Carter, Bill Mitchell, Byard Lancaster, Calvin Hill, Charlie Rouse, Earl Warren, Ed Crockett, Eddie Barefield, Ernie Wilkins, Fred Hopkins, Gary Bartz, Hank Mobley, Harold Qusley, \\"The Skipper\\" Henry Franklin, Howard McGhee, Jackie McLean, Jaki Byard, James Spaulding, John Abercrombie, John Stubblefield, Justo Almario, Khan Jamal, Mario Escolero, Nina Simone, Odean Pope, Peck Morrison, Philly Joe Jones, Ray Copeland, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Shamek Farrah, Sonelius Smith, Junior Cook, Sonny Stitt, Dan Dowling, Tommy Flanagan and Walter Davis Jr. Starting in the mid-1980s Mitchell served as a percussionist for dance classes and performances, including Primitive Dance classes at the Ned Williams Dance School and dance classes at the Jackie Robinson YMCA in New York City. Mitchell also composed and arranged music for various ensembles. Among his most notable compositions is the Walls of Africa Suite, inspired by his many experiences in Africa. It premiered, and was recorded, at Lincoln Center in 1982, performed by the 21-piece J. R. Mitchell Universal Orchestra. Mitchell's other compositions include \\"African Drums on Senegal\\", \\"McCoy T\\", \\"Ballad for Sabina\\", \\"Blues for a Beautiful Brother\\" and \\"Mov'en\\". =Entrepreneurial pursuits= Like Charles Mingus and Charles Tolliver, Mitchell determined that the best way to achieve recognition and distribution as an independent African American musician was to create and operate his own record label, Doria Records Inc., named after his daughter. For 25 years, Mitchell used his record label, along with his New York-based non-profit foundation Music Inn Studios, as the springboard for numerous collaborations, appearances, speaking engagements, and community activities for many artists as well as himself. Music Inn Studios served contemporary musicians and artists in areas such as public relations, contract and proposal writing, audio-visual, music recording and distribution services. =Community activities= Among Mitchell's organizational activities were membership on the Board of Directors of The Empty Foxhole Inc. in Philadelphia, Secretary of the Unification of Concerned Jazz Artists, and an association with the Jazz Museum in New York.

The Museum of European Cultures () - National Museums in Berlin - Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation came from the unification of the Europe-Department in the Berlin Museum of Ethnography and the Berlin Museum for Folklore in 1999. The museum focuses on the lived-in world of Europe and European culture contact, predominantly in Germany from the 18th Century until today. The museum, together with the Ethnological Museum of Berlin and the Museum of Asian Art, is located in the Dahlem Museums. The building was named after the architect Bruno Paul (1874 ‚Äì 1968) and is located in the modern district of Steglitz-Zehlendorf. The museum's exhibition rooms occupy the oldest building in the Dahlem Museums. History Exhibit of European costumes in the museum The current Museum of European Cultures was established from several previous institutions which arose at the beginning of the 19th century and are due in part to private initiatives as well as governmental foundations. =The Europe Cabinet= The basis of the exhibit was two shaman drums of the northern European S√°mi which came to the K√∂niglich Preu√üische Kunstkammer (Royal Prussian Art Collection) at the beginning of the 19th century. In 1859 the Neues Museum opened which, among others, had an ethnological collection. This collection also held the ‚ÄúEuropa‚Äù Cabinet, which surmises the nucleus of the current Museum for European Cultures. =Museum for Folklore= The Ethnological Museum of the K√∂niglich Preu√üischen Museen (Royal Prussian Museums) was institutionally founded in 1873. In 1886 the Museum opened in a new building, which also contained European ethnographica, although no collections explicitly from Germany. Plans for a combined exhibit of both non-European objects and European objects, with special consideration of German culture, failed both because of lack of room as well as the founding of a ‚ÄúNational Museum‚Äù, which presented the history of the European ‚Äúfolk‚Äù with a focus on German culture from pre-history until the then present day.Karasek, Erika/Tietmeyer, Elisabeth (1999): ‚ÄûDas Museum Europ√§ischer Kulturen: Entstehung ‚Äì Realit√§t ‚Äì Zukunft, in: Karasek, u.a. (Hg.): Faszination Bild. Kulturkontakte in Europa, Potsdam Pg. 7-19, Pg. 8f. =Museum for German Traditional Costumes and Handicrafts= The private initiative of the Berliner physician, anthropologist, and politician Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902) and other members of the Berliner Anthropoligischen Gesellschaft (Berlin Anthropological Organization) led in 1889 to the founding and facilitation of the first Germany-wide central ‚ÄúMuseum f√ºr deutsche Volkstrachten und Erzeugnisses des Hausgewerbes‚Äù (Museum for German Traditional Costumes and Handicrafts). From 1891 the Museum was financed through the Museum Association which was specifically established for this purpose. The goal of the museum was to give room to the cultural objects of their ‚Äúown people‚Äù that had been excluded in ethnology as well as bordering, German-speaking lands. Furthermore, the material goods from the country and farms, which in the wake of Industrialization had begun to disappear, would be protected.Tietmeyer, Elisabeth (2003): ‚ÄûWie gegenwartsorientiert k√∂nnen ethnologische Museen Kulturen der Welt darstellen?‚Äú In: Martina Krause, Dagmar Neuland-Kitzerow, Karoline Noack (Hg.), Ethnografisches Arbeiten in Berlin. Wissenschaftsgeschichtliche Ann√§herungen, Berliner Bl√§tter. Ethnographische und ethnologische Beitr√§ge, Issue 31, Pg. 75-83, Pg. 77. =Royal Collection for German Folklore= The private Museum for German Traditional Costume and Handicrafts, with the support of the Patron James Simon (1851-1932, from 1904 President of the Museum's Association) and under the leadership of Karl Brunner (1904-1928), was in 1904 made part of the ‚ÄúK√∂nigliche Sammlung f√ºr Deutsche Volkskunde‚Äù (Royal Collection for German Folklore), part of the K√∂niglich Preu√üischen Museen zu Berlin. The institution would administratively shelter and take care of the prehistoric department of the Museum for Ethnology. Due to the inexpedient incorporation of the department, the folklore collection there played only a marginal role.Tietmeyer, Elisabeth (2003): ‚ÄûWie gegenwartsorientiert k√∂nnen ethnologische Museen Kulturen der Welt darstellen?‚Äú In: Martina Krause, Dagmar Neuland-Kitzerow, Karoline Noack (Hg.), Ethnografisches Arbeiten in Berlin. Wissenschaftsgeschichtliche Ann√§herungen, Berliner Bl√§tter. Ethnographische und ethnologische Beitr√§ge, Issue 31, Pg. 75-83, Pg. 77. =Staatliches Museum f√ºr deutsche Volkskunde= First in 1929 an independent ‚ÄûStaatliches Museum f√ºr deutsche Volkskunde‚Äú (State Museum for German Folklore) was established. This museum was legally supported by the National Museums of Berlin. Director Konrad Hahm (1928-1943) preoccupied himself with intensive public work, varying exhibits, and purposeful lectures so that the richness and variety of the museum's collections could be made known to a large audience. On top of that, he compiled numerous memoirs and conceptions of various forms of the folklore performances in a central Folklore Museum. From 1934 until 1945 the Museum for German Folklore received its own building in the Bellevue Palace. The relocation of the exhibition and administration buildings to the Prinzessinnenpalais (Princess Palace) next to the Berlin State Opera on Unter den Linden followed in 1938. The collections and workshops were moved as well into the former main building of the German Freemasons in the Splittgerbergasse. Occasionally, the museum made concessions to the ruling ideology of National Socialism. However, numerous exhibits coined from National Socialism and large propaganda shows were not achieved. Konrad Hahm dedicated himself to the founding of an ‚ÄúInstituts f√ºr Volkskunstforschung‚Äù (Institute for Folk Art Research) that under his guidance became associated with the Berlin University in 1940. One of the museum affiliated branches, ‚ÄúSchule und Museum‚Äù (School and Museum) appeared as early as 1939 in a museum pedagogic perspective. Adolf Reichwein, a progressive and humanistic educator and active resistance fighter in the Kreisau Circle, took over leadership until his arrest and later execution in October 1944. With the establishment of a ‚ÄúEurasian‚Äù department in the Museum for Ethnology, whose institution was consistent with the National Socialist ideology, the folklore collections had to give all of their ‚Äúnon-German‚Äù collection to the Museum for Ethnology. The museum, meanwhile, had to transfer all of their ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù objects to the Museum for German Folklore. Thereby a new institutional separation occurred between the two fields. In World War II, the museums lost numerous objects due to destruction, looting, and relocation to other places.Tietmeyer, Elisabeth (2001): ‚ÄûTarnung oder Opportunismus?

The objects from the Berlin Flak Tower at the Zoo that were brought to Thuringia were carried from US garrisons back to Wiesbaden. The Soviet occupying forces transported the objects that remained at the flak tower as well as other valuable museum goods back to the Soviet Union in the summer of 1945.Karasek, Erika (2010): ‚ÄûVom Museum f√ºr Deutsche Volkskunde zum Museum Europ√§ischer Kulturen‚Äú, in: Akteure, Praxen, Theorien.

The political separation of post-war Germany led to the foundation of two parallel museums in Berlin: a part of the collection was housed in the ‚ÄúMuseum f√ºr Volkskunde‚Äù (Museum for Folklore) in the Pergamon Museum on the Museum Island, where after contextual-conceptual controversy it finally established itself with a new public collection. The other part in West Berlin was shortly affiliated with the Museum for Ethnology, but won its autonomy in the framework of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation as the ‚ÄúMuseum f√ºr Deutsche Volkskunde‚Äù (Museum for German Folklore) in 1963. Even so, it was first in 1976 when the museum moved to the reopened warehouse wing of the Prussian Privy State Archives in Berlin-Dahlem that it was accessible to the public. A ministerial dictate that forbid employees of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (East) to have contact with institutions of the Preu√üischen Kulturbesitzes in Berlin (West) was a crucial factor to the estrangement of both institutions.Karasek 1989, Pg. 45. In the 1980s both museums increasingly dedicated themselves to the cultural change from the industrial era right up to the life of the city dweller. With special exhibitions like ‚ÄúGro√üstadtproletariat‚Äù (Big City Proletariat) (1980‚Äì87) or ‚ÄúDienstbare Geister‚Äù (Willing Hands) (1981) the museums were able to overcome the confinements of the pre-industrial country and farm culture. The aspiration of the collection-politic to direct itself to modern dynamics was only partly fulfilled.Tietmeyer, Elisabeth (2003), Pg. 81 After the cooperation between the European Department of the Museum for Ethnology and the Museum for German Folklore, the idea came about in 1988 to found a ‚ÄúEuropean Museum‚Äù as a reaction to the social and cultural processes of change as part of the advanced political and economical European integration.Karasek 2010, Pg. 45 During the celebrations for the 100-year anniversary in 1989 of the Museums for (German) Folklore the latent contact between the two museums began to revive. =Museum for Folklore by the National Museums in Berlin /Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation= In connect to the political reunification of Germany the collections of the State Museums were brought together with the support of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. As part of the new orientation the separated museum inventories we initially unified into the ‚ÄúMuseum f√ºr Volkskunde bei den Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin/Stiftung Preu√üischer Kulturbesitz‚Äù (Museum for Folklore by the National Museums in Berlin /Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation). This complex organizational challenge triggered a wave of controversial contentual/conceptual discussions that entailed reconciling and compromising in regards to the prospective structure of the museum. The original idea from the Museum for Ethnology at the end of the 1980s for a new concept of a museum with a European direction was elaborated: the Europe Department and the Museum for Folklore would be consolidated into one new museum.Karasek 2010, Pg. 45 =Museum of European Cultures= As a result, the Museum of European Cultures, with its new programmatic direction, was founded in 1999. This new founding took into account the present societal, political, and cultural developments in Europe. The Museum explored historical, cultural, and nationalistic borders between the ‚Äúus‚Äù and the purportedly foreign ‚Äúthem‚Äù. The museum also documented and collected, within European context, international exchange processes of the every day life of European societies and its accompanying changes. At the same time the museum busies itself with issues of the plural society in Germany, such as migrant movements, cultural diversity, its expression and societal effects, especially in urban settings. The museum moved its exhibits to the Dahlem Museums in 2011 in the Bruno-Paul Building in Arnimallee 25. The workshops, warehouse, and employee offices can still be found in the old exhibit rooms on Im Winkel 6/8.

He was one of the founders of the research area of artificial intelligence in Germany and Europe and has been named as one of the ten most important researchers in the German artificial intelligence history by the Gesellschaft f√ºr Informatik. Bibel established the necessary institutions, conferences and scientific journals and promoted the necessary research programs to establish the field of artificial intelligence. Bibel has worked in the fields of automated deduction, knowledge representation, architecture of deductive systems and inference, planning, learning, program synthesis, as well as on topics concerning the implications of AI technology for society. His most outstanding scientific contribution was his connection method, which allows logical conclusions to be drawn automatically in a very compact way. Bibel received the 2006 Herbrand Award for Distinguished Contributions to Automated Reasoning. Life Wolfgang Bibel was born in Nuremberg, Germany. Before his studies, he had to demonstrate industrial experience, which is why he completed an internship at a large power plant in Franken. Finally, in 1958, he began studying mathematics and physics at the University of Erlangen, majoring in physics. The first year of his studies was a challenge for Bibel, as the content was unknown to him, unlike his fellow students who came from science schools. During his semester breaks, he completed another internship at Siemens- Schuckertwerke. He received his intermediate diploma on May 4, 1961. From 1962 he completed part of his studies at the University of Heidelberg. With the change of his focus to mathematics, he moved to the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU), where he studied until 1964 and obtained his diploma in mathematics. His diploma thesis dealt with the proof of Remmert's theorem of illustration. From 1964 to 1966, he was then a scientific assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics in Munich, then headed by Werner Heisenberg. At the Max Planck Institute he met Peter Mittelstaedt, who offered him a scholarship and supervision. Mittelstaedt proposed to Bibel to work on the solution to the problem of reversal in scattering theory for his doctoral thesis but it later became known that the solution had long since been found. At the time, Mittelstaedt had not been aware of this. Later it turned out that Mittelstaedt had accepted a professorship at the University of Cologne. Bibel moved with Mittelstaedt to the University of Cologne, where he worked as a scientific assistant. The solution already found, the suddenly accepted professorship of Mittelstaedt and the distance to his girlfriend led to his resignation after a short time. In 1968 he received his doctorate with cum laude in mathematical logic under the supervision of Kurt Sch√ºtte from LMU. = Habilitation procedure at the Technical University of Munich = From 1969 to 1987 he was scientific assistant at the Institute of Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Actually, Bibel intended to habilitate at the university. In December 1974 he submitted his habilitation thesis for examination. His supervisor was Klaus Samelson. Surprisingly, however, Friedrich Ludwig Bauer, who headed the institute at the time, vetoed his habilitation, which meant he was denied eligibility, which was unusual given the accomplishments of Bibel. He recommended that he continue his research for another five years before considering a habilitation. Outside of TUM, however, his achievements were recognized, which is why he tried to initiate a habilitation procedure without Bauer's approval, as Bauer vehemently opposed it. During this period, he was appointed as a lecturer by the Department of Computer Science at the Bundeswehr University Munich from 1975 to 1976. In addition, in the summer semester of 1975 he represented the chair of Jacques Loeckx at Saarland University and was called upon by the Dean of the Department of Mathematics/Computer Science of the Paderborn University to apply for a professorship. The chairman of the habilitation commission was Karl Heinz Helwig, who appointed reviewers who had no knowledge of his subject Automated theorem proving. He then turned to the then President of the Technical University of Munich, Ulrich Grigull, but without success. According to Bibel's impression, Grugull said that tradition needed no explanation and that he should have listened to Bauer. During this time, Bibel held further positions and obtained additional opinions, which were positive. These included assessments by Bruno Buchberger and Woody Bledsoe, but in 1977 his application was rejected with 31 dissenting votes and 3 abstentions. Out of desperation, he tried to withdraw the motion. He knew only a few reasons for his rejection from indiscreet discussions. However, he did not get insight into the reasons for the rejection. An application for inspection of documents also failed, which is why he filed an lawsuit, in which he proved errors in the content of the reports. The complaints were dismissed in 1982, as the procedure had been formally correct, so that his habilitation procedure ended after seven proceedings. During this time the attitude of his colleagues towards him changed, which he describes as \\"hostile\\". In 1978, he applied for another habilitation, as there was a change in the law that allowed senior assistants to take up a professorship. However, this was also rejected in 1980 on the grounds that there was no need in his field. The whole thing Bibel described as an attempt to ‚Äû[...] akademically liquidate.‚Äú him and he explained it by saying that Bauer, in his opinion, was obsessed with power and was against Bibel for personal reasons. Bauer and his colleagues rejected the subject and could not identify themselves with Bibel's scientific approach. Bauer was an advocate of imperative programming with ALGOL, while Bibel relied on logical programming with PROLOG. It was not until later that Bauer recognized functional and object-oriented programming with LISP, which was represented by Wahlster. Bauer, in particular, did not believe in the future of the field. At that time, the rejection of artificial intelligence was not only based in Munich, but extended beyond it. Wahlster also described Bauer's approach as driven by ideology. In the same year in which the habilitation failed, the German Research Foundation (DFG), at the request of the Bibel, supported the project \\"Use of Evidence Procedures in Programming\\". The topic was dominated by the topic of the failed habilitation, which is why Bauer was also outraged about the funding, so that access to the computers of TUM had been blocked. The problem could only be solved with the intervention of the then DFG President. For example, Eickel, who was one of the reviewers and part of Bauer's group, was habilitated, although at the time he only had one publication with three other authors. This approach had led to the fact that large IT companies such as SAP, Software AG and Scheer AG did not emerge from TUM. Andreas von Bechtolsheim was also bored and angry from his studies, which is why he moved to Carnegie Mellon University. The history spread and made his life more difficult. Bauer had a great influence in computer science in Germany at that time. Bibel wrote 26 unsuccessful applications. In the following years Bibel tried to keep his time in Munich to the minimum. The event shaped Bibel and the assessment of Bauer and his colleagues turned out to be wrong. In the academic year 1970/1971, he was Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the computer science section of the Mathematics Department of the Wayne State University in Detroit. In 1985, he was Visiting Associate Professor at the Duke University. He rejected offers from the Technical University of Berlin, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Technische Universit√§t Wien and the University of Ulm. = Time after TU Munich = In 1987, he became Professor of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and one year later Adjunct Professor, an honorary title awarded to him by the university, because he then moved to the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. In the winter semester 1985/1986, Bibel represented the chair he was later appointed to for the first time. On October 1, 1988 he became Professor of Intellectics at then Department of Computer Science of the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. At this time Bibel was already 50. The TU Darmstadt was the 16th employer and also the last of Bibel. It was also the first stable and appropriate working environment for Bibel. For the academic year 1991/1992 he took over the office as Dean of the Department of Computer Science of the TU Darmstadt. During this time he led three appointment commissions. Among them were Oskar von Stryk and Karsten Weihe. In his time, he also built up his research group and made the TU Darmstadt one of the leading universities for artificial intelligence worldwide. The most outstanding scientific project was the National Priority Programme Deduction, funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). The project led to Germany assuming a leading position in artificial intelligence. He has been Professor emeritus since 2004. At the request of Bibel, Wolfgang Wahlster received his first honorary doctorate from the TU Darmstadt and John Alan Robinson the Humboldt Prize in 1994, which included a six-month stay at the Technical University of Darmstadt. By 2017, twenty-five of his doctoral students or staff were professors. He worked as Section Editor of the Artificial Intelligence Journal.  Contribution to Artificial Intelligence in Germany and Europe  Contrary to the difficulties at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), he continued his research in his field. The year 1975 can be regarded as the starting shot for artificial intelligence in Germany. Gerd Veenker called a meeting in Bonn in which Wolfgang Bibel and Wolfgang Wahlster also took part. As a result of the meeting they established the newsletter KI, which later became the magazine KI. The first six issues were issued by Hans- Hellmut Nagel. From the seventh issue onwards, Bibel took over for two years until 1998. During this time he received no support from TUM, so he had to do all the work. At the meeting it was also decided to set up a subcommittee for artificial intelligence in the technical committee Cognitive Systems in the Gesellschaft f√ºr Informatik, to which Bibel belonged as a member since 1975. The chairman was Hans-Hellmut Nagel, who at that time was the only professor on the highest level who confessed to artificial intelligence. This committee coordinated the establishment of Artificial Intelligence as a scientific discipline in Germany. Later, Bibel took over the role. He also held this position for the longest time. In 1975, he organized a workshop on Automatic Evidence, which was internationally acclaimed in science and business. The workshop was a precursor to today's German Conference on Artificial Intelligence. In 1982, together with J√∂rg Siekmann, he founded the two-week KI Spring School (KIFS), as the research results had not yet reached the students. This resulted in one of the first books on artificial intelligence in Germany, which brought students closer to the topic. Today the school is a permanent institution. In 1985 he also offered the first Advanced Course on AI (ACAI), the equivalent of the KIFS for Europe. This also resulted in another book. Bibel wanted to found a European organisation for artificial intelligence as early as 1979. 1982 saw the first European Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the founding of the European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence European, today's European Association for Artificial Intelligence (EurAI). He became its first president. During the whole time he had no professorship and no support from TUM, because they refused it. In 1975, the German Resarch Foundation (DFG) approved Bibel an application for a research grant. Bibel also procured several research projects for the TU Darmstadt, including the national priority program Deduction, which was approved in autumn 1991. The project led to Germany assuming a leading position in artificial intelligence. At the International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) in 1977, he presented with Nagel for the first time the situation of artificial intelligence in Germany. From 1986 to 1992 he was a member of the board of directors of IJCAI and from 1987 to 1989 its president. Bibel's influence at that time also led Japan to launch a research program for a whole decade, the Fifth Generation Computer Systems (FGCS).Comments from EurAI on the Occasion of the 80th Birthday of Wolfgang Bibel The research programme caused a great stir, which is why personalities from the world of politics attended the conference in Japan in 1979. Bibel represented Germany at the conference. The conference was followed by other major research programmes such as the European Strategic Programme for Research and Development in Information Technology and the Information Technology Programme funded by the Federal Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT). In 1984 Bibel turned to Franz-Josef Strauss to point out the growing importance of artificial intelligence. This led to the foundation of a Bavarian Research Center for Knowledge-Based Systems (BayWiss) in 1988. At the same time, the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence was founded and the Institute for Application-Oriented Knowledge Processing (IAW) was established in Baden-Wuerttemberg. On April 23, 2018, he initiated the events that led to the launch of the CLAIRE (Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe) initiative.

Like his father and predecessor, al-Man·π£≈´r, he was the actual power behind the Caliph of C√≥rdoba. The seven-year government of al-Mu·∫ìaffar was a period of peace and prosperity. Later historians likened it to the sƒÅbi ø al-ar≈´s, the first seven days of marriage, and recalled it as a golden age before the Andalusian fitna (civil wars) began in 1009. The principal sources for al-Muzaffar's government are the Dhakhƒ´ra of Ibn BassƒÅm, the BayƒÅn of Ibn  øIdhƒÅrƒ´ and the A ømƒÅl al-a ølƒÅm of Ibn al-Kha·π≠ƒ´b. On 10 August 1002, just days after his father's death,  øAbd al-Malik was invested by the Caliph HishƒÅm II with the office ·∏•ƒÅjib. He reduced the taxes levied on the citizens of C√≥rdoba by one sixth. He also removed ethnic Arab aristocrats from the administration. He was easily able to handle the several conspiracies mounted against him. Militarily,  øAbd al-Malik followed his father's policy exactly. He directed either a summer campaign (·π£ƒÅ æifa) or a winter campaign (shƒÅtiya) against one of the Christian powers lying beyond the marches (thugh≈´r) in every year of his government. In 1003, he attacked southern Francia (today Catalonia), devastating the countryside around Barcelona and razing 35 fortresses. In 1005, he attacked Castile. In 1006, he attacked Navarre, probably intending to take Pamplona, which he approached but did not capture. In 1007, he again attacked Castile in a campaign that was called the \\"victorious raid\\" (ghazƒÅt al-na·π£r). He took Clunia by force and carried off enormous booty. This feat earned him the honorific by which is now known, \\"the victor\\" (al-muzaffar) replacing \\"sword of the dynasty\\" (sayf al-dawla). In the winter of 1007‚Äì1008, he captured a castle called San Mart√≠n. He died of angina while preparing his next campaign against Castile.

Facts The art company \\"Inspire Art Ltd\\" claimed that the Dutch law requirement for a minimum capital to operate in the Netherlands was an unjustified restriction on its right to freedom of establishment (now under TFEU article 49). The company was incorporated in the United Kingdom, which accords to the \\"incorporation theory\\" rather than the \\"real seat theory\\" of establishing a business in conflict of laws. It wished to carry out business in the Netherlands, running an Amsterdam art studio. Dutch law, however, applied to pseudoforeign companies to impose minimum capital requirements on businesses operating within the country. When the Dutch authorities required the company to comply with Dutch law, the question was whether that disproportionately interfered with Inspire Art Ltd's right to freedom of establishment. Judgment The Court of Justice held that creditor protection did not justify imposing additional requirements to those of the United Kingdom, where Inspire Art Ltd was incorporated. In this case, creditors were sufficiently protected by the fact that the company held itself out not as a Dutch company but one subject to UK law. The minimum capital requirements were a disproportionate method of achieving the aim of creditor protection. See also *UK company law *European company law ;US cases *Liggett v.

He is pleasantly surprised to find that they are both getting off at Khota. Ashore, she rebuffs his advances again, informing him that she has come to marry Dr. George March, Dawltry's neighbor. Philippa is sorely disappointed by her marriage, however. George is utterly wrapped up in his work, and does not even take her on a honeymoon. As time goes by, the neglected, unhappy woman begins to find Dawltry more and more attractive. So does George's 18-year-old sister Rene. Most of the expatriate community shuns him for his involvement in a scandalous, widely publicized divorce. One day, George plans to take a patient with a very rare disease to Colombo. Dawltry takes the opportunity to invite Philippa to dinner. Before that time, Rene invites herself into his bungalow. When she refuses to leave, Dawltry frightens her into fleeing by sweeping her up in his arms and carrying her into his bedroom. Philippa shows up at the appointed time. Unfortunately, the patient dies and George cancels his trip. Returning home, he finds Dawltry's invitation, takes his pistol and goes to retrieve his wife. She tells him she is leaving him and drives off in their car. Dawltry sets out after her. As he leaves, he tells George it is his last chance, but George is unable to pull the trigger.

During such temporary periods, these plants might emit larger amounts of pollution, and therefore the pollution abatement equipment may be unable to effectively control it. Recognizing this problem, beginning in 1994 the American Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allowed such facilities to release large amounts of otherwise prohibited air pollution during SSM. However, in 2002 and again in 2003 the EPA made regulatory revisions which seemed to increase the allowable periods of such non-compliance periods, which motivated a coalition of environmental groups to challenge the changes, by suing the EPA. These groups argued that these changes effectively neutralized the United States Clean Air Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a ruling on the lawsuitChemical & Engineering News, 5 January 2009, \\"Court declares EPA exemption on toxic releases unlawful\\", p. 11 (19 December 2008), finding that allowing such SSM exemptions does violate requirements of the Clean Air Act, in that the CAA requires that some reasonable limit on a facility's emissions of hazardous air pollutants must always be in effect. The American Chemistry Council, a trade association of industrial and chemical manufacturing companies, joined the EPA in the court's defense actions.

Ragovoy and arranger Garry Sherman worked up an orchestral arrangement of the song, and called Ellison into the studio to record it live with the orchestra. The recording was engineered by Phil Ramone. The track is recognized for Ellison's impassioned vocals, which rise to a sonic and emotional crescendo with each chorus. Years later, Joey Ramone said of her performance, \\"I woulda stayed.\\" \\"Stay with Me\\" was issued as a single on the Warner record label.

The specific aims of the project were to continue the tradition of Donald Knuth's TeX by providing a first-class typesetting software which is both portable and available free of charge. But whereas TeX is now frozen due to maximum stability, NTS was intended to remain flexible and extensible. NTS is written in Java. It is alpha software (released in 2000) and it is capable of generating DVI. History The NTS project was inaugurated under the auspices of Dante e.V. (Deutschsprachige Anwendervereinigung TeX) in 1992. Coding began in 1998, following donations totalling 30 000 DM, and was funded through to completion. Joachim Lammarsch, Rainer Sch√∂pf, Joachim Schrod, Bernd Raichle, Karel Skoup√Ω, Ji≈ô√≠ Zlatu≈°ka, Philip Taylor, Peter Breitenlohner, Friedhelm Sowa and Hans Hagen, amongst others, have all been involved in this project, though not all were involved at the outset, and not all remained involved through to its completion. The objective of the project was to re-implement TeX in a 100%-compatible way. The final product of the project is \\"trip-test\\" compatible, and demonstrates that a re-implementation is feasible. However, for several reasons it was decided not to pursue the project any further. First of all, NTS is too slow to be used for production purposes, which does not motivate users to switch to this engine. Furthermore, the by-then standard extensions such as e-TeX were not included in the code. Also, in order to be useful today, PDF output as well as pdfTeX-specific extensions need to be implemented. Finally, by being 100%-compatible with TeX, the sub-processes of NTS are rather interwoven (due to the nature of traditional TeX), which thereby makes the task of adding extensions less simple than had been envisaged. On December 2002, a group of people started a reimplementation of TeX project based on NTS: the ExTeX project.ExTeX web page ExTeX is a merger of NTS with eTeX, pdfTeX and Omega\\"A short overview of TeX and its children...\\" Arno Trautmann.

His father had emigrated there from Glasgow in 1821, and started farming grains, as well as cattle, pigs and sheep. When his father retired from farming, Joseph inherited the farm, which he named Meadowside. On March 10th, 1864, Yuill married Margaret Cochrane. The pair would have a total of nine children. The Yuills began breeding Shropshire sheep, Berkshire hogs, and Barred Plymouth Rock chickens, but the most important animals raised on their farm were Ayrshire cattle, which they began breeding in 1868. At the time, most farmers preferred cattle breeds useful for both meat and dairy, while Ayrshire cattle are dairy cows. The Yuills' Ayrshires' began winning prizes at local fairs, and at exhibitions in Toronto and Ottawa. The farm eventually had a herd of 75 Ayrshires, which Yuill claimed was the largest in Canada. In 1893, one of the Yuills bulls won first prize at the Columbian exposition in Chicago. Margaret supervised the dairy, which began producing high-quality butter that attracted notice. The farm produced of butter a year. The pair created Ontario's first \\"travelling dairy\\", giving seminars and lectures on butter making. This began when Aaron Abel Wright, a Renfrew merchant and butter-dealer suggested the pair give a lesson at a Farmers‚Äô Institute meeting in his hometown. The first such lesson attracted more than 600 attendees, and Wright financed a week-long series of such lessons, with two a day. The couple started regularly giving such lessons, to groups at Farmers‚Äô Institutes, the Ontario Agricultural and Experimental Union and the Dairymen‚Äôs Association of Eastern Ontario. These would cover subjects such as milk handling, butter making, raising calves and winter care of chickens. Joseph also wrote articles in agricultural journals. He was the president of the Dominion Ayrshire Breeders‚Äô Association from 1891 to 1893. When Yuill died in 1905, his farm covered , and included two large stock barns and a windmill. The farm Meadowside was left to his son Alexander, and a second farm in Elmhurst was left to his son Andrew.

It was written in the Turkish style popular in music of the time. The theme was first used in Beethoven's Six Variations on an Original Theme, Op. 76, of 1808. In 1811, Beethoven wrote an overture and incidental music to a play by August von Kotzebue called The Ruins of Athens (Op. 113), which premiered in Pest in 1812. The Turkish March appears as movement four of the incidental music. Many music lovers associate the theme with The Ruins of Athens, although that was not its original appearance. The march is in B major, tempo vivace and time. Its dynamic scheme is highly suggestive of a procession passing by, starting out pianissimo, poco a poco rising to a fortissimo climax and then receding back to pianissimo by the coda. Unlike much of Beethoven's other orchestral music, the woodwinds are the dominant voice rather than the strings.  Derivative works  Franz Liszt wrote a piano transcription in 1846, \\"Capriccio alla turca sur des motifs de Beethoven\\" (S. 388). Franz Liszt also wrote a version for orchestra and piano in 1837 entitled \\"Fantasie √ºber Motiven aus Beethovens Ruinen von Athen\\" (s.121i). Anton Rubinstein arranged a popular piano version of the march in B major, tempo Allegretto. Sergei Rachmaninoff further arranged Rubinstein's version, heard on piano roll (1928). An electronic version (also known as The Elephant Never Forgets) by electronic music pioneers Perrey and Kingsley was used as theme for the series El Chavo del Ocho broadcast on Mexican television in 1971. A shortened version was featured as cartel enforcer Lado's ringtone throughout Oliver Stone's 2012 crime thriller Savages.

Amalgamated eventually succumbed to the poor economy in the United States during the Great Depression, but Gossard continues as a division of Courtaulds in Great Britain. History Gossard was established as H. W.

In the 1920s it introduced the then-revolutionary idea of putting corset ties on the front, allowing the wearer to untie them herself. The company advertised extensively under the slogan \\"The Gossard Line of Beauty.\\" In 1928 the company was reorganized as a division of Associated Apparel Industries, Inc.

It is illustrated by Nick Sharratt.  Summary  There are seven stories about the children in a class taught by Mr Speed at Mapleton Juniors. The last story however, is about a girl called Natasha who talks through a machine, she doesn't actually go to Mapleton Juniors, she goes to a special school for disabled children. The Worry Website, a replacement of boring old Circle Time (according to Holly) is a website that is created by Mr Speed and you can only access it by Mr Speed's classroom computer. There were originally planned to be only six stories, with one being submitted by a fan through a competition. However, the winning entry (Lisa's worry) ended so sadly that Wilson was motivated to write a seventh story to give the book a happier ending.  Holly: Worry 1  Holly lives with her cute younger sister Hannah and her father. She thinks Hannah's Reception class teacher, Miss Morgan, is going to be her stepmother, as she has started dating her father. Holly wishes that her stepmother will be wicked. Holly likes Miss Morgan, but when she finds out that her father is dating with her, decides to loathe her. When they are dating, Holly spends more time with Miss Morgan, but never gives the teacher a chance to get on with her. Holly becomes foes with Miss Morgan, and then when they are going shopping together, Miss Morgan says she is getting sick of Holly behaving horrible to her. Then they both become best friends.  Greg: Worry 2  Greg sat next to Holly, his girlfriend.  Claire: Worry 3  Since she was a little girl, Claire has had nightmares after films so her mum has been very strict about what she watches. After watching the notorious 18-rated film The Monster, an extremely violent and gory film, she cannot get her mind off it when sleeping. Mr Speed gives her tips on how to get rid of her nightmares with her special skill, football, and the dream goes. She then gets a dream about her and Mr Speed playing a game of football together and defeating the monster.  William: Worry 4  William is very unintelligent in everything. Mr Speed gives him a prize for losing a spelling contest. Later Mr Speed tells a story about an eating contest he once won when he was at school, called the Enormous Mouthful Contest, and then the children have their own contest, and William wins it.  Samantha: Worry 5  Samantha's dad left her family and went off with his girlfriend. She has been very sad since then. Also she feels unpopular. Mr Speed suggests gardening which later attracts William to her and they garden very well.  Lisa: Worry 6  Lisa's dad is an alcoholic. He beats her mum up. She is very sad to have this in her life. This is the only story that does not have a resolution, with Lisa deciding not to put her real worry down and say she is starting to get spots instead. However, the final chapter (Natasha's worry) partly continues Lisa's story as well.  Natasha: Worry 7  Natasha, as said above, is disabled and uses a voice machine. She wants to be in the concert. She becomes friends with Lisa and they enter it with the worry song.

The Pact was not a military alliance, but aimed to support Australian and New Zealand interests in the postwar world, particularly in the South Pacific.http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/new-zealand-forces-in-asia/nz- military-involvement It was the \\"first clear and unmistakable statement of the two Dominion's postwar interests\\", and Alister McIntosh described it as having \\"said the right things in somewhat the wrong way\\".  Background  H. V. Evatt, the Australian Minister of External Affairs, had criticized the 1943 Cairo Declaration for disposing of Japanese territories in the northern Pacific without consultation or warning to Australia and New Zealand. Evatt wanted to establish Australia as the dominant power in the South Pacific; taking over British colonies in the western Pacific and assuming undefined security responsibilities for Portuguese Timor and the Netherlands East Indies. Given Britain's weakness, the alternative was the United States. Evatt is creditted with initiating the discussions which led to the agreement. For both nations, the pact was the first treaty negotiated independently.  Articles  The pact consisted of forty four clauses, summarised as follows: * The governments pledged to support a post-war \\"general system of world security\\" within the framework of what would become the United Nations. * The governments agreed that there should be a \\"a regional zone of defence comprising the South West and South Pacific areas shall be established and that this zone should be based on Australia and New Zealand, stretching through the arc of islands North and North East of Australia, to Western Samoa and the Cook Islands.\\" * The governments cited the trusteeship practice as \\"applicable in broad principle to all colonial territories in the Pacific\\". * The governments proposed the establishment of an advisory South Seas Regional Commission, to secure common policy between the eighteen different jurisdictions in the South Pacific and aid \\"social, economic, and political development\\" for the native populations. * The governments agreed to closer political and economic ties in the future, establishing a permanent secretariat between them. And they agreed to \\"act together in maters of common interest\\" on issues in the South Pacific. * The governments recognised the principle that use of military bases during the war does not transfer territorial claims or rights of sovereignty after the end of hostilities. * The governments agreed to act jointly with regards to post-war civil aviation.  Aftermath  In Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, the agreement was well received. However, the pact came under criticism in Australia and the United States. The United States opposed the Canberra Pact as it was made without their consultation, and the pact clearly outlined strategic boundaries in the Pacific, which the United States regarded as imposing on their sphere of interest. The prime ministers of New Zealand, Peter Fraser, and Australia, John Curtin, were subjected to a very demeaning dressing-down by Secretary of State Hull as a sign of American displeasure. In addition, New Zealand's armed forces in the Pacific theatre of operations were effectively sidelined as a result.Today in History: 21 January, nzhistory.net.nz, New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage. Secretariats were established in each Department of External Affairs, with in New Zealand Alister McIntosh telling his staff that exchanges could go through Carl Berendsen the New Zealand High Commissioner in Australia or direct to the Australian Government but \\"definitely not through D'Alton\\", the Australian High Commissioner in New Zealand (who was a political appointment). Initially the two governments \\"were in closer touch than they had ever been before, or possibly have been since\\".

Usually marked on the equipment by the manufacturer. It is a calculation of the Minimum Breaking Strength (MBS) aka Minimum Breaking Load (MBL) divided by a safety factor, usually ranging from 4 to 6 on lifting equipment. The factor can be as high as 10:1 or 10 to 1, if the equipment poses a risk to a person's life. Working Load Limit (WLL) is the maximum working load designed by the manufacturer. This load represents a force that is much less than that required to make the lifting equipment fail or yield. The WLL is calculated by dividing MBL by a safety factor (SF). An example of this would be a chain that has a MBL of 2000 lbf (8.89 kN) would have a SWL or WLL of 400 lbf (1.78 kN) if a safety factor of 5 (5:1, 5 to 1, or 1/5) is used. As such: WLL = MBL / SF SWL is no longer used to identify the maximum capacity of equipment due to it being too vague and leaving it open for legal issues.

Together, they are former one-time Chikara Campeones de Parejas, one-time PWG World Tag Team Champions and winners of PWG's 2012 Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament. Professional wrestling career =International Wrestling Syndicate= Stupefied made his debut in the Canadian wrestling promotion International Wrestling Syndicate (IWS). He quickly found a tag team partner in Player Uno as the Super Smash Brothers. The team found success as they soon won the IWS Tag Team Championship. He remained with the promotion until it folded on October 9, 2010. =Chikara (2007-2010)= Dionne as Stupefied in November 2008 Stupefied debuted in Chikara in 2007 as one half of the Super Smash Bros., for the November triple-shot weekend. Stupefied was brought back for King of Trios, and became a regular wrestler at the fed. The tag team became a fan favorite, however, they had trouble picking up wins. In August 2008 after Stupefied had repackaged himself as Player Dos, the Super Smash Bros. began a winning streak which would peak on September 21, 2008, during Chikara's debut in the Midwest, when the Super Smash Bros. ended the record-breaking reign of Incoherence (Delirious and Hallowicked), becoming the 4th Chikara Campeones de Parejas. However, their reign came to an abrupt end on October 19, 2008, at the hands of the Osirian Portal (Amasis and Ophidian) in only their first defense. On August 16, 2009, Player Dos won the seventh annual Young Lions Cup, defeating Colin Delaney in the finals. He would lose the title to Tim Donst on January 31, 2010. On October 24, 2010, Player Dos teamed with Player Uno and wrestled to date his last Chikara match with BDK members Sara Del Rey and Daizee Haze in a losing effort. =Ring of Honor (2009‚Äì2010)= Dionne as Player Dos in August 2010 On April 18, 2009, Dionne made his Ring of Honor debut as a replacement for the injured El Generico, under the ring name Generico Dos, in a six-man tag team match where he, Kevin Steen and Kenny Omega were defeated by Austin Aries, Rhett Titus and Kenny King. The Super Smash Brothers made their ROH debut as a team on May 8, 2009, at Never Say Die, losing to the team of Titus and King. On July 25 in Toronto, Ontario, at Death Before Dishonor VII Night 2 they scored an upset victory over former ROH World Tag Team Champions Kevin Steen and El Generico. On the November 9 episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling on HDNet, Dos and Uno debuted on the show in a return match, where they were defeated by Steen and Generico. On ROH Epic Encounter III Dos wrestled Kevin Steen in a losing effort. He had teamed with Uno on several HDNet episode wrestling teams like The American Wolves and The Kings of Wrestling. Since the Summer of 2010, Dos has not appeared in the company since. =Dragon Gate USA (2012)= On January 28, 2012, the Super Smash Bros. made their debut for Dragon Gate USA, defeating The Scene (Caleb Konley and Scott Reed) in a tag team match. The following day, they picked up another win over the D.U.F. (Arik Cannon and Pinkie Sanchez), after which Uno asked for a shot at the Open the United Gate Championship. The Super Smash Bros.' win streak ended on November 2, when they were defeated by Genki Horiguchi and Ryo Saito in an Open the United Gate Championship number one contenders' match. =Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (2011‚Äì2013, 2019)= The Super Smash Bros. - Player Uno (left in mask) and Stu Dos performing their signature in-ring pose On September 10, 2011, Stupefied debuted in Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) as a member of the Super Smash Bros. with Player Uno. In their debut match, they faced the RockNES Monsters (Johnny Goodtime and Johnny Yuma), a tag team with a similar video game-themed gimmick, in a losing effort. The Super Smash Bros. returned on December 10, 2011, this time losing a match against the American Wolves (Davey Richards and Eddie Edwards). The Super Smash Bros. picked up their first win in PWG on March 17, 2012, by defeating former two-time PWG World Tag Team Champions, The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson), and the RockNES Monsters in a three-way match. On April 21, the Super Smash Bros. defeated The Young Bucks in the opening round, Future Shock (Adam Cole and Kyle O'Reilly) in the semifinal, and 2 Husky Black Guys (El Generico and Willie Mack) in the final round to win the 2012 Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament and become number one contenders to the PWG World Tag Team Championship. On May 25, the Super Smash Bros. defeated The Young Bucks in a No Disqualification match to win the vacant PWG World Tag Team Championship. The Super Smash Bros. made their first successful title defense on July 21 at Threemendous III, PWG's nine-year anniversary event, where they defeated Future Shock and The Young Bucks in a three-way ladder match. On December 1 at Mystery Vortex, the Super Smash Bros. made their second successful World Tag Team Championship defense against the RockNES Monsters. Later that same event, they were defeated by the Dojo Bros (Eddie Edwards and Roderick Strong) in a non-title match. On January 12, 2013, the Super Smash Bros. lost the World Tag Team Championship to the Unbreakable F'n Machines (Brian Cage and Michael Elgin) in the opening round of the 2013 Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament. =All Elite Wrestling (2019‚Äìpresent)= Stu Grayson and Evil Uno made their surprise debut as The Dark Order at AEW Double or Nothing on May 25, 2019, appearing at the conclusion of the match between Best Friends and Ang√©lico and Jack Evans. After the match was over, the lights went out and when they came back on, Grayson and Uno were in the ring. The lights went out a second time and when they came back on, masked henchmen surrounded the ring. The Order then attacked all four men. After the attack, the lights went out again and they disappeared. Professional wrestling style and persona In Chikara, Stupefied based his gimmick, moveset, and attire around video games, more specifically games for the NES and SNES consoles. One of his trademarks was his tights, which had a pocket fashioned around an NES console on one side; for instance, if the Karate Kid game cartridge was inserted into the slot, he would start doing game-related mannerisms. In recent years, he has switched to regular tights. Personal life Dionne owns a small flooring company.

After playing five seasons in the minor leagues, he became a minor league coach with several organizations. He had first joined the New York Yankees organization in 1996, spending three seasons as the pitching coach at Triple-A Columbus (1996‚Äì98). He spent three seasons as a major league pitching coach with the Chicago Cubs (2000-01) and the Texas Rangers (2002). Acosta and another minor league coach were killed in an automobile accident while working for the Yankees in the Dominican Republic.  Biography  Acosta was born on March 21, 1957 in Portales, New Mexico. He played in the minors from 1978 to 1982. He debuted with the Helena Phillies, going 0‚Äì1 with a 9.00 ERA in five appearances. In 1979, he pitched for the Peninsula Pilots and had a career year, with a 10‚Äì7, 3.04 season. He finished 9th in the Carolina League in ERA. Returning to Peninsula in 1980, he only pitched in 9 games, going 2‚Äì0 with a 3.55 ERA, 2 saves and a shutout. He resurfaced in the 1982 Mexican Baseball League, posting a 0‚Äì3, 6.75 record for the Plataneros de Tabasco to complete his career. Acosta began coaching in the Texas Rangers organization with the Butte Copper Kings in 1988. He coached the Gastonia Rangers (1989), GCL Rangers (1990, 1993), Tulsa Drillers (1991) and Oklahoma City 89ers (1992). Moving to the Chicago Cubs' organization, he then coached the Daytona Cubs (1994) and GCL Cubs (1995). Next he coached the Columbus Clippers (1996‚Äì1998) for the New York Yankees. He managed the Cubs Class A Lansing Lugnuts in the Midwest League in 1999, and was then promoted to the major league level, serving as the pitching coach for the Chicago Cubs. Acosta was with the Cubs in 2000 and 2001; in his second year, the team's pitching staff reduced its ERA by more than a run and recorded a league-high strikeout total. However, Acosta did not get along well with manager Don Baylor; he resigned after the 2001 season and served as the pitching coach for the Texas Rangers in 2002. Acosta served as international coordinator of instruction as well as manager of the Gulf Coast Yankees of the Yankees' Gulf Coast team in Tampa since 2004, guiding the team to the Gulf Coast League championship in his final two seasons. Acosta resided in Florida. He and a colleague, Humberto Trejo, were killed in an automobile accident on April 19, 2006, while working in the Dominican Republic with the New York Yankees minor league system. Acosta had a wife and three children. His son, Ryan, was drafted by the Cubs in the 2007 amateur draft.

Description The pattern is made up of three candles: normally a long bearish candle, followed by a short bullish or bearish doji, which is then followed by a long bullish candle. To have a valid Morning Star formation, most traders look for the top of the third candle to be at least halfway up the body of the first candle in the pattern. Black candles indicate falling prices, and white candles indicate rising prices. Interpretation When found in a downtrend, this pattern can be an indication that a reversal in the price trend is going to take place. What the pattern represents from a supply and demand point of view is a lot of selling in the period of the first black candle. Then, a period of lower trading with a reduced range, which indicates indecision in the market, forms the second candle. This is followed by a large white candle, which represents buyers taking control of the market. As the Morning Star is a three-candle pattern, traders often don't wait for confirmation from a fourth candle before they buy the stock. High volumes on the third trading day confirm the pattern. Traders look at the size of the candles for an indication of the size of the potential reversal. The larger the white and black candle, and the higher the white candle moves in relation to the black candle, the larger the potential reversal. The chart below illustrates. The Morning Star pattern is circled. Note the high trading volumes on the third day. The opposite occurring at the top of an uptrend is called an evening star.

Unable to reach any airport for an emergency landing, pilots Chesley Sullenberger and Jeffrey Skiles glided the plane to a ditching in the Hudson River off Midtown Manhattan.  All 155 people on board were rescued by nearby boats, with few serious injuries. This water landing of a powerless jet liner became known as the \\"Miracle on the Hudson\\",  * and a National Transportation Safety Board official described it as \\"the most successful ditching in aviation history\\". The Board rejected the notion that the pilot could have avoided ditching by returning to LaGuardia or diverting to nearby Teterboro Airport. The pilots and flight attendants were awarded the Master's Medal of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators in recognition of their \\"heroic and unique aviation achievement\\". Background N106US, the aircraft involved in the accident, at LaGuardia eight years earlier, while operating for US Airways Shuttle. On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 with call sign 'Cactus 1549' was scheduled to fly from New York City's LaGuardia Airport (LGA) to Charlotte Douglas (CLT), with direct onward service to Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport. The aircraft was an Airbus A320-214 powered by two GE Aviation/Snecma-designed CFM56-5B4/P turbofan engines. The captain and pilot in command was 57-year-old Chesley B. Sullenberger, a former fighter pilot who had been an airline pilot since leaving the United States Air Force in 1980. At the time, he had logged 19,663 total flight hours, including 4,765 in an A320; he was also a glider pilot and expert on aviation safety.  First officer Jeffrey Skiles, 49,  had accrued 20,727 career flight hours with 37 in an A320, but this was his first A320 assignment as pilot flying. There were 150 passengers and three flight attendants on board. Accident =Takeoff and bird strike= The flight was cleared for takeoff to the northeast from LaGuardia's Runway 4 at 3:24:56 pm Eastern Standard Time (20:24:56 UTC). With Skiles in control, the crew made its first report after becoming airborne at 3:25:51 as being at and climbing. The weather at 2:51 p.m. was visibility with broken clouds at , wind from 290¬∞; an hour later it was few clouds at , wind from 310¬∞. At 3:26:37 Sullenberger remarked to Skiles: \\"What a view of the Hudson today.\\" alt=The aircraft headed approximately north after takeoff, then wheeled anti-clockwise to follow the Hudson southwards. At 3:27:11 during climbout, the plane struck a flock of Canada geese at an altitude of about north-northwest of LaGuardia. The pilots' view was filled with the large birds;  passengers and crew heard very loud bangs and saw flames from the engines, followed by silence and an odor of fuel.  Realizing that both engines had shut down, Sullenberger took control while Skiles worked the checklist for engine restart. The aircraft slowed but continued to climb for a further 19 seconds, reaching about at an airspeed of about , then began a glide descent, accelerating to at 3:28:10 as it descended through . At 3:27:33, Sullenberger radioed a mayday call to New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON): \\"... this is Cactus 1539 [siccorrect call sign was Cactus 1549], hit birds. We've lost thrust on both engines. We're turning back towards LaGuardia\\". Air traffic controller Patrick Harten told LaGuardia's tower to hold all departures, and directed Sullenberger back to Runway 13. Sullenberger responded, \\"Unable\\". Sullenberger asked controllers for landing options in New Jersey, mentioning Teterboro Airport. Permission was given for Teterboro's Runway 1, Sullenberger initially responded \\"Yes\\", but then: \\"We can't do it ... We're gonna be in the Hudson\\". The aircraft passed less than above the George Washington Bridge. Sullenberger commanded over the cabin address system, \\"Brace for impact\\", and the flight attendants relayed the command to passengers. Meanwhile, air traffic controllers asked the Coast Guard to caution vessels in the Hudson and ask them to prepare to assist with rescue. =Ditching and evacuation= Coast Guard video of the water landing, and rescue About ninety seconds later, at 3:31 pm, the plane made an unpowered ditching, descending southwards at about into the middle of the North River section of the Hudson tidal estuary, at on the New York side of the state line, roughly opposite West 50th Street (near the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum) in Manhattan and Port Imperial in Weehawken, New Jersey. Flight attendants compared the ditching to a \\"hard landing\\" with \\"one impact, no bounce, then a gradual deceleration.\\" The ebb tide then began to take the plane southward. Sullenberger opened the cockpit door and gave the order to evacuate. The crew began evacuating the passengers through the four overwing window exits and into an inflatable slide/raft deployed from the front right passenger door (the front left slide failed to operate, so the manual inflation handle was pulled). The evacuation was made more difficult by the fact that someone opened the rear left door, allowing more water to enter the plane; whether this was a flight attendant or a passenger is disputed. Water was also entering through a hole in the fuselage and through cargo doors that had come open, so as the water rose the attendant urged passengers to move forward by climbing over seats. One passenger was in a wheelchair.  Finally, Sullenberger walked the cabin twice to confirm it was empty.  Video beginning 20 minutes after ditching, with numerous ferries and rescue boats surrounding the aircraft The air and water temperatures were about and , respectively. Some evacuees waited for rescue knee-deep in water on the partially submerged slides, some wearing life-vests. Others stood on the wings or, fearing an explosion, swam away from the plane. One passenger, after helping with the evacuation, found the wing so crowded that he jumped into the river and swam to a boat. =Rescue= Sullenberger had ditched near boats, which facilitated rescue. Two NY Waterway ferries arrived within minutes  and began taking people aboard using a Jason's cradle; numerous other boats, including from the US Coast Guard, were quickly on scene as well. Sullenberger advised the ferry crews to rescue those on the wings first, as they were in more jeopardy than those on the slides, which detached to become life rafts. The last person was taken from the plane at 3:55 pm. About 140 New York City firefighters responded to nearby docks , as did police, helicopters, and various vessels and divers. Other agencies provided medical help on the Weehawken side of the river, where most passengers were taken. Boats surround the tail of the sunken plane, visible just above the water line. Aftermath The partially submerged aircraft tied up alongside Battery Park City Among the people on board there were 95 minor injuries and 5 serious, including a deep laceration in flight attendant Doreen Welsh's leg. Seventy-eight people were treated, mostly for minor injuries and hypothermia; twenty-four passengers and two rescuers were treated at hospitals, with two passengers kept overnight. One passenger now wears glasses because of eye damage from jet fuel. No pets were being carried on the flight. Each passenger later received a letter of apology, $5,000 in compensation for lost baggage (and $5,000 more if they could demonstrate larger losses) and refund of the ticket price.  In May 2009, they received any belongings that had been recovered. In addition, they reported offers of $10,000 each in return for agreeing not to sue US Airways. Many passengers and rescuers later experienced post-traumatic stress symptoms such as sleeplessness, flashbacks, and panic attacks; some began an email support group. Patrick Harten, the controller who had worked the flight, said that \\"the hardest, most traumatic part of the entire event was when it was over\\", and that he was \\"gripped by raw moments of shock and grief\\". In an effort to prevent similar accidents, officials captured and gassed 1,235 Canada geese at 17 locations across New York City in mid-2009 and coated 1,739 goose eggs with oil to smother the developing goslings. To date (2017) 70,000 birds have been intentionally slaughtered in NYC as a result of the Hudson ditching. Investigation The plane being recovered from the river during the night of January 17 The partially submerged plane was moored to a pier near the World Financial Center in Lower Manhattan, roughly downstream from the ditching location. The left engine, detached by the ditching, was recovered from the riverbed. On January 17 the aircraft was barged  to New Jersey. The initial National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) evaluation that the plane had lost thrust after a bird strike  * was confirmed by analysis of the cockpit voice and flight data recorders. Two days earlier the plane had experienced a less severe compressor stall,  but the affected engine was restarted. A faulty temperature sensor was replaced, and inspection verified the engine had not been damaged in that incident. On January 21, the NTSB found evidence of soft-body damage in the right engine along with organic debris including a feather.  The left engine also evidenced soft body impact, with: \\"dents on both the spinner and inlet lip of the engine cowling. Five booster inlet guide vanes are fractured and eight outlet guide vanes are missing.\\" Both engines, missing large portions of their housings, were sent to the manufacturer for examination. On January 31, the plane was moved to Kearny, New Jersey. The bird remains were later identified by DNA testing to be Canada geese, which typically weigh more than engines are designed to withstand ingesting. Because the plane was assembled in France, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA; the European counterpart of the FAA) and the Bureau d'Enqu√™tes et d'Analyses pour la S√©curit√© de l'Aviation Civile (BEA; the French counterpart of the NTSB) joined the investigation, with technical assistance from Airbus and GE Aviation/Snecma, respectively the manufacturers of the airframe and the engines.  * Goose feather found in the left engine The NTSB used flight simulators to test the possibility that the flight could have returned safely to LaGuardia or diverted to Teterboro; only seven of the thirteen simulated returns to La Guardia succeeded, and only one of the two to Teterboro. Furthermore, the NTSB report called these simulations unrealistic: \\"The immediate turn made by the pilots during the simulations did not reflect or account for real-world considerations, such as the time delay required to recognize the bird strike and decide on a course of action.\\" A further simulation, in which a 35-second delay was inserted to allow for those, crashed. In testimony before the NTSB, Sullenberger maintained that there had been no time to bring the plane to any airport, and that attempting to do so would likely have killed those onboard and more on the ground. The Board ultimately ruled that Sullenberger had made the correct decision, reasoning that the checklist for dual-engine failure is designed for higher altitudes, when pilots have more time to deal with the situation, and that while simulations showed that the plane might have just barely made it back to LaGuardia, those scenarios assumed an instant decision to do so, with no time allowed for assessing the situation.  On May 4, 2010 the NTSB issued its final report, which identified the probable cause as \\"the ingestion of large birds into each engine, which resulted in an almost total loss of thrust in both engines.\\" The final report credited the outcome to four factors: good decision-making and teamwork by the cockpit crew (including decisions to immediately turn on the APU and to ditch in the Hudson); the fact that the A320 is certified for extended overwater operation (and hence carried life vests and additional raft/slides) even though not required for that route; the performance of the flight crew during the evacuation; and the proximity of working vessels to the ditching site. Contributing factors were good visibility and a fast response from the ferry operators and emergency responders. The report made 34 recommendations, including that engines be tested for resistance to bird strikes at low speeds; development of checklists for dual-engine failures at low altitude, and changes to checklist design in general \\"to minimize the risk of flight crewmembers becoming stuck in an inappropriate checklist or portion of a checklist\\"; improved pilot training for water landings; provision of life vests on all flights regardless of route, and changes to the locations of vests and other emergency equipment; research into improved wildlife management, and technical innovations on aircraft, to reduce bird strikes; research into possible changes in passenger brace positions; and research into \\"methods of overcoming passengers' inattention\\" during preflight safety briefings. Author and pilot William Langewiesche asserted that insufficient credit was given to the A320's fly-by- wire design, by which the pilot uses a side-stick to make control inputs to the flight control computers. The computers then impose adjustments and limits of their own to keep the plane stable, which the pilot cannot override even in an emergency. This design allowed the pilots of Flight 1549 to concentrate on engine restart and deciding the course, without the burden of manually adjusting the glidepath to reduce the plane's rate of descent. However, Sullenberger said that these computer-imposed limits also prevented him from achieving the optimum landing flare for the ditching, which would have softened the impact. Crew awards and honors An NTSB board member called the ditching \\"the most successful... in aviation history. These people knew what they were supposed to do and they did it and as a result, no lives were lost.\\" New York State Governor David Paterson called the incident \\"a Miracle on the Hudson.\\"  U.S. President George W. Bush said he was \\"inspired by the skill and heroism of the flight crew,\\" and praised the emergency responders and volunteers. President-elect Barack Obama said that everyone was proud of Sullenberger's \\"heroic and graceful job in landing the damaged aircraft.\\" He thanked the crew, whom he invited to his inauguration five days later.  The Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators awarded the crew the rarely bestowed Master's Medal on January 22, 2009 for outstanding aviation achievement, at the discretion of the Master of the Guild. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg presented the crew with the Keys to the City, and Sullenberger with a replacement copy of a library book lost on the flight, Sidney Dekker's Just Culture: Balancing Safety and Accountability. Rescuers received Certificates of Honor. The crew received a standing ovation at the Super Bowl XLIII on February 1, 2009, and Sullenberger threw the ceremonial first pitch of the 2009 Major League Baseball season for the San Francisco Giants. His Giants jersey was inscribed with the name \\"Sully\\" and the number 155the count of people aboard the plane. On July 28, passengers Dave Sanderson and Barry Leonard organized a thank you luncheon for emergency responders from Hudson County, New Jersey, on the shores of Palisades Medical Center in North Bergen, New Jersey, where 57 passengers had been brought following their rescue. Present were members of the U.S. Coast Guard, North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue, NY Waterway Ferries, the American Red Cross, Weehawken Volunteer First Aid, the Weehawken Police Department, West New York E.M.S., North Bergen E.M.S., the Hudson County Office of Emergency Management, the New Jersey E.M.S. Task Force, the Guttenberg Police Department, McCabe Ambulance, the Harrison Police Department, and doctors and nurses who treated survivors.  Sullenberger was named Grand Marshal for the 2010 Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California. N106US on display at Carolinas Aviation Museum In August 2010, aeronautical chart publisher Jeppesen issued a humorous approach plate titled \\"Hudson Miracle APCH,\\" dedicated to the five crew of Flight 1549 and annotated \\"Presented with Pride and Gratitude from your friends at Jeppesen.\\" Sullenberger retired on March 3, 2010, after thirty years with US Airways and its predecessor, Pacific Southwest Airlines. At the end of his final flight he was reunited with Skiles and a number of the passengers from Flight 1549. N106US, the accident aircraft, was moved to a salvage yard in New Jersey and put up for auction a week after the accident, but remained without takers for over two years. In 2011, it was purchased by the Carolinas Aviation Museum in Charlotte, North Carolina, and reassembled, minus the engines, in the museum's main hangar, where it is currently on display.   In 2013, the entire crew was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. . Media The ditching was recorded by several closed-circuit television cameras. Television reports and documentaries produced soon afterwards contained extensive video of the ditching and rescue, and recorded interviews with the aircrew, passengers, rescuers, and other key participants. Sullenberger's 2009 memoir, Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters was adapted into a feature film Sully, directed by Clint Eastwood. It starred Tom Hanks as Sullenberger and Aaron Eckhart as co-pilot Jeff Skiles. It was released by Warner Bros. on September 9, 2016.

Description Size of various Alvarezsaurids compared to a human, Ceratonykus in red Ceratonykus was a long-legged dinosaur that appears to have been adapted for running in the desert. It was very small, with a skull length of . In 2010 Paul estimated its length at 60 cm (2 ft), its weight at 1 kg (2.2 lbs). In 2016 Molina-P√©rez and Larramendi gave a length of 75 cm (2.5 ft) and a weight of 760 grams (1.68 lbs) with a hip height of 30 cm (1 ft). Originally thought to be one of the earliest members of flightless birds, alvarezsaurids have recently been regarded as more basal theropods. Skeletal remains suggest that they had tiny but stout forelimbs and compact birdlike hands. The skeletal structure also suggests that this dinosaur possessed significant breast and arm muscles that were likely adapted for tearing and digging. They had elongate jaws with minute teeth and a tubular snout that suggests they could have been adapted to feed on insects such as termites.V. R. Alifanov and R. Barsbold. 2009.

The Spanish conquest of the Maya was a protracted conflict during the Spanish colonisation of the Americas, in which the Spanish conquistadores and their allies gradually incorporated the territory of the Late Postclassic Maya states and polities into the colonial Viceroyalty of New Spain. The Maya occupied a territory that is now incorporated into the modern countries of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras and El Salvador; the conquest began in the early 16th century and is generally considered to have ended in 1697. The conquest of the Maya was hindered by their politically fragmented state. Spanish and native tactics and technology differed greatly. The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns; they viewed the taking of prisoners as a hindrance to outright victory, whereas the Maya prioritised the capture of live prisoners and of booty. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic; in response to the use of Spanish cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits and lining them with wooden stakes. Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the European conquerors. Spanish weaponry included broadswords, rapiers, lances, pikes, halberds, crossbows, matchlocks and light artillery. Maya warriors fought with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows, stones, and wooden swords with inset obsidian blades, and wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Maya lacked key elements of Old World technology such as a functional wheel, horses, iron, steel, and gunpowder; they were also extremely susceptible to Old World diseases, against which they had no resistance. Before the conquest, Maya territory contained a number of competing kingdoms. Many conquistadors viewed the Maya as \\"infidels\\" who needed to be forcefully converted and pacified, disregarding the achievements of their civilization. The first contact between the Maya and European explorers came in 1502, during the fourth voyage of Christopher Columbus, when his brother Bartholomew encountered a canoe. Several Spanish expeditions followed in 1517 and 1519, making landfall on various parts of the Yucat√°n coast. The Spanish conquest of the Maya was a prolonged affair; the Maya kingdoms resisted integration into the Spanish Empire with such tenacity that their defeat took almost two centuries. The Itza Maya and other lowland groups in the Pet√©n Basin were first contacted by Hern√°n Cort√©s in 1525, but remained independent and hostile to the encroaching Spanish until 1697, when a concerted Spanish assault led by Mart√≠n de Urz√∫a y Arizmendi finally defeated the last independent Maya kingdom. Geography Satellite view of the Yucat√°n Peninsula The Maya civilization occupied a wide territory that included southeastern Mexico and northern Central America; this area included the entire Yucat√°n Peninsula, and all of the territory now incorporated into the modern countries of Guatemala and Belize, as well as the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador. In Mexico, the Maya occupied territory now incorporated into the states of Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche, Quintana Roo and Yucat√°n. The Yucat√°n Peninsula is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the east and by the Gulf of Mexico to the north and west. It incorporates the modern Mexican states of Yucat√°n, Quintana Roo and Campeche, the eastern portion of the state of Tabasco, most of the Guatemalan department of Pet√©n, and all of Belize. Most of the peninsula is formed by a vast plain with few hills or mountains and a generally low coastline. The northwestern and northern portions of the Yucat√°n Peninsula experience lower rainfall than the rest of the peninsula; these regions feature highly porous limestone bedrock resulting in less surface water. In contrast, the northeastern portion of the peninsula is characterised by forested swamplands. The northern portion of the peninsula lacks rivers, except for the Champot√≥n River ‚Äì all other rivers are located in the south. The Pet√©n region consists of densely forested low-lying limestone plain, crossed by low east‚Äìwest oriented ridges and is characterised by a variety of forest and soil types; water sources include generally small rivers and low-lying seasonal swamps known as bajos. A chain of fourteen lakes runs across the central drainage basin of Pet√©n. The largest lake is Lake Pet√©n Itza; it measures . A broad savannah extends south of the central lakes. To the north of the lakes region bajos become more frequent, interspersed with forest. To the south the plain gradually rises towards the Guatemalan Highlands. Dense forest covers northern Pet√©n and Belize, most of Quintana Roo, southern Campeche and a portion of the south of Yucat√°n state. Further north, the vegetation turns to lower forest consisting of dense scrub. Chiapas occupies the extreme southeast of Mexico; it possesses of Pacific coastline. Chiapas features two principal highland regions; to the south is the Sierra Madre de Chiapas and in central Chiapas are the Monta√±as Centrales (Central Highlands). They are separated by the Depresi√≥n Central, containing the drainage basin of the Grijalva River, featuring a hot climate with moderate rainfall. The Sierra Madre highlands gain altitude from west to east, with the highest mountains near the Guatemalan border. The Central Highlands of Chiapas rise sharply to the north of the Grijalva, to a maximum altitude of , then descend gradually towards the Yucat√°n Peninsula. They are cut by deep valleys running parallel to the Pacific coast, and feature a complex drainage system that feeds both the Grijalva and the Lacant√∫n River. At the eastern end of the Central Highlands is the Lacandon Forest, this region is largely mountainous with lowland tropical plains at its easternmost extreme. The littoral zone of Soconusco lies to the south of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre. Maya region before the conquest Map of the approximate area covered by the Maya civilization at its maximum extent The Maya had never been unified as a single empire, but by the time the Spanish arrived Maya civilization was thousands of years old and had already seen the rise and fall of great cities. =Yucat√°n= The first large Maya cities developed in the Pet√©n Basin in the far south of the Yucat√°n Peninsula as far back as the Middle Preclassic (c. 600‚Äì350 BC), and Pet√©n formed the heartland of the ancient Maya civilization during the Classic period (c. AD 250‚Äì900). The 16th-century Maya provinces of northern Yucat√°n are likely to have evolved out of polities of the Maya Classic period. The great cities that dominated Pet√©n had fallen into ruin by the beginning of the 10th century with the onset of the Classic Maya collapse. A significant Maya presence remained in Pet√©n into the Postclassic period after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources. In the early 16th century, the Yucat√°n Peninsula was still dominated by the Maya civilization. It was divided into a number of independent provinces that shared a common culture but varied in their internal sociopolitical organisation. When the Spanish discovered Yucat√°n, the provinces of Mani and Sotuta were two of the most important polities in the region. They were mutually hostile; the Xiu Maya of Mani allied themselves with the Spanish, while the Cocom Maya of Sotuta became the implacable enemies of the European colonisers. At the time of conquest, polities in the northern Yucat√°n peninsula included Mani, Cehpech and Chakan; further east along the north coast were Ah Kin Chel, Cupul, and Chikinchel. Ecab, Uaymil, Chetumal all bordered on the Caribbean Sea. Cochuah was also in the eastern half of the peninsula. Tases, Hocaba and Sotuta were all landlocked provinces. Chanputun (modern Champot√≥n) was on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, as was Acalan. In the southern portion of the peninsula, a number of polities occupied the Pet√©n Basin. The Kejache occupied a territory between the Pet√©n lakes and what is now Campeche. The Cholan Maya-speaking Lakandon (not to be confused with the modern inhabitants of Chiapas by that name) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning eastern Chiapas and southwestern Pet√©n. The Lakandon had a fierce reputation amongst the Spanish. Before their defeat in 1697 the Itza controlled or influenced much of Pet√©n and parts of Belize. The Itza were warlike, and their capital was Nojpet√©n, an island city upon Lake Pet√©n Itz√°. The Kowoj were the second in importance; they were hostile towards their Itza neighbours. The Kowoj were located around the eastern Pet√©n lakes. The Yalain occupied a territory that extended eastwards to Tipuj in Belize. Other groups in Pet√©n are less well known, and their precise territorial extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the Chinamita, the Icaiche, the Kejache, the Lakandon Ch ºol, the Manche Ch ºol, and the Mopan. =Maya Highlands= alt=Guatemala is situated between the Pacific Ocean to the south and the Caribbean Sea to the northeast. The broad band of the Sierra Madre mountains sweeps down from Mexico in the west, across southern and central Guatemala and into El Salvador and Honduras to the east. The north is dominated by a broad lowland plain that extends eastwards into Belize and north into Mexico. A narrower plain separates the Sierra Madre from the Pacific Ocean to the south. What is now the Mexican state of Chiapas was divided roughly equally between the non-Maya Zoque in the western half and Maya in the eastern half; this distribution continued up to the time of the Spanish conquest. On the eve of the conquest the highlands of Guatemala were dominated by several powerful Maya states. In the centuries preceding the arrival of the Spanish the K ºiche º had carved out a small empire covering a large part of the western Guatemalan Highlands and the neighbouring Pacific coastal plain. However, in the late 15th century the Kaqchikel rebelled against their former K ºiche º allies and founded a new kingdom to the southeast with Iximche as its capital. In the decades before the Spanish invasion the Kaqchikel kingdom had been steadily eroding the kingdom of the K ºiche º. Other highland groups included the Tz ºutujil around Lake Atitl√°n, the Mam in the western highlands and the Poqomam in the eastern highlands. The central highlands of Chiapas were occupied by a number of Maya peoples, including the Tzotzil, who were divided into a number of provinces; the province of Chamula was said to have five small towns grouped closely together. The Tojolabal held territory around Comit√°n. The Coxoh Maya held territory in the upper reaches of the Grijalva drainage, near the Guatemalan border, and were probably a subgroup of the Tojolabal. =Pacific lowlands= Soconusco was an important communication route between the central Mexican highlands and Central America. It had been subjugated by the Aztec Triple Alliance at the end of the 15th century, under the emperor Ahuizotl, and paid tribute in cacao. The highland K ºiche º dominated the Pacific coastal plain of western Guatemala. The eastern portion of the Pacific plain was occupied by the non-Maya Pipil and Xinca. Background to the conquest Christopher Columbus discovered the New World for the Kingdom of Castile and Leon in 1492. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. In the first decades after the discovery of the new lands, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the king of Spain via the Council of the Indies. Weaponry, strategies and tactics The conquistadors were all volunteers, the majority of whom did not receive a fixed salary but instead a portion of the spoils of victory, in the form of precious metals, land grants and provision of native labour. Many of the Spanish were already experienced soldiers who had previously campaigned in Europe. In addition to Spaniards, the invasion force probably included dozens of armed African slaves and freemen. The politically fragmented state of the Yucat√°n Peninsula at the time of conquest hindered the Spanish invasion, since there was no central political authority to be overthrown. However, the Spanish exploited this fragmentation by taking advantage of pre-existing rivalries between polities. Among Mesoamerican peoples the capture of prisoners was a priority, while to the Spanish such taking of prisoners was a hindrance to outright victory. The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones (also known as congregaciones). Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases; coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were also vulnerable to pirate attacks. =Spanish weapons and tactics= Spanish weaponry and tactics differed greatly from that of the indigenous peoples. This included the Spanish use of crossbows, firearms (including muskets, arquebuses and cannon), war dogs and war horses. Horses had never been encountered by the Maya before, and their use gave the mounted conquistador an overwhelming advantage over his unmounted opponent, allowing the rider to strike with greater force while simultaneously making him less vulnerable to attack. The mounted conquistador was highly manoeuvrable and this allowed groups of combatants to quickly displace themselves across the battlefield. The horse itself was not passive, and could buffet the enemy combatant. The crossbows and early firearms were unwieldy and deteriorated rapidly in the field, often becoming unusable after a few weeks of campaigning due to the effects of the climate. The Maya lacked key elements of Old World technology, such as the use of iron and steel and functional wheels. The use of steel swords was perhaps the greatest technological advantage held by the Spanish, although the deployment of cavalry helped them to rout indigenous armies on occasion. The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the quilted cotton armour of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour. The conquistadors applied a more effective military organisation and strategic awareness than their opponents, allowing them to deploy troops and supplies in a way that increased the Spanish advantage. The 16th-century Spanish conquistadors were armed with one- and two-handed broadswords, lances, pikes, rapiers, halberds, crossbows, matchlocks and light artillery. Crossbows were easier to maintain than matchlocks, especially in the humid tropical climate of the Caribbean region that included much of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. In Guatemala the Spanish routinely fielded indigenous allies; at first these were Nahua brought from the recently conquered Mexico, later they also included Maya. It is estimated that for every Spaniard on the field of battle, there were at least 10 native auxiliaries. Sometimes there were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and the participation of these Mesoamerican allies was decisive. =Native weapons and tactics= Maya armies were highly disciplined, and warriors participated in regular training exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male was available for military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders. Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; the needs of their crops usually came before warfare. Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder. Maya warriors entered battle against the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones. They wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Pet√©n Maya as bows and arrows, fire- sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins. The Maya had historically employed ambush and raiding as their preferred tactic, and its employment against the Spanish proved troublesome for the Europeans. In response to the use of cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits on the roads, lining them with fire-hardened stakes and camouflaging them with grass and weeds, a tactic that according to the Kaqchikel killed many horses. Impact of Old World diseases Europeans-introduced smallpox & devastated the indigenous populations of the Americas Epidemics incidentally introduced by the Spanish included smallpox, measles and influenza. These diseases, together with typhus and yellow fever, had a major impact on Maya populations. The Old World diseases brought with the Spanish and against which the indigenous New World peoples had no resistance were a deciding factor in the conquest; they decimated populations before battles were even fought. It is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact. A single soldier arriving in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and initiated the devastating plagues that swept through the native populations of the Americas. Modern estimates of native population decline vary from 75% to 90% mortality. Maya written histories suggest that smallpox was rapidly transmitted throughout the Maya area the same year that it arrived in central Mexico. Among the most deadly diseases were the aforementioned smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis. Modern knowledge of the impact of these diseases on populations with no prior exposure suggests that 33‚Äì50% of the population of the Maya highlands perished. These diseases swept through Yucat√°n in the 1520s and 1530s, with periodic recurrences throughout the 16th century. By the late 16th century, malaria had arrived in the region, and yellow fever was first reported in the mid-17th century. Mortality was high, with approximately 50% of the population of some Yucatec Maya settlements being wiped out. Those areas of the peninsula that experience damper conditions became rapidly depopulated after the conquest with the introduction of malaria and other waterborne parasites. The native population of the northeastern portion of the peninsula was almost completely eliminated within fifty years of the conquest. Soconusco also suffered catastrophic population collapse, with an estimated 90‚Äì95% drop. In the south, conditions conducive to the spread of malaria existed throughout Pet√©n and Belize. In Tabasco the population of approximately 30,000 was reduced by an estimated 90%, with measles, smallpox, catarrhs, dysentery and fevers being the main culprits. At the time of the fall of Nojpet√©n in 1697, there are estimated to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Pet√©n Itz√°, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war.  First encounters: 1502 and 1511  Bartholomew Columbus came across a Yucatec Maya canoe in the Gulf of Honduras On 30 July 1502, during his fourth voyage, Christopher Columbus arrived at Guanaja, one of the Bay Islands off the coast of Honduras. He sent his brother Bartholomew to scout the island. As Bartholomew explored, a large trading canoe approached. Bartholomew Columbus boarded the canoe, and found it was a Maya trading vessel from Yucat√°n, carrying well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo. The Europeans looted whatever took their interest from amongst the cargo and seized the elderly captain to serve as an interpreter; the canoe was then allowed to continue on its way. This was the first recorded contact between Europeans and the Maya. It is likely that news of the piratical strangers in the Caribbean passed along the Maya trade routes ‚Äì the first prophecies of bearded invaders sent by Kukulkan, the northern Maya feathered serpent god, were probably recorded around this time, and in due course passed into the books of Chilam Balam. In 1511 the Spanish caravel Santa Mar√≠a de la Barca sailed along the Central American coast under the command of Pedro de Valdivia. The ship foundered upon a reef somewhere off Jamaica. There were just twenty survivors from the wreck, including Captain Valdivia, Ger√≥nimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero. They set themselves adrift in one of the ship's boats and after thirteen days, during which half of the survivors died, they made landfall upon the coast of Yucat√°n. There they were seized by a Halach Uinik, a Maya lord. Captain Vildivia was sacrificed with four of his companions, and their flesh was served at a feast. Aguilar and Guerrero were held prisoner and fattened for killing, together with five or six of their shipmates. Aguilar and Guerrero managed to escape their captors and fled to a neighbouring lord, who took them prisoner and kept them as slaves. After a time, Gonzalo Guerrero was passed as a slave to the lord Nachan Can of Chetumal. Guerrero became completely Mayanised and by 1514 Guerrero had achieved the rank of nacom, a war leader who served against Nachan Can's enemies. Exploration of the Yucat√°n coast, 1517‚Äì1519 =Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, 1517= In 1517, Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba set sail from Cuba with a small fleet. The expedition sailed west from Cuba for three weeks before sighting the northeastern tip of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The ships could not put in close to the shore due to the coastal shallows. However, they could see a Maya city some two leagues inland. The following morning, ten large canoes rowed out to meet the Spanish ships, and over thirty Maya boarded the vessels and mixed freely with the Spaniards. The following day the conquistadors put ashore. As the Spanish party advanced along a path towards the city, they were ambushed by Maya warriors. Thirteen Spaniards were injured by arrows in the first assault, but the conquistadors regrouped and repulsed the Maya attack. They advanced to a small plaza upon the outskirts of the city. When the Spaniards ransacked nearby temples they found a number of low-grade gold items, which filled them with enthusiasm. The expedition captured two Mayas to be used as interpreters and retreated to the ships. The Spanish discovered that the Maya arrowheads were fashioned from flint and tended to shatter on impact, causing infected wounds and a slow death; two of the wounded Spaniards died from the arrow- wounds inflicted in the ambush. Over the next fifteen days the fleet followed the coastline west, and then south. The expedition was now perilously short of fresh water, and shore parties searching for water were left dangerously exposed because the ships could not pull close to the shore due to the shallows. On 23 February 1517, the Spanish spotted the Maya city of Campeche. A large contingent put ashore to fill their water casks. They were approached by about fifty finely dressed and unarmed Indians while the water was being loaded into the boats; they questioned the Spaniards as to their purpose by means of signs. The Spanish party then accepted an invitation to enter the city. Once inside the city, the Maya leaders made it clear that the Spanish would be killed if they did not withdraw immediately. The Spanish party retreated in defensive formation to the safety of the ships. After ten more days, the ships spotted an inlet close to Champot√≥n, and a landing party discovered fresh water. Armed Maya warriors approached from the city, and communication was attempted with signs. Night fell by the time the water casks had been filled and the attempts at communication concluded. By sunrise the Spanish had been surrounded by a sizeable army. The massed Maya warriors launched an assault and all of the Spanish party received wounds in the frantic melee that followed, including Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba. The Spanish regrouped and forced passage to the shore, where their discipline collapsed and a frantic scramble for the boats ensued, leaving the Spanish vulnerable to the pursuing Maya warriors who waded into the sea behind them. By the end of the battle, the Spanish had lost over fifty men, more than half their number, and five more men died from their wounds in the following days. The battle had lasted only an hour. They were now far from help and low on supplies; too many men had been lost and injured to sail all three ships back to Cuba, so one was abandoned. The ship's pilot then steered a course for Cuba via Florida, and Hern√°ndez de Cord√≥ba wrote a report to Governor Diego Vel√°zquez describing the voyage and, most importantly, the discovery of gold. Hern√°ndez died soon after from his wounds. =Juan de Grijalva, 1518= Diego Vel√°zquez, the governor of Cuba, was enthused by Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba's report of gold in Yucat√°n. He organised a new expedition and placed his nephew Juan de Grijalva in command over his four ships. The small fleet left Cuba in April 1518, and made its first landfall upon the island of Cozumel, off the east coast of Yucat√°n. The Maya inhabitants of Cozumel fled the Spanish and would not respond to Grijalva's friendly overtures. The fleet then sailed south along the east coast of the peninsula. The Spanish spotted three large Maya cities along the coast, but Grijalva did not land at any of these and turned back north to loop around the north of the peninsula and sail down the west coast. At Campeche the Spanish tried to barter for water but the Maya refused, so Grijalva opened fire against the city with small cannon; the inhabitants fled, allowing the Spanish to take the abandoned city. Messages were sent with a few Maya who had been too slow to escape but the Maya remained hidden in the forest; the Spanish boarded their ships and continued along the coast. At Champot√≥n, the fleet was approached by a small number of large war canoes, but the ships' cannon soon put them to flight. At the mouth of the Tabasco River the Spanish sighted massed warriors and canoes but the natives did not approach. By means of interpreters, Grijalva indicated that he wished to trade and bartered wine and beads in exchange for food and other supplies. From the natives they received a few gold trinkets and news of the riches of the Aztec Empire to the west. The expedition continued far enough to confirm the reality of the gold- rich empire, sailing as far north as P√°nuco River. As the fleet returned to Cuba, the Spanish attacked Champot√≥n to avenge the previous year's defeat of the Spanish expedition led by Hern√°ndez. One Spaniard was killed and fifty were wounded in the ensuing battle, including Grijalva. Grijalva put into Havana five months after he had left. =Hern√°n Cort√©s, 1519= alt=Old painting of a bearded young man facing slightly to the right. He is wearing a dark jacket with a high collar topped by a white ruff, with ornate buttons down the front. The painting is dark and set in an oval with the letters \\"HERNAN CORTES\\" in a rectangle underneath. Grijalva's return aroused great interest in Cuba, and Yucat√°n was believed to be a land of riches waiting to be plundered. A new expedition was organised, with a fleet of eleven ships carrying 500 men and some horses. Hern√°n Cort√©s was placed in command, and his crew included officers that would become famous conquistadors, including Pedro de Alvarado, Crist√≥bal de Olid, Gonzalo de Sandoval and Diego de Ordaz. Also aboard were Francisco de Montejo and Bernal D√≠az del Castillo, veterans of the Grijalva expedition. The fleet made its first landfall at Cozumel; Maya temples were cast down and a Christian cross was put up on one of them. At Cozumel Cort√©s heard rumours of bearded men on the Yucat√°n mainland, who he presumed were Europeans. Cort√©s sent out messengers to them and was able to rescue the shipwrecked Ger√≥nimo de Aguilar, who had been enslaved by a Maya lord. Aguilar had learnt the Yucatec Maya language and became Cort√©s' interpreter. From Cozumel, the fleet looped around the north of the Yucat√°n Peninsula and followed the coast to the Grijalva River, which Cort√©s named in honour of the Spanish captain who had discovered it. In Tabasco, Cort√©s anchored his ships at Potonch√°n, a Chontal Maya town. The Maya prepared for battle but the Spanish horses and firearms quickly decided the outcome. The defeated Chontal Maya lords offered gold, food, clothing and a group of young women in tribute to the victors. Among these women was a young Maya noblewoman called Malintzin, who was given the Spanish name Marina. She spoke Maya and Nahuatl and became the means by which Cort√©s was able to communicate with the Aztecs. From Tabasco, Cort√©s continued along the coast, and went on to conquer the Aztecs. Preparations for conquest of the Highlands, 1522‚Äì1523 After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan fell to the Spanish in 1521, the Kaqchikel Maya of Iximche sent envoys to Hern√°n Cort√©s to declare their allegiance to the new ruler of Mexico, and the K ºiche º Maya of Q ºumarkaj may also have sent a delegation. In 1522 Cort√©s sent Mexican allies to scout the Soconusco region of lowland Chiapas, where they met new delegations from Iximche and Q ºumarkaj at Tuxp√°n; both of the powerful highland Maya kingdoms declared their loyalty to the King of Spain. But Cort√©s' allies in Soconusco soon informed him that the K ºiche º and the Kaqchikel were not loyal, and were harassing Spain's allies in the region. Cort√©s despatched Pedro de Alvarado with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, 4 cannons, and thousands of allied warriors from central Mexico; they arrived in Soconusco in 1523. Soconusco, 1523‚Äì1524 Pedro de Alvarado passed through Soconusco with a sizeable force in 1523, en route to conquer Guatemala. Alvarado's army included hardened veterans of the conquest of the Aztecs, and included cavalry and artillery; he was accompanied by a great many indigenous allies. Alvarado was received in peace in Soconusco, and the inhabitants swore allegiance to the Spanish Crown. They reported that neighbouring groups in Guatemala were attacking them because of their friendly outlook towards the Spanish. By 1524, Soconusco had been completely pacified by Alvarado and his forces. Due to the economic importance of cacao to the new colony, the Spanish were reluctant to move the indigenous inhabitants far from their established cacao orchards. As a result, the inhabitants of Soconusco were less likely to be rounded up into new reducci√≥n settlements than elsewhere in Chiapas, since the planting of a new cacao crop would have required five years to mature. Hern√°n Cort√©s in the Maya lowlands, 1524‚Äì25 In 1524, after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hern√°n Cort√©s led an expedition to Honduras over land, cutting across Acalan in southern Campeche and the Itza kingdom in what is now the northern Pet√©n Department of Guatemala. His aim was to subdue the rebellious Crist√≥bal de Olid, whom he had sent to conquer Honduras, and who had set himself up independently in that territory. Cort√©s left Tenochtitlan on 12 October 1524 with 140 Spanish soldiers, 93 of them mounted, 3,000 Mexican warriors, 150 horses, artillery, munitions and other supplies. Cort√©s marched into Maya territory in Tabasco; the army crossed the Usumacinta River near Tenosique and crossed into the Chontal Maya province of Acalan, where he recruited 600 Chontal Maya carriers. Cort√©s and his army left Acalan on 5 March 1525. The expedition passed onwards through Kejache territory, and arrived at the north shore of Lake Pet√©n Itz√° on 13 March 1525. The Roman Catholic priests accompanying the expedition celebrated mass in the presence of the king of the Itza, who was said to be so impressed that he pledged to worship the cross and to destroy his idols. Cort√©s accepted an invitation from Kan Ek º to visit Nojpet√©n. On his departure, Cort√©s left behind a cross and a lame horse that the Itza treated as a deity, but the animal soon died. From the lake, Cort√©s continued on the arduous journey south along the western slopes of the Maya Mountains, during which he lost most of his horses. The expedition became lost in the hills north of Lake Izabal and came close to starvation before they captured a Maya boy who led them to safety. Cort√©s found a village on the shore of Lake Izabal, and crossed the Dulce River to the settlement of Nito, somewhere on the Amatique Bay, with about a dozen companions, and waited there for the rest of his army to regroup over the next week. By this time the remnants of the expedition had been reduced to a few hundred; Cort√©s succeeded in contacting the Spaniards he was searching for, only to find that Crist√≥bal de Olid's own officers had already put down his rebellion. Cort√©s then returned to Mexico by sea. Fringes of empire: Belize, 16th‚Äì17th centuries No Spanish military expeditions were launched against the Maya of Belize, although both Dominican and Franciscan friars penetrated the region in attempts at evangelising the natives. The only Spanish settlement in the territory was established by Alonso d'Avila in 1531 and lasted less than two years. In 1574, fifty households of Manche Ch ºol were relocated from Campin and Yaxal, in southern Belize, to the shore of Lake Izabal, but they soon fled back into the forest. In order to counter Spanish encroachment into their territory, the local Maya maintained a tense alliance with English loggers operating in central Belize. In 1641, the Franciscans established two reducciones among the Muzul Maya of central Belize, at Zoite and Cehake; both settlements were sacked by Dutch corsairs within a year. Conquest of the Maya Highlands, 1524‚Äì1526 =Subjugation of the K ºiche º, 1524= Page from the Lienzo de Tlaxcala showing the conquest of Quetzaltenango Pedro de Alvarado and his army advanced along the Pacific coast unopposed until they reached the Samal√° River in western Guatemala. This region formed a part of the K ºiche º kingdom, and a K ºiche º army tried unsuccessfully to prevent the Spanish from crossing the river. Once across, the conquistadors ransacked nearby settlements. On 8 February 1524 Alvarado's army fought a battle at Xetulul, (modern San Francisco Zapotitl√°n). The Spanish and their allies stormed the town and set up camp in the marketplace. Alvarado then headed upriver into the Sierra Madre mountains towards the K ºiche º heartlands, crossing the pass into the valley of Quetzaltenango. On 12 February 1524 Alvarado's Mexican allies were ambushed in the pass and driven back by K ºiche º warriors but a Spanish cavalry charge scattered the K ºiche º and the army crossed to the city of Xelaju (modern Quetzaltenango) to find it deserted. The Spanish accounts relate that at least one and possibly two of the ruling lords of Q ºumarkaj died in the fierce battles upon the initial approach to Quetzaltenango. Almost a week later, on 18 February 1524, a 30,000-strong K ºiche º army confronted the Spanish army in the Quetzaltenango valley and was comprehensively defeated; many K ºiche º nobles were among the dead. This battle exhausted the K ºiche º militarily and they asked for peace, and invited Pedro de Alvarado into their capital Q ºumarkaj. Alvarado was deeply suspicious of K ºiche º intentions but accepted the offer and marched to Q ºumarkaj with his army. At Tzakah√° the Spanish conducted a Roman Catholic mass under a makeshift roof; this site was chosen to build the first church in Guatemala. The first Easter mass held in Guatemala was celebrated in the new church, during which high-ranking natives were baptised. alt=Grass- and scrub-covered ruins set against a backdrop of low pine forest. A crumbling squat square tower stands behind to the right, all that remains of the Temple of Tohil, with the remains of the walls of the ballcourt to the left in the foreground. In March 1524 Pedro de Alvarado camped outside Q ºumarkaj. He invited the K ºiche º lords Oxib-Keh (the ajpop, or king) and Beleheb-Tzy (the ajpop k ºamha, or king elect) to visit him in his camp. As soon as they did so, he seized them as prisoners. In response to a furious K ºiche º counterattack, Alvarado had the captured K ºiche º lords burnt to death, and then proceeded to burn the entire city. After the destruction of Q ºumarkaj, Pedro de Alvarado sent messages to Iximche, capital of the Kaqchikel, proposing an alliance against the remaining K ºiche º resistance. Alvarado wrote that they sent 4000 warriors to assist him, although the Kaqchikel recorded that they sent only 400. With the capitulation of the K ºiche º kingdom, various non-K ºiche º peoples under K ºiche º dominion also submitted to the Spanish. This included the Mam inhabitants of the area now within the modern department of San Marcos. =Kaqchikel alliance and conquest of the Tz ºutujil, 1524= On 14 April 1524, the Spanish were invited into Iximche and were well received by the lords Belehe Qat and Cahi Imox. The Kaqchikel kings provided native soldiers to assist the conquistadors against continuing K ºiche º resistance and to help with the defeat of the neighbouring Tz ºutujil kingdom. The Spanish only stayed briefly before continuing to Atitlan and the Pacific coast. The Spanish returned to the Kaqchikel capital on 23 July 1524 and on 27 July Pedro de Alvarado declared Iximche as the first capital of Guatemala, Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (\\"St. James of the Knights of Guatemala\\"). alt=View across hills to a broad lake bathed in a light mist. The mountainous lake shore curves from the left foreground backwards and to the right, with several volcanoes rising from the far shore, framed by a clear blue sky above. After two Kaqchikel messengers sent by Pedro de Alvarado were killed by the Tz ºutujil, the conquistadors and their Kaqchikel allies marched against the Tz ºutujil. Pedro de Alvarado led 60 cavalry, 150 Spanish infantry and an unspecified number of Kaqchikel warriors. The Spanish and their allies arrived at the lakeshore after a day's march, and Alvarado rode ahead with 30 cavalry along the lake shore until he engaged a hostile Tz ºutujil force, which was broken by the Spanish charge. The survivors were pursued across a causeway to an island on foot before the inhabitants could break the bridges. The rest of Alvarado's army soon arrived and they successfully stormed the island. The surviving Tz ºutujil fled into the lake and swam to safety. The Spanish could not pursue them because 300 canoes sent by the Kaqchikels had not yet arrived. This battle took place on 18 April. The following day the Spanish entered Tecpan Atitlan, the Tz ºutujil capital, but found it deserted. The Tz ºutujil leaders responded to Alvarado's messengers by surrendering to Pedro de Alvarado and swearing loyalty to Spain, at which point Alvarado considered them pacified and returned to Iximche; three days later, the lords of the Tz ºutujil arrived there to pledge their loyalty and offer tribute to the conquistadors. =Reconnaissance of the Chiapas Highlands, 1524= Early entry routes to Chiapas, 1523-1525 In 1524 Luis Mar√≠n led a small party on a reconnaissance expedition into Chiapas. He set out from Coatzacoalcos (renamed Esp√≠ritu Santo by the Spanish), on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. His party followed the Grijalva upriver; near modern Chiapa de Corzo the Spanish party fought and defeated the Chiapanecos. Following this battle, Mar√≠n headed into the central highlands of Chiapas; around Easter he passed through the Tzotzil Maya town Zinacantan without opposition from the inhabitants. The Zinacantecos, true to their pledge of allegiance two years earlier, aided the Spanish against the other indigenous peoples of the region. Mar√≠n was initially met by a peaceful embassy as he approached the Tzoztzil town of Chamula. He took this as the submission of the inhabitants, but was met by armed resistance when he tried to enter the province. The Spanish found that the Chamula Tzotzil had abandoned their lands and stripped them of food in an attempt to discourage the invaders. A day after their initial approach, Mar√≠n found that the Chamula Tzotzil had gathered their warriors upon a ridge that was too steep for the Spanish horses to climb. The conquistadors were met with a barrage of missiles and boiling water, and found the nearby town defended by a formidable thick defensive wall. The Spanish stormed the wall, to find that the inhabitants had withdrawn under cover of torrential rain that had interrupted the battle. After taking the deserted Chamula, the Spanish expedition continued against their allies at Huixtan. Again the inhabitants offered armed resistance before abandoning their town to the Spanish. Conquistador Diego Godoy wrote that the Indians killed or captured at Huixtan numbered no more than 500. The Spanish, by now disappointed with the scarce pickings, decided to retreat to Coatzacoalcos in May 1524. =Kaqchikel rebellion, 1524‚Äì1530= Pedro de Alvarado rapidly began to demand gold in tribute from the Kaqchikels, souring the friendship between the two peoples, and the Kaqchikel people abandoned their city and fled to the forests and hills on 28 August 1524. Ten days later the Spanish declared war on the Kaqchikel. The Spanish founded a new town at nearby Tecp√°n Guatemala, abandoned it in 1527 because of continuous Kaqchikel attacks, and moved to the Almolonga Valley to the east, refounding their capital at Ciudad Vieja. The Kaqchikel kept up resistance against the Spanish for a number of years, but on 9 May 1530, exhausted by warfare, the two kings of the most important clans returned from the wilds. A day later they were joined by many nobles and their families and many more people; they then surrendered at the new Spanish capital at Ciudad Vieja. The former inhabitants of Iximche were dispersed; some were moved to Tecp√°n, the rest to Solol√° and other towns around Lake Atitl√°n. =Siege of Zaculeu, 1525= alt=A cluster of squat white step pyramids, the tallest of them topped by a shrine with three doorways. In the background is a low mountain ridge. At the time of the conquest, the main Mam population was situated in Xinabahul (modern Huehuetenango city), but Zaculeu's fortifications led to its use as a refuge during the conquest. The refuge was attacked by Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras, brother of Pedro de Alvarado, in 1525, with 40 Spanish cavalry and 80 Spanish infantry, and some 2,000 Mexican and K ºiche º allies. Gonzalo de Alvarado left the Spanish camp at Tecp√°n Guatemala in July 1525 and marched to Momostenango, which quickly fell to the Spanish after a four-hour battle. The following day Gonzalo de Alvarado marched on Huehuetenango and was confronted by a Mam army of 5,000 warriors from Malacat√°n. The Mam army advanced across the plain in battle formation and was met by a Spanish cavalry charge that threw them into disarray, with the infantry mopping up those Mam that survived the cavalry. The Mam leader Canil Acab was killed and the surviving warriors fled to the hills. The Spanish army rested for a few days, then continued onwards to Huehuetenango only to find it deserted. Kayb ºil B ºalam had received news of the Spanish advance and had withdrawn to his fortress at Zaculeu, with some 6,000 warriors gathered from the surrounding area. The fortress possessed formidable defences, and Gonzalo de Alvarado launched an assault on the weaker northern entrance. Mam warriors initially held firm against the Spanish infantry but fell back before repeated cavalry charges. Kayb ºil B ºalam, seeing that outright victory on an open battlefield was impossible, withdrew his army back within the safety of the walls. As Alvarado dug in and laid siege to the fortress, an army of approximately 8,000 Mam warriors descended on Zaculeu from the Cuchumatanes mountains to the north, drawn from towns allied with the city; the relief army was annihilated by the Spanish cavalry. After several months the Mam were reduced to starvation. Kayb ºil B ºalam finally surrendered the city to the Spanish in the middle of October 1525. When the Spanish entered the city they found 1,800 dead Indians, and the survivors eating the corpses. After the fall of Zaculeu, a Spanish garrison was established at Huehuetenango, and Gonzalo de Alvarado returned to Tecp√°n Guatemala. =Pedro de Alvarado in the Chiapas Highlands, 1525= A year after Luis Mar√≠n's reconnaissance expedition, Pedro de Alvarado entered Chiapas when he crossed a part of the Lacandon Forest in an attempt to link up with Hern√°n Cort√©s' expedition heading for Honduras. Alvarado entered Chiapas from Guatemala via the territory of the Acala Ch ºol; he was unable to locate Cort√©s, and his scouts eventually led him to Tecpan Puyumatlan (modern Santa Eulalia, Huehuetenango), in a mountainous region near the territory of the Lakandon Ch ºol. The inhabitants of Tecpan Puyumatlan offered fierce resistance against the Spanish-led expedition, and Gonzalo de Alvarado wrote that the Spanish suffered many losses, including the killing of messengers sent to summon the natives to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown. After failing to locate Cort√©s, the Alvarados returned to Guatemala. =Central and eastern Guatemalan Highlands, 1525‚Äì1532= alt=Pedro de Alvarado entered Guatemala from the west along the southern Pacific plain in 1524, before swinging northwards and fighting a number of battles to enter the highlands. He then executed a broad loop around the north side of the highland Lake Atitl√°n, fighting further battles along the way, before descending southwards once more into the Pacific lowlands. Two more battles were fought as his forces headed east into what is now El Salvador. In 1525 Hern√°n Cort√©s entered northern Guatemala from the north, crossed to Lake Pet√©n Itz√° and continued roughly southeast to Lake Izabal before turning east to the Gulf of Honduras. In 1525 Pedro de Alvarado sent a small company to conquer Mixco Viejo (Chinautla Viejo), the capital of the Poqomam. The Spanish attempted an approach through a narrow pass but were forced back with heavy losses. Alvarado himself launched the second assault with 200 Tlaxcalan allies but was also beaten back. The Poqomam then received reinforcements, and the two armies clashed on open ground outside of the city. The battle was chaotic and lasted for most of the day, but was finally decided by the Spanish cavalry. The leaders of the reinforcements surrendered to the Spanish three days after their retreat and revealed that the city had a secret entrance in the form of a cave. Alvarado sent 40 men to cover the exit from the cave and launched another assault along the ravine, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with musketmen, each with a companion sheltering him with a shield. This tactic allowed the Spanish to break through the pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city. Those who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the exit from the cave, the survivors were captured and brought back to the city. The siege had lasted more than a month, and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco. There are no direct sources describing the conquest of the Chajoma by the Spanish but it appears to have been a drawn-out campaign rather than a rapid victory. After the conquest, the inhabitants of the kingdom were resettled in San Pedro Sacatep√©quez, and San Mart√≠n Jilotepeque. The Chajoma rebelled against the Spanish in 1526, fighting a battle at Ukub ºil, an unidentified site somewhere near the modern towns of San Juan Sacatep√©quez and San Pedro Sacatep√©quez. Chiquimula de la Sierra (\\"Chiquimula in the Highlands\\") was inhabited by Ch ºorti º Maya at the time of the conquest. The first Spanish reconnaissance of this region took place in 1524. In 1526 three Spanish captains invaded Chiquimula on the orders of Pedro de Alvarado. The indigenous population soon rebelled against excessive Spanish demands, but the rebellion was quickly put down in April 1530. However, the region was not considered fully conquered until a campaign by Jorge de Bocanegra in 1531‚Äì1532 that also took in parts of Jalapa. The afflictions of Old World diseases, war and overwork in the mines and encomiendas took a heavy toll on the inhabitants of eastern Guatemala, to the extent that indigenous population levels never recovered to their pre-conquest levels. Francisco de Montejo in Yucat√°n, 1527‚Äì28 Monument in M√©rida to Montejo the Elder and his son. The richer lands of Mexico engaged the main attention of the Conquistadors for some years, then in 1526 Francisco de Montejo (a veteran of the Grijalva and Cort√©s expeditions) successfully petitioned the King of Spain for the right to conquer Yucat√°n. On 8 December of that year he was issued with the hereditary military title of adelantado and permission to colonise the Yucat√°n Peninsula. In 1527 he left Spain with 400 men in four ships, with horses, small arms, cannon and provisions. One of the ships was left at Santo Domingo as a supply ship to provide later support; the other ships set sail and reached Cozumel, an island off the east coast of Yucat√°n, in the second half of September 1527. Montejo was received in there in peace by the lord Aj Naum Pat. The ships only stopped briefly before making for the mainland, making landfall somewhere near Xelha in the Maya province of Ekab. Montejo garrisoned Xelha with 40 soldiers and posted 20 more at nearby Pole. Xelha was renamed Salamanca de Xelha and became the first Spanish settlement in the peninsula. The provisions were soon exhausted and additional food was requisitioned from the local Maya villagers; this too was soon consumed. Many local Maya fled into the forest and Spanish raiding parties scoured the surrounding area for food, finding little. With discontent growing among his men, Montejo took the drastic step of burning his ships; this strengthened the resolve of his troops, who gradually acclimatised to the harsh conditions of Yucat√°n. Montejo was able to get more food from the still-friendly Aj Nuam Pat of Cozumel. Montejo took 125 men and set out on an expedition to explore the north-eastern portion of the Yucat√°n peninsula. At Belma, Montejo gathered the leaders of the nearby Maya towns and instructed them to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown. After this, Montejo led his men to Conil, a town in Ekab, where the Spanish party halted for two months. In the spring of 1528, Montejo left Conil for the city of Chauaca, which was abandoned by its Maya inhabitants under cover of darkness. The following morning the inhabitants attacked the Spanish party but were defeated. The Spanish then continued to Ake, where they engaged in a major battle, which left more than 1,200 Maya dead. After this Spanish victory, the neighbouring Maya leaders all surrendered. Montejo's party then continued to Sisia and Loche before heading back to Xelha. Montejo arrived at Xelha with only 60 of his party, and found that only 12 of his 40-strong garrison survived, while the entire garrison at Pole had been slaughtered. The support ship eventually arrived from Santo Domingo, and Montejo used it to sail south along the coast, while he sent his second-in- command Alonso d'Avila via land. Montejo discovered the thriving port city of Chaktumal (modern Chetumal). The Maya at Chaktumal fed false information to the Spanish, and Montejo was unable link up with d'Avila, who returned overland to Xelha. The fledgling Spanish colony was moved to nearby Xamanha, modern Playa del Carmen, which Montejo considered to be a better port. After waiting for d'Avila without result, Montejo sailed south as far as Honduras before turning around and heading back up the coast to finally meet up with his lieutenant at Xamanha. Late in 1528, Montejo left d'Avila to oversee Xamanha and sailed north to loop around the Yucat√°n Peninsula and head for the Spanish colony of New Spain in central Mexico. Conquest of the Chiapas Highlands, 1527‚Äì1547 Pedro de Portocarrero, a young nobleman, led the next expedition into Chiapas after Alvarado, again from Guatemala. His campaign is largely undocumented but in January 1528 he successfully established the settlement of San Crist√≥bal de los Llanos in the Comit√°n valley, in the territory of the Tojolabal Maya. This served as a base of operations that allowed the Spanish to extend their control towards the Ocosingo valley. One of the scarce mentions of Portocarrero's campaign suggests that there was some indigenous resistance but its exact form and extent is unknown. Portocarrero established Spanish dominion over a number of Tzeltal and Tojolabal settlements, and penetrated as far as the Tzotzil town of Huixtan. By 1528, Spanish colonial power had been established in the Chiapas Highlands, and encomienda rights were being issued to individual conquistadores. Spanish dominion extended from the upper drainage of the Grijalva, across Comit√°n and Teopisca to the Ocosingo valley. The north and northwest were incorporated into the Villa de Esp√≠ritu Santo district, that included Ch ºol Maya territory around Tila. In the early years of conquest, encomienda rights effectively meant rights to pillage and round up slaves, usually in the form of a group of mounted conquistadores launching a lightning slave raid upon an unsuspecting population centre. Prisoners would be branded as slaves, and were sold in exchange for weapons, supplies, and horses. =Diego Mazariegos, 1528= In 1528, captain Diego Mazariegos crossed into Chiapas via the Isthmus of Tehuantepec with artillery and raw recruits recently arrived from Spain. By this time, the indigenous population had been greatly reduced by a combination of disease and famine. They first travelled to Jiquipilas to meet up with a delegation from Zinacantan, who had asked for Spanish assistance against rebellious vassals; a small contingent of Spanish cavalry was enough to bring these back into line. After this, Mazariegos and his companions proceeded to Chiapan and set up a temporary camp nearby, that they named Villa Real. Mazariegos had arrived with a mandate to establish a new colonial province of Chiapa in the Chiapas Highlands. He initially met with resistance from the veteran conquistadores who had already established themselves in the region. Mazariegos heard that Pedro de Portocarrero was in the highlands, and sought him out in order to persuade him to leave. The two conquistadors eventually met up in Huixtan. Mazariegos entered into protracted three-month negotiations with the Spanish settlers in Coatzacoalcos (Esp√≠ritu Santo) and San Crist√≥bal de los Llanos. Eventually an agreement was reached, and the encomiendas of Esp√≠ritu Santo that lay in the highlands were merged those of San Crist√≥bal to form the new province. Unknown to Mazariegos, the king had already issued an order that the settlements of San Crist√≥bal de los Llanos be transferred to Pedro de Alvarado. The end result of the negotiations between Mazariegos and the established settlers was that Villa de San Crist√≥bal de los Llanos was broken up, and those settlers who wished to remain were transferred to Villa Real, which had been moved to the fertile Jovel valley. Pedro de Portocarrero left Chiapas and returned to Guatemala. Mazariegos proceeded with the policy of moving the Indians into reducciones; this process was made easier by the much reduced indigenous population levels. Mazariegos issued licences of encomienda covering still unconquered regions in order to encourage colonists to conquer new territory. The Province of Chiapa had no coastal territory, and at the end of this process about 100 Spanish settlers were concentrated in the remote provincial capital at Villa Real, surrounded by hostile Indian settlements, and with deep internal divisions. =Rebellion in the Chiapas Highlands, 1528= Although Mazariegos had managed to establish his new provincial capital without armed conflict, excessive Spanish demands for labour and supplies soon provoked the locals into rebellion. In August 1528, Mazariegos replaced the existing encomenderos with his friends and allies; the natives, seeing the Spanish isolated and witnessing the hostility between the original and newly arrived settlers, took this opportunity to rebel and refused to supply their new masters. Zinacant√°n was the only indigenous settlement that remained loyal to the Spanish. Villa Real was now surrounded by hostile territory, and any Spanish help was too far away to be of value. The colonists quickly ran short of food and responded by taking up arms and riding against the Indians in search of food and slaves. The Indians abandoned their towns and hid their women and children in caves. The rebellious populations concentrated themselves on easily defended mountaintops. At Quetzaltepeque a lengthy battle was fought between the Tzeltal Maya and the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of a number of Spanish. The battle lasted several days, and the Spanish were supported by indigenous warriors from central Mexico. The battle eventually resulted in a Spanish victory, but the rest of the province of Chiapa remained rebellious. After the battle of Quetzaltepeque, Villa Real was still short on food and Mazariegos was ill; he retreated to Copanaguastla against the protests of the town council, which was left to defend the fledgling colony. By now, Nu√±o de Guzm√°n was governor in Mexico, and he despatched Juan Enr√≠quez de Guzm√°n to Chiapa as end-of-term judge over Mazariegos, and as alcalde mayor (a local colonial governor). He occupied his post for a year, during which time he attempted to reestablish Spanish control over the province, especially the northern and eastern regions, but was unable to make much headway. =Founding of Ciudad Real, Chiapa, 1531‚Äì1535= In 1531, Pedro de Alvarado finally took up the post of governor of Chiapa. He immediately reinstated the old name of San Crist√≥bal de los Llanos upon Villa Real. Once again, the encomiendas of Chiapa were transferred to new owners. The Spanish launched an expedition against Puyumatlan; it was not successful in terms of conquest, but enabled the Spanish to seize more slaves to trade for weapons and horses. The newly acquired supplies would then be used in further expeditions to conquer and pacify still-independent regions, leading to a cycle of slave raids, trade for supplies, followed by further conquests and slave raids. The Mazariegos family managed to establish a power base in the local colonial institutions and, in 1535, they succeeded in having San Crist√≥bal de los Llanos declared a city, with the new name of Ciudad Real. They also managed to acquire special privileges from the Crown in order to stabilise the colony, such as an edict that specified that the governor of Chiapa must govern in person and not through a delegated representative. In practise, the quick turnover of encomiendas continued, since few Spaniards had legal Spanish wives and legitimate children who could inherit. This situation would not stabilise until the 1540s, when the dire shortage of Spanish women in the colony was alleviated by an influx of new colonists. =Establishment of the Dominicans in Chiapa, 1545‚Äì1547= Santiago Matamoros was a readily identifiable image of Spanish military superiority In 1542, the New Laws were issued with the aim of protecting the indigenous peoples of the Spanish colonies from their overexploitation by the encomenderos. Friar Bartolom√© de las Casas and his followers left Spain in July 1544 to enforce the New Laws. Las Casas arrived in Ciudad Real with 16 fellow Dominicans on 12 March 1545. The Dominicans were the first religious order to attempt the evangelisation of the native population. Their arrival meant that the colonists were no longer free to treat the natives as they saw fit without the risk of intervention by the religious authorities. The Dominicans soon came into conflict with the established colonists. Colonial opposition to the Dominicans was such that the Dominicans were forced to flee Ciudad Real in fear of their lives. They established themselves nearby in two indigenous villages, the old site of Villa Real de Chiapa and Cinacantl√°n. From Villa Real, Bartolom√© de las Casas and his companions prepared for the evangelisation of all the territory that fell within the Bishopric of Chiapa. The Dominicans promoted the veneration of Santiago Matamoros (St. James the Moor-slayer) as a readily identifiable image of Spanish military superiority. The Dominicans soon saw the need to reestablish themselves in Ciudad Real, and the hostilities with the colonists were calmed. In 1547, the first stone for the new Dominican convent in Ciudad Real was placed. Francisco de Montejo and Alonso d'Avila, Yucat√°n 1531‚Äì35 Montejo was appointed alcalde mayor (a local colonial governor) of Tabasco in 1529, and pacified that province with the aid of his son, also named Francisco de Montejo. D'Avila was sent from eastern Yucat√°n to conquer Acalan, which extended southeast of the Laguna de Terminos. Montejo the Younger founded Salamanca de Xicalango as a base of operations. In 1530 d'Avila established Salamanca de Acal√°n as a base from which to launch new attempts to conquer Yucat√°n. Salamanca de Acal√°n proved a disappointment, with no gold for the taking and with lower levels of population than had been hoped. D'Avila soon abandoned the new settlement and set off across the lands of the Kejache to Champot√≥n, arriving there towards the end of 1530, where he was later joined by the Montejos. In 1531 Montejo moved his base of operations to Campeche. Alonso d'Avila was sent overland to the east of the peninsula, passing through Man√≠ where he was well received by the Xiu Maya. D'Avila continued southeast to Chetumal where he founded the Spanish town of Villa Real just within the borders of modern Belize. The local Maya fiercely resisted the placement of the new Spanish colony and d'Avila and his men were forced to abandon it and make for Honduras in canoes. At Campeche, a strong Maya force attacked the city, but was repulsed by the Spanish. Aj Canul, the lord of the attacking Maya, surrendered to the Spanish. After this battle, the younger Francisco de Montejo was despatched to the northern Cupul province, where the lord Naabon Cupul reluctantly allowed him to found the Spanish town of Ciudad Real at Chichen Itza. Montejo parcelled out the province amongst his soldiers as encomiendas. After six months of Spanish rule, Naabon Cupul was killed during a failed attempt to kill Montejo the Younger. The death of their lord only served to inflame Cupul anger and, in mid 1533, they laid siege to the small Spanish garrison at Chichen Itza. Montejo the Younger abandoned Ciudad Real by night, and he and his men fled west, where the Chel, Pech and Xiu provinces remained obedient to Spanish rule. Montejo the Younger was received in friendship by the lord of the Chel province. In the spring of 1534 he rejoined his father in the Chakan province at Dzikabal, (near modern M√©rida). The Xiu Maya maintained their friendship with the Spanish throughout the conquest and Spanish authority was eventually established over Yucat√°n in large part due to Xiu support. The Montejos founded a new Spanish town at Dzilam, although the Spanish suffered hardships there. Montejo the Elder returned to Campeche, where he was received with friendship by the local Maya. He was accompanied by the friendly Chel lord Namux Chel. Montejo the Younger remained behind in Dzilam to continue his attempts at conquest of the region but soon retreated to Campeche to rejoin his father and Alonso d'Avila, who had returned to Campeche shortly beforehand. Around this time the news began to arrive of Francisco Pizarro's conquests in Peru and the rich plunder there. Montejo's soldiers began to abandon him to seek their fortune elsewhere; in seven years of attempted conquest in the northern provinces of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, very little gold had been found. Towards the end of 1534 or the beginning of the next year, Montejo the Elder and his son retreated to Veracruz, taking their remaining soldiers with them. Montejo the Elder became embroiled in colonial infighting over the right to rule Honduras, a claim that put him in conflict with Pedro de Alvarado, captain general of Guatemala, who also claimed Honduras as part of his jurisdiction. Alvarado was ultimately to prove successful. In Montejo the Elder's absence, first in central Mexico, and then in Honduras, Montejo the Younger acted as lieutenant governor and captain general in Tabasco. =Conflict at Champoton= The Franciscan friar Jacobo de Testera arrived in Champoton in 1535 to attempt the peaceful incorporation of Yucat√°n into the Spanish Empire. His initial efforts were proving successful when Captain Lorenzo de Godoy arrived in Champoton at the command of soldiers despatched there by Montejo the Younger. Godoy and Testera were soon in conflict and the friar was forced to abandon Champoton and return to central Mexico. Godoy's attempt to subdue the Maya around Champoton was unsuccessful, so Montejo the Younger sent his cousin to take command; his diplomatic overtures to the Champoton Kowoj were successful and they submitted to Spanish rule. Champoton was the last Spanish outpost in the Yucat√°n Peninsula; it was increasingly isolated and the situation there became difficult. San Marcos: Province of Tecusitl√°n and Lacand√≥n, 1533 In 1533 Pedro de Alvarado ordered de Le√≥n y Cardona to explore and conquer the area around the Tacan√°, Tajumulco, Lacand√≥n and San Antonio volcanoes; in colonial times this area was referred to as the Province of Tecusitl√°n and Lacand√≥n. De Le√≥n marched to a Maya city named Quezalli by his Nahuatl-speaking allies with a force of fifty Spaniards; his Mexican allies also referred to the city by the name Sacatepequez. De Le√≥n renamed the city as San Pedro Sacatep√©quez. The Spanish founded a village nearby at Candacuchex in April that year, renaming it as San Marcos. Campaigns in the Cuchumatanes and Lacandon Forest alt=View over a heavily forested mountain slope towards rugged peaks beyond, separated from them by a mass of low cloud. In the ten years after the fall of Zaculeu various Spanish expeditions crossed into the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes and engaged in the gradual and complex conquest of the Chuj and Q ºanjob ºal. The Spanish were attracted to the region in the hope of extracting gold, silver and other riches from the mountains but their remoteness, the difficult terrain and relatively low population made their conquest and exploitation extremely difficult. The population of the Cuchumatanes is estimated to have been 260,000 before European contact. By the time the Spanish physically arrived in the region this had collapsed to 150,000 because of the effects of the Old World diseases that had run ahead of them. =Eastern Cuchumatanes, 1529‚Äì1530= After Zaculeu fell to the Spanish, the Ixil and Uspantek Maya were sufficiently isolated to evade immediate Spanish attention. The Uspantek and the Ixil were allies and in 1529 Uspantek warriors were harassing Spanish forces and the city of Uspant√°n was trying to foment rebellion among the K ºiche º; the Spanish decided that military action was necessary. Gaspar Arias, magistrate of Guatemala, penetrated the eastern Cuchumatanes with sixty Spanish infantry and three hundred allied indigenous warriors. By early September he had imposed temporary Spanish authority over the Ixil towns of Chajul and Nebaj. The Spanish army then marched east toward Uspant√°n; Arias then handed command over to the inexperienced Pedro de Olmos and returned to the capital. Olmos launched a disastrous full-scale frontal assault on the city. As soon as the Spanish attacked, they were ambushed from the rear by over two thousand Uspantek warriors. The Spanish forces were routed with heavy losses; many of their indigenous allies were slain, and many more were captured alive by the Uspantek warriors only to be sacrificed. A year later Francisco de Castellanos set out from Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (by now relocated to Ciudad Vieja) on another expedition, leading eight corporals, thirty-two cavalry, forty Spanish infantry and several hundred allied indigenous warriors. The expedition recruited further forces on the march north to the Cuchumatanes. On the steep southern slopes they clashed with between four and five thousand Ixil warriors; a lengthy battle followed during which the Spanish cavalry outflanked the Ixil army and forced them to retreat to their mountaintop fortress at Nebaj. The Spanish besieged the city, and their indigenous allies penetrated the stronghold and set it on fire. This allowed the Spanish to break the defences. The victorious Spanish branded surviving warriors as slaves. The inhabitants of Chajul immediately capitulated to the Spanish as soon as news of the battle reached them. The Spanish continued east towards Uspant√°n to find it defended by ten thousand warriors, including forces from Cotzal, Cun√©n, Sacapulas and Verapaz. Although heavily outnumbered, the Spanish cavalry and firearms decided the battle. The Spanish overran Uspant√°n and again branded all surviving warriors as slaves. The surrounding towns also surrendered, and December 1530 marked the end of the military stage of the conquest of the Cuchumatanes. =Western Cuchumatanes and Lacandon Forest, 1529‚Äì1686= alt=A series of semi-collapsed dry-stone terraces, overgrown with short grass.

In 1529 the Chuj city of San Mateo Ixtat√°n (then known by the name of Ystapalap√°n) was given in encomienda to the conquistador Gonzalo de Ovalle together with Santa Eulalia and Jacaltenango. In 1549, the first reduction of San Mateo Ixtat√°n took place, overseen by Dominican missionaries, in the same year the Q ºanjob ºal reducci√≥n settlement of Santa Eulalia was founded. Further Q ºanjob ºal reducciones were in place by 1560. Q ºanjob ºal resistance was largely passive, based on withdrawal to the inaccessible mountains and forests. In 1586 the Mercedarian Order built the first church in Santa Eulalia. The Chuj of San Mateo Ixtat√°n remained rebellious and resisted Spanish control for longer than their highland neighbours, resistance that was possible owing to their alliance with the lowland Lakandon Ch ºol to the north. By the mid-16th century, the Spanish frontier expanding outwards from Comit√°n and Ocosingo reached the Lacandon Forest, and further advancement was impeded by the region's fiercely independent inhabitants. At the time of Spanish contact in the 16th century, the Lacandon Forest was inhabited by Ch ºol people referred to as Lakam Tun. This name was Hispanicised to Lacandon. The Lakandon were aggressive, and their numbers were swelled by refugees from neighbouring indigenous groups fleeing Spanish domination. The ecclesiastical authorities were so worried by this threat to their peaceful efforts at evangelisation that they eventually supported military intervention. The first Spanish expedition against the Lakandon was carried out in 1559; repeated expeditions into the Lacandon Forest succeeded in destroying some villages but did not manage to subdue the inhabitants of the region, nor bring it within the Spanish Empire. This successful resistance against Spanish attempts at domination served to attract ever more Indians fleeing colonial rule. In 1684, a council led by Enrique Enr√≠quez de Guzm√°n, the governor of Guatemala, decided on the reduction of San Mateo Ixtat√°n and nearby Santa Eulalia. On 29 January 1686, Captain Melchor Rodr√≠guez Mazariegos, acting under orders from the governor, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtat√°n, where he recruited indigenous warriors from the nearby villages. To prevent news of the Spanish advance reaching the inhabitants of the Lacandon area, the governor ordered the capture of three of San Mateo's community leaders, and had them sent under guard to be imprisoned in Huehuetenango. The governor joined Captain Rodr√≠guez Mazariegos in San Mateo Ixtat√°n on 3 February; he ordered the captain to remain in the village and use it as a base of operations for penetrating the Lacandon region. Two Spanish missionaries also remained in the town. Governor Enriquez de Guzm√°n subsequently left San Mateo Ixtat√°n for Comit√°n in Chiapas, to enter the Lacandon region via Ocosingo. =Conquest of the Lakandon, 1695‚Äì1696= In 1695 the colonial authorities decided to act upon a plan to connect the province of Guatemala with Yucat√°n, and a three-way invasion of the Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtat√°n, Cob√°n and Ocosingo. Captain Rodriguez Mazariegos, accompanied by Fray de Rivas and 6 other missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtat√°n. Following the same route used in 1686, they managed on the way to recruit 200 indigenous Maya warriors from Santa Eulalia, San Juan Solom√° and San Mateo. On 28 February 1695, all three groups left their respective bases of operations to conquer the Lacandon. The San Mateo group headed northeast into the Lacandon Jungle, and joined up with Jacinto de Barrios Leal, president of the Royal Audiencia of Guatemala. The soldiers commanded by Barrios Leal conquered a number of Ch ºol communities. The most important of these was Sakb ºajlan on the Lacant√∫n River, which was renamed as Nuestra Se√±ora de Dolores, or Dolores del Lakandon, in April 1695. The Spanish built a fort and garrisoned it with 30 Spanish soldiers. Mercederian friar Diego de Rivas was based at Dolores del Lakandon, and he and his fellow Mercederians baptised several hundred Lakandon Ch ºols in the following months and established contacts with neighbouring Ch ºol communities. The third group, under Juan D√≠az de Velasco, marched from Verapaz against the Itza of northern Pet√©n. Barrios Leal was accompanied by Franciscan friar Antonio Margil, who remained in Dolores del Lakandon until 1697. The Ch ºol of the Lacandon Forest were resettled in Huehuetenango, in the Guatemalan Highlands, in the early 18th century. Land of War: Verapaz, 1537‚Äì1555 alt=Painting of a balding man sitting at a desk and writing with a quill. He wears a dark religious robe and with a white hood and white undersleeves, and a crucifix pendant and is looking down at the three sheets of paper in front of him. His left hand is resting on an armrest. By 1537 the area immediately north of the new colony of Guatemala was being referred to as the Tierra de Guerra (\\"Land of War\\"). Paradoxically, it was simultaneously known as Verapaz (\\"True Peace\\"). The Land of War described an area that was undergoing conquest; it was a region of dense forest that was difficult for the Spanish to penetrate militarily. Whenever the Spanish located a centre of population in this region, the inhabitants were moved and concentrated in a new colonial settlement near the edge of the jungle where the Spanish could more easily control them. This strategy resulted in the gradual depopulation of the forest, simultaneously converting it into a wilderness refuge for those fleeing Spanish domination, both for individual refugees and for entire communities. The Land of War, from the 16th century through to the start of the 18th century, included a vast area from Sacapulas in the west to Nito on the Caribbean coast and extended northwards from Rabinal and Salam√°, and was an intermediate area between the highlands and the northern lowlands. Dominican friar Bartolom√© de las Casas arrived in the colony of Guatemala in 1537 and immediately campaigned to replace violent military conquest with peaceful missionary work. Las Casas offered to achieve the conquest of the Land of War through the preaching of the Catholic faith. In this way they congregated a group of Christian Indians in the location of what is now the town of Rabinal. Las Casas was instrumental in the introduction of the New Laws in 1542, established by the Spanish Crown to control the excesses of the colonists against the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas. As a result, the Dominicans met substantial resistance from the Spanish colonists; this distracted the Dominicans from their efforts to establish peaceful control over the Land of War. In 1555 Spanish friar Domingo de Vico offended a local Ch ºol ruler and was killed by the Acala Ch ºol and their Lakandon allies. In response to the killing, a punitive expedition was launched, headed by Juan Matalbatz, a Q ºeqchi º leader from Chamelco; the independent Indians captured by the Q ºeqchi º expedition were taken back to Cob√°n and resettled in Santo Tom√°s Ap√≥stol. The Dominicans established themselves in Xocolo on the shore of Lake Izabal in the mid-16th century. Xocolo became infamous among the Dominican missionaries for the practice of witchcraft by its inhabitants. By 1574 it was the most important staging post for European expeditions into the interior, and it remained important in that role until as late as 1630, although it was abandoned in 1631. Conquest and settlement in northern Yucat√°n, 1540‚Äì46  In 1540 Montejo the Elder, who was now in his late 60s, turned his royal rights to colonise Yucat√°n over to his son, Francisco Montejo the Younger. In early 1541 Montejo the Younger joined his cousin in Champton; he did not remain there long, and quickly moved his forces to Campeche. Once there Montejo the Younger, commanding between three and four hundred Spanish soldiers, established the first permanent Spanish town council in the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Shortly afterwards, Montejo the Younger summoned the local Maya lords and commanded them to submit to the Spanish Crown. A number of lords submitted peacefully, including the ruler of the Xiu Maya. The lord of the Canul Maya refused to submit and Montejo the Younger sent his cousin against them (also called Francisco de Montejo); Montejo the Younger remained in Campeche awaiting reinforcements. Montejo the Younger's cousin met the Canul Maya at Chakan, not far from T ºho. On 6 January 1542 he founded the second permanent town council, calling the new colonial town M√©rida. On 23 January, Tutul Xiu, the lord of Mani, approached the Spanish encampment at M√©rida in peace. He was greatly impressed by a Roman Catholic mass celebrated for his benefit and converted to the new religion. Tutul Xiu was the ruler of the most powerful province of northern Yucat√°n and his submission to Spain and conversion to Christianity had repercussions throughout the peninsula, and encouraged the lords of the western provinces of the peninsula to accept Spanish rule. The eastern provinces continued to resist Spanish overtures. Montejo the Younger sent his cousin to Chauaca where most of the eastern lords greeted him in peace. The Cochua and Cupul Maya resisted Spanish domination, but were quickly defeated. Montejo continued to the eastern Ekab province. When nine Spaniards were drowned in a storm off Cozumel and another was killed by hostile Maya, rumours grew in the telling and both the Cupul and Cochua provinces once again rose up against their would-be overlords. The Spanish hold on the eastern portion of the peninsula remained tenuous and a number of Maya polities remained independent, including Chetumal, Cochua, Cupul, Sotuta and the Tazes. On 8 November 1546 an alliance of eastern provinces launched a coordinated uprising against the Spanish. The provinces of Cupul, Cochua, Sotuta, Tazes, Uaymil, Chetumal and Chikinchel united in an effort to drive the invaders from the peninsula; the uprising lasted four months. Eighteen Spaniards were surprised in the eastern towns, and were sacrificed, and over 400 allied Maya were killed. M√©rida and Campeche were forewarned of the impending attack; Montejo the Younger and his cousin were in Campeche. Montejo the Elder arrived in M√©rida from Chiapas in December 1546, with reinforcements gathered from Champoton and Campeche. The rebellious eastern Maya were finally defeated in a single battle, in which twenty Spaniards and several hundred allied Maya were killed. This battle marked the final conquest of the northern portion of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. As a result of the uprising and the Spanish response, many of the Maya inhabitants of the eastern and southern territories fled to the still unconquered Pet√©n Basin, in the extreme south. Southern lowlands, 1618‚Äì97 The Pet√©n Basin covers an area that is now part of Guatemala; in colonial times it originally fell under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Yucat√°n, before being transferred to the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala in 1703. The Contact Period in the Pet√©n lowlands lasted from 1525 through to 1700. Superior Spanish weaponry and the use of cavalry, although decisive in the northern Yucat√°n, were ill- suited to warfare in the dense forests of lowland Pet√©n. =Early 17th century= 17th century entry routes to Pet√©n The leaders of Xocolo and Amatique, backed by the threat of Spanish action, persuaded a community of 190 Toquegua to settle on the Amatique coast in April 1604. The new settlement immediately suffered a drop in population. In 1628 the towns of the Manche Ch ºol were placed under the administration of the governor of Verapaz, with Francisco Mor√°n as their ecclesiastical head. Mor√°n moved Spanish soldiers into the region to protect against raids from the Itza to the north. The new Spanish garrison in an area that had not previously seen a heavy Spanish military presence provoked the Manche to revolt, which was followed by abandonment of the indigenous settlements. Following Cort√©s' visit in 1525, no Spanish attempted to visit the warlike Itza inhabitants of Nojpet√©n for almost a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from M√©rida on a mission to attempt the peaceful conversion of the still pagan Itza in central Pet√©n. Bartolom√© de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by some Christianised Maya. They were well received at Nojpet√©n by the current Kan Ek º. Attempts to convert the Itza failed, and the friars left Nojpet√©n on friendly terms with the Itza king. The friars returned in October 1619, and again Kan Ek º welcomed them in a friendly manner, but this time the Maya priesthood were hostile and the missionaries were expelled without food or water, but survived the journey back to M√©rida. In March 1622, Captain Francisco de Mirones Lezcano set out from Yucat√°n with 20 Spanish soldiers and 80 Mayas to launch an assault upon the Itza. His was joined by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado. In May the expedition advanced to Sakalum, where they waited for reinforcements. En route to Nojpet√©n, Delgado left the expedition to make his own way to Nojpet√©n with eighty Christianised Maya from Tipuj in Belize; he was joined by an escort of 13 soldiers. Soon after their arrival at the Itza capital, the Itza seized and sacrificed the Spanish party. Soon afterwards, on 27 January 1624, an Itza war party led by AjK ºin P ºol caught Mirones and his soldiers off guard and unarmed in the church at Sakalum and slaughtered them. Spanish reinforcements arrived too late. A number of local Maya men and women had also been killed, and the attackers burned the town. Following these massacres, the Maya governor of Oxkutzcab, Fernando Kamal, set out with 150 Maya archers to track AjK ºin P ºol down. The captured Itza captain and his followers were taken back to the Spanish Captain Antonio M√©ndez de Canzo, interrogated under torture, tried, and executed. These events ended all Spanish attempts to contact the Itza until 1695. In the 1640s internal strife in Spain distracted the government from attempts to conquer unknown lands; the Spanish Crown lacked the time, money or interest in such colonial adventures for the next four decades. =Late 17th century= In 1692 Basque nobleman Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a y Arizmendi proposed to the Spanish king the construction of a road from M√©rida southwards to link with the Guatemalan colony, in the process \\"reducing\\" any independent native populations into colonial congregaciones; this was part of a greater plan to subjugate the Lakandon and Manche Ch ºol of southern Pet√©n and the upper reaches of the Usumacinta River. At the beginning of March 1695, Captain Alonso Garc√≠a de Paredes led a group of 50 Spanish soldiers south into Kejache territory, accompanied by native guides, muleteers and labourers. He met with armed Kejache resistance, and retreated around the middle of April. In March 1695, Captain Juan D√≠az de Velasco set out from Cahab√≥n in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, with 70 Spanish soldiers, accompanied by a large number of Maya archers from Verapaz, native muleteers, and four Dominican friars. They pressed ahead to Lake Pet√©n Itz√° and engaged in a series of fierce skirmishes with Itza hunting parties. At the lakeshore, the Spanish encountered such a large force of Itzas that they retreated south, back to their main camp. The expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahab√≥n. In mid-May 1695 Garc√≠a again marched southwards from Campeche, with 115 Spanish soldiers and 150 Maya musketeers, plus Maya labourers and muleteers. The expedition was joined by two companies of Maya musketeers. Garc√≠a ordered the construction of a fort at Chuntuki, some 25 leagues (approximately 65 miles or 105 km) north of Lake Pet√©n Itz√°, which served as the main military base for the Camino Real (\\"Royal Road\\") project. The Sajkab ºchen company of native musketeers engaged in a skirmish with about 25 Kejache near the abandoned Kejache town of Chunpich. Several musketeers were injured, and the Kejache retreated without injury. The company seized large amounts of abandoned food from two more deserted settlements and then also retreated. A small group of Franciscans led by friar Andr√©s de Avenda√±o sought out the Chunpich Kejache that had engaged the Sajkab ºchen musketeers but were unable to find them, and Avenda√±o returned to M√©rida. Meanwhile, another group of Franciscans continued following the roadbuilders into Kejache territory. Around 3 August Garc√≠a moved his entire army forward to Chunpich, and by October Spanish soldiers had established themselves near the source of the San Pedro River. By November Tzuktok º was garrisoned with 86 soldiers and more at Chuntuki. In December 1695 the main force was reinforced with 250 soldiers, of which 150 were Spanish and pardo and 100 were Maya, together with labourers and muleteers. Franciscan expeditions, September 1695 ‚Äì January 1696 Juan de San Buenaventura's small group of Franciscans arrived in Chuntuki on 30 August 1695. In early November 1695, two Franciscans were sent to establish a mission at Pak ºek ºem, where they were well received by the cacique (native chief) and his pagan priest. Pak ºek ºem was sufficiently far from the new Spanish road that it was free from military interference, and the friars oversaw the building of a church in what was the largest mission town in Kejache territory. A second church was built at B ºatkab º to attend to over 100 K ºejache refugees who had been gathered there under the stewardship of a Spanish friar; a further church was established at Tzuktok º, overseen by another friar. Franciscan Andr√©s de Avenda√±o left M√©rida on 13 December 1695, and arrived in Nojpet√©n around 14 January 1696, accompanied by four companions. The Franciscans baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days. Avenda√±o tried to convince Kan Ek º to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish Crown, without success. The king of the Itza, cited Itza prophecy and said the time was not yet right. Kan Ek º learnt of a plot by the Kowoj and their allies to ambush and kill the Franciscans, and the Itza king advised them to return to M√©rida via Tipuj. February‚ÄìMarch 1696 When Captain Garc√≠a de Paredes arrived at Chuntuki in mid-January, he only had 90 soldiers plus labourers. Captain Pedro de Zubiaur, Garc√≠a's senior officer, arrived at Lake Pet√©n Itza with 60 musketeers, two Franciscans, and allied Yucatec Maya warriors. They were also accompanied by about 40 Maya porters. They were approached by about 300 canoes carrying approximately 2,000 Itza warriors. The warriors mingled freely with the Spanish party and the encounter degenerated into a skirmish. About a dozen of the Spanish party were seized, and three were killed. The Spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets, and the Itza retreated across the lake with their prisoners, who included the two Franciscans. The Spanish party retreated from the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were surrounded by thousands of Itza warriors. Zubiaur ordered his men to fire a volley that killed between 30 and 40 Itzas. Realising that they were hopelessly outnumbered, the Spanish retreated towards Chuntuki, abandoning their captured companions. Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a now began to organise an all-out assault on Nojpet√©n. Work on the road was redoubled and about a month after the battle at Ch ºich º the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore, now supported by artillery. A Guatemalan expedition against the Itza set out from Cahab√≥n in early 1696. An advance party was led into an Itza trap and 87 expedition members were lost, including 50 soldiers, two Dominicans and about 35 Maya helpers. The rest of the party arrived at the shore of Lake Pet√©n Itz√°, but quickly retreated back to Guatemala. Assault on Nojpet√©n Mart√≠n de Urz√∫a y Arizmendi arrived on the western shore of Lake Pet√©n Itz√° with his soldiers on 26 February 1697. Once there they built a heavily armed galeota attack boat, which carried 114 men and at least five artillery pieces. On 10 March, Urs√∫a received a mixed Itza and Yalain embassy in peace, and invited Kan Ek º to visit his encampment three days later. On the appointed day, Kan Ek º failed to arrive; instead Maya warriors amassed both along the shore and in canoes upon the lake. That morning, a waterbourne assault was launched upon Kan Ek's capital. The city fell after a brief but bloody battle in which many Itza warriors died; the Spanish suffered only minor casualties. After the battle the surviving defenders swam across to the mainland and melted away into the forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy the abandoned town. Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a renamed Nojpet√©n as Nuestra Se√±ora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza (\\"Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza\\"). Kan Ek º was soon captured with help from the Yalain Maya ruler Chamach Xulu; The Kowoj king was also soon captured, together with other Maya nobles and their families. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to the European colonisers. Final years of conquest During the campaign to conquer the Itza of Pet√©n, the Spanish sent expeditions to harass and relocate the Mopan north of Lake Izabal and the Ch ºol Maya of the Amatique forests to the east. They were resettled on the south shore of the lake. By the latter half of the 18th century, the local inhabitants consisted entirely of Spaniards, mulattos and others of mixed race, all associated with the Castillo de San Felipe de Lara fort guarding the entrance to Lake Izabal. There was a drastic depopulation of Lake Izabal and the Motagua Delta due to constant slave raids by the Miskito Sambu of the Caribbean coast that effectively ended the Maya population of the region; the captured Maya were sold into slavery, a common practise among the Miskito. In the late 17th century the small population of Ch ºol Maya in southern Pet√©n and Belize was forcibly removed to Alta Verapaz, where the people were absorbed into the Q ºeqchi º population. The Ch ºol of the Lacandon Jungle were resettled in Huehuetenango in the early 18th century. By 1699 the neighbouring Toquegua no longer existed as a separate people because of a combination of high mortality and intermarriage with the Amatique Indians. At around this time the Spanish decided on the reduction of the independent Mopan Maya living to the north of Lake Izabal. Catholic priests from Yucat√°n founded several mission towns around Lake Pet√©n Itz√° in 1702‚Äì1703. Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled in 1704, but although well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed and most of the mission towns were abandoned. By 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Pet√©n, compared to ten times that number in 1697. Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous groups also played their part. Legacy of the Spanish conquest The initial shock of the Spanish conquest was followed by decades of heavy exploitation of the indigenous peoples, allies and foes alike. Over the following two hundred years colonial rule gradually imposed Spanish cultural standards on the subjugated peoples. The Spanish reducciones created new nucleated settlements laid out in a grid pattern in the Spanish style, with a central plaza, a church and the town hall housing the civil government, known as the ayuntamiento. This style of settlement can still be seen in the villages and towns of the area. The introduction of Catholicism was the main vehicle for cultural change, and resulted in religious syncretism. Old World cultural elements came to be thoroughly adopted by Maya groups. The greatest change was replacement of the pre-Columbian economic order by European technology and livestock; this included the introduction of iron and steel tools to replace Neolithic tools, and of cattle, pigs and chickens. New crops were also introduced; however, sugarcane and coffee led to plantations that economically exploited native labour. Some indigenous elites such as the Xajil Kaqchikel noble family did manage to maintain a level of status into the colonial period. During the second half of the 18th century, adult male Indians were heavily taxed, often being forced into debt peonage. Western Pet√©n and neighbouring Chiapas remained sparsely populated, and the Maya inhabitants avoided contact with the Spanish.

The sources describing the Spanish conquest of Guatemala include those written by the Spanish themselves, among them two letters written by conquistador Pedro de Alvarado in 1524, describing the initial campaign to subjugate the Guatemalan Highlands. Gonzalo de Alvarado y Ch√°vez wrote an account that mostly supports that of Pedro de Alvarado. Pedro de Alvarado's brother Jorge wrote another account to the king of Spain that explained it was his own campaign of 1527‚Äì1529 that established the Spanish colony. Bernal D√≠az del Castillo wrote a lengthy account of the conquest of Mexico and neighbouring regions, the Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa√±a (\\"True History of the Conquest of New Spain\\"); his account of the conquest of Guatemala generally agrees with that of the Alvarados. He also included his own description of Cortes' expedition, and an account of the conquest of the Chiapas highlands. Conquistador Diego Godoy accompanied Luis Mar√≠n on his reconnaissance of Chiapas, and wrote an account of the battle against the inhabitants of Chamula. Hern√°n Cort√©s described his expedition to Honduras in the fifth letter of his Cartas de Relaci√≥n. Dominican friar Bartolom√© de las Casas wrote a highly critical account of the Spanish conquest of the Americas and included accounts of some incidents in Guatemala. The Tlaxcalan allies of the Spanish wrote their own accounts of the conquest; these included a letter to the Spanish king protesting at their poor treatment once the campaign was over. Other accounts were in the form of questionnaires answered before colonial magistrates to protest and register a claim for recompense. Two pictorial accounts painted in the stylised indigenous pictographic tradition have survived; these are the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan, and the Lienzo de Tlaxcala. Accounts of the conquest as seen from the point of view of the defeated highland Maya kingdoms are included in a number of indigenous documents, including the Annals of the Kaqchikels. A letter from the defeated Tz ºutujil Maya nobility to the Spanish king written in 1571 details the exploitation of the subjugated peoples. Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzm√°n was a colonial Guatemalan historian of Spanish descent who wrote La Recordaci√≥n Florida. The book was written in 1690 and is regarded as one of the most important works of Guatemalan history. Field investigation has tended to support the estimates of indigenous population and army sizes given by Fuentes y Guzm√°n. Title page of Historia de la Conquista de la Provincia de el Itza produced in 1701, four years after the fall of Nojpet√©n, by the relator of the Council of the Indies In 1688 colonial historian Diego L√≥pez de Cogolludo detailed the expeditions of the Spanish missionaries in 1618 and 1619 in his Los tres siglos de la dominaci√≥n espa√±ola en Yucat√°n o sea historia de esta provincia (\\"The three centuries of Spanish domination in Yucat√°n, or the history of this province\\"); he based it upon Fuensalida's report, which is now lost. Franciscan friar Andr√©s Avenda√±o y Loyola recorded his own account of his late 17th century journeys to Nojpet√©n. When the Spanish finally conquered Pet√©n in 1697 they produced a vast quantity of documentation. Juan de Villagutierre Soto-Mayor was a Spanish colonial official who wrote the Historia de la Conquista de la Provincia de el Itza, reduccion, y progressos de la de el Lacandon, y otras naciones de indios barbaros, de la mediacion de el Reyno de Guatimala, a las provincias del Yucatan en la Am√©rica Septentrional (\\"History of the Conquest of the Province of the Itza, reduction, and advances in that of the Lacandon, and other nations of barbarous indians, and the intervention of the Kingdom of Guatemala, and the provinces of Yucatan in Northern America\\"). This detailed the history of Pet√©n from 1525 through to 1699.

At the third and final match-up Liddell once again won, making it 2‚Äì1 for himself, by TKO at 1:28 in the second round. Background Before the first meeting between the two, Randy Couture fought at heavyweight and was heavyweight champion twice before the first match-up. Couture moved down to light heavyweight after two consecutive losses against larger grapplers Josh Barnett, and Ricco Rodriguez, both with the heavyweight title at stake. Liddell was a rising light heavyweight contender before the first fight. Couture had developed a feared reputation as a wrestler who could strike. Going on a 9 fight win streak before the fight with Couture, Liddell had 11 victories with only one loss to submission specialist Jeremy Horn. UFC 43: Meltdown The origins of the trilogy go back to UFC 36 on March 22, 2002 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Randy Couture was the defending UFC heavyweight champion and was making his third title defense against grappling standout Josh Barnett. Couture was controlling the majority of the fight until Barnett took his back and delivered a series of unanswered strikes to the head before the referee stopped the bout at 4:35 of the second round. Following the event, Barnett tested positive for steroids in a post-fight drug test and was stripped of the title and suspended by the Nevada Athletic Commission. Meanwhile, Chuck Liddell was scheduled to fight Brazilian boxer Vitor Belfort at UFC 37.5 in June in Las Vegas to determine the number one contender for the UFC light-heavyweight championship. Liddell won by unanimous decision. While it was expected that Liddell would face Tito Ortiz (his friend and former training partner) for the title, Ortiz expressed desire for a grudge match against mixed martial arts pioneer Ken Shamrock. Ortiz and Shamrock finally met in November at UFC 40. Ortiz dominated Shamrock with multiple strikes and takedowns and won the bout by TKO (corner stoppage) at 5:00 of the third round. Earlier that night, Liddell defeated Renato Sobral by KO (head kick) in the first round. After the fight, Liddell stated that he wanted his next fight to be for the light-heavyweight title. Ortiz said later that he and Liddell would have to renegotiate things, stating that their friendship wasn't worth the money they were being paid to fight. Following the steroids controversy with Barnett, Couture faced heavyweight grappler Ricco Rodriguez at UFC 39 in September 2002 for the vacant UFC heavyweight title. Again, Couture found himself in control of the fight until Rodriguez delivered multiple strikes and elbows from the mounted position and was declared the new heavyweight champion at 3:04 of the fifth round. Many fans and critics believed that Couture at the age of 38 years was done as a mixed martial artist believing that he was too small and old to compete with the younger heavyweights following his second consecutive loss. Proceedings were not going well with the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship. Ortiz was in a contractual dispute with the company and refused to defend his title against Liddell, citing injuries, entertainment obligations, and inadequate pay. After months of failed negotiations, the UFC created an interim light heavyweight title to be fought for in June 2003 at UFC 43 in an effort pressure Ortiz to return and defend his title. As a special attraction for the fans, the UFC decided to have Randy Couture move down from heavyweight to light heavyweight and face Chuck Liddell for the interim belt. Many believed Liddell would easily defeat Couture and eventually face Ortiz to unify the title. Couture was a heavy underdog going into the fight with critics citing his age and recent losses at heavyweight. In what was a shock to the MMA world, Couture neutralized Liddell's powerful hooks with straight punches and eventually began taking him down at will. Couture eventually gained full mount and forced a referee stoppage due to punches at 2:39 of round 3. With this victory, Couture earned the nickname \\"Captain America\\" and became the first MMA fighter to win a professional title in another weight class. Liddell would leave to represent the UFC in the Japanese Pride Fighting Championships and would not fight again in the UFC for nearly a year. Couture went on to face Tito Ortiz at UFC 44 for the undisputed UFC Light Heavyweight Championship in September 2003. Couture was again a major underdog going into the fight. Couture won a unanimous decision in dominant fashion culminating to Couture spanking Ortiz in the final moments of round 5 despite Ortiz's corner men yelling he's tapping and became the undisputed UFC light heavyweight champion at age 40. UFC 52: Couture vs. Liddell 2 After their losses to Randy Couture in 2003, Liddell and Ortiz's friendship quickly disintegrated and the two became bitter rivals. Liddell was angry that Ortiz refused to fight him for the light heavyweight championship, claiming Tito knew Liddell could beat him. Stories say that while Liddell and Ortiz were training partners, Chuck always got the better of Tito by stuffing takedowns and landing multiple kicks and body shots. Ortiz however maintained that he simply did not wish to fight a friend and that the two had made a pact not to fight each other. Liddell claimed there was no such pact. The war of words continued for months and fans demanded that Chuck and Tito fight. The fight finally happened on April 2, 2004 at UFC 47 in what was billed as the biggest grudge match in mixed martial arts. Liddell defeated Ortiz by KO (punches) at :38 of the second round. Chuck became somewhat of a celebrity following his victory, appearing in multiple commercials, late night talk shows, and music videos. Liddell once again found himself as the number one contender for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship when he defeated Vernon White by KO (punch) at 4:05 of the first round at UFC 49 in August 2004. Later at that same event, Randy Couture defeated Vitor Belfort for the light heavyweight title by TKO (doctor stoppage) at the end of the third round, setting up a rematch between him and Liddell for the title in 2005. The UFC was gaining in popularity in America and the organization's parent company Zuffa decided to broaden the fan base. They created The Ultimate Fighter reality TV show. Sixteen mixed martial arts fighters (eight Light Heavyweights weighing from 186 to 205 lbs and eight Middleweights weighing from 171 to 185 lbs) were invited to participate in the show where they would reside together and train in two separate teams coached by Chuck Liddell and Randy Couture. The teams would compete in physical challenges, segments hosted by singer Willa Ford, to determine which team would have the right to pair one of their own fighters against an opponent of their choice in the same weight class, with the loser being eliminated. Although opposing coaches and future opponents in the octagon, Randy and Chuck were very respectful, civil, and friendly towards each other during the taping of the show, co-developing workout routines for all the aspiring fighters, as well as dealing with some serious incidents between the participants at the house. MMA exploded in popularity during the first season on Spike TV with the finale peaking with 10 million viewers during the Forrest Griffin vs. Stephan Bonnar fight. The weekend following The Ultimate Fighter 1 Finale, Randy and Chuck faced off again in the main event at UFC 52 in Las Vegas on April 16, 2005, for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship. This would be remembered as one of the best and most important pay-per-view cards the UFC ever put together. At the time, it was the highest-grossing UFC event ever at the live gate, with $2,575,450 in ticket sales. The event also earned 280,000 PPV buys, shattering the company's previous record of 150,000 buys at UFC 40. Chuck stated that he underestimated Randy at their last bout which caused him to neglect his stamina and he would not make that mistake again. Randy on the other hand predicted that the rematch would end the same way the first fight did. The start of the match saw both fighters start on their feet feeling out the distance and attempting multiple jabs and hooks. Then Couture got Liddell in the clinch and the two exchanged multiple uppercuts and strikes. After the two broke away, Couture signaled to the referee that he had been accidentally poked in the eye which caused the referee to call for a time-out. After about a minute of examination, the ringside doctor said Couture was okay to continue the fight. Angered by the poke, Couture rushed at Liddell with multiple strikes. Seeing an opportunity, Chuck back-pedalled and caught Randy on the jaw with a straight right hand which sent him crumbling to the mat which was followed by two more unanswered strikes and caused the referee to stop the fight at 2:06 of round one and Chuck Liddell was declared the new UFC Light Heavyweight Champion. UFC 57: Liddell vs. Couture 3 Following their UFC 52 rematch, both fighters' visibility in mainstream media increased dramatically. Revenues and the fighter pay-scale also increased and Spike TV ordered a second season of The Ultimate Fighter following the huge success of the first season and would become the network's signature program as well as the new UFC Unleashed program which aired UFC fights from past events. Everyone expected Randy Couture and Chuck Liddell to meet again a rubber match for the title. Until then, Couture would have to earn his title shot and Liddell would have to defend his championship before a third fight could be considered. Both fighters were scheduled to fight on the UFC 54 card on August 20, 2005 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Randy faced fellow wrestler and former teammate Mike van Arsdale in what was a very competitive grappling match. Randy took control in the second round with his superior conditioning. He then defeated a visibly gassed van Arsdale by submission (Anaconda Choke) at :52 of the third round and became the number one contender for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship. Later that same night in the main event, Liddell fought in his first title defense against the first fighter to ever defeat him, Jeremy Horn. Although Chuck was the clear favorite as the champion, many die-hard fans gave Horn a good chance given his vast fighting experience with a professional record of 85‚Äì15‚Äì5 and the fact that he beat Liddell once before. Liddell dominated Horn with powerful strikes during the first two rounds, knocking him down twice. Horn did come back and outbox Liddell in the third round as Chuck seemed to slow down a little. In the fourth round Chuck delivered a straight right hand which caught Horn on the eye-socket and sent him to the ground again. Horn then told the referee that he could no longer see clearly and the ref ruled Liddell the winner at 2:46 of round 4 by TKO (Verbal Submission). The stage was now set a rubber match between Liddell and Couture for the UFC Light Heavyweight title. The two fighters would meet again in the main event at UFC 57 on February 4, 2006. This would be at the time the UFC's largest grossing gate with $3.3 million in sales. The event would again shatter the previous PPV buy rate with over 400,000 buys. Randy stated that the accidental eye poke by Liddell in their last fight caused him to be angry and reckless which left him vulnerable to the knockout and that he would not make that mistake again. Chuck said he was looking to knockout Randy for a second time. The two exchanged strikes for the majority of the first round with Liddell getting a cut above his eye and Couture receiving a broken nose by an uppercut. Couture then stole the first round with two successful takedowns at the end of the round. The second round went much the same way with both fighters keeping the fight on the feet. As Couture lunged forward with a telegraphed big right hand, he slipped on a loose piece of the canvas causing him to lose his balance. Liddell took advantage of this, sidestepping the now off-balance Couture and caught him with a big right hook to the chin. Couture fell to his knees and Liddell pounce with several more strikes to the head. The referee stepped in and stopped the fight at 1:28 of the second and ruled Liddell the winner by TKO. Immediately following the fight in a post-fight interview with UFC commentator Joe Rogan, Couture announced his retirement from professional mixed martial arts, although he would continue as a UFC commentator and a coach for MMA fighters. Aftermath Following their rubber match, both fighters continued to be very visible figures in the MMA world, with Liddell as the reigning UFC Light heavyweight Champion and Couture as an MMA commentator and coach. Liddell would go on to defend his belt multiple times before losing it to Quinton Jackson at UFC 71. Couture would eventually come out of retirement to fight and defeat Tim Sylvia at UFC 68 for the UFC Heavyweight Title. Both began making multiple appearances in movies and television shows which helped mixed martial arts grow even more in popularity. \\"The Iceman\\" has recently retired after a three fight losing streak against fellow former UFC Light Heavyweight Champions Rashad Evans, Mauricio Rua, and former UFC Middleweight Champion Rich Franklin. Couture would continue fighting until the age of 47 and go on a three fight win streak including victories over Brandon Vera, fellow UFC Hall of Famer and former UFC Heavyweight Champion Mark Coleman, and 11 time boxing champion James Toney. \\"The Natural\\" would fight fellow former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Lyoto Machida at UFC 129. After a brutal flying front kick knockout, Couture would once again declare his resignation from Mixed martial arts at the age of 47. Today, many sports and media analysts credit Couture and Liddell for bringing mixed martial arts into the mainstream of American sports and entertainment. During this time, Couture joined MMA legends Royce Gracie, Ken Shamrock and Dan Severn by becoming the fourth inductee into the UFC Hall of Fame. Liddell joined Couture when he was inducted into the Hall of Fame in July 2009.

The wars were mainly about control of the Rhine delta. After the death of the Frisian king Redbad, the Franks gained the upper hand. In 734 at the Battle of the Boarn the Frisians were defeated and the Franks annexed the Frisian lands between the Vlie and the Lauwers. Only the Frisians east of the Lauwers remained independent. In 772 they lost their independence as well. The wars ended with the last uprising of the Frisians in 793 and the pacification of the Frisians by Charlemagne. Background The displacements of peoples during the Migration Period resulted in the Frisian settlements in the north and the west of the Low Countries the Saxons in the east, the Warnen at the mouth of the Rhine and the Franks further south around the Scheldt. There, under the leadership of their Merovingian kings, they had an important role in the politics in northern Gaul. The Frisians consisted of loosely bonded tribes centered on war bands but without great power. In the second half of the 7th century the Frisian kingdom reached its maximum geographic development. The Frisian kings became interested in former Frankish lands; under the leadership of the predecessors of Aldgisl they expanded their power to the heart of the Low Countries. The presence of the Warnen at the mouth of the Rhine remains unclear, but it appears they were likely crushed between the Frisians and Franks. Rhine delta control Though the Merovingian king of the Franks Chilperic I (561-584) is mentioned in Frankish sources as the \\"terror of the Frisians and the Suebi\\", there is evidence that around 600 the Frisians were successful in a war led by their king Audulf. This allowed the Frisians to expand further south. By 630 the situation had changed. The Merovingian king Dagobert I brought the Frankish empire under one banner again and conquered the lands south of the Oude Rijn. This time they brought Christianity to the Frisian lands and built a church in Utrecht. After Dagobert died the Franks could not hold their position there, and around 650 the central river area, including Dorestad became Frisian again. The manufacturing of Frankish coins stopped and the city of Utrecht became the residence of the Frisian kings. Under the rule of King Aldgisl the Frisians came into conflict with the Frankish mayor of the palace Ebroin. This time the conflict was about the old Roman border fortifications. Aldgisl kept the Franks at a bay with his army maneuvers. In 678 he welcomed the English bishop Wilfrid, who like him was not a friend of the Franks. Frisian sceattas from approximately 710 to 735 Under the successor of Aldgisl, Redbad, the tide turned in favour of the Franks: in 690 the Franks were victorious in the battle of Dorestad under the mayor of the palace Pepin of Herstal. Though not all the consequences of this battle are clear, Dorestad became Frankish again, as did the castles of Utrecht and Fechten. It is thought that the influence of the Franks now extended from south of the Oude Rijn to the coast, but this is not entirely clear because the Frisians did not entirely lose control over the central river area. In any case there was an Archbishopric or bishopric of the Frisians founded for Willibrord it Liber Pontificalis (Corpus XXXVI 1, side 168) en Beda Venerabilis (Corpus XLVI9, page 218) and a marriage was held between Grimoald the Younger the oldest son of Pepin, and Thiadsvind, the daughter of Redbad in 711. After Pepin died in 714, Redbad took advantage of the battle for succession in Frankish lands. He concluded a treaty with the Frankish mayor of the palace Ragenfrid so that in 716 his armies entered Frankish territory as far as Cologne, where they were victorious in the Battle of Cologne. In this way all lands south of the Rhine became Frisian again. The army returned to the north with much war loot. Redbad made plans to invade the Frankish empire for the second time and mobilised a large army. But before he could do this he fell ill and died in the autumn of 719. It is not certain who the successor of Redbad was. It is believed that there were troubles with the succession, because the Frankish opponent Charles Martel easily invaded Frisia and subjugated the territory. The resistance was so weak that Charles Martel not only annexed Frisia Citerior (\\"nearer\\" Frisia south of the Rhine), but he also crossed the Rhine and annexed \\"farther\\" Frisia, to the banks of the river Vlie. The end of independent Frisia In 733, Charles Martel sent an army against the Frisians. The Frisian king Poppo was defeated and his army pushed back to Eastergoa. The next year, Charles ferried an army across the Almere with a fleet that enabled him to sail up to De Boarn. The Frisians were defeated in Battle of the Boarn that followed, and their king, Poppo, was killed. The victors plundered and burned non-Christian sanctuaries. Charles Martel returned with much loot, and broke the power of the Frisian kings for good. The Franks annexed the Frisian lands between the Vlie and the Lauwers. =Annexation of East Frisia= The Frankish king Charlemagne brought an end to the independence of the Frisians east of the Lauwers as well, expanding the Frankish Empire further to the east. The war began with a campaign against the East Frisians and was then continued against the Saxons, where the Saxon Wars would last thirty-two years. In 772, Charles attacked the Frisians east of the Lauwers and the Saxons with a large army. He defeated them in several battles and so the last independent Frisian lands and the lands of the Saxons came into Frankish hands. Frisian uprisings After their defeat, the Frisians rebelled against the Franks several times. =Murder of Saint Boniface= Boniface The first Frisian bishop Boniface set out for Frisia in 754 with a small retinue. He baptized a great number and summoned a general meeting for confirmation at a place not far from Dokkum, between Franeker and Groningen. Instead of the converts he expected, a group of armed inhabitants appeared. The Frisian warriors were angry because he had destroyed their shrines. They slew the aged archbishop because, according to Boniface's hagiographer, they believed the chests he carried with him contained gold and other riches. They were dismayed when they discovered that the chest only contained the bishop's books. =Uprising of 782-785= Under the leadership of Widukind the Saxons continued to resist the Franks. In 782 the Frisians east of the Lauwers also began an uprising against the Franks. The uprising expanded to Frisian lands in the west that had been pacified earlier. This led to an en masse return to paganism by the population. Marauders burned churches and the priests, including Ludger, had to flee south. In response Charlemagne organized a new campaign in 783 to restore control, first over the Saxons and later over the Frisians. The Frisians aided Widukind against the Franks in 784 by sending him an army. It did not help much and he had to surrender in 785 and the Frisian uprising was severely repressed by the Franks. =Uprising of 793= In 793 the Frisians rebelled for the last time against Charlemagne. The reason for this was the forceful recruiting of Frisians and Saxons for the war against the Avars in the east. Under the leadership of dukes Unno and Eilrad, an uprising arose east of the Lauwers and spread to other Frisian lands. This led to a temporary return to paganism, and again priests had to flee. This uprising was also suppressed by the Franks.

He published more than 40 books and won several literary awards, including his country's most notable award, the Grand Prix Schiller, in 1997.\\"Leading writer dies: One of French-speaking Switzerland's best known authors, Maurice Chappaz, has died at the age of 92.\\", 15 January 2009, article at the SwissInfo.ch website, retrieved same day  Biography  Born in Lausanne, Maurice Chappaz spent his childhood between Martigny and the abbey of Le Ch√¢ble, in the Swiss canton of Valais. Born of a family of lawyers and solicitors, nephew of Valaisian secretary of State Maurice Troillet, he studied at Saint-Maurice Abbey High School, then he registered first in Law School at the University of Lausanne, but quickly left it to study litt√©rature in the University of Geneva, which he also left a few months later. A poet above all, Maurice Chappaz published his first text, Un homme qui vivait couch√© sur un banc, in December 1939. On that occasion, he was encouraged by Charles-Ferdinand Ramuz and Gustave Roud. 1983 But as of the summer of 1940, World War II put an end to his availability. He thus had to patrol the Swiss borders and published several texts in the review Lettres which would be collected in 1944 into Les Grandes Journ√©es de Printemps hailed by Paul Eluard. In 1942, he met S. Corinna Bille, painter Edmond Bille's daughter, whom he would marry in 1947 and with whom he would have three children, Blaise, Achille and Marie-No√´lle. After Corinna's death in 1979, he remarried in 1992, with Mich√®ne Caussignac, widow of the travel-writer Lorenzo Pestelli. Adieu √† Maurice Chappaz After the end of World War II, Maurice Chappaz travelled in Europe. Without any regular occupation and yearning to devote his time to writing, he became an occasional press correspondent while managing his uncle's vineyard in Valais. As he went through serious personal turmoil, he tried new experiences after another and his hand at different jobs while at the same time still more questions cropped up in his mind. In 1953, the publishing of the Testament du Haut-Rh√¥ne crowned a ten-year poetic quest. The book, noted by Charles-Albert Cingria, was a success (its author got awarded the Prix Rambert), yet, the poet was forced to rethink himself and was thrown into a deep despair. To see the world from a new perspective, he decided to join the Grande Dixence Dam building site, where he would work as a surveyor-attendant. This experience would reconcile him with poetry Maurice Chappaz, a film by Jean-No√´l Cristiani,2001,52' and its outcome would be the Chant de la Grande Dixence (written as of 1959, and published in 1965). Later to be followed by Portrait des Valaisans en L√©gende et en V√©rit√© (1965), Office des Morts (written in 1963, and published in 1966) or Tendres Campagnes(written in 1962, and published in 1966). Maurice Chappaz carried out still other numerous trips around the world : Laponia (1968), Paris (1968), Nepal and Tibet (1970), Mount Athos (1972), Lebanon (1974), Russia (1974 et 1979), China (1981), Quebec and New York (1990). In the 1970s, the press and the Valaisian population were divided over the publishing of his book Les Maquereaux des cimes blanches (The Mackerels of the White Ridges), which is a pamphlet against the tourist industry that wreaks havoc in the genuine Valais. On that occasion, students from Saint-Maurice would write \\" Vive Chappaz \\" (long live Chappaz) in huge white capital letters on the cliff overlooking the abbey. On Corinna Bille's death, in 1979, he left Veyras, where they had moved in in 1957, and he settled in Le Ch√¢ble abbey, which belonged to his mother's side. Then he published poems alternating between the burlesque and a deathly tone (A rire et √† mourir, 1983), he began a 6000 pages Journal, held continuously from 1981 to 1987, and wrote a tale and poetical prose dealing with mourning (Octobre 79 and Le Livre de C., 1986). Eager to publish his wife Corinna Bille's unpublished writings, left behind at her death, and taking over the translation from Virgil for √©ditions Gallimard (1987) and Theocritus' Idylls (1992), he drafted a picture of the Alpine ancient civilization in Valais-Tibet (2000). In 1997, Maurice Chappaz was awarded Grand Prix Shiller, the most prestigious Swiss award, and that same year, he was also awarded, in France, the Poetry Bourse Goncourt for the whole of his work. In Autumn 2001, √âvangile selon Judas (Gospel according to Judas), a theological fictitious tale, was published by Gallimard. In 2002, he wrote a text titled Lettre d'une for√™t √† l'autre which was published in the art review Trou (issue n¬∞12) ; the head edition (100 issues numbered and signed) contained a facsimile of the manuscript of his thank speech for his title of Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres, delivered in Martigny in Autumn 2001 for the French ambassador. Chappaz's last published book before his death was La Pipe qui prie et fume, in 2008. Maurice Chappaz's interview, November 2008 Maurice Chappaz died on 15 January 2009 in Martigny hospital. His estate is archived in the Swiss Literary Archives in Bern.

Hoagland (1912-1995) was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and attended Stanford University and Harvard Business School. During World War II he served with the Military Planning Division of the Quartermaster Corps. In 1946 he obtained a job with the Field Service Staff of the Republican National Committee, in which he campaigned for Republican congressmen in marginal districts.Marquis Who's Who. Who's Who in the East: 18th Edition, 1981-1982. Chicago, Illinois, Marquis Who's Who. Pg. 354 During 1947 and 1948 he was Deputy Director of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. In August 1948 he resigned from the Committee to campaign for Republican congressional candidates. After the 1948 election Hoagland obtained a job with the American Research and Development Corporation of Boston, Massachusetts, where he worked for over twenty years. However, he continued to be active in Republican politics, and took frequent leaves of absence from his job to help with Republican campaign work. Down to 1954 Hoagland continued to assist Republican candidates in marginal districts, particularly in Indiana, Ohio and Colorado. In 1954 he began to work as an advance man for President Dwight D. Eisenhower‚Äôs campaign trips.In this capacity he would go to cities that the President was planning to visit and make all the local arrangements. He helped arrange for coverage of the visit by local news media. He helped plan the route of the President's motorcade and convinced local businesses to allow their employees to leave work at the time of the motorcade so large crowds could be assembled as the President passed. Hoagland also met with local Republican leaders to determine who would travel with the President or sit with him at local events, a matter of great importance to politicians who hoped to gain recognition by being seen with the President. Hoagland kept extensive notebooks regarding his work as an advance man, and also collected schedules and local newspaper articles about the President's trips. The last trip he planned for Eisenhower was a proposed visit to Liberal, Kansas, in October 1964, after Eisenhower had left the White House. The trip was cancelled at the last minute due to the death of former president Herbert Hoover. References External links * Papers of Henry W. Hoagland, Dwight D.

Early life Born in Dublin, Parker was the son of another Rev. John Parker (d. 1643), also a Church of Ireland clergyman, dean of Leighlin (1618‚Äì37) and then of Killaloe, County Clare until his death. A John Parker is recorded as a scholar of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1636.Gilbert, J. T., rev. by Jason McElligott, 'Parker, John (d. 1681), Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin' in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (OUP, 2004) Career Parker was ordained a deacon in 1638 and in 1642 became a minor canon of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. He was prebendary of Rathangan, in the diocese of Kildare, and in 1643 prebendary of Maynooth at St Patrick's and of St Michan's at Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, both benefices previously held by his father. When his father died in 1643 he succeeded him as dean of Killaloe. During the early years of the Irish Confederate Wars, Parker was in Dublin as chaplain to the Earl of Ormond, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. In 1649, the Cromwellian authorities deprived him of all his offices and imprisoned him as a suspected Royalist spy, although his patron Ormond was able to get his release after only a few months in an exchange of prisoners. In 1650, Parker went to England. He stayed there until the Restoration, when he was one of the Irish Royalist clergymen who secured new preferments. Appointed Bishop of Elphin on 6 August 1660, he was consecrated in Dublin on 27 January 1661, the day after he was made a Doctor of Divinity by the University of Dublin.Fryde, E. B., et al., Handbook of British Chronology (Cambridge University Press, 1996) pp. 392‚Äì393 Parker was a member of the committee of the Irish House of Lords which drafted a declaration in 1661 to continue the Anglican basis of the Church of Ireland. In August 1661 he was sent to London to present the Convocation's case to the king, and he stayed there until March 1662. On 9 August 1667, Parker was appointed Archbishop of Tuam, a position which brought with it the sees of Annaghdown and Kilfenora.

Since the passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Immigration Statistics has responsibility to carry out two statutory requirements: 1) to collect and disseminate to Congress and the public data and information useful in evaluating the social, economic, environmental, and demographic impact of immigration laws; and 2) to establish standards of reliability and validity for immigration statistics collected by the department's operational Components.  Introduction  Located within the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans and with a mission focused on data collection and analysis, the Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) is uniquely positioned to gather information from across the department and the entire federal government and to perform these centralizing analytic and dissemination functions. In so doing, the office provides critical support to three of the department's five core missions: Prevent Terrorism and Enhance Security (Mission 1), Secure and Manage Our Borders (Mission 2), and Enforce and Administer Our Immigration Laws (Mission 3). The complexity of the immigration mission space drives further demand for high quality data and analysis from a range of policy stakeholders. The department's operational components require cross-cutting data to complete certain enforcement activities and to adjudicate certain claims. Congress seeks regular and comprehensive reporting on immigration benefits, immigration enforcement, border security, and migration inflows. Under the department's analytic agenda, senior leaders rely on detailed operational data and outcome metrics for strategic planning. Other executive branch actors also depend on empirical analysis to monitor and refine immigration policy. Most importantly, a firm commitment to transparency anchored in the collection and dissemination of clear and credible immigration data is essential to combating widespread confusion and misinformation about immigration trends, and to contribute to a more informed policy debate. Since 2015, the department's commitment to empirical analysis and transparency has driven a major rebuilding effort, along with an effort to integrate the department's diverse and disparate immigration data systems. The newly reinvigorated Office of Immigration Statistics brings a unified and coordinated approach to supporting the homeland security mission. In doing so, OIS will foster cooperation and collaboration among the department's components to achieve a high level of quality data; to lead immigration research; to increase communication with partners, stakeholders, and customers; and to inform the department's overall decision-making process.  History  OIS builds on a nearly two-century legacy of collecting and summarizing data on immigration into the United States. Such reporting began with the \\"Steerage\\" (or \\"Passenger\\") Act of March 2, 1819, which required the Secretary of State to report to each session of Congress on the age, sex, occupation, and origins of passengers on arriving vessels. The Department of State performed these duties until the early 1870s, after which responsibility shifted to the Treasury Department's Bureau of Statistics, followed by the Department of Commerce and Labor in 1903, and then the Department of Labor in 1913. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was transferred from the Department of Labor to the Department of Justice in 1940, where it resided until 2003, when the components of INS were subsumed under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Section 103 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 establishes OIS's modern mandate: in consultation with interested academics, government agencies, and other parties, to provide Congress and the public, on an annual basis, with information about immigration and the impact of immigration laws. Section 701 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred these duties from the Statistics Branch of the Office of Policy and Planning of the INS to the DHS Undersecretary for Management, and charged OIS with establishing standards of reliability and validity for immigration statistics. OIS currently sits within DHS's Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans, and collects data from DHS's various operational Components, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), as well as from other Federal agencies such as the Department of Justice, the Department of State, and the U.S. Census Bureau. OIS meets these reporting mandates primarily through its flagship publication, The Yearbook of Immigration Statistics. The Yearbook reports on five immigration topics: lawful permanent residents, refugees and asylees, naturalizations, nonimmigrant admissions, and enforcement actions. In addition to the yearbook, OIS publishes annual flow reports and population estimates that provide additional details on trends within each of these areas, and the office publishes additional reports and fact sheets on special topics as the need arises. Mission, Vision, and Values The Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) mission, vision, and values provide the conceptual framework underlying all its objectives, goals, and projects. = Mission = The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Immigration Statistics leads the collection and dissemination to Congress and the public of statistical information and analysis useful in evaluating the social, economic, environmental, and demographic impact of immigration laws, migration flows, and immigration enforcement; the office establishes standards of reliability and validity for the department's immigration statistics; and the office develops other immigration-related reports and conducts research at the direction of the Secretary. = Vision = * The U.S. government's premier organization for immigration statistics and for analysis of immigration and immigration enforcement; recognized by the public, the federal partners, and the immigration research community for policy-relevant, accurate, timely, and credible immigration data, research, and analysis. * The U.S. government leader for integration of all immigration-related data, systems and standards. * The department's in-house think tank for department-wide immigration research and analysis to provide cutting edge policy-relevant research, continuously engaging with our partners, stakeholders, and customers to maximize the relevance, quality, and reach of OIS research. = Values = OIS values and respects its data partners, customers, and workforce, who are essential to the development, dissemination, and use of statistical information on immigration. Our organization and its people have three core values: PROFESSIONALISM, TRANSPARENCY, and TEAMWORK. * Professionalism: OIS adheres to the highest professional standards for a statistical agency, always ensuring that our data are valid, reliable, and objective. * Transparency: OIS is transparent about our methodology and data sources, and strives to make research and data readily accessible to Congress and the public. * Teamwork: The OIS team works cooperatively toward common goals, in close collaboration with our data partners, customers, and other stakeholders.  Strategic Plan Summary  # Lead the DHS effort to integrate immigration-related data across the Federal Government. # Improve the quality, timeliness, and utility of DHS immigration statistical data and analysis. # Improve the dissemination of OIS products to inform policy-makers, Congress, and the public. # Serve as an in- house DHS think-tank on immigration issues. # Maintain a high-quality, motivated workforce and provide the environment to support it.  Core Reports  = The Yearbook of Immigration Statistics = The Yearbook of Immigration Statistics is a compendium of tables that provides data on foreign nationals who, during a fiscal year, were granted lawful permanent residence (i.e., admitted as immigrants or became legal permanent residents), were admitted into the United States on a temporary basis (e.g., tourists, students, or workers), applied for asylum or refugee status, or were naturalized. The Yearbook also presents data on immigration enforcement actions, including alien apprehensions, removals, and returns. = Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) = Lawful permanent residents (LPRs), also known as \\"green card\\" holders, are non-citizens who are lawfully authorized to live permanently within the United States. LPRs may accept an offer of employment without special restrictions, own property, receive financial assistance at public colleges and universities, and join the Armed Forces. They also may apply to become U.S. citizens if they meet certain eligibility requirements. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides several broad classes of admission for foreign nationals to gain LPR status, the largest of which focuses on admitting immigrants for the purpose of family reunification. Other major categories include economic and humanitarian immigrants, as well as immigrants from countries with relatively low levels of immigration to the United States. The Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) Annual Flow Reports on LPRs contain information obtained from foreign nationals' applications for LPR status on the number and characteristics of persons who became LPRs during a given fiscal year. = Refugees and Asylees = A refugee is a person outside his or her country of nationality who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country of nationality because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. An asylee is a person who meets the definition of refugee and is already present in the United States or is seeking admission at a port of entry. Refugees are required to apply for Lawful Permanent Resident (\\"green card\\") status one year after being admitted, and asylees may apply for green card status one year after their grant of asylum. The Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) Annual Flow Reports on refugees and asylees contain information obtained from the Worldwide Refugee Admissions Processing System (WRAPS) of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration of the U.S. Department of State on the numbers and demographic profiles of persons admitted to the United States as refugees, and those applying for and granted asylum status during a given fiscal year. = Naturalizations = Naturalization confers U.S. citizenship upon foreign nationals who have fulfilled the requirements Congress established in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). After naturalization, foreign-born citizens enjoy nearly all of the same benefits, rights, and responsibilities that the Constitution gives to native-born U.S. citizens, including the right to vote. The Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) Annual Flow Reports on naturalization contain information obtained from naturalization applications on the number and characteristics of persons aged 18 years and older who became naturalized US citizens during a given fiscal year. = Nonimmigrant Admissions = Nonimmigrants are foreign nationals granted temporary admission into the United States. The major purposes for which nonimmigrant admission may be authorized include temporary visits for business or pleasure, academic or vocational study, temporary employment, or to act as a representative of a foreign government or international organization, among others. The Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) Annual Flow Reports on nonimmigrants contain information obtained from I-94 arrival records on the number and characteristics of nonimmigrant admissions to the United States during a given fiscal year. = Immigration Enforcement Actions = The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) engages in immigration enforcement actions to prevent unlawful entry into the United States and to apprehend and repatriate aliens who have violated or failed to comply with U.S. immigration laws. Primary responsibility for the enforcement of immigration law within DHS rests with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). CBP enforces immigration laws at and between the ports of entry, ICE is responsible for interior enforcement and for detention and removal operations, and USCIS adjudicates applications and petitions for immigration and naturalization benefits. The Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) annual Immigration Enforcement Actions reports contain information obtained from CBP and ICE case records and processed by OIS to describe the number and characteristics of foreign nationals found inadmissible, apprehended, arrested, detained, returned, or removed during a given fiscal year. = Population Estimates = The Office of Immigration Statistics occasionally publishes population estimates of a particular subgroup. Population estimates take information on immigration flows and may combine it with other counts or estimates, such as those in the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS), as well as demographic life expectancy tables to give an idea of population size and characteristics in a given year. Terminology, data sources, and methodology may have shifted over time. Current series include population estimates for unauthorized immigrants, nonimmigrants, and lawful permanent residents.  Additional Reports  = Enforcement Priorities = The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) engages in immigration enforcement actions to prevent unlawful entry into the United States and to apprehend and repatriate aliens who have violated or failed to comply with U.S. immigration laws. In 2014, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced a number of measures to strengthen and unify the department's immigration enforcement priorities by concentrating resources on the arrest, detention, and removal of individuals identified as posing a threat to national security, public safety, or border security. The 2014 priorities emphasize criminal convictions over criminal arrests, and focus on felonies and significant or multiple misdemeanors over minor infractions of the law. The priorities also focus on forward-looking efforts to further reduce unlawful migration by targeting recent border crossers and those who significantly abuse the visa system. = Immigration Statistics Fact Sheets = In addition to its regularly published yearbook and flow reports, the Office of Immigration Statistics also occasionally publishes various shorter fact sheets on widely varying topics ranging from characteristics of those apprehended at the border in a given time period to reports on immigrants' interstate migration between the acquisition of lawful permanent resident (LPR) status and citizenship. Reports may use Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data or publicly available data from other sources, such as from the U.S. Census Bureau. = Immigration Infographics = Immigration Infographics produced by OIS describe key immigration topics such as the number and characteristics of lawful permanent residents, refugees and asylees, naturalizations, nonimmigrant admissions, and immigration enforcement actions. = Historical Library = The historical library was created in 1987 as part of the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) History Office. Its mission is to track the agency history and the implementation of federal government immigration policy from 1891‚Äîwhen the federal government first created the Immigration Bureau‚Äîthrough its present time.

Promoted to squadron leader in July 1972, having turned down the opportunity to become a Queen's Equerry, he was seconded to the British Army and joined the Parachute Regiment with 16 Parachute Brigade where he completed over one hundred parachute descents, one of which the parachute failed to open on an exercise parachuting into Schleswig-Holstein. The tour was shortened to attend the Indian Defence Services Staff College, in South India for a year in 1975. On completion of Staff College, a return to flying duties on the new single-seat Jaguar aircraft followed, first as a Deputy OC No 41 (F) Sqn based at RAF Coltishall, where he was awarded a Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air. Promoted to wing commander in July 1979, he completed the six-month Air Warfare Course at the RAF College, Cranwell, before assuming command of No. II (AC) Squadron in 1980, flying the Jaguar at RAF Laarbruch. Thorn was the first and only jaguar pilot to achieve one hundred percent air-to-ground strafe scores on no less than seven occasions, four of which both Aden guns of 60 rounds each fired simultaneously achieved 120 hits on Nordhorn range, West Germany and the other 3 with a single Aden gun firing 60 rounds achieving 60 hits on each sortie. He was awarded the Air Force Cross in December 1982. In January 1983 he handed over command of No II (AC) Squadron to Wing Commander Hoare. He was posted to the Operations Directorate in the Ministry of Defence with responsibility for future RAF air to ground weapons which included the development of a new nuclear weapon. In 1985 he was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society (FRAeS). Thorn was promoted to group captain and was appointed Station Commander, RAF Cranwell in September 1987 before being succeeded by Group Captain T.E.L. Jarron.http://www.rafweb.org/Stations/Station%20OCs-Lincs.htm Thorn next held an appointment at the Training Command HQ before attending the Royal College of Defence Studies (RCDS) in London during the year 1990. During the year's course he was promoted to air commodore and at the end of the course was appointed the Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) at HQ RAF Germany in January 1991. He held this post until March 1993 when he became the first air commodore to be appointed the Commandant-General of the RAF Regiment whilst holding the post of Director of Fire Services, and Head of the RAF Strike Command Provost Branch.

Retirement After he had prematurely retired from the RAF having achieved over 8,000 single seat flying hours and a total of 123 parachute descents, Thorn joined De Beers as the Head of Security for the Diamond Company with worldwide responsibility. At the same time he joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training) Branch in December 1995 with the rank of flying officer. In December 1997 he was awarded a Green Endorsement for an instance of Exceptional Flying Skill and Judgement when flying with an Air Training Corps (ATC) cadet in a RAF Tutor aircraft he successfully completed a forced landing back onto the airfield from 350 feet after the engine had failed and the propellor stopped. He was promoted to the rank of flight lieutenant in 2003. After 13 years service in the RAFVR he was awarded the Cadet medal in 2008. In November 2000, together with the Metropolitan Police Flying Squad he was heavily involved in successfully denying an attempt to steal ¬£350 million display of De Beers diamonds (the Millennium Star and 11 unique Blue Diamonds) from the Millennium Dome, Greenwich, London. In 2005, he retired from De Beers at the age of 60 years and formed his own Security Consultancy Company dealing with the Jewellery Retail Trade and Diamond/Gold Mines. As a consequence of a change of RAF policy on the maximum age of RAF pilots he was forced to cease flying on 31 January 2010 but continued to run his consultancy until April 2019 when he finally retired at the age of 77 years.

He and his band of men were attacked by a patrol led by Robert Carey, 1st Earl of Monmouth Lord Warden of the Marches (1596‚Äì98). During the assault Bourne's uncle was killed and Geordie was beaten into surrender. After his arrest he was found guilty of March Treason and sentenced to death. Many in the garrison were deeply concerned about executing the prisoner because it seemed to be common knowledge that the convict was a personal friend of the Scottish Middle March Warden Robert Ker of Cessford. The condemned man was given a 24-hour reprieve and riders were sent to Cessford to invite his intervention. There was no response. Meanwhile, Robert Carey, masquerading as a member of his own garrison, interviewed Bourne in his cell. According to Carey's 'Memoirs', Geordie Bourne confessed that > \\"he had lain with above forty men‚Äôs wives, what in England, what in > Scotland; and that he had killed seven Englishmen with his own hands, > cruelly murdering them: that he had spent his whole time in whoring, > drinking, stealing, and taking deep revenge for slight offences\\".

Biography In Ypres, the members of the family on his father's side came from modest origins. The men were day labourers, builders, innkeepers or saddlers and the women were dressmakers or lace makers. Jean Francois, his father (1794‚Äì1837) was an upholsterer and his mother, Victoire F√©licit√© (1789‚Äì1870), was the daughter of a tradesman from Aire-sur-la Lys (France). His first marriage took place in Ixelles on 19 November 1847 to √âl√©onore Bodson from Dinant (1792‚Äì1854) and on 14 October 1858 in Louvain he later married Marie Anne Tilly, who bore him a son named Hector (1859‚Äì1895). He lived in the Belgian capital from 1847, changing his address several times, from rue aux Herbes Potag√®res 30 to Saint-Josse-ten-Noode up to 1848, rue Goffart 28 in Ixelles until 1853, chauss√©e de Wavre 31, also in Ixelles until 1859, chauss√©e de Charleroi 131 in Saint-Gilles until 1863 and finally rue du Financier, which was renamed a little later to rue Godecharle 16 in Ixelles. Fran√ßois Roffiaen was barely three years old, when for unknown reasons he went to live with his paternal uncle, Joseph-Louis-Augustin, who was a bookseller in the rue de l‚ÄôAnge in Namur, the city where he spent, as he himself noted \\"the most beautiful years of his existence\\" and where he frequented the Atheneum, as well as the Academy of Painting (1835‚Äì1839) under the direction of Ferninand Marinus (1808‚Äì1890). Among his fellow students were Louis Bonet (1822‚Äì1894), Jean Baptiste Kindermans (1821‚Äì1876) and Joseph Quinaux (1822‚Äì1895). He followed his artistic studies at the Academy of Brussels (1839‚Äì1842), notably under the famous vedutiste, Fran√ßois Bossuet (1789‚Äì1889) who was responsible for teaching him perspective and who was the authority on landscapes and city views. Then he attended the Brussels studio of Pierre-Louis K√ºhnen (1812‚Äì1877), a painter originating from Aix-la-Chapelle, specialised in painting romantic landscapes. Roffiaen received for that reason an annual subsidy of 600 francs, paid by the city of Ypres (1841‚Äì1845 or 1846). At the same time, he taught drawing at the college of Dinant. To thank the city of his birth for the support they had given him, he gave a Landscape with Hydraulic Mill (1844), a Waterfall of the Aar in the High Alps and a View from Gr√ºtli on Lake Geneva (1857) to the local museum. He also bequeathed a lot later a large Valley of Chamonix to the commune of Ixelles, of which he was on the board of directors since the time of its creation in 1892. These titles clearly reveal one of the artist's favourite themes, the representation of Alpine landscapes. Deeply impressed by the canvases Alexandre Calame (1810 - 1864) had sent to Belgian Salons, Fran√ßois Roffiaen indeed won a place at Geneva in the autumn of 1846 and stayed for six months beside this master, before discovering the mountains himself. He continued to familiarise himself with the landscapes of Switzerland, Austria, Upper Bavaria and the Haute- Savoie during several other journeys (1852, 1855, 1856, 1864, 1868, 1879). But the painter also liked to represent picturesque scenes of the valleys of the Meuse and the Ourthe, the Scottish lochs, discovered in 1862, or the extensive heather of Limbourg, which he travelled through from the middle of the preceding decade, so that like Edmond Tschaggeny (1818‚Äì1873), he became one of the pioneers of the Campine Painters (called the School of Genk), a school which has been unjustly forgotten. Since the beginning of the year 1840, Roffiaen adopted the path followed by all artists, anxious to assure the greatest possible publicity for their works : participation in big group exhibitions. That is how for more than fifty years his paintings came to be hanging on the picture rails of the three yearly Salons of Antwerp, Brussels and Gent and were included in very many exhibitions in the provinces (Bruges, Dendermonde, Kortrijk, Leuven, Li√®ge, Mechelen, Mons, Namur, Spa, Ostend, Ypres) and abroad (Alger, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Bremen, Caracas, Dublin, Le Havre, London, Lyon, Melbourne, Munich, Nice, Paris, Reims, Rotterdam, The Hague). The years 1850‚Äì1860 were those of his greatest success, including numerous sales in Belgium, in Great Britain and in the United States, having works acquired by the Shah of Persia, by the Belgian and British royal houses, a study tour of Scotland commissioned by Queen Victoria, but which unfortunately never took place because of the sudden death of Albert, Prince Consort (December 1861), and when he received the title of Chevalier de l‚ÄôOrdre de L√©opold (1869). His painting, constructed according to indefinitely repeated formulae and each year becoming a little more tired, finished however by wearying the art chroniclers : \\"Critics of the press have often reproached him for the bias he shows in his painting. M Roffiaen has ignored them, he has continued to accumulate landscapes of Belgium, Scotland, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, what do I know, combing them without rest, using the same formula, making do with the same sky, the same trees, the same rocks, unconcerned by the latitudes, according to the taste of a special public, who buy all of that and pay him handsomely. Leave M. Roffiaen alone, gentlemen of the press, he paints his little nature scenes one demands of him and knows well the reason why.\\" (G. H., L‚ÄôOrgane de Namur et de la Province, 1874). Fran√ßois Roffiaen, On the banks of the river Meuse at Waulsort (oil on panel, 1876) However, on several occasions a critic like Gustave Lagye (1843‚Äì1908) attempted to emphasise the qualities of his art, both in its extreme delicacy and finesse and in its almost photographic detail. \\"Although opposed to M. Roffiaen for his manner of painting, dry and thin, I am obliged to admire him for the prodigious ability and above all for the exquisite art with which he holds grandiose panoramas in the narrowest of frames, where he chisels the smallest bump with the scruples of a miniaturist. Allow lovers of great painting to prefer in general large studies, executed in a day of fever and inspiration, but the tourist always prefers fine and complete pictorial photographs, where M. Roffiaen allows them to rediscover the scenes that he admired and details of the places themselves from an enthusiastic and curious point of view. His Borders of the Meuse, at Wauslort ; his Marshes of Genck, at the approach of Sunset ; his View into the Bernese Overland, are treated in a gothic manner, also in their perspective and their elegance. M. Roffiaen is a figure apart in the Belgian artistic movement and one should give him the justice he is due\\" (La F√©deration artistique, 1877). The execution of certain animals or little characters which fill out his works have been left to others more expert than he in these matters, as is the custom in traditional artistic circles : Johannes Hubertus Leonardus de Haas (1832-1908), Adolf Dillens (1821‚Äì1877), Th√©odore G√©rard (1829‚Äì1902), Louis Robbe (1806‚Äì1887), Paul Van der Vin (1823‚Äì1877), Frans Van Leemputten (1850‚Äì1914), Eug√®ne Verboeckhoven (1799‚Äì1881) or again the brothers Edward (1819‚Äì1897) and Constant (1823‚Äì1867) Woutermaetens. Initiated in April 1854 into the most important lodge in the kingdom, The True Friends of the Union and of Progress Reunited, Fran√ßois Roffiaen pushed his masonic career up to the 33rd and last degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, his name appearing in the List of Great General Inspectors for the Supreme Council of Belgium, of which he was Grand Master of Ceremonies for twenty eight years. In 1883, his involvement encouraged him to pay homage openly by dedicating one of his paintings to his Brother, General Antonio Guzm√°n-Blanco (1829‚Äì1899), president of the republic of Venezuela. Fran√ßois Roffiaen, The Banks of the K√∂nigsee (Upper Bavaria) (oil on cardboard, not dated) Fran√ßois Roffiaen is equally illustrious in the domain of natural sciences, to which Jules Colbeau (1823‚Äì1881) introduced him in his youth. While children the two companions already took delight in observing nature in the little property that Colbeau's parents owned in the suburbs of Namur. Once adult, they took a journey together to Switzerland (1852) where they collected insects, butterflies and molluscs. In January 1863, their mutual passion for the last type of living creatures led them, with five other people, Firmin De Malzine, Egide Fologne, Henri Lambotte, Alexandre Seghers and Joseph Weyers ‚Äì to found the Malacological Society of Belgium, to whose Annals Roffiaen made diverse contributions : \\"Notes conchyoliogiques\\" (French translation from an article in Italian by Dr Senoner (t.1) ; \\"Mollusques terrestres et fluviatiles recueillis en Suisse\\" and \\"Essais pour obtenir les Helix scalariformes\\" (t.3) ; \\"Coquilles recueillies √† Hasti√®re et √† Chimay\\" (t. 6) ; \\"Mollusques observ√©s dans la vall√©e de l‚ÄôOurthe\\" (t. 8) ; \\"Mollusques recueillis dans le Grand-Duch√© de Luxembourg\\" (t. 9) ; \\"Mollusques recueillis √† Gand\\" ; \\"Mollusques recueillis √† Waulsor\\" (t. 10) ; \\"Mollusques recueillis dans les environs de Gand\\" (t. 11) ; \\"Notes sur des mollusques recueillis √† Waulsort\\" (t. 12) ; \\"Jules Colbeau et la Soci√©t√© royale malacologique de Belgique\\" (t. 16) ; \\"Rapport sur l‚Äôassemble g√©n√©rale du 1er juillet 1882\\" (t. 17). The owner of a remarkable personal collection of molluscs, he also attended to the increase and the presentation of those of the Malacological Society, invented a series of instruments used to extract the animals from their shells and constructed a cochlearium, a sort of vivarium used for the observation and raising of molluscs. A sign of the place he occupies in this little scholarly world of his time, two of the animals‚Äîone living and a fossil‚Äîeven received his name, Planorbis Roffiaeni and Cyprina Roffiaeni respectively. Some months after his death, the local authorities gave the name of Fran√ßois Roffiaen to a street in Ixelles. In 1907, an article was dedicated to him in the Biographie nationale, edited by the Royal Academy of Belgium. Madeleine Ley (1901‚Äì1981), his great grand daughter (Prix Rossel 1940), called his image briefly to mind in her novel Olivia (Gallimard, 1936 ; re-edition Labor, 1986). But the character had already been forgotten. In the first half of the twentieth century his name was no longer cited except by chance, his case dismissed in a few hasty phrases and often scathingly, preferring a livelier form of art, one that was more personal, more \\"sincere\\", more \\"credible\\", in a word, more \\"modern\\" than his, as if this was understood once and for all. Since the years 1960‚Äì70, however, there has been a renewal of interest in the art of the \\"little masters\\" of the nineteenth century, to which there are more than one \\"folding away seat of some kind after the official armchair that many among them have occupied at the time of a triumphant academism and towards which certain people attempt to return, since the course of taste is in perpetual motion\\" (G√©rald Schurr, 1979), and the work of Roffiaen is on the way to becoming rehabilitated. A first exhibition was especially dedicated to him at the communal Museum of Ypres, from 5 December 1998 to 4 April 1999.

It was the largest building in the city, succeeding the Hotel Robert E. Lee, and the tallest building in North Carolina from 1927 to 1929, when it was succeeded by the Reynolds Building; all three buildings were in Winston-Salem. The Nissen Building was named to the National Register of Historic Places March 17, 1983, with a boundary increase in 2004 to include a one-story addition built in 1969.

History W.M. Nissen and new leasee Coach Kolstad, the owner of Nissen Wagon Works, built the Nissen Building on the site of a former YMCA between 1926 and 1927. William Lee Stoddart of New York City, known for the Battery Park Hotel in Asheville, North Carolina, was the architect. The building opened with a Bob-a-Link miniature golf course in the basement. The first tenants included the Civil Service Administration, Veterans Administration and the Office of Flying Safety. In 1931 the street level shops included The Vogue clothing shop, the Bland Piano Company, Gladys' Lingerie Shop, the Belcher- Forlaw Shoe Company and Bobbitt's Nissen Drug.Brownlee, Fambrough L.

The Nissen Building was the first air-conditioned building in the Southeast. In May 1999, BB&T; bought what was then called the First Union Building for $2.5 million from Aon Consulting Inc., which moved about 400 employees to University Corporate Center. BB&T; planned to be the primary tenant by 2003, but the bank instead sold the building for $2 million in August 2000 to Prime Residential LLC of Chicago, which planned to convert the building to 132 apartments at a cost of $26 million. In 2005, the building was in the process of being converted into 145 luxury apartments. A plan for condominiums was considered but dropped. Nissen Risk Capital LLC and HRI, using Holder Construction Co. as general contractor, began work in Summer 2004.

His mother, Margaret Jefferson, was the daughter of the American actor, Joseph Jefferson. His sister was Eleanor Farjeon, the writer of children's verse and stories. His brothers were Harry Farjeon, the composer, and J. Jefferson Farjeon, who wrote novels. He was a conscientious objector in the First World War.Grenfell, Joyce (1988): Edited by James Roose-Evans. Darling Ma. London: Hodder & Stoughton Career His first play to be performed, Friends, was put on at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin in 1917. Subsequently, he had several plays performed in London. He was better known for his revues than for his \\"straight\\" plays, however. These included: Spread It Abroad, The Two Bouquets, Nine Sharp, Little Revue, Diversion and Light and Shade. He is credited with discovering Joyce Grenfell, whose first stage appearance was in Light and Shade. In 1938, he joined the management of the Little Theatre in London, and his revues were performed there.

He wrote reviews of plays and articles about the theatre for a number of British newspapers and magazines, including the Daily Mirror, Vogue, The Listener and the Radio Times. He was interested in the history of the theatre, and wrote about the Elizabethan theatre, Shakespeare and his plays, and edited a seven volume publication of the text of the First Folio. In the 1940s he helped to save the Theatre Royal, Bristol when it was put up for sale and might have ceased to be a theatre. He collaborated with his sister on a number of books, including Kings and Queens (1932), The Two Bouquets (1938, also staged with music by Ernest Irving), An Elephant in Arcady (1939), and The Glass Slipper (1944).

Begun 1992, and finally approved with the formation of the Fifth Republic of Niger on 18 July 1999, Niger has been enacting a plan for Decentralisation of some state powers to local bodies. Prior to the 1999-2006 project, Niger's subdivisions were administered via direct appointment from the central government in Niamey. Beginning with Niger's first municipal elections of 2 February 1999, the nation started electing local officials for the first time. Citizens now elect local committee representatives in each Commune, chosen by subdivisions of the commune: \\"Quarters\\" in towns and \\"Villages\\" in rural areas, with additional groupings for traditional polities and nomadic populations. These officials choose Mayors, and from them are drawn representatives to the Department level. The same process here chooses a Departmental council and Prefect, and representatives to the Regional level. The system is repeated a Regional level, with a Regional Prefect, council, and representatives to the High Council of Territorial Collectives (Le Haut Conseil des Collectivit√©s Territoriales HCCT). The HCCT has only advisory powers, but its members (Regions, Departments, and Communes) have some financial, planning, educational and environmental powers. The central government oversees this process through the office of the Minister of State for the Interior, Public Safety and Decentralization. NIGER. Situation institutionnelle .

The latter two categories cover all areas not covered by Urban Communes (population over 10000) or Rural Communes (population under 10000), and are governed by the Department, whereas Communes have (since 1999) elected councils and mayors. Additional semi-autonomous sub- divisions include Sultanates, Provinces and Tributaries (tribus).Loi 2001-23, Article 6 The Nigerien government estimates there are an additional 17000 Villages administered by Rural Communes, while there are a number of Quartiers (boroughs or neighborhoods) administered by Urban Communes.GOUVERNEMENT DE LA R√âPUBLIQUE DU NIGER.

Status of Niamey changed from department to capital district.\\" Historical evolution Prior to independence, Niger was divided into sixteen Cercles as second level administration divisions: Agadez, Birni N'Konni, Dogondoutchi, Dosso, Filingu√©, Gour√©, Madaoua, Magaria, Maradi, N'Guigmi, Niamey, Tahoua, T√©ra, Tessaoua, Tillab√©ry, and Zinder. Their capitals had the same names as the cercle. After independence, the 31 December 1961 Law of territorial organization created 31 circonscriptions. The 16 colonial cercles continued to exist, and served as a level of division above these circonscriptions. Four cercles (Dogondoutchi, Filingu√©, N'Guigmi, and T√©ra) had only one circonscription. The Law of August 14, 1964 then reorganized the country into seven departments, adopting the French second level administration naming system, in contrast to neighbor Mali, which retained the colonial Cercles and Regions.

The song is an observation of the way many women are still treated; with (I hope) an optimistic ending. The third song (\\"Fun Flesh\\") is an imaginary picture of a man and his son. The father is very rich, clinging to his pathetic view of reality. Reality for him includes the idea of women as objects - contorted on shiny paper. He's wrong, sad, stubborn and insists on misleading his son. \\"Flashing Back\\" is about the happy moments of my life - the perfect combinations of cold truth and sleep walking ... inexplicable.

His project was to unite the German middle-sized powers under Bavarian leadership against Prussia and Austria as a \\"Third Germany\\" (the so-called Trias). Thus, he was partly responsible that Bavaria in actuality torpedoed the project of the Erfurt Union.

It is a rebated rim cartridge designed to fit Remington's R-15 semiautomatic hunting rifle. It was designed to fit the dimensional constraints of the AR-15 magazine and is based on a modification of the .450 Bushmaster, which in turn was based on the .284 Winchester. Remington was the only company that manufactured this ammunition and its components. The cartridge was a commercial failure and has been discontinued by Remington. The .30 Remington AR cartridge has a significantly wider diameter than the .223 Remington. Design Starting with a .450 Bushmaster case, Remington trimmed the length to 1.525\\" from the original 1.7\\" and necked it down to accept a conical .308\\" diameter bullet with a 25 degree shoulder. The rim size is.492\\" and because the round generates 55,000 psi, Remington opted to use a .308 rifle bolt in a 5.56 sized rifle for increased case support. With a 150 grain bullet, the round travels at 2575 fps. Cartridge Performance Performance tests between the .30 RAR and the .308 Winchester show that while the .30 RAR does have a good muzzle velocity, the energy it is capable of delivering on target at around 400 yards decreases significantly. Combined with the poorer ballistic coefficients of the lighter projectiles (.267 for the 125 grain Core-Lokt), this makes the .30 RAR a cartridge suited to ranges around 300 to 400 yards where a larger calibre projectile is required. A side effect of the short, wide case has meant that the Remington R-15 Rifle which was designed alongside the cartridge uses a four-round, single-stack magazine.

His Early Start on the Violin was first published in German in 1976, followed by three more volumes, and is widely used. The work has been translated into Italian, Chinese, and (in 2008) into English; adaptations for viola and cellos have also been published. Sassmannshaus grew up in Wuppertal and was largely self-taught on the violin. In the late 1940s he briefly had lessons with the German-American virtuoso Walter Schulze-Priska. He soon started teaching himself, and by the early 1950 he had enough pupils to make a living, and although he took up a more secure position of assistant principal violist in W√ºrzburg in 1958, he continued to give private lessons. In 1976 he became the head of the municipal music school in W√ºrzburg. His teaching methods became known through presentations at national or European conferences in the late 1960s and early 1970s, resulting in the publication of his handwritten materials. Sassmannshaus taught children from the ages four to six at a time when starting at ten was still considered normal. Unlike Shinichi Suzuki (founder of the Suzuki Method), he introduced note-reading early, using a large-print format. To teach pitch and rhythm he used familiar folk songs and texts, and often the same song recurs later to teach a new finger pattern or position. Particularly innovative was the early introduction of shifting and playing in positions. The large print, illustrations and familiar songs made the violin books more approachable than most others, while at the same time the method introduced at an early stage technique usually considered as quite advanced. Previously available only in German, these books were edited and translated into English by his son, Kurt Sassmannshaus, a violin pedagogue now working in America.  Sources  * Sassmannshaus, K.

C√©sar the character, who claims to be, alternately, a boy and a girl (but mainly a girl), has a hyper-developed sense of reality, a plethora of hang-ups, and a casual relationship with the truth. Contrary to what the name suggests, it is not a story of religious awakening, and begins and ends in the same year of the life of the narrator. The Spanish version was first published in 1993. Chris Andrews‚Äô English translation was published by New Directions in 2007. Plot summary How I Became A Nun chronicles a year in the fantastic internal and external life of an introverted six-year-old called C√©sar, who sees herself as a girl but is referred to by the rest of the world as a boy. In the beginning of the novel, her family moves to a bigger town Rosario, where her father takes her for a promised Ice-cream. The child is horrified at the taste of the Strawberry ice- cream, which disappoints the father. He insists that she finish her ice-cream and stop being difficult. After tasting the ice-cream himself, he realizes it is contaminated and in an altercation ends up killing the ice-cream vendor. The child gets cyanide poisoning and spends her time in the hospital, often suffering from delusions. Once out of the hospital, she learns that her father has been sent to eight years of prison. She joins school, three months late into the class and finds herself disconnected from a class which has learned to read. Thus she gets drawn into her own world of make-believe and imagination. Her only friends are her mother and a boy named Arturo Carrera. In the end, she is kidnapped by the wife of the ice-cream vendor who was killed by her father. The wife, in an act of vengeance, throws Cesar into a drum of Strawberry ice-cream, which seems to have become the girl's biggest horror. The story as told by young C√©sar captures a child's sense of wonder and naivete, and blurs the categories of what is imagined and what is real. Reception When How I Became a Nun debuted outside Argentina, it was \\"celebrated...as one of the ten most important books published in Spain that year\\" and called \\"a true masterpiece for our times\\".

His first cemetery commission, the mausoleum at Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago, Illinois, is considered his best work. He obtained a patent on an improved mausoleum ventilation system in 1917. Two of his works are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Early life Sidney Lovell was born February 26, 1867, in Racine, Wisconsin, to Philip and Louisa ( Knill) Lovell. He was the sixth of seven children. Philip Lovell had emigrated to the United States at the age of 24 from Driffield, East Yorkshire, United Kingdom, while Louisa Knill had emigrated at the age of 17 from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, United Kingdom. Both arrived in 1845 and took up residence in Beloit, Wisconsin. They married on April 26, 1856, and moved to Racine in 1857. The Lovells were among Racine's earliest settlers (the town had only been founded in 1841), and Philip earned a living as a butcher. Like his younger brother Frank, Sidney was most likely educated in the local public schools. Philip Lovell died on July 12, 1873, when Sidney was six years old. Philip Lovell had been very prosperous, and left his wife well-off. (For example, she owned 1 percent of the stock in the Commercial and Savings Bank of Racine.) Architectural career =Theater years= The mausoleum at Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago, considered Lovell's masterwork. In 1882, architect James M. Wood arrived in Racine for the opening of the Blake Opera House, which he had designed and which he was to manage. Lovell became acquainted with Wood, and left Racine with Wood in 1883. Lovell served as Wood's architectural apprentice (there being almost no schools of architecture at the time), and assisted Wood in designing the Grand Opera House in Wausau, Wisconsin, in 1883; the Academy of Music in East Saginaw, Michigan, 1884; Wood's Opera House in Bay City, Michigan, in 1885; and then later large-scale theatrical scenery in Chicago, Illinois. Although Lovell and Wood's activities between 1883 and 1885 are not known, by 1885 Lovell was a full-fledged architect. From spring 1885 to summer 1886, Wood and Lovell traveled from town to town in Michigan, designing theatrical scenery. In 1886, Wood designed the Hennepin Avenue Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Wood and Lovell's other activities are not known from 1886 to 1888, but in 1888 the pair arrived in Los Angeles, California, where Wood had won a commission to remodel the Grand Opera House The project was finished in 1890. The two men formed a partnership, Wood & Lovell, in 1891 in San Francisco. The firm added a third partner, Fuller Claflin, in 1893. Wood and Lovell focused on commissions in Chicago and New York City, while Claflin handled West Coast business. The same year, Wood & Lovell opened a branch office in Chicago, to which the two original partners removed. They kept their San Francisco office open until 1895. During this period, Wood & Lovell specialized in theaters with an East Indian decorative motif. Among the projects on which Lovell and Wood worked were the Broadway Theatre in Denver, Colorado, in 1890; the Marquam Grand Opera House in Portland, Oregon, in 1890; the Loring Opera House in Riverside, California, in 1890; the Tacoma Theater in Tacoma, Washington, in 1890; the Yosemite Theater in Stockton, California, in 1892; Stockwell's Theatre in San Francisco in 1892; the Empire Theater in Quincy, Illinois, in 1893; the Lafayette Square Opera House in Washington, D.C., in 1895; and the Jefferson Theatre in Portland, Oregon, in 1896. In 1897, Wood and Lovell dissolved their partnership. Lovell continued to design theaters, including the Tucson Opera House in Tucson, Arizona, in 1897; the Overland Theater in Nebraska City, Nebraska, in 1897; the Metropolitan Opera House in Owatonna, Minnesota, in 1897; the Appleton Opera House in Appleton, Wisconsin, in 1901; the Neenah Theater (a movie theater) in Neenah, Wisconsin, in 1902, the Illinois Theatre in Rock Island, Illinois, in 1905;; and the Kedzie Avenue Theater Annex (a movie theater) in 1912. =Other buildings= Entrance tower at Kensico Cemetery by Lovell & Lovell, which cleverly concealed the cemetery's water tank. As early as 1892, Lovell began work designing non-theatrical buildings as well. One of the earliest was the Hotel Renaissance, built in San Francisco in 1892. Lovell continued to design non-theatrical structures, such as apartment buildings,; but did not focus his work in this area until about 1913. In that year, he designed a department store building in Marinette, Wisconsin; an apartment building in Chicago; a nickelodeon and billiard hall in Chicago; and a theater, office building, billiard hall, and retail store in Chicago. In 1914, architects William Ernest Walker and Howard L. Cheney joined Lovell's firm. Over the next four years, Lovell continued to design a wide array of commercial structures: a five-story warehouse in Chicago in 1915; luxury apartments in Chicago in 1915; an ornate fence for wealthy Chicago residence in 1916; an apartment building Chicago in 1916; a large 18-unit apartment building Chicago in 1916; two small apartment buildings in Chicago in 1917; a testing laboratory building in Chicago in 1917; a factory and power station in Chicago Heights, Illinois, in 1917; and a factory in Chicago Heights, Illinois, in 1918. =Mausoleum work= In 1912, Rosehill Cemetery, a large cemetery on Chicago's North Side, contracted with Lovell for the design of a massive mausoleum. The Community Mausoleum (also known as the Rosehill Mausoleum) was completed in 1914, and is widely considered to be Lovell's masterwork. The $300,000 ($ in dollars), 1,500-crypt structure was the first large-scale public mausoleum in the nation. The mausoleum contains 38 windows by the Tiffany Studios. This is the largest collection of secular Tiffany- designed glass in the United States, and was valued in 1994 at $10 million ($ in dollars). In 1916, Lovell designed a $150,000 ($ in dollars), 1,000-crypt mausoleum for Valhalla Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. As Lovell designed mausoleums, he came to realize that there were fundamental problems facing above-ground burial. It had been common for centuries for above-ground burial vaults to be tightly sealed, to prevent the leakage of fluids and the spread of nauseating odors (both generated by the decomposition of the human body) from vaults. Tightly sealed vaults, however, allowed decomposition gases to build up, causing vaults to violently rupture (\\"exploding vault syndrome\\") and scatter partly-decomposed remains inside the mausoleum. Lovell designed a solution, which involved building a ventilation system and drainage system behind the vaults. He applied for a patent, which was granted on October 23, 1917 (patent number 1,244,109). Chapel at the mausoleum at Mayfield Cemetery in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. Lovell designed a mausoleum for Forest Hill Cemetery in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1919,; and later that year designed and erected a large family monument for the Francis Joseph Reitz family in St. Joseph Catholic Cemetery in Evansville, Indiana. In 1920, Lovell was at work on designs for a $264,000 ($ in dollars) mausoleum at Oakwood Cemetery in Saginaw, Michigan; and a $300,000 ($ in dollars) mausoleum at Deepdale Cemetery in Lansing, Michigan; and a $150,000 ($ in dollars) mausoleum at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Norfolk, Virginia; and a $150,000 ($ in dollars) mausoleum at Old Mission Cemetery in Wichita, Kansas. Lovell's son, Marion \\"Don\\" Lovell, joined his father's firm in 1922, and the company adopted the name \\"Lovell & Lovell\\". In 1923, Lovell was commissioned to design a large mausoleum at Knollwood Cemetery in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. The $175,000 structure was finished in 1928. Lovell designed a public mausoleum for Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York, in 1924, and a unique Gothic stone entrance to conceal a high water tower in 1928. He also designed the Oakwood Memorial Mausoleum in Oakwood Cemetery in Dixon, Illinois, in 1924. Lovell designed another Cleveland-area mausoleum in 1926 for Mayfield Cemetery in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. The $400,000 structure opened in 1929.; Lovell & Lovell finished design work on the $250,000 Memorial Crypt at Fairlawn Cemetery in Decatur, Illinois, in late 1925 or early 1926. It opened in April 1927. Lovell completed work on the Llano Pantheon, a mausoleum in Llano Cemetery in Amarillo, Texas, in 1927. In association with T. P. Barnett & Co., Lovell & Lovell designed a mausoleum at Oak Grove Cemetery in St. Louis in 1928. That same year, Lovell & Lovell designed a mausoleum at Mount Royal Cemetery in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a $500,000 mausoleum at Forest Park Cemetery in Houston, Texas, and a $250,000 mausoleum at Springdale Cemetery in Peoria, Illinois. In 1930, Lovell & Lovell completed work on the Highland Memorial Mausoleum in Highland Cemetery in South Bend, Indiana. The Chicago Daily Tribune reported that Lovell, alone or in association with his son, designed 56 mausoleums and mausoleum additions in his lifetime. Personal life Lovell married Jane Winters Bruner of San Francisco on April 16, 1890. The couple had two children: son Marion McDonald (born July 7, 1895) and daughter Alice Booth (born July 1, 1899). Death Sidney Lovell suffered from frail health in his last years. He died on August 6, 1938, at Birchwood Park Sanitarium in Chicago. His funeral was held in the chapel at Rosehill Cemetery, and he was buried in the Rosehill Mausoleum. Honors In 1925, Lovell won a \\"first mention\\" award in the Remodeled Building Class for his work on 224 E. Ontario Street in Chicago. The award was bestowed by the Lake Shore Trust and Savings Bank, which sponsored a series of architectural awards for construction in the North Central area of Chicago. Two of Lovell's mausoleums are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Old Mission Cemetery mausoleum was specifically singled out for this honor in 2009. His mausoleum was included in the historic designation given to Springdale Cemetery in 2004.

Lithornis were able to fly well, but are closely related to today's tinamous (which are poor flyers) and ratites (which are flightless birds). Fossils of Lithornis are known with certainty from the Upper Paleocene through the Middle Eocene, but their fossil record may extend to the late Cretaceous. \\"Lithornis\\" is from ancient Greek for \\"stone bird\\", as it is one of the first fossil birds to become widely discussed. Presumably closely related genera are Paracathartes and Pseudocrypturus. Species Life restoration. Six species have been recognized in modern times; undescribed ones are also likely to exist. The supposed tarsometatarsus piece from which \\"Lithornis\\" emuinus was described is actually a humerus fragment of the giant pseudotooth bird Dasornis.Houde, P. (1988) =Lithornis celetius= L. celetius is from the Bangtail Quarry, Sedan Quadrangle, Park County, Montana, USA, and was described by Peter Houde (1988). It is from the Fort Union Formation, which is earliest Tiffanian, Late Paleocene. The type fossil is USNM 290601. L. celetius was of average size for the genus, and the name Celetius is derived from the Greek word keletion a race horse for which the type locality is also named. =Lithornis hookeri= Harrison and Walker originally labeled the fossil as belonging to the species Pediorallus barbarae in 1977. In 1984, Harrison redescribed the fossil as coming from a new species Pediorallus hookeri, and later that year it was moved to Lithornis hookeri.Mayr, G. (2008) L. hookeri is the smallest of the Lithornithidae. =Lithornis nasi= W. George collected the original fossil in the Division A London Clay, North Sea Basin at Walton on the Naze, Essex, England. The fossil was described by Harrison in 1984 as a rail, Pediorallus nasi, but was later moved to Lithornis nasi. L. nasi is larger than L. hookeri and L. plebius. =Lithornis plebius= L. plebius is from the same locality as L. promiscuus and was also described by Peter Houde (1988). The type specimen is USNM 336534. =Lithornis promiscuus= L. promiscuus has type specimen USNM 336535 and was described by Peter Houde (1988). It is from the Clark Quadrangle, Park County, Wyoming, USA. It is from the Willwood Formation, which is earliest Eocene in age. An egg, USNM 336570, is known for L. celetius as well. =Lithornis vulturinus= L. vulturinus was described as a vulture by Owen (1840) from the holotype fossil 955 738 - TM 024 717. The fossil was collected from Early Eocene London Clay deposits on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, England by J. Hunter before 1793. This fossil was destroyed by bombing in World War II. Numerous isolated fossil bones of Lithornis vulturinus were incorrectly described anew, such as Parvigyps praecox and Promusophaga magnifica - the supposed earliest vulture and turaco, while others were referred to existing families of neognathous birds. A neotype (BMNH A 5204) was erected to replace the holotype in 1988 by Houde, who for the first time diagnosed it as a paleognath based on complete three- dimensional skulls and skeletons of congeners from North America. An exceptionally preserved specimen was collected from Denmark and cataloged as MGUH 26770.Leonard, L. & Van Tuinen, M. (2005) Palaeobiology Lithornis' wing bones are similar to those of storks and vultures, meaning that unlike modern tinamous it was capable of soaring flight.Houde, Peter W.

This is consistent with a nocturnal, forest- dwelling lifestyle, though as much all volant birds it retains large optical lobes.Torres, C. R.; Clarke, J. A.

Two journalists have disputed this and other claims made by Yahia. He is best known for being the alleged former body double of Uday Hussein, the son of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. Biography Yahia is of Kurdish descent. He says that he became Uday's double after the Iran‚ÄìIraq War had begun. He was born 4 days before Uday. At the age of 23, he was summoned to the presidential palace, where he discovered that Uday remembered that classmates had remarked on the resemblance between the two when they were in school together. Yahia was informed that he was to become Uday's fedai (body double) to make public appearances as Uday whenever a dangerous situation was expected. Yahia initially refused to take the job and was subsequently put in solitary confinement. After his imprisonment, Latif agreed to be Uday's double. He was trained for six months to imitate Uday's speech patterns and manner. He underwent surgery and dental work to make their appearances more similar. During the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Yahia was used as a morale booster for the Iraqi troops and sent to Basra posing as Uday to meet with troops.. His relationship with Uday later deteriorated. According to Yahia, the final straw came when a woman Uday was interested in paid more attention to Yahia. Uday shot at him, grazing him. When ordered to kill the father of a beauty pageant holder, a defiant Yahia slit his arms in front of Uday and the father.https://www.newsweek.com/my- life-uday-husseins-body-double-68475 Yahia fled north, where he was imprisoned by Kurdish Peshmerga, being mistaken for Uday. When they realized he was not Uday, he was released and granted asylum in Austria in 1992. After Yahia was attacked in Austria, he moved to London in 1995. On 10 March 1997, Yahia allegedly threatened a refugee official in Norway, showing up at his office with a can of gasoline, pouring it out over the floor, and threatening to light it. The official managed to \\"calm\\" Yahia, who fled after half an hour. He was subsequently arrested by the police. He was released before his trial and left the country, first to Germany, then to Ireland. =Challenges to Yahia's claims= Irish Times journalist Eoin Butler and Sunday Times journalist Ed Caesar have questioned Yahia's various claims, including that he was Uday Hussein's body double, and pointed out that many of Yahia's activities since leaving Iraq in 1992, including his education, have not been verified. In 2007, Butler interviewed Yahia and highlighted inconsistencies in many of Yahia's statements. In 2011, just before the release of The Devil's Double, Butler commented that Yahia's stories about when he was Uday's double were \\"to put it mildly, far-fetched.\\" After the 2007 interview, Yahia's ex- wife contacted Butler and told him that when she first met Yahia, he used a different name, Khalid al-Kubaisi. After the two married, she heard for the first time that Yahia claimed to have been Uday's body double, which she found \\"dubious.\\" In 2011, Caesar interviewed various people from the time of the Hussein regime. Although Saddam's purported use of body doubles was widely known, two confidantes of Uday Hussein denied that he used doubles. One said that Yahia was arrested for impersonation of Uday in 1990, and the other corroborated the incident, also stating that Yahia pretended to be Uday to pick up women. A private guard at Saddam's presidential palace from 1989 to 2003 also denied that Uday used doubles. Saddam Hussein's former doctor and a plastic surgeon at the Ibn Sina hospital said that the reconstructive surgery Yahia claims to have undergone there was never performed. The doctor also said he operated on Uday many times and Uday never had a body double. A former CIA case officer in Iraq, who claimed to know every asset in Iraq at the time and had friends who were close to the Hussein brothers, had never heard of Yahia, nor heard of Uday ever using doubles. Yahia disputes these claims, saying that his very existence was a state secret. Saddam Hussein himself, when asked during an interrogation session about whether any in the Iraqi government, notably his son Uday, used body doubles, went on to deny these claims, stating, \\"I think my sons would not do this.\\" Film The movie The Devil's Double, directed by Lee Tamahori and starring Dominic Cooper as Yahia and Uday, premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival on 22 January 2011. Yahia was also the subject of an episode of National Geographic Channel's Locked Up Abroad in 2012. Books * I was Saddam's Son released on 1 May 1994 by Arcade Publishing. Hardcover: 250 pages.

The AEMET is part of the Secretariat of State for Environment of the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and is headquartered in the University City, Madrid. The agency was known as Central Institute of Meteorology from 1887 to 1978 and National Institute of Meteorology from 1978 to 2008 when it adopted its current name. The AEMET performs its task through a collection of data from its network of centers. The agency has centers distributed through the regions and it has offices in almost every airport and air force base. In addition, there are synoptic observatories spread throughout the Spanish geography. It represents Spain in international meteorological institutions, such as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).  History  It was founded in 1887 as the \\"Instituto Central Meteorol√≥gico\\" by Royal Decree of August 12 and it was part of the Directorate-General for Public Instruction of the Ministry of Development. As stated in the founding Decree, the Institute had to \\"especially calculate and announce the probable time to the ports and capitals of the province, without prejudice to the other scientific and practical work entrusted to it.\\" The creation of the agency was promoted by the Development Minister Carlos Navarro Rodrigo and Francisco Giner de los R√≠os, founder of the Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza, in an attempt to recover the country's delay on Science. It was the first institution dedicated to the meteorological service in Spain. Its first director was the scientific Augusto Arcim√≠s who remained in office until 1910. The first headquarters of the Institute was the Castle building in the Retiro Park, Madrid. With different denominations and organic ascriptions, this agency has been playing the role of \\"National Meteorological Service\\" since its creation. During the Second Republic, in 1933, it became dependent on the Directorate-General for Aeronautics of the Ministry of War. After the Civil War, in 1940, all the meteorological services were unified in the renowned \\"National Meteorological Service\\", which was attached to the Ministry of Air. In 1962 a new building was inaugurated in the University City of Madrid that in the 70s assumed the central services. In the democratic period, a new restructuring took place in 1978, when it was renamed the National Institute of Meteorology (INM) and became dependent on the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The second and last restructuring of the agency happened in 2008, when the National Meteorological Institute was renamed State Meteorological Agency and it assumed all the goods and responsibilities of it.  Activities and resources  AEMET's main task is \\"to develop, implement and provide meteorological services falling within the competences of the State, as well as to give support to other public and private activities which improve the safety and quality of life of the Spanish society\\". Its activities include, among others, taking meteorological observations in Spain and archiving them, weather monitoring and forecasting, and doing scientific research in numerical weather prediction models. To accomplish these tasks AEMET has at its disposal high computing power and a vast observation network, including manned and automatic weather stations, radiosondes, weather radar and lightning detectors.AEMET resources  References   External links   Izana Atmospheric Research Center * Useful information for visitors Governmental meteorological agencies in Europe Research institutes in the Community of Madrid Government agencies of Spain ","title":"State Meteorological Agency"},{"id":"21111794","title":"54th General Assembly of Nova Scotia"},{"id":"21111801","text":"The Marshall Field Garden Apartments is a large non-governmental subsidized housing project in the Old Town neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The project occupies two square city blocks and was the largest moderate-income housing development in the U.S. at the time of construction in 1929. Marshall Field Garden Apartments has 628 units within 10 buildings. Rapper Polo G is a notable former resident of this project. History Postcard of the apartments the 1500 block of north Sedgwick street circa 1966. The apartments can be seen in the left of the image, and have been renamed to 'Old Town Gardens' The apartments The project was developed by the estate of Marshall Field, entrepreneur and founder of the Chicago Marshall Field's department store chain. The project was directed by Marshall Field III. Its aim was not only to provide housing at a reasonable cost but also to provide a catalyst for renewal of the surrounding area. Marshall Field Garden Apartments was at the time of construction one of two large philanthropic housing developments in Chicago. The other was Michigan Boulevard Garden Apartments, at 47th and Michigan. Both were built in 1929 and both were modeled after the Dunbar Apartments built by John D. Rockefeller Jr., in 1926 in Harlem, New York City. Marshall Field Garden Apartments was meant to be the first of three or four similar projects, but the Great Depression kept those plans from coming to fruition. Marshall had hoped to provide low cost housing but land acquisition and construction cost overruns pushed the rent into the moderate range. By 1991, the apartments had deteriorated, and were sold to private investors in 1992 with a clause that specified that they would remain available only to low income tenants for 25 years.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-04-01/news/9101300162_1_low- income-cabrini-green-federal-rent-subsidies In 2016, the apartments were sold to Related Midwest, and in a public-private partnership agreement plan to keep the units affordable until 2045.

Contemporaneous Article Extract \\"Outlines ‚Äì Albert Firth ‚Äì Albert is one of many players on our present register who commenced his career as a member of the Wakefield City Schools' side. Unlike the majority, however he had to seek his Rugby League football at that stage, for his school in Stanley did not play Rugby. Whilst with the Wakefield City Schools' team he gained County honours against Cumberland. In those days he played in the forwards; a number of occasions being at loose forward. Schooldays over, he naturally joined his local team ‚Äì Stanley Rangers ‚Äì for whom he made several appearances at centre three-quarter. In whichever position he played, however, his work was so successful that Trinity secured his signature at sixteen years of age. Albert signed for Wakefield Trinity in July, 1953 and, after a short period in the \\"A‚Äù team, made his senior d√©but in November, 1953 against Huddersfield here at Belle Vue. There was another appearance in the senior team during that season, but in the following campaign he made his mark and from there he has not looked back. In his first full season of 1954‚Äì5, he made thirty appearances and scored 13 tries ‚Äì his most successful term until this present season. In September he made his County d√©but for Yorkshire against Cumberland at Hull and there are strong hopes that this will form only the first of many similar representative appearances. Still only in his early twenties, with 127 first team appearances (and over forty tries) behind him, he still has much to give Trinity in the important seasons ahead. The continuance of his career and the further fulfilment of much promise will be watched with interest and satisfaction\\" Outside of Rugby League He later became a landlord at The Angel Inn, and other pubs in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, England.

The collection includes Numbers 1‚Äì5, 7, and 10, while the missing Numbers 8 and 9 are presumed to have been lost.Sitney, p.233 The idea of the numbering was to suggest a coherent link between each individual film, and that they were to be treated not just on their own but as part of a larger body of work.

Initially recorded with no sound, a medley of music by The Beatles was added retrospectively.

It was produced by Solax Studios when it and many other early film studios in America's first motion picture industry were based in Fort Lee, New Jersey at the beginning of the 20th century. The story concerns a young man (Fraunie Fraunholz) who refuses to accept financial assistance from his wealthy girlfriend (Marian Swayne) in favor of earning his own fortune on the stock market. She concocts a plan to convince him that he will collect an inheritance from a wealthy aunt if he marries before noon. While he desperately proposes to every female he meets, she is trying to reach him before he finds a girl who will say yes. With only minutes to go before the deadline expires, he gives up his search and intends to commit suicide under the wheels of the next passing car.

He began conducting a small ensemble there as early as 1921. In 1923, he became that station's first full-time music director, and he held that position for both WLW and WSAI (also in Cincinnati) from 1928 to 1937. Under Stoess's direction and station owner Powel Crosley Jr.'s leadership the music program grew to over 100 staff members by 1932 and was broadcast throughout the United States, earning WLW the nickname \\"The Nation's Station\\". Stoess is credited with the early development of the soundtrack for the radio dramas produced at WLW.[2] These dramas were nicknamed \\"soap operas\\" in reference to WLW's close relationship with sponsors Procter and Gamble. While he was at WLW, Stoess directed Vocal Varieties, which originated at WLW and was broadcast on NBC-Red. Stoess left WLW in July 1944 to work for Trans- American Broadcasting & Television Corporation in New York. Later, he went to the American Broadcasting Company, where he was responsible for the music of the religious drama The Greatest Story Ever Told.

The cargo was eventually salvaged, and the scattered remains were investigated in 1988 and 1996. Career San Pedro de Alcantara was built of mahogany in Cuba in 1770, by an English shipbuilder in Spanish service. She sailed to Peru in 1784, where she loaded about 600 tons of copper, 153 tons of silver and four tons of gold from Peruvian mines. She also carried a collection of ancient ceramics from the Chimu culture, as well as political prisoners from the T√∫pac Amaru Rebellion (including T√∫pac Amaru's 12-year-old son) and from the Conspiracy of the Tres Antonios in Chile. The silver was in the form of minted coins, mostly \\"pieces of eight\\". Unfortunately the ship was heavily overloaded and the cargo was about twice as much as usual for such a ship. The captain was even warned that the ship would risk losing her bottom in a storm. However, there were no exact rules for the loading of ships, so she sailed for Spain anyway. During her voyage from Peru, San Pedro de Alcantara was constantly leaking, and the crew had a hard time manning the pumps. She was forced to put into the port of Talcahuano, in Chile, where major repairs were effected. After rounding Cape Horn, the ship had to be taken in again for repairs at Rio de Janeiro, where the leaks were again fixed. The ship continued her journey to Spain in early 1786. San Pedro de Alcantara sank in a storm on February 2, 1786, at approximately 10.30 PM, off Peniche, on the Portuguese coast, with the loss of 128 people. There were 270 survivors. Salvage operations began almost immediately, carried out by around 40 underwater divers, who without the help of any breathing apparatus brought up almost 750 tons of cargo over the three years following the disaster.

Origin The Radium Woman was based on √àve Curie's biography of her mother, which had been simultaneously published in France, Britain, Italy, Spain, the United States and other countries in 1937. Doorly explained in the foreword: :\\"The life of Madame Curie has been written by her daughter with a charm and beauty never surpassed. It is therefore with the deepest humility that I have ventured to make out of that lovely book a shorter tale for young people. People ought not to wait till they are over sixteen to make the acquaintance of the greatest and most delightful human beings and to hear of the world's greatest deeds.\\" Contents The first seven chapters concern Marie Curie's early life, which was spent in a Poland unwillingly incorporated into the Russian Empire. The book begins with the five-year-old Manya Sklodovski in her family home in Warsaw, already aware of the power of the Russian officials, and later describes the ten-year-old schoolgirl's experience of secretly learning forbidden Polish history with her class. Her surroundings and the incidents of her life are vividly described and her early brilliance unforcedly exhibited. Other chapters concern the fourteen-year-old Manya learning that a friend's brother is to be executed as a rebel, and her year's holiday after finishing High School at sixteen, time spent in the country and the mountains. The biography continues through the early difficult days of making a living by teaching, supporting her sister who was studying medicine in Paris, starting an illegal Polish school for peasant children in the country, and an unhappy love affair. Then after a brief sojourn in Belgium come her own days of study both in Paris and in Warsaw. \\"That was the part of Marie's life she loved best, her hard student days, when, working in poverty and alone, with all the power of her youth, she was most herself.\\" The Radium Woman, Chapter VIII. Her meeting with Pierre Curie which led to marriage and the flowering of her career, and the great discoveries which changed the face of science and earned the Nobel Prize, occupy the central chapters of the book. At each step the text is peppered with descriptions of her daily life and small significant incidents to make the story come alive for the young reader.

It is known only from a few bones. It was about 1 m long and probably weighed about 30 kg (66 lb). This makes it the largest monotreme known to have ever lived. Due to the lack of cranial material, placement of Z. hacketti into the modern long-beaked echidna genus Zaglossus is uncertain. Description At around 1 metre long, 0.6 metres tall and about 30 kg, Z. hacketti was the largest monotreme known to have existed. Z. hacketti had longer, straighter legs than any of the modern echidnas. Augee (2006) speculates that this feature made the animal more adept at traversing through thickly wooded forests. Discoveries Fossils of Z. hacketti have been discovered in Mammoth Cave, Western Australia. The material is poor, mostly vertebra and leg bones, and the cranial material is completely absent, making Z. hacketti's placement into the genus Zaglossus uncertain. Some of the fossils have incisions and burn marks, suggesting that Z. hacketti was at least occasionally hunted by humans. Aboriginal rock art found in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory may represent Z. hacketti or the extant western long-beaked echidna (Zaglossus bruijni).; Gunn, R.

Company history Cover of The Arena, monthly flagship publication of the Arena Publishing Co. Headquartered in Copley Square in Boston, the firm specialized in fiction and non-fiction books on the progressive causes of the 1890s. Though in existence for only a short period, from 1890 to 1896, Arena issued books by several important progressive figures of the time.Roger Eliot Stoddard, \\"Vanity and Reform: B. O. Flower's Arena Publishing Company, Boston, 1890-1896,\\" Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America, Vol. 76 No. 3 (1982), pp. 273-337. The firm has been called \\"the notoriously radical Arena Publishing Company.\\"Donald Pizer, Hamlin Garland's Early Work and Career. Berkeley, CA: University of California Publications, 1960; pg. 144. Arena released books on political and economic reform and progressive religious movements (including books written by Flower). The company's promotional materials advertised \\"important books for thoughtful people\\" on \\"progressive modern thought and effort.\\" It issued a number of the utopian novels that were a prominent feature of American literature in the late 19th century,Kenneth M. Roemer, The Obsolete Necessity: America in Utopian Writings, 1888-1900, Kent, OH, Kent State University Press, 1976.Jean Pfaelzer, The Utopian Novel in America, 1886-1896: The Politics of Form, Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1984. along with related speculative and science fiction. \\"Arena Publishing Company of Boston published twenty or more fantastic fiction volumes between 1892 and 1896.\\"James Gunn, The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, New York, Viking, 1988; p. 373.

McCrackan, The Rise of the Swiss Republic (1892) The firm's radicalism reached even into the format of its books. Flower believed that the standard printing format of black ink on white paper caused eyestrain; Schindler's Young West, a sequel to Edward Bellamy's famous Looking Backward, was issued with colored borders, that varied among blue, green, and yellow page margins.Arthur Mann, \\"Solomon Schindler: Boston Radical,\\" The New England Quarterly, Vol. 23 No. 4 (December 1950), pp. 453-76; see p. 471. Arena also produced popular fiction that concerned socially progressive issues. The titles and authors are now largely forgotten; Helen H. Gardener's feminist novel Pray You, Sir, Whose Daughter? (1892) and M. L. Cowles's Redpath: Life on a Southern Plantation (1893) are not unrepresentative. Flower nourished an interest in spiritualism  he served on the board of directors of the American Psychical Society  and published spiritual novels like Mary Clay Knapp's Whose Soul Have I Now? (1896). Along with its books, the firm also published a monthly journal titled The Arena, edited by Flower, which called itself \\"the leading progressive review of the world.\\" The journal featured articles and essays by the company's authors, like Garland and Schindler, plus early work by Frank Norris, Stephen Crane, and Upton Sinclair.Stanley Wertheim, A Stephen Crane Encyclopedia, Westport, CT, Greenwood Press, 1997; p. 109.

He was the eldest son of Henry VII with a Scar, Duke of Brzeg, by his first wife Helena, the daughter of Otto V, Count of Orlam√ºnde. Life =Childhood and Youth= Henry IX was his parents' only child. His mother died prematurely in 1369, shortly after his birth, perhaps even during the childbirth. The prince grew in the intellectual and artistic court of his grandfather, Louis I the Fair. He took part in the many scientific disputes, sumptuous feasts and balls, theatrical presentations and also knight tournaments. Louis I's library was one of the most extensive in Europe. The Duke, who was a renowned patron of the arts and culture, cared intensely about the education of his heirs. In 1379, Henry IX's father remarried. His new wife was Margareta of Masovia, daughter of Duke Siemowit III and widow of Casimir IV of Pomerania. From this union, Henry IX gained two half-siblings: Louis II and Margareta. Despite the considerable age difference between them, the brothers had a warm and close relationship for many years until the succession war at the beginning of the 15th century. On 5 July 1396 Louis I the Fair give Henry IX the towns of Kluczbork, Byczyna and Wo≈Çczyn, on occasion of his betrothal with Anna of Cieszyn, daughter of Duke Przemyslaus I Noszak; but was only on 29 September (nine days after the marriage ceremony) when he was confirmed with the formal possession of their domains, who produced a rent of 2,000 fines. In the marriage contract, was also stipulated that lands became in the widow's lands () of the bride. A few months later, Duke Louis I give his grandson the half of the rents of the towns of Brzeg, Wierzbno and O≈Çawa. =Beginning of Rule= On 6/23 December 1398 Louis I the Fair died, and was succeeded by his son Henry VIII, who died only eight months later, on 11 July 1399. Both brothers Henry IX and Louis II inherited the Duchy of Brieg and became co-rulers, but in October 1400 they decided to divided their lands. Henry IX took the districts of Lubin (L√ºben), Chojn√≥w (Haynau) and O≈Çawa (Ohlau), and Louis II took Brzeg (Brieg). On 17 July 1402 the two brothers appeared in a meeting of Piast Dukes in Wroclaw, which concluded with each other and the other Dukes a defensive alliance and paid homage to King Wenceslaus IV. =Captivity of Louis II by the Saracens= In 1404 Louis II went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, during which he was imprisoned by the Saracens. The unfortunate news reached to Brzeg only until the end of the year. Henry IX, in order to reunited the ransom for his brother, imposed to the inhabitants of Brzeg, as well of his own subjects of Chojn√≥w and O≈Çawa an additional tax. The needed sum of 4,000 fines was collected shortly after; however, Louis II wasn't returned to Silesia until the end of 1405. During his captivity, Henry IX held the regency over the Duchy of Brzeg. =War against Louis II. Death= In March 1409 Duke Wenceslaus II of Legnica, Bishop of Wroclaw, declared Louis II as his heir over the Duchy of Legnica and the half of Z≈Çotoryja. The rights over the other half of Z≈Çotoryja and a rent of 6,000 fines were assigned to Henryk IX. Wenceslaus II also decided also that both brothers had the option to take control over all Z≈Çotoryja if one pay the other in compensation. In the same year Louis II purchased to Henry IX his part of Z≈Çotoryja. At this point, the Duke of Lubin (already infuriated by the favoritism of Wenceslaus II over Louis II) and his younger brother broke their friendly relations. Soon the dispute turned into an open war, issued by Henry IX, which is going during the years 1411-1414. The war continue despite the mediation of Wenceslaus II, who tried to persuade Henry IX to stop. The dispute only ended thanks to the action of King Wenceslaus IV, who forbade his vassals to fight. The brothers were finally reconciled and issued a document on mutual help. The residents of the Duchy of Legnica-Z≈Çotoryja were obliged to paid homage to both Dukes.

In Somali speaking regions its widely known as Garas. In Ethiopia you will find it in Nechisar National Park and along the Sagan River in the Konso special woreda of Ethiopi. It is also sparsely distributed in Afar Region where the tree is much appreciated for its fruits. It is known to grow up to 10 meters in height. It is well known to the local Konso people (who call it karsata) for growing new shoots, flowers, and seeds during dry weather. They use it as an indicator of potential famine and drought conditions. D. glabra produces edible fruits and the seed is considered a typical famine food. However, the fruits must be cooked for a long time (i.e. up to 24 hours), they have a bad smell, and excessive consumption causes stomach aches and other intestinal problems.Yves Guinand and Dechassa Lemessa, \\"Wild-Food Plants in Southern Ethiopia: Reflections on the role of 'famine-foods' at a time of drought\\" UN-OCHA Report, March 2000 (accessed 15 January 2009) References Trees of Ethiopia Salvadoraceae Edible plants Drought- tolerant trees ","title":"Dobera glabra"},{"id":"21112938","text":"Choate Hall & Stewart LLP, commonly referred to as \\"Choate\\", is a Boston-based law firm.
