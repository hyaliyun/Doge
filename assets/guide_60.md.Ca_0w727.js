It was shot at the Tempelhof Studios in Berlin. The film's sets were designed by the art director Walter Haag. Plot The film starts with Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, held prisoner in Fotheringhay Castle, awaiting the final judgement in her case, which is expected within a few hours. Soon she finds out that the Royal Court has sentenced her, with the assent of Queen Elizabeth I, to be executed on the scaffold on the following day. She breaks down and remembers the events leading to her now imminent death. The bulk of the film consists of this flashback. The young Mary arrives from France to Scotland, as the lawful Queen of Scots, only to encounter a strong opposition. Her half-brother, Jacob Stuart, who had ruled the country till then, asserts that a woman is incapable of ruling the \\"rough\\" and \\"male\\" land of Scotland, and that she should have remained in \\"feminine\\" France. The lords, headed by Lord Bothwell, face Mary Stuart critically. Moreover, immediately upon her arrival Mary faces an assassination attempt with poisoned wine, by Johanna (Jean) Gordon, whose Clan Gordon was at feud with the Stuarts for many years. Members of the Privy Council, whom Mary summons to deal with the first political decisions to be announced, do not show up. The only one present is Jacob Stuart, who tears up the document presented for his signature. When the Queen is alone again Lord Bothwell arrives and confesses that he had fallen in love with her. Mary Stuart orders him arrested for insulting the Queen, even though she is impressed by his demeanour. Meanwhile, Queen Elizabeth I, angered that with a lawful Catholic queen taking over Scotland will limit her influence there and even threaten her right to the throne in England, sends to Scotland her confidant Henry Darnley - who is both an English peer and a Scottish lord - to spy for her and to raise the population against Mary Stuart. Nevertheless, Darnley himself falls in love with Queen Mary and leads her to lord Bothwell's Castle, where the Scottish lords meet secretly to plot the Queen's deposition. Mary ventures alone into the meeting, and is imprisoned. She is released the next day, but only to after having been made to swear an oath that she would marry a Scot. Mary Stuart's choice falls on lord Bothwell, whom she believes to be still in captivity. It turns out, however, that he had fled together with Jean Gordon, and has married her. The two of them raise an army with the aim of overthrowing Mary ‚Äì Jean wants revenge on the Queen and the Stuarts, while Lord Bothwell wants power. The Queen is meanwhile constrained to marry Lord Darnley, but becomes involved with the Italian singer David Riccio. Eventually, she gives birth to a boy child, James - the future King James I. A troupe of itinerant actors stages a play hinting broadly that Riccio is the Queen's lover and might be the father of her child. Lord Darnley feels mocked and indignant and therefore authorises a plot in which Riccio is assassinated. At this time Lord Bothwells' army appears, which The Queen allows to enter Lord Bothwell's Castle and temporarily take over power in the land \\"for the Queen's own protection\\". Lord Darnley has meanwhile fallen ill with smallpox. On the advice of Lord Bothwell, now her lover, Mary has her ill husband brought to Edinburgh, where he dies in an explosion at his home. Now Queen Elisabeth sends an army to Scotland to release Mary Stuart from the power of Bothwell and to offer to her refuge in England, which is actually a trap meant to imprison Mary and keep her away from the throne of Scotland. Meanwhile, Mary Stuart had married Lord Bothwell, who had separated from Jean Gordon. The wedding is interrupted when the English army appears under the guidance of Jacob Stuart, the Queen's half-brother, who presents secret love letters which Mary Stuart had sent to Bothwell while still married to her previous husband. Olivier, the Queen's page, is killed while attempting to hide the letters. Lord Bothwell is faced with the choice of standing by Mary Stuart and dying, or denying her. He turns away from her, but the treacherous Jacob Stuart still sentences him to death by dragging (in actual history he fled to Denmark whose King treated him cruelly and where he eventually died in prison; all of which is not mentioned in the film). When Jacob Stuart takes from his sister her child James, to protect him against Queen Elizabeth, Mary Stuart accepts the offer of the English Queen and goes into exile in England, which sets up her path to the scaffold. The frame story from the beginning resumes. Mary makes peace with dying and pledges her undying devotion to her ladies-in-waiting, the people of Scotland, and the many men she loved and lost. The next morning Mary Stuart, in a stunning bejeweled red gown, is led to the scaffold and kneels down in prayer as she awaits the sharp hatchet to fall. Cast The cast included * Zarah Leander: Mary, Queen of Scots * Walther Suessenguth: Lord Jacob Stuart (James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray) * Willy Birgel: Lord Bothwell (James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell) * Maria Koppenh√∂fer: Queen Elizabeth I * Lotte Koch: Johanna Gordon (Jean Gordon, Countess of Bothwell) * Axel von Ambesser: Henry Darnley (Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley) * Enrico Benfer: David Riccio * Will Quadflieg: Page Olivier * Hubert von Meyerinck: Sir John * Erich Ponto: Itinerant actor * Ursula Herking: Member of the itinerant actors' troupe * Hans Hessling: Nelson, Henry Darnley's Companion * Margot Hielscher: One of the Four Marys * Herbert H√ºbner: Lord Arran (James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran) * Rudolf Klein-Rogge: Ruthven, General of the Scottish Palace Guard * Eduard von Winterstein: An English General * Josef Sieber: Paris, a Scottish prison guard * Ernst Stahl-Nachbaur: John Knox The heart as a theme The theme of the heart's emotions is repeated throughout the whole film. The cold Elizabeth I who had obviously edged any love out of her own life is contrasted with the extremely emotional Mary Stuart, whose life is filled (as presented in the film) by love. When Queen Elizabeth learns of the birth of the Scottish heir to the throne gets, she exclaims: \\"I rule and she loves!\\". One of the last lofty expressions Mary are in the film: \\"Kings win in life - hearts, in eternity\\". Mary Stuart appears guided exclusively by emotions. She says: \\"My heart has guided me; it is the only thing that leads me.\\" The biggest mistake of her life - the marriage with Lord Darnley, shows the exception: \\"It is about the crown, not about your heart\\" Darnley says in the film. Nevertheless, it is noted that their common son, the future King James I would be a good ruler but - as one of the courtiers says to Queen Mary - he will also \\"have a big heart\\". Production \\"Das Herz der K√∂nigin\\" was filmed from November 1939 to March 1940 in the Babelsberg film studio. On 29 October 1940 the film censorship board classified the film as \\"unsuitable for minors\\" but otherwise \\"valuable\\" both \\"artistically\\" and \\"culturally\\". The premiere took place on 1 November 1940 in the M√ºnchen Ufa-Palace (\\"Luitpold-Theater\\") The film is punctuated by numerous songs, mostly sung by Zarah Leander: * \\"A black stone, a white stone\\" (Zarah Leander) * \\"Where is your heart\\" (Zarah Leander) * \\"Slumber song\\" (Zarah Leander) * \\"Once a foreign guest comes to you\\" (Zarah Leander, Friedrich Benfer) * \\"If only you do not think of it, nothing will hurt you\\" (Erich Ponto) The text was written by Harald Braun, the music by Theo Mackeben. *In 1941 Harald Braun published a novelization, also titled Das Herz der K√∂nigin. Criticism Das Herz der K√∂nigin became a failure in its time and also today counts as one of the weakest of Zarah Leander's films. The International Film Encyclopedia criticized the film as a work from the Nazi era with a strong anti-British bias:Klaus Br√ºne (Ed.): Lexikon des Internationalen Films. Band 3. Rowohlt, Reinbek bei Hamburg 1990, S. 1594. \\"The depiction of the cold ruler Elizabeth I was aimed at presenting the early history of 'British imperialism' and its striving for world domination, which would have consequences 'for all parts of the Earth during centuries up to the present' ‚Äú, thus implicitly justifying Germany's war with Britain at the time.Theodor Riegler: \\"Ballade von Leben, Liebe und Tod.

Berg , Oxford and New York 2007, P. 167. Moreover, critics noted that \\"The extreme miscasting of Zarah Leander in the leading role added to the film's kitsch an unintended comic element\\", that \\"The film is superficial and pseudo-historical\\" and that \\"In her stiff splendid evening gowns as Mary Stuart, Leander could hardly move\\".Yvonne Tiedt: \\"Es leuchten die Sterne.

Aid is particularly focused on impoverished areas with higher proportions of at-risk children and youth. History The first steps toward school social work in Hungary were taken after World War I, when school nurses (referred to as green cross nurses by Em≈ëke B√°nyai) started working at schools in the late 1930s.B√°nyai, E. (2000). Az iskolai szoci√°lis munka √©s lehet≈ës√©gei az ezredfordul√≥n Magyarorsz√°gon. In: H√°l√≥, August, pp. 3‚Äì5. Similar to that of a present-day social worker, they pursued individual case work and aided families in the field and at school. The nurses had a college or university degree in education and belonged to the staff of the school, with the scope of their duties shaped according to its needs. The nurses offered family care services mainly for families residing in the slums of Budapest in order to prevent academic failure and school dropout.Pik, K. (1994). A ferencv√°rosi Gyermekj√≥l√©ti Szolg√°latr√≥l. Csal√°d, gyermek ifj√∫s√°g, No. 5, pp. 8‚Äì11. Following World War II, the Hungarian political elite declared that education was the primary requirement for child protection. The first significant change in child protection took place in 1964, when teachers were appointed child protection workers in the kindergartens and schools of Budapest. Elements similar to those in the work of school social workers appeared in the scope of activities of family care workers employed by educational advisory services, which were launched in 1967. In 1975, child protection supervisors were appointed to advise child protection workers at schools. Such child protection supervision functioned until 1985. Employees of family-care centres established in the mid-1980s developed a committed social worker identity. They made regular contacts with local schools, kindergartens, and offered various services to the children, parents and teachers. As a form of youth protection, a so-called afternoon-care system was functioning in the 1970s and 1980s with elements resembling present-day social work. Social and economic changes taking place in the late 1980s and the consequent increase in the rate of unemployment, declassing and dramatic impoverishment of certain social groups, changes in social norms and values, and the related emergence and extension of deviant behaviour challenged schools. It became apparent that these sudden and intensely rising problems were preventing schools from fulfilling their basic tasks, and could not be addressed by traditional educational tools. Child protection workers, whose positions were filled by teachers, did not have the qualifications or the time necessary for the management of complicated cases. Finally, schools stated their claim to employ professionals who provide personal social services for pupils, parents and staff members.Fiszter, E. (1994). Hetedik f√©l√©ves terepgyakorlat a ferencv√°rosi gyermekj√≥l√©ti szolg√°latn√°l. (manuscript) Resolutions of the 1990s To resolve the problems which had arisen, three basic concepts were developed by the early 1990s: the appointment of dedicated full- and part-time child protection workers, specialized schools for underprivileged areas with large numbers of at-risk children, and teams of social workers based in local child care centres. Appointing teachers to the duty of child protection Employment of child protection workers The management of some schools sought to enhanced child protection service by partially or wholly freeing the workdays of teachers willing and suited to the task of assisting troubled children and their families. Teachers so appointed usually did not have proper qualifications nor were they sufficiently equipped (with an interview room, telephone and supervision). As they were expected to act according to the interests of the school which employed them, it was difficult for them to advocate for the children and their families against the school administration. Colleagues often overwhelmed them with feelings of frustration and unreasonable demands, and they were frequently called to serve as substitute teachers on their days off.B√°nyai, E. (2006). Az oktat√°si, nevel√©si int√©zm√©nyek gyermekv√©delmi szolg√°ltat√°sainak jellemz≈ëi, a szoci√°lis szolg√°ltat√°sok kapcsol√≥d√°si lehet≈ës√©gei, fejleszt√©si hangs√∫lyai a gyermekszeg√©nys√©g cs√∂kkent√©se √©rdek√©ben. Gyerekes√©ly F√ºzetek Employment of independent child protection workers To improve upon the above model, child protection workers were separated from schools in the early 1990s and employed by the Educational Service Cabinet, in districts XV and XVI of Budapest. Their assignment and supervision was made by the educational department of the local government. This ended the conflict of loyalties but it continued to use educational means and an educational approach. The model was criticized as it continued to employ people who were teachers by training, rather than social workers; and as a government employee the school social worker could not stand against the state schools administration. Despite these problems, the employment of child protection workers remained standard practice at schools. Internal school social work Alternative schools established in the early 1990s sought to provide education satisfying the individual needs of children coming from underprivileged social backgrounds and being unable to manage in a traditional school. In these schools, educational and social work overlap; the educational concept requires the staff to utilize social expertise in educational work. Success of the model is presumably due to the staff's awareness in handling problems that pupils face outside school and a supporting attitude toward pupils. Despite facing some of the same issues of conflict of interest, such schools continue to employ school social workers even when traditional schools ceased to offer services. Both the need among the pupils and the academic mission of the alternative schools legitimized the role of the school social worker. External school social work Recognizing the important role that schools played in child and youth protection work, the first school social work teams in Hungary were formed in the early 1990s (Gedeon 1996). Social services provided by external experts were introduced in several schools at the same time. On the basis of such work launched in autumn 1991 from a local child care centre to a school in District VII of Budapest, a team was set up with the help of the local government in 1992. In District VIII, it was also a child care centre that posted a school social worker to a local school. In 1993, the Child Protection Group initiated services in District XI. At the outset, the group belonged to the Educational Service Centre, and later was converted into a child welfare centre (B√°nyai 2009, Moln√°r 2009, Mih√°ly 1991). These were distinguished from the independent child protection workers under the educational department of the local government. Perhaps the best-known experimental project carrying out \\"external\\" school social work was the \\"Ferencv√°ros\\" Network of School Social Workers. The network was started in summer 1992. Later it was renamed \\"Ferencv√°ros\\" White Raven Child Welfare Service. In District IX of Budapest, the local government promoted the establishment of the child welfare service in 1992. The concept was developed by Dr Mihaly and her colleagues. The main principle on which they stood was: \\"Child protection must be removed from schools, but it must not be handed over to the system of authorities. A child protection system independent form authorities has to be created\\" (Dr Mihaly, 2008). It is a characteristic of the model that it considers the community surrounding the school, including the network of supporting organizations. They aspired to create and run a region-based child protection system. The social worker did not want to take up the child protection worker's duties, but focused on the role of a mediator, co-ordinator, and \\"catalyst\\". Working with pupils was reduced, since social workers were on duty at schools only once a week. The range of activities covered group work, organizing club sessions, summer camping and playrooms, and offering homework help ‚Äì instead of doing case management for individuals. Furthermore, they worked with families and were entitled to offer them financial and in-kind assistance. A structure of services different from that of the traditional school social work evolved due to the lack of modern child protection services and institutions providing customized care for clients in Hungary. In particular, services were offered to families to prevent children from being removed from their birth parents, as there was no basic child welfare services separate from the operation of authorities. \\"Ferencv√°ros\\" Child Welfare Service attempted to fill this gap. This work led to the Child Welfare Act that came into effect in November 1997. After the law came into effect, the \\"Ferencv√°ros\\" Child Welfare Service underwent a transformation: child welfare activities began to outweigh school social work, which had previously been of primary importance. The Child Welfare Act created new conditions for the operation of the other networks of school social workers and child welfare services as well, easing the burden on local governments. As a consequence, classical school social work became overshadowed by the corrective tasks of child welfare. As since 1996, Annex 1 of Act LXII of 1996 have been obliging schools to employ a part-time child protection worker, schools should have increased capability of support for students. However, in practice schools continued to give this work to teachers without adequate qualifications. Post-2000 Since 2004, school social work has been expanding, with increasing employment. Child welfare services also focus more on school social work. Since the national register of school social workers is currently being prepared, exact data is unavailable. At present, there are three main approaches to school social work in Hungary: #Internal school social work or the so-called traditional model #External school social work or the Ferencv√°ros model #The P√©cs model Employing teachers as child protection workers is no longer a viable option following the introduction of university degree programmes in social work and social education, which provided qualified professionals. Traditional model In the internal or traditional model, the school social worker's employer is the administrator of the school. The school social worker offers various social services while present at the school, and is familiar with its functioning. The social worker may form a team with a school doctor or nurse, but generally does not have supervision or team case management available. This model is applied mainly by schools maintained by (e.g.: Burattino √Åltal√°nos - √©s Szakk√©pz≈ë Iskola, Forr√°s Szakiskola, Gandhi Gimn√°zium, Vil√°g Vil√°goss√°ga Alap√≠tv√°ny), but a few such state schools also exist (e.g.: Radn√≥ti Szakk√∂z√©piskola in the city of P√©cs, √âltes M√°ty√°s Iskola, Magyarmecskei √Åltal√°nos Iskola). The first school social work programmes in Hungary followed this model. External model In the external or Ferencv√°ros model, school social work is delivered to the by external suppliers through networks. Each colleague assists 4‚Äì5 schools (or kindergartens), with weekly service available for a relatively short time to each school. Group and community work overshadows individual case management. Qualified professionals are aided by supervision and team case management. External school social work is implemented mainly by state-run child welfare services (e.g.: II. ker√ºleti Gyermekj√≥l√©ti K√∂zpont, √öjbudai Hum√°n Szolg√°ltat√≥ K√∂zpont Gyermekj√≥l√©ti Szolg√°lata, Sopron, Szombathely, Ny√≠regyh√°za), but there are some NGO-run services as well (e.g. Perif√©ria Egyes√ºlet). Programmes based on the external model were set back by the Child Protection Act, since the act promoted the corrective child protection activities of the services. However, new emphasis was placed on school social work after the 2003 consensus conference of child welfare services, which found only 14 percent of services carried out school social work in 2005. Strengths of the model are the employment of professionals with adequate qualifications and the support of networks. Critics of the model blame the departure from the conceptional framework of the traditional model (B√°nyai 2006), and the so-called \\"schedule of attendance\\", which means that a school social worker spends only a few hours a week at a particular school. The P√©cs model The P√©cs model, which was formed in 2006, combines the advantages of the previous two models. The school social worker assists one school per day with social services and attends weekly team case management meetings. A network of professionals offers support in supervision and individual counselling, case management, standardized paperwork and registration of clients, etc. The school social worker is employed by an NGO independent from both the school and the child welfare system, and is thus less biased by organizational hierarchy. Conceptually, the framework uses modern ecological models applied to child- oriented school social work. The school social worker applies a preventive approach to find solutions to pupils' problems, using individual casework, social group work and community work, considering both the environment and the complexity of the personality, and seeks solutions with the help of a multidisciplinary team (M√°t√© 2008). This model is applied by the Network of School Social Workers of INDIT K√∂zalap√≠tv√°ny at six schools. The model co- operates closely with youth supporting programs outside schools. Moreover, INDIT K√∂zalap√≠tv√°n itself runs youth-supporting programmes such as Youth Office \\"Alternative\\" (the first youth-supporting programme in Hungary located in a shopping mall), Street Social Work Service and the Party Service (a harm reduction programme for party-goers). Integration of the above programmes into one organization makes it possible for INDIT to reach school-dropouts and truants. Education and professional associations Standardized training and active associations are of crucial importance to forming a cohesive profession. It is standard practice for school social workers in Hungary to have a university or college degree in social work or social education. These two professions, rooted in different cultures [social work from the United States and social education from Germany], have developed quite similarly and are nearly identical in scope. There are some regional variances depending on the type of degree programmes available in the area. At B√°rczi Guszt√°v Gy√≥gypedag√≥giai F≈ëiskola, psychoeducators for specialized child protection work have been trained since 1973. From 1985 several degree programmes for general child protection have been accredited. ELTE (E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University of Budapest) launched a postgraduate degree programme in social policy in 1985. Hungarian colleges and universities started undergraduate programmes in general social work in 1989 and in social education in 1990. Requirements of qualification of undergraduate programmes in social studies (social policy, social work, social education) were issued in 1996 (Government Decree on Requirements of Qualification of Undergraduate University Degree Programmes in Social Studies 6/1996 [January 18], Annex 2) (Bucsy 2005). Courses on school social work were introduced to the above programmes. Dr. Istv√°n Budai at Vit√©z J√°nos Tan√≠t√≥k√©pz≈ë F≈ëiskola (Vit√©z J√°nos Teacher Training College) in 1991 and Em≈ëke B√°nyai at ELTE in 1993 were the first to teach this subject. According to the results of a study carried out in 2009, school social work is currently taught at eleven university departments of social work and at six departments of social education. School social work is part of undergraduate degree programmes at most faculties training social professionals, which demonstrates the importance of the subject. However, there have yet to be any graduate- level programs in Hungary, though Kodol√°nyi J√°nos University of Applied Sciences plans to launch a one-year master programme in school social work. The first Hungarian school social work textbook was published in 1993 by the Vit√©z J√°nos Tan√≠t√≥k√©pz≈ë F≈ëiskola (Vit√©z J√°nos Teacher Training College of Esztergom) and the √ìv√≥k√©pz≈ë F≈ëiskola (Preschool Teacher Training College of Hajd√∫b√∂sz√∂rm√©ny) and was edited by Istv√°n Budai. The book was published under the title Papers on child welfare I. ‚Äì School social work. The Hungarian School Social Worker Association was founded at a conference organized by Kodol√°nyi J√°nos University of Applied Sciences on November 30, 2007, in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. Objectives of the association are: *to knit Hungarian school social professionals together *to serve as a scientific and professional basis for school social workers and as an organization representing their interests *to improve the life quality of children and youth living in Hungary by means of spreading school social work across the country. The association intends to participate in the codification of regulations controlling school social work. As part of the above policy formulation and law making process, the association is ready to contribute to defining the conditions and protocol for school social work and to the improvement of finances.

It originated in the three infantry companies of Bhils of the Jodhpur Legion that stayed loyal to the British when the Legion revolted in 1857. (The Bhil companies had been raised in 1841.) They were incorporated in 1860 as the Erinpoorah (or Erinpura) Irregular Force by a Lt-Col J F W Hall. This force was composed of a squadron of cavalry, mainly Sikhs, numbering, 164 of all ranks, and eight companies of infantry, numbering 719. The British mostly enlisted Bhils and Minas in the infantry to provide employment to people of the local tribes and thus ween them away from their lawless habits.Imperial Gazetteer of India, (1908‚Äì1931), v. 12, p. 27. From end 1870 to 1881 the commandant was in political charge of the Sirohi district and on several occasions he sent out detachments to support the police in patrolling disturbed areas and arresting dacoits. In 1895 the strength of the cavalry squadron was reduced from 164 to 100 of all ranks. In 1897 the force, which had till then been under the Foreign Department of the Government of India, was placed under the Commander-in-Chief. After the Kitchener reforms of the Indian Army in 1903, it was renamed the 43rd (Erinpura) Regiment. The regiment was made up of four double companies of infantry recruited from Rajputana Hindus and Muslims. The regimental depot was at Erinpura in Rajasthan throughout its history from 1860‚Äì1921. On the outbreak of World War I the 43rd was serving as part of the 5th (Mhow) Division. During World War I the regiment served in the 15th Indian Division during the Mesopotamia Campaign. The first or regular battalion was employed mainly in escort duties and guarding line of communication, although it was present at the Second Battle of Ramada in September 1917. A second battalion was raised in 1917. As a war- time unit lacking experienced personnel it was employed mainly for guard and other security purposes in Bombay,http://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armyunits/indianinfantry/43rderinpura.htm before being disbanded in 1920. After World War I the Indian government reformed the army again moving from single-battalion infantry units to multi- battalion regiments. As part of this reorganisation nine infantry regiments were disbanded.

History It was designed by architect Louis Dubois in 1904 and opened in 1906 originally called Lutetia Hotel, and was one of the greatest representatives of Art Nouveau arrived in Argentina in the early twentieth century. The Avenida de Mayo was still a fashionable avenue, opened in 1896, where during the passage of the first decade of the styles used for buildings evolved, from academicism or Neoclassicism to Art Nouveau, Art Deco and later. Moreover Avenue, which had been designed for residences of the aristocracy and great palaces, was exploited by the owners of the land to build apartment buildings there income (rent) which quickly mutated into hotels.

Pe√±arol was the champion. History After the schism of 1922, Central and Pe√±arol were disaffiliated from the association. Both associations, FUF and AUF, organised their own tournaments separately. With several attempts to reunification failed, the Government of Uruguay intervened to solve the problem and as a result, the AUF decided not to hold a championship in 1925. As the situation had not significantly changed in 1926, the AUF did not organise an official championship either. With the purpose of joining both associations, AUF and FUF, the National Government established a provisional championship, named \\"H√©ctor R. G√≥mez\\", to be played in two series. It was played in two groups, \\"serie A\\", with all the clubs of Primera Divisi√≥n (with the exception of Charley and Dublin, that had left the league some time ago).

The village has 1280 residents, is located 78 m asl and its inhabitants are called Bavariani. Physical Geography The centre is located at the foot of the Montello, along the former road Schiavonesca SS 248, between the villages of Sovilla (east) and Giavera (west). The village is located about 22 km from Treviso and 3 km from Nervesa della Battaglia.  History  Human presence dates back to ancient times: in Bavaria stone tools were found, among the oldest relics of the province, dating back to Mousterian (70.000-40.000 years ago). Human presence reappeared in the Montello 5th millennium BC. Under Roman rule, Bavaria was a farming area. Starting from 11th century a community of German origin, the Bavarians which the town was named after, gave rise to the current village. During Venetian domination the forest of Montello was almost cleared and wood was taken to the port (such was the importance that the forest of Montello was ideally placed ‚Äúwithin the arsenal‚Äù, the heart of Venetian power). During the First World War, in the years 1917 and 1918, the town was on the front line and its inhabitants were evacuated. Bavaria was razed and the reconstruction was very difficult. After the war, poverty was such that Bavaria and the whole area were addressed as the town of the sachet, alluding to the large number of poor people who, with a canvas bag in hand, meandered through the nearby towns to beg for a handful of cornmeal to make a simple polenta. Since the early '60 the area has developed a solid industrial and crafting network, extended to the entire Montello. Monuments and places of interest Religious Buildings Parish Church St. Urban parish church has very ancient origins, previously part of the parish of Cusignana (as was the parish in Nervesa). Until 1593 it contained an altarpiece by Fiumicelli depicting various Saints. Originally, the side altars were dedicated to St. Urban and St. Vincent and the other altarpiece to St. Gotthard; later, the first was rededicated to the Resurrection and to Rosario, while the second was rededicated to St. Valentine. The marble main altar comes from the Certosa del Montello, demolished after the Napoleonic invasion. Around 1820 the building was expanded and supported by a belltower destroyed during the First World War. During the year 1939 the new church floor was completed. In 2008 the facade was beautifully restored. Other Sacred Places * Church of Our Lady of Fatima and St. Valentine: church-monument built in 1925 and named for Our Lady of Fatima and St. Valentine, town patron. * Cave of St. Jerome: This is a small Chapel built by Zaccaria de' Zaccaria between 1813 and 1819, shortly after the demolition of the Certosa. It was built with materials salvaged from a 14th-century hermitage site in the valley, one of the three potential sources on the Montello upon which the Certosa itself could have originated. Severely damaged during the Great War and subsequently neglected, it was restored in the 1990s by local Alpini volunteers. Civilian buildings Palazzo Sfoglio Antolini An example of a classic Villa Veneta, Palazzo Sfoglio-Antolini dates back to 1825. The building was damaged during the First World War, even used as a factory for part of its life, it was eventually sold by the Vatican in the 1960s. In the last decade, the Villa has benefited from a major restoration and conservation effort. Facing the canal, the privately owned home consists of a central building with two mezzanine floors and a barchessa, positioned as a wing addition with arches and external frescoes. On the inside, the large main hall has frescoes attributed to Giambattista Canale (1745‚Äì1825), son of Fabio Canale (1703‚Äì1767) and a relative of Antonio Canale (known as Canaletto). Other local examples of his artistry can be found at the parish church in Caerano San Marco and Palazzo Labia near Venice. Natural areas Sports The Bavaria sport facility is home to Nervesa's basketball team, known as Pallacanestro Nervesa, as well as the Futsal team, called Atletico Nervesa, formerly United Nervesarcade after merging with the nearby team in Arcade, Italy. The new football grounds are occasionally used by the Nervesa team, Football Club Nervesa, but is also host to various youth soccer- football tournaments, drawing players from throughout the province of Treviso. During the 2009 parish festival, the final of the Italian tug of war Championship was held on the football grounds. At each annual parish festival, 5 km and 10 km running events are organized on the scenic Montello. Festivals Since 1986 a traditional Sagra, or rural festival, dedicated to the Madonna della Certosa (‚ÄòThe Madonna of the Carthusian monastery‚Äô) has taken place at the end of July. In the past there was also a festival of Saint Valentine in mid-February.

History  It has existed from at least the 9th century, and has numbered among its monks many important figures in Georgian ecclesiastical history. At the end of the 13th century Sapara became a possession of the Jakeli family, whose leader, Sargis Jakeli, was adept at staying on good terms with the Mongols, which enabled Samtskhe to enjoy a peace unusual for the time. When he grew old, Sargis took monastic orders and changed his name to Saba. His son Beka built the largest of the 12 churches here, St Saba's Church, named after the saint whose name his father had adopted, one of the most architecturally important churches of its time. The 14th-century frescoes inside are of high quality. From the end of the 16th century until the beginning of the 17th century the Sapara Monastery became empty due to the expansion of Ottoman Empire policy into Samtskhe and during this process the monastery's icons and other treasures were taken to more protected areas of Georgia. Sapara Monastery Architecture Set in a green forested canyon, the monastery is contrastingly distinguished by its pink and yellow stones. The ensemble is composed of church buildings and remnants of a palace and fortifications walls. The most important is the cross-in-square temple of St. Saba. Another significant church is St. Mary's Assumption Church. St. Mary's Assumption Church This was the earliest church in the ensemble, built, probably, in the 10th century. The large hall church has two entrances: original, western, and northern, which was opened after the construction of St. Saba's Church. The western part, unusually for hall churches, has two floors. Its eastern part contains the apse with the conch. The fragments of frescos date to the beginning of 14th century. The facades are decorated by reliefs. St. Saba's Church Best example of the 13th century temple architecture in Georgia, this church also survived in rather good condition till modern timesZakaraya, P. (1983) Pamyatniki Vostochnoi Gruzii. Iskusstvo, Moskva, 376 s. [Monuments of Eastern Georgia](In Russian). Ordered to be constructed by Beka I Jaqeli, it was built by architect Peresasdze. His name can be found on the western window arch of the portal. Due to complex relief and little space he had to built a wall from the southern side. The church probably had three entrances. Currently only the northern and western remain. The eastern facade is distinguished by contrastingly produced square altar part. Within the church the apse is flanked by the prothesis and sacristy on the ground floor, and the crypts on the upper. An archaic feature is the presence of choirs in the upper floor of the western part. The upper floor is connected with the entire space by the arches. The interior is illuminated rather weakly by four windows, one in each arm of the cross, and eight windows in the dome tholobate. The mural have signs of development through the church history: variation in the manner, colours, width of contours. The murals of the southern wall are probably the oldest, from the 14th century. Generally following the traditions of that period, special accent is made on space and tonality with a number of planes. The lower part of the southern wall depicts St. Saba and Jaqeli rulers of Samtskhe: Sargis I, Beka I, Sargis II and Kvarkvare. Above them the Great Feasts, also depicted on the northern wall. The western wall contains numerous Biblical scenes. Among them healings, miracles and the Last Judgement. The apse, in addition to bishops and deacons, depicts the Deesus and Eucharist. The vaults are decorated by the medallions of evangelists. Further up, the tholobate contains eight disciples. Above them, in the dome, the Ascension. The exterior decoration is rich as well. Polychromatic red-violet cladding is typical for the period, as well as the dipped window decorations. It is rather hard to explore the eastern facade, hanging over a precipice; thus poor decoration. Southern facade has ornamentation around the entrance and the windows, particularly the central window. Entering from the northern portal, its tympanum contains a cross with two medallions, carrying birds. An ornamentation flanks the entrance. The eastern portal and the upper facade both have rich and harmonic ornamentation. The heavy dome contains sixteen windows on the tholobate - eight true and eight false, a feature that will become common in later churches. Its bell tower is one of the oldest built in Georgia. Its cubic first floor contain depictions of the members of Lasuridze family, and, thus, served as their tomb. The belfry is on the upper floor.

He won the Federal Duck Stamp competition a record five times in his life: 1948, 1951, 1959, 1969 and 1971. Reece turned 100 in April 2020Maynard Reece‚Äôs Legacy Is Protected Habitat and died in July that year.Maynard F. Reece Early life and education Reece was born in Arnolds Park on Lake Okoboji in northwestern Iowa. His father was a Quaker minister. The nature of his father's work meant that the family moved often, and this gave Reece exposure to many different aspects of American rural beauty. \\"Growing up on the marshes of northwest Iowa, Maynard Reece began drawing and painting with pencils and barn paints. His seventh grade teacher introduced him to watercolors, and he decided to become an artist. In 1940, Reece moved to the capital city of Des Moines for work where he found a job in the museum of the Iowa Department of History and Archives. During his time there, he met Ding Darling, Iowa's most prolific and acclaimed political cartoonist of the time, who became a mentor to Reece's burgeoning talent in drawing. Art In 1948, Reece won his first Federal Duck Stamp competition. These are not postage stamps but rather stamps required for all waterfowl hunters to have in their possession when hunting waterfowl. He became a prolific and often-published artist. His illustrations have appeared in magazines such as Life, Sports Illustrated, Saturday Evening Post, Sports Afield, Outdoor Life, Ducks Unlimited and National Wildlife. Moreover, he has published two books devoted to his own wildlife art: The Waterfowl Art of Maynard Reece and The Upland Bird Art of Maynard Reece. His art combines an accuracy of detail with a keen expressiveness of feeling. \\"Much has been written about the accuracy of Reece's artwork; every detail correct - feathers, position, wind, weather and weeds...These things are combined with a feel for color, a sensitivity to the moods of nature and the ability to dip back into the mental images of decades of outdoor observation to create a work of art which is much more than the sum of its parts.\\" Awards * 1948.

Their concerts, given in very high-society settings, featured the new (to American ears) four-part arrangements (tenor, second tenor, baritone and bass) that the Club founders discovered when wealthy folk began to tour Europe during the expansionist boom brought about by the Civil War. In a format that was followed by the glee clubs that sprang up in other cities, the Mendelssohn Club presented artistic works from (initially mostly German) composers, mixed with 4-part renditions of sentimental and novelty pieces, to audiences of influential friends and relatives in pleasantly informal settings. In this way, the Club created an audience for classical music among the newly well-to-do where none had existed before, leading directly to the establishment of symphony orchestras and other classical music ensembles across the country The Club's concerts were invitation-only affairs, and in its heyday it could take up to six years for new members to be admitted. In 1890, their performance so affected Alfred Corning Clark, the millionaire owner of Singer Sewing Machines and a former member who had joined in a duet with Nell Arthur, the wife of President Chester A. Arthur, in the Club's second concert, that he immediately commissioned the construction of the six- story Mendelssohn Hall on West 40th Street, close by the early home of the Metropolitan Opera. The Hall was designed by architect and member Robert Henderson Robertson and was completed in 1892. It featured an 1100-seat auditorium, rehearsal space, apartments, and two gigantic 30-foot long murals on canvas by the artist Robert Frederick Blum in the neo-classical style that characterized the Golden Age. Among the Club's tenants was the artist Winslow Homer, who once offered to sketch the club in payment for his back rent; he was turned down. The Club was dispossessed in 1911 after Clark's widow died, and her heirs sought to make some money by leasing the building to Kinemacolor, an ambitious but premature venture into color movies. On February 12, 1916, on the golden anniversary of the Mendelssohn Glee Club and also that of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, members and guests gathered in the auditorium of the Waldorf Astoria in New York, where the Club sang to the members and guests of the Ellis Glee Club of Los Angeles, seated with telephone receivers held fast to their ears in the Biltmore Hotel, 3,000 miles of wire away. Singing to New York in their turn, the Ellis Club completed the world's first transcontinental concert, marking the dawn of the Electronic Age as the Golden Age faded away. Directors and members The first significant conductor of the Mendelssohn Glee Club, Joseph Mosenthal, helped to popularize the group through his dramatic leadership and musical vision. Mosenthal, who served for 30 years and composed several ambitious works for the Club, exhausted himself getting to rehearsal during a snowstorm in January 1896 and died on a sofa in Mendelssohn Hall, directly beneath his portrait by John White Alexander. He was succeeded by the young Edward MacDowell, who had just returned to New York to found the School of Music at Columbia University. When MacDowell's career came to a tragic end in 1904 after being nearly killed by a hansom cab, the Club stepped in with benefit concerts and private donations that led to the founding of the MacDowell Colony for the Arts in Peterborough, New Hampshire, where the composer eventually succumbed. His place was taken by Walter Damrosch, of the famous New York musical family. During World War II the Club was led by Cesare Sodero, who was also the vocal director for Verdi operas at the Met. Sodero was followed by Emerson Buckley, who left to found the Fort Lauderdale Symphony and later to introduce Luciano Pavarotti to America. The noted basso John Royer Bogue led the Club through its centennial years. In 1966, the first concert of its 100th season was marked by the only time the great Blum murals have been displayed since Mendelssohn Hall was torn down. The baton was passed to the present director, Eugene Wisoff, in 1993. Notable members have included tenor soloist Richard Crooks, baritone soloist and composer Oley Speaks, and operatic and concert basso Herbert Witherspoon. Members of the Met chorus commonly joined the Club as well. Among the young female soloists who have been part of the Club's performances ever since President Arthur's wife are some who went on to be Metropolitan Opera stars, like Licia Albanese, Aprile Millo, and Helen Traubel. Influence The Mendelssohn Glee Club had a tremendous impact on American musical tastes, especially the appreciation of what we now call classical music among the upper class in the later 19th Century. A trip to Boston in 1871 resulted in the formation of the Apollo Club of Boston, leading soon after to the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In the same way, the Mendelssohn Club's visits initiated the Orpheus Club of Philadelphia, and from this the Philadelphia Orchestra. Other men's glee clubs on the Mendelssohn model sprang up across the country, creating a lasting heritage of participation in serious music by men who simply love to sing.

In most cases, the association, especially when formalised by local government, is known as \\"town twinning\\" (), though other terms, such as \\"partner towns\\" or \\"sister cities\\" are sometimes used instead, and while most of the places included are towns, the list also comprises villages, cities, districts, counties, etc. with similar links. As a sign of deteriorating relations with China, Gothenburg, Link√∂ping, Lule√• and V√§ster√•s, which have had long-standing twinning or partnership agreements with Chinese cities ‚Äì Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xian and Jinan respectively ‚Äì have allowed the agreements to lapse in 2020. Link√∂ping mayor Lars Vikinge told that they were terminating all political contact with China because of the unacceptable Chinese hostility towards the Swedish government.

Vacancy  The seat had become vacant on 28 June 1912 when the sitting Labour Member of Parliament (MP), 60-year-old Enoch Edwards died. Edwards had represented the constituency since gaining it from the Unionists at the 1906 general election as a Liberal candidate. In 1909, Edwards crossed from Liberal to Labour in accordance with the wishes of his trade union. Even though he contested both the 1910 general elections as a Labour candidate, he was still supported by the Liberal Party. Enoch Edwards  Candidates  The Conservative candidate was George Rittner, who was standing here for the third time. The Labour candidate was Samuel Finney. Unlike Enoch Edwards, Finney had no sympathies with the Liberal party, so the local Liberal Association considered fielding a candidate. A neighbouring Liberal MP, Josiah Wedgwood encouraged his friend, R. L. Outhwaite to stand as a Liberal Party candidate. Liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George was looking towards a Liberal Land Campaign to gain support for a reform of land taxation to introduce a 'Single Tax'. Like Josiah Wedgwood, Outhwaite was a strong supporter of the 'Single Tax'. The local Liberal Association therefore adopted Outhwaite as candidate to campaign on a 'Single Tax' platform. The Campaign  The Liberal campaign received a boost when John Redmond, the Leader of the nationalist Irish Parliamentary Party, sent a letter of support to Outhwaite due to his support for the Liberal Government's Irish Home Rule Bill.  Result  RL Outhwaite The result was a boost for Lloyd George's land reform campaign and shortly afterwards, H. H. Asquith agreed to commit the Liberal government to a reform of land taxation. It also demonstrated that the Liberal party could be successful against the Labour party by pursuing a radical agenda.

Situations where such planets could exist include a young terrestrial planet just after its formation, a planet that has recently suffered a large collision event, or a planet orbiting very close to its star, causing intense irradiation and tidal forces.Tidally Heated Terrestrial Exoplanets: Viscoelastic Response Models, Wade G. Henning, Richard J. O'Connell, Dimitar D. Sasselov, (Submitted on 10 Dec 2009)  Factors and characteristics  Lava planets would probably orbit extremely close to their parent star. In planets with eccentric orbits, the gravity from the nearby star would distort the planet periodically, with the resulting friction producing internal heat. This tidal heating could melt rocks into magma, which would then erupt through volcanoes. This would be similar to the Solar System moon Io, orbiting close to its parent Jupiter. Io is the most geologically active world in the Solar System, with hundreds of volcanic centres and extensive lava flows. Lava worlds orbiting extremely closely to their parent star may possibly have even more volcanic activity than Io, leading some astronomers to use the term super-Io.CoRoT-7 b: Super-Earth or Super-Io?, Rory Barnes, Sean N. Raymond, Richard Greenberg, Brian Jackson, Nathan A. Kaib, (Submitted on 7 Dec 2009) These \\"super-Io\\" exoplanets may resemble Io with extensive sulfur concentrated on their surfaces that is associated with the continuous active volcanism. However, tidal heating is not the only factor shaping a lava planet. In addition to tidal heating from orbiting close to their parent star, the intense stellar irradiation could melt the surface crust directly into lava. The entire star-facing surface of a tidally locked planet could be left covered in a lava ocean while the nightside may have lava lakes, or even lava rain caused by the condensation of vaporized rock from the dayside. The mass of the planet would also be a factor. The appearance of plate tectonics on terrestrial planets is related to planetary mass, with more massive planets than Earth expected to exhibit plate tectonics and thus more intense volcanic activity. Also, a Mega Earth may retain so much internal heat from its formation that a solid crust cannot form. Protoplanets tend to have intense volcanic activity resulting from large amounts of internal heating just after formation, even relatively small planets that orbit far from their parent stars. Lava planets can also result from giant impacts; Earth was briefly a lava planet after being impacted by a Mars-sized body which formed the Moon. A 2020 preprint study finds that lava planets have low geometric albedos of around 0.1 and that molten lava on the surface can cool and harden to form quenched glass.  Candidates  There are no known lava worlds in the Solar System and the existence of extrasolar lava planets remains theoretical. Several known exoplanets are likely lava worlds, given their small enough masses, sizes, and orbits. Likely lava exoplanets include COROT-7b, Kepler-10b, and Kepler-78b.

He contributed to John Evelyn's Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber, and was an influential author on orchards and cider. He was also a member of the Hartlib Circle. Life He was born in Yarkhill, Herefordshire, the son of Thomas Beale, a lawyer and farmer, and Joanna Pye; he was a nephew of Robert Pye and Walter Pye.historyofparliamentonline.org, Pye, Walter I (1571-1635), of The Mynde, Much Dewchurch, Herefs. and Greyfriars, Christchurch, London. He was educated at the King's School, Worcester by Henry Bright, who is thought to have nurtured his early study of Erasmus, and then at Eton College, before going to King's College, Cambridge in 1629. In his own account he had a photographic memory, and had early read in Melanchthon, Johannes Magirus and Zacharias Ursinus; he read philosophy to the King's students for two years. Thomas Birch identifies this period as the time when Ramism and Calvinism fell out of fashion there. He graduated B.A. in 1633, M.A. in 1636, and was Fellow from 1632 to 1640. He travelled on the continent in the late 1630s, and was rector of Sock Dennis, Somerset from 1638. Beale proposed an art of memory to Samuel Hartlib, in 1656. Hartlib, writing to Robert Boyle in 1658, said of Beale: \\"There is not the like man in the whole island\\". He became rector of Yeovil, Somerset, in 1660. In January, 1663 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Works His works are: *Aphorisms concerning Cider, printed in John Evelvn's Sylva 1664, and entitled in the later editions of that work, General Advertisements concerning Cider. *Herefordshire Orchards, a Pattern for all England, written in an Epistolary Address to Samuel Hartlib, Esq.

John Sadler, John Stoughton. *Settlement of Ireland: Gerard Boate and his brother Arnold Boate, William Petty, Benjamin Worsley. Education Educational reform was topical, and central to the pansophist programme. Hartlib compiled a list of \\"advisers\\", and updated it. It included Jeremy Collier, Dury, Thomas Horne, Marchamont Nedham, John Pell, William Rand, Christian Ravius, Israel Tonge, and Moses Wall.Christopher Hill, Milton and the English Revolution (1979), pp. 146‚Äì7.Charles Webster, Samuel Hartlib and the Advancement of Learning (2010), p. 58; Google Books. The staff proposed for Durham College was influenced by the Circle's lobbying. John Hall was another associateBarbara Lewalski, The Life of John Milton (2003), p. 210. who wrote on education. In the period 1648‚Äì50 many works on education appeared from Circle authors (Dury, Dymock, Hall, Cyprian Kinner, Petty, George Snell, and Worsley).Webster, p. 51; Google Books. A letter from Hartlib to John Milton prompted the tract Of Education (1644), subtitled To Master Samuel Hartlib. But Milton's ideas were quite some way from those of the Comenians.Barbara Lewalski, The Life of John Milton (2003), pp. 172‚Äì3. The problem of the \\"Invisible College\\" Robert Boyle referred a few times in his correspondence to the 'Invisible College'. Scholarly attention has been paid to identifying this shadowy group. The social picture is not simplistic, since en masse Hartlib's contacts had fingers in every pie. Margery Purver concluded that the Invisible College coincided with the Hartlib-led lobbyists, those who were promoting to the Parliament the concept of an Office of Address.Margery Purver, The Royal Society: Concept and Creation (1967), p. 205. The effective lifetime of this idea has been pinned down to the period 1647 to 1653, and as a second wave of speculation on the ideal society, after Comenius left England.J. C. Davis, Utopia and the Ideal Society: A Study of English Utopian Writing, 1516-1700 (1983), p. 315. In the later Interregnum the \\"Invisible College\\" might refer to a group meeting in Gresham College.http://www-history.mcs.st- and.ac.uk/Societies/RS.html According to Christopher Hill, however, the 1645 group (the Gresham College club that was convened from 1645 by Theodore Haak, certainly a Hartlibian) was distinct from the Comenian Invisible College.Christopher Hill, Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution (1965), p. 105. Lady Katherine Ranelagh, who was Boyle's sister, had a London salon during the 1650s, much frequented by virtuosi associated with Hartlib.Lisa Jardine, The Curious Life of Robert Hooke (2003), p. 88. Projects Office of Address One of Hartlib's projects, a variant on Salomon's House that had more of a public face, was the \\"Office of Address\\" -- he envisaged an office in every town where somebody might go to find things out. This might well be compatible with Baconian ideas, and a related public office scheme was mooted under James I (by Arthur Gorges and Walter Cope). But the immediate inspiration was Th√©ophraste Renaudot and his Paris bureau d'adresse.Hugh Trevor-Roper, Renaissance Essays (1985), p. 188. For example, at a practical level, Hartlib thought people could advertise job vacancies there -- and prospective employees would be able to find work. At a more studious level, Hartlib wanted academics to pool their knowledge so that the Office could act as a living and growing form of encyclopedia, in which people could keep adding new information. The Office of address idea was promoted by Considerations tending to the happy Accomplishment of Englands Reformation in Church and State (1647), written by Hartlib and Dury, a pamphlet also including an ambitious tiered system of educational reform.Denis Lawton, Peter Gordon, A History of Western Educational Ideas (2002), p. 74. There was a limited implementation, by Henry Robinson, in 1650.Kathleen Anne Wellman, Making Science Social: The Conferences of Th√©ophraste Renaudot, 1633-1642 (2003), p. 42. Foundation of the Royal Society In 1660 Hartlib was at work writing to John Evelyn, an important broker of the royal charter for the eventual Royal Society. He was, however, not promoting a purist Baconian model, but an \\"Antilia\\". This was the name chosen by Johann Valentin Andreae for a more hermetic and utopian fellowship. The proposal, which conformed to Comenian ideas as more compatible with pansophia or universal wisdom, was in effect decisively rejected. Hartlib was relying on a plan of Bengt Skytte, a son of Johan Skytte and knighted by Charles I,Marjory Harper, Emigrant Homecomings: The Return Movement of Emigrants, 1600-2000 (2005), p. 63. and the move was away from Bacon's clearer emphasis on reforming the natural sciences. Despite some critical voices, the Hartlib-Comenius trend was written out of the Royal Society from the beginning. Hartlib himself died shortly after the Society was set up.Margery Purver, The Royal Society: Concept and Creation (1967), p. 206-234. Eclectic attitudes and associations Hartlib was noted as a follower of Francis Bacon and Comenius, but his background in the German academies of the period gave him a broad view of other methods and approaches, including those of Petrus Ramus, Bartholom√§us Keckermann, and Jacobus Acontius. Further, the Hartlib Circle was tolerant of hermetic ideas; Hartlib himself had an interest in sigils and astrology.Keith Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic (1971), p. 270 and p. 346. Boyle too attempted to straddle the opening divide between experimental chemistry and alchemy, by treating the latter in a less esoteric way; he did distance himself to an extent from the Hartlib group on moving to Oxford around 1655.Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer, Leviathan and the Air-Pump (1985), pp. 71-2. Both Boyle and William Petty became more attached to a third or fourth loose association, the group around John Wilkins, at this period, now referred to as the Oxford Philosophical Club. Wilkins was to be the founding Secretary of the Royal Society.Markku Peltonen, The Cambridge Companion to Bacon (1996), pp. 166.

Oxford Music Online. Retrieved 21/09/2009. is a British choral conductor and musicologist. He was the founder of The Tallis Scholars in 1973 and of Gimell Records (with Steve Smith) in 1980. Early life and education Phillips was born in Southampton and educated at Winchester College (1967‚Äì71), the RSCM (1972) and St John's College, Oxford (Organ Scholar 1972‚Äì75). He studied music with Hugh Macdonald, Denis Arnold and David Wulstan. He subsequently taught at Oxford University, Trinity College of Music and the Royal College of Music in London (where he directed the Chamber Choir in succession to David Willcocks), but had resigned all these posts by 1988 in order to pursue a full-time career in conducting. The Tallis Scholars Phillips's first concert with the Tallis Scholars took place in the St Mary Magdalen's Church, Oxford on 3 November 1973. The group was made up of choral scholars (hence the use of the word 'Scholars' in the title) and layclerks from the leading Oxbridge choral foundations. From the start Phillips aimed to produce a distinctive sound, influenced by choirs he admired, in particular the Clerkes of Oxenford. However the repertoire he chose was idiosyncratic, based in his desire to explore neglected corners of the polyphonic repertories, continental as much as English. This first concert included music by Obrecht, Ockeghem and Lassus. After the foundation of Gimell Records in 1980, the Tallis Scholars have gone on to fill many gaps in the recording catalogue, making discs devoted to such relatively unknown composers as Obrecht, Ockeghem, Cardoso, White, Clemens, Gombert and Mouton. Since winning the Gramophone Record of the Year Award in 1987, the Tallis Scholars have been recognised as perhaps the world's leading ensemble in interpreting renaissance polyphony. Phillips first met the composer John Tavener in 1977, which led to a lifelong friendship. For many years Tavener was the only living composer to write for The Tallis Scholars, a connection which resulted in such masterpieces as the Ikon of Light, the Lords Prayer (1999), Let not the Prince be silent, Tribute to Cavafy and The Requiem Fragments. In more recent years Phillips has commissioned Eric Whitacre, Gabriel Jackson, Nico Muhly, Ivan Moody, John Woolrich, Matthew Martin, Christopher Willcock, Michael Nyman; and in 2014 made a disc entirely dedicated to Arvo P√§rt's tintinnabuli style. Phillips gave his first Promenade concert in 1988, since when he has appeared seven more times, always with the Tallis Scholars, but in 2007 also with the BBC Singers, when the two groups joined forces to give the first modern performance of Striggio's 60-part Mass Ecco si beato giorno. Most recently Phillips and The Tallis Scholars appeared at the Proms on 4 August 2014 to help mark the exact anniversary of the outbreak of World War 1, with a Requiem written for them by John Tavener, televised on BBC 4. In 1990 Phillips was the subject of a South Bank Show, introduced by Melvyn Bragg. It followed the course of renaissance polyphony through England and the Netherlands and was entitled \\"A Personal Odyssey\\". In 2013 he directed the Tallis Scholars in a 99-concert year of events, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the group. Amongst other countries they visited New Zealand for the first time, Australia for the seventh time, Japan for the 14th time, and the US for the 61st.  Other conducting work  In 1985 Phillips was invited to conduct the Chapelle Royale of Paris (by Philippe Herreweghe), and the Netherlands Chamber Choir, which sparked a lifelong interest in working with groups trained outside the Anglican choral tradition. These invitations also promoted in Phillips an interest in European culture, cuisines and languages. He has owned property in Paris since 1989 and given interviews in French, German, Italian and Spanish. He is also a student of Arabic (in which he has not given an interview). As of 2015, The Tallis Scholars have given more than two-thirds of their 2000 concerts outside the UK. Phillips subsequently worked with the Finnish Radio Choir, Markell's Voices (Novosibirsk) and the Collegium Vocale of Gent (again at the invitation of Philippe Herreweghe). He started a collaboration with the BBC Singers in 2003, with whom he has now appeared in nearly 20 productions. He works regularly with The Tudor Choir of Seattle, the Choeur de Chambre de Namur, Intrada (Moscow), El Leon de Oro (Oviedo), and Musica Reservata (Barcelona). In 2013 he started a new collaboration with the Netherlands Chamber Choir, featuring Brumel's 12-voice Missa Et ecce terrae motus.  Educational work  In 2000 Peter Phillips and David Woodcock set up the first Tallis Scholars Summer School in Oakham. This was followed in 2005 by an extension in Seattle (US), and in 2007 by one in Sydney (Australia). He has also been involved with similar courses in Rimini, Evora and Barcelona. He has lectured on the John Hall pre-University course in Venice since 1981. In August 2015 he will lead a new course for 16- to 25-year-olds at Winchester College, entitled Tallis Scholars at Winchester. Phillips began an association with Merton College Chapel in 1974 when, as an undergraduate, he directed Tallis's 'Why fum'th in fight' as a prelude to a performance of Vaughan Williams's Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis. The Tallis Scholars recorded regularly in Merton Chapel between 1976 and 1987, returning permanently in 2005. In 2006, with the help of Jessica Rawson and Simon Jones, Phillips established a new choral foundation at the College. This choir sang its first services under Phillips and Benjamin Nicholas in October 2008, since when it has toured widely, made a disc every year and given many concerts. In 2011 the Guardian was already describing this choir as 'outstanding'. In 2014 Phillips helped to establish the first London International Choral Competition at St John's Smith Square. Among the judges were John Rutter, Emma Kirkby, Alastair Hume, Mark Williams and James O'Donnell. The featured composer was John Tavener. Phillips has recently become a founding trustee of the Muze Trust, a charity designed to help with musical education in Zambia. At the invitation of Paul Kelly, the founder of the Trust, he visited Lusaka in 2010, directing Vox Zambesi in a concert and a recording. The Trust has recently acquired its own premises in Lusaka.  Publications  In addition to his performance based work, Phillips has published specialist articles and new editions of rare music which have helped renaissance polyphony become more widely established. In addition he has written a regular column for the Spectator magazine on all aspects of classical music since January 1983, amounting to over 450 pieces. In 1989 he also wrote a cricket column. In 1995 he became the owner and publisher of the Musical Times ‚Äì the oldest continuously published music journal in the world. He has also written for the Times Literary Supplement, the Times, the Guardian, the Musical Times, the Royal Academy Magazine, the BBC Music Magazine and the Evening Standard. He has written three books: English Sacred Music 1549‚Äì1649 (Gimell, 1991); What We Really Do (Musical Times: 1st edition 2003); What We Really Do (Musical Times: 2nd edition 2013).  Other activities  Phillips is a keen follower of cricket and a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club. He is also a member of the Chelsea Arts Club. In 1986 he became a qualified pilot, in the hope of taming his fear of turbulence; and in 2007 he bought the Cr√©ole, a 70-foot wooden motor yacht built in 1930 and moored in Seattle.  Awards and honours  In 2005, Peter Phillips was made a Chevalier de l‚ÄôOrdre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture, a decoration intended to honour individuals who have contributed to the understanding of French culture in the world. In 2008 he was made a Reed Rubin Director of Music at Merton College, Oxford; and in 2010 a Bodley Fellow of the College. With the Tallis Scholars he has received four Gramophone Awards (in 1987, 1991, 1994 and 2005); two Diapason d‚ÄôOr de l‚ÄôAnn√©e (in 1989 and 2012); and three Grammy nominations (in 2002, 2009 and 2010). Their 1980 recording of Allegri's Miserere was said by the BBC Music Magazine to be one of the 50 greatest recordings of all time. In 2009 the Tallis Scholars were voted by Early Music Today the fourth most influential early group in the history of the genre, after the instrumental ensembles of David Munrow, John Eliot Gardiner and Christopher Hogwood. In 2013 they were voted into the Gramophone's Hall of Fame ‚Äì about 120 names from the entire history of classical recording ‚Äì the only early music group to be so listed.

The Ixchel warn Pazel that if he tells anyone of their presence, they will kill him, because sailors hate Ixchel and have developed ways of smoking them out of ships. Thasha arrives on the Chathrand with her father and household. When Pazel has a fit due to the negative side effect of his power, he bumps into Thasha and she takes him to his cabin. There, Pazel meets Ramachni, a wizard from another world, who grants Pazel three words of great power. However, when Pazel insults Thasha's father, who sacked Pazel's hometown, Pazel is expelled from the ship. As the voyage progresses, it becomes clear something is not right. Chadfallow had previously warned Pazel not to sail on the Chathrand, only to sail on it himself, the captain writes letters to his dead father, the Ixchel notice that several rats on board the ship have awakened and one of them declares a holy war against the captain, a man attacks Thasha's bodyguard only to be saved by the unassuming Mr. Kett, and Thasha feels that her father's mistress is not entirely trustworthy. There is also talk of someone trying to find the 'Red Wolf,' and the 'Nilstone.' It is revealed that there are several intertwining conspiracies. The emperor wants to ignite a civil war in the Mzithrin Empire to weaken them. Mr. Kett, who is really a sorcerer, is there to bring the banished Mzithrin King Shaggat back to power, not just to fight the current kings of the Mzithrin Empire, but to take over the world. As the ship comes to the haunted coast Mr. Kett leads an expedition out to the coast to find the Red Wolf where the Nilstone is hidden. Pazel, who has made his way to the haunted coast, is captured and made part of the expedition. Thasha escapes the Chathrand and meets up with her tutor to help save the day. With Pazel's help, the Nilstone (enclosed in the Red Wolf) is raised from the depths. Kett, after being temporarily defeated, returns to the ship and manages to give the Nilstone to the Shaggat. However, Pazel uses one of his words to turn the Shaggat to stone, preventing Mr. Kett's plans from coming into fruition. Captain Nilius Rose declares that after Thasha's wedding the Chathrand will head out to sea, never to return.

Its conclusion contains the famous phrase that: Nevertheless, the court did not find for the applicant, who had been fined for publishing a book deemed to be obscene. Facts Richard Handyside, proprietor of \\"Stage 1\\" publishers, purchased British rights of The Little Red Schoolbook, written by S√∏ren Hansen and Jesper Jensen and published, as of 1976, in Denmark, Belgium, Finland, France, West Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland as well as several non-European countries. Its chapter on pupils contained a 26-page section concerning \\"Sex\\". Handyside sent out several hundred review copies of the book, together with a press release, to a selection of publications from national and local newspapers to educational and medical journals. He also placed advertisements for the book. The book became subject of extensive press comment, both favourable and not. On 31 March 1971, 1,069 copies of the book were provisionally seized together with leaflets, posters, showcards, and correspondence relating to its publication and sale. On 1 April 1971, 139 more copies were seized. About 18,800 copies of a total print of 20,000 copies were missed and subsequently sold. On 8 April, a magistrates' court issued two summonses against Handyside for having in his possession obscene books for publication for gain. Handyside ceased distribution of the book and advised bookshops accordingly but, by that time, some 17,000 copies were already in circulation. On 1 July 1971, Handyside was found guilty of both offences and fined ¬£25 on each summons and ordered to pay ¬£110 costs. His appeal was rejected. Proceedings before ECtHR The application was lodged by Handyside in 1972. In 1975, the European Commission of Human Rights had adopted its report on the case, finding no violations of conventions, and specifically articles 10, 17, and P1-1 by a majority (no violation of article 18 was found unanimously). In 1976, court's chamber relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the plenary court. Judgment Using margin of appreciation doctrine, the court held by thirteen votes to one that the interference in Handyside's freedom of expression was both prescribed by law, having a legitimate aim and necessary in a democratic society, thus there was no violation of article 10 ECHR. Judge H. Mosler disagreed and filed a dissenting opinion, considering that violation did take place due to interference not being necessary. The court had also held unanimously that Handyside's property rights (article 1 of protocol 1) were not violated. Judge M. Zekia filed a concurring opinion in this question.

Brooks and illustrated by Kurt Wiese. The story takes place when the United States was in the middle of World War II. When freedom of the press is stifled in the area, Freddy starts his own paper. The competition between his reporting and the dishonest reporting of the other paper leads to his being arrested, tried in court and kidnapped. The town rises to Freddy's defense and frees him. Plot summary On a cold March morning, Charles the rooster malingers about going outside to crow. His attempts to avoid work actually make him too sick to do work. Freddy convinces the Bean animals to join in the neighborhood scrap drive contest, finding unneeded metal to help win the war. Freddy takes news input to the newspaper offices of the Guardian to discover that his friend, the editor Mr. Dimsey, has been fired. The owner of the paper, Mrs. Underdunk, put her nephew Mr. Garble in charge. With Dimsey's help, Freddy starts another paper The Bean Home News, for the animals. The Bean animals work on Dimsey's farm to pay for his time. Unexpectedly, several people in town have subscribed. This prompts the pig to hire reporters to collect the news from town. The newspapers come into confrontation when Freddy is accidentally bumped into by Underdunk on the sidewalk. When the sheriff refuses to arrest the pig, Underdunk threatens to use her influence to put him out of office. She comes to the Bean farm, proclaiming that she will have Freddy shot. A joke meant for Charles backfires, further infuriating her. The city reporter for the Bean Home News is collecting great material: :\\"'Where in tunket did you get that item about Mr. Weezer and Miss Biles being engaged to be married? There wasn‚Äôt a soul in town knew about it. I ain‚Äôt even sure they knew about it themselves.'\\" (p. 88) The Guardian calls Freddy a ferocious wild pig. Freddy responds in his paper with the true version of events. Citizens believe Freddy, drawing more threats from Underdunk. Charles the rooster is infuriated, and meeting his reputation from an earlier book, single-handedly attacks Garble. That leads Underdunk to demand Freddy's arrest as being the head of an animal gang. Freddy hides in his friend the sheriff's jail, which proves lucky, since when they come to arrest him, the sheriff points out that the pig is already \\"in custody\\". When Freddy visits Old Whibley for advice, the owl determines to be Freddy's lawyer. He instructs Freddy to demand a jury trial, so that his friends will be on the jury. The animals constantly interrupt Garble's sleep, so that in the courtroom he is on the edge of falling asleep. Underdunk's case is unconvincing: :\\"'Did he bite you?' :'No.'.... :'...you immediately called upon the sheriff to lock him up. Why?' :'...That pig cannot be trusted to behave himself.\\" :'Why? Because he did not bite you?'\\" (p. 156) Garble falls soundly asleep, losing his chance to testify. The jury votes Freddy innocent. When Underdunk throws a gala party including a senator, the Bean animals cannot resist sneaking into the grounds to watch. When they are found, Freddy flees into the house just as a war blackout is called, and the house goes dark. Pretending to be the senator, Freddy announces that Underdunk is donating her prize lawn ornament to the Bean's scrap drive. In the chaos that follows when the lights come on, Freddy is captured and imprisoned. However the animals find him, and the authorities are notified. The police, sheriff and judge and many from town arrive in a loud mob. :\\"'Another interruption of that kind,' said the judge severely, 'and I will have this barnyard cleared.'\\" (p. 208) Having been publicly caught, Underdunk and Garble agree to stop harassing Freddy. Her lawn ornament is given up, and the Bean animals win the scrap drive. Characters Freddy lives on the Bean Farm with animal friends: dogs, cows, chickens and rabbits, as well as a variety of owls, jays, mice, spiders and wasps: several play a role in the book. Jerry the ant talks Freddy into teaching him how to read, and is employed as a spy. Mr. Garble and his aunt Mrs. Underdunk are introduced ‚Äî appearing again a number of times, and not finally dealt with until near the end of the series.

The company operated in south central Iowa in Mahaska and Monroe counties until after World War I. Exhaustion of some resources, competition from overseas markets, and other changes led to the company's closing down its mines and leaving its major planned towns by the late 1920s. The CCC worked at Muchakinock in Mahaska County until the coal resources of that area were largely exhausted. In 1900, the company purchased in southern Mahaska County and northern Monroe County, Iowa. After rapidly building the planned community of Buxton in northern Monroe County, CCC moved its headquarters there. Buxton has been described as \\"an example of the superimposition of the urban-industrial pattern on the rural countryside and the subsequent shifts that occur as regional economic exploitive systems change.\\"Gradwohl, David M., and Nancy M. Osborn (1984/1990), Exploring Buried Buxton: Archaeology of an Abandoned Iowa Coal Mining Town with a Large Black Population, Ames, Iowa: Iowa State University Press, p. 188, available online through Project MUSE CCC hired a high proportion of African-American workers, recruited from the South, and they occupied leadership positions in the local unions and company towns. Buxton was an active town until about 1925, when the CCC opened camps closer to its new mines. It had become the largest unincorporated city in the nation and the largest coal town west of the Mississippi River.Exhibit: No Roads Lead to Buxton , n.d., African American Museum of Iowa, 2016 In 1927 the mine closed and by the late 1930s, Buxton had been totally abandoned. The coal markets had changed after World War I, and the workers dispersed to other locales and cities across the country. Consolidation's Mine No. 18 in Buxton was probably the largest bituminous coal mine in Iowa.Greg A. Brick, Iowa Underground, Trails Books, 2004; Chapter 42, pp. 143-144. By 1913, the Buxton UMWA union local was reported to have \\"at least 80 percent colored men.\\" In 1914, Buxton had 5,000 people and was the largest town in the United States to be \\"populated and governed entirely or almost entirely by Negroes.\\" Monroe N. Work, ed., \\"Negro Towns and Settlements in the United States,\\" Negro Year Book 1914‚Äì1915: An Annual Encyclopedia of the Negro, Negro Year Book Company, Tuskeegee Institute, 1914; page 298. Beginning in 1880, Consolidation was one of the first northern industrial employers to make large-scale use of African-American labor. It recruited Southern black workers as strike breakers, most of whom came from mining regions of Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky, and retained them. Those working at Muchakinock and Buxton were given equal pay to white workers and lived in integrated communities. Due to its regional and national significance, the townsite of Buxton was surveyed for archeological resources and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

C. Cook vs. M. E. Cutts, United States Congressional Serial Set, Section III, Washington, DC, Feb. 19, 1883. Coal mining along Muchakinock Creek dates to 1843, when local blacksmiths mined coal from exposures along the creek. By 1867, small drift mines were developed all along Muchakinock Creek down to Eddyville, where the creek flows into the Des Moines River. In 1873, the Iowa Central Railroad built a branch along Muchakinock Creek. The Consolidation Coal Company was formed in 1875 by the merger of the Iowa Central Coal Company and the Black Diamond Mines of Coalfield in Monroe County, Iowa, and the Eureka Mine in Beacon, Iowa. By 1878, Consolidation Coal Company had 400 employees, and in 1880, it was purchased by the Chicago and North Western Railway to secure a regional source for its fuel.James H. Lees, \\"History of Coal Mining in Iowa,\\" Chapter III of Iowa Geological Survey Annual Report, 1908, Des Moines, 1909; page 666-558 The coal camp at Muchakinock was about south of the county seat of Oskaloosa {{Coord|41|13|20.03|N|92|38|25.86|W|region:US},}Topographical Map of Mahaska County, Iowa, Huebinger's Atlas of the State of Iowa, Iowa Publishing Co., 1904 and it quickly developed as one of the most prosperous and largest coal camps in Iowa.\\"Iowa's Pioneer Coal Operators,\\" Eighth Biennial Report of the State Mine Inspectors to the Governor of the State of Iowa for the Two Years Ending June 30, 1897, Conway, Des Moines, 1897; page 76. Consolidation Mine No. 1 was opened in 1873. The Muchachinock US post office operated from 1874 to 1904, with an official name change to Muchakinock in 1886.Muchakinock Post Office (historical), in the USGS Geographic Names Information System In 1880, the company had a dispute with its workers in Muchakinock. J. E. Buxton, Consolidation's superintendent, sent Major Thomas Shumate south to hire African Americans as strike breakers. Shumate hired \\"lots of crowds\\" of \\"colored men\\" from Virginia. Whole families arrived with each \\"crowd\\". \\"Bringing these men to the mines, and the employment of colored miners was a new thing.\\" The first \\"crowd\\" arrived in Muchakinock on March 5, 1880. By October 6, 1880 Shumate had brought in six \\"crowds\\". The \\"third crowd\\" filled one railroad passenger car. It left Staunton, Virginia on May 12 and traveled via Chicago and Marshalltown, Iowa, arriving in Muchakinock on May 15. Rail fare from Virginia to Iowa was $12, which the company paid and took as an advance against each miner's monthly wages. The new African-American employees proved so satisfactory that the company retained them after the end of the strike. In years to come, the company attributed much of its wealth to their labor.\\"Negro Governments in the North,\\" The American Review of Reviews, XXXVIII, New York, Oct. 1908; page 472 The company paid black and white workers equally, and did not permit segregation in housing or schools in its camps and towns. In 1884, the Chicago and Northwestern completed a branch from Belle Plaine to Muchakinock.Annual Report of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company for the Twenty-Sixth Fiscal Year Ending May 31, 1885 By then, Mines 1, 2, 3 and 5 were operating in Muchakinock. No. 6 was a shaft mine, newly opened just north of the camp.Second Biennial Report of the State Mine Inspector to the Governor of the State of Iowa for the Years 1884 and 1885; pages 38, 57. By 1887, the African-American workers in Muchakinock had organized a mutual protection society. Members paid fifty cents a month, or $1 per family. 80% of this paid for health insurance, while the remainder went into a sinking fund to cover members' burial expenses. The coal company acted as banker to this society.Portrait and Biographical Album of Mahaska County, Chicago: Chapman Brothers, 1887; pages 522‚Äì523 By 1893, Consolidation Mines No. 6 and 7, located about south of Oskaloosa, produced 1550 tons of coal per day, employing 489 men and boys. No. 6 had a shaft, while No. 7 had a shaft. Both mines worked the same coal seam, using the double-entry room and pillar system of mining.John W. Canty, Biennial Report of the Second District, Sixth Biennial Report of the State Mine Inspectors to the Governor of the State of Iowa for the Two Years Ending June 30, 1893, Ragsdale, Des Moines, 1893; pages 50‚Äì51 Mine No. 8 was three miles (5 km) northwest of Muchakinock. The Bituminous Coal Miners' Strike of 1894 lasted from late April through May of that year. All of Iowa's coal miners went on strike, with the exception of the miners at Muchakinock and Evans (8 miles north along Muchakinock Creek). Tensions were high enough that the company management armed Muchakinock's black miners with Springfield rifles. By May 28, tension was so high among workers that Companies G and K of the Second Regiment of the Iowa National Guard were sent to Muchakinock to preserve order. On May 30, large bodies of armed strikers, from 400 to 600 men, were congregating in Mahaska County, apparently intent on forcing the nearby mining camp of Evans to strike as the first stage of an attack on Muchakinock. In the end, no shots were fired.Thomas J.

The Consolidation Coal Company opened a new mining camp in Buxton, Monroe County. The founding of Buxton in 1901 led to a \\"great exodus\\" of workers and their families, leaving Muchakinock nearly vacant by 1904.

In 1900 and 1901, after extending the Muchakinock branch of the Chicago and North Western tracks across the Des Moines River, the Consolidation Coal Company opened a new mining camp at Buxton, in Monroe County . The camp was named by B. C. Buxton after his father, John E. Buxton, who had managed the mines at Muchakinock. The company created a planned community that was developed along a regular grid pattern. It hired architect Frank E. Wetherell to design miners' houses, two churches, and a high school as part of its \\"urban planning and social humanitarianism.\\"[Gradwohl and Osborn (1984/1990), Exploring Buried Buxton], p. 189, available online through Project MUSE The US Post Office at Buxton operated from 1901 to 1923.Buxton Post Office (historical), in the USGS Geographic Names Information System Many black workers moved here from Muchakinock. After a strike by white miners, the company recruited additional black workers from mining areas in the South. But the town's population was multi-ethnic, with white immigrants from Slovakia, Sweden, Austria, Ireland, Wales and England. Consolidation Mine No. 10, circa 1908. Consolidation Mine No. 10 was about south of Buxton, with a shaft and a headframe, working a coal seam that varied from 4 to thick. The hoists could lift 4 cars to the surface in a minute, each carrying up to 1.5 tons of coal. Electric haulage was used in the mines, using a combination of third-rail, trolley wire, and rack-and-pinion haulage. Mine No. 11, opened in 1902, was about a mile south of No. 10, with a shaft. By 1908, Consolidation had opened Mine No. 15. All of the Buxton mines worked a coal seam about 54 inches thick. In 1901, Consolidation's miners organized locals 1799 and 2106 of the United Mine Workers union, with memberships of 493 and 691, respectively. Local 2106 immediately became the largest union local in Iowa, in any trade.\\"Trade Unions in Iowa ‚Äì Table No. 1,\\" Mine Workers of America, United, Tenth Biennial Report of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the State of Iowa, 1901‚Äì1902, Murphy, Des Moines, 1903; page 232. At that time, Consolidation's mines were described as being \\"worked almost entirely by colored miners.\\"James H. Lees, History of Coal Mining in Iowa, Chapter III of Iowa Geological Survey Annual Report, 1908, Des Moines, 1909; pages 549‚Äì550. In 1913, the Buxton UMWA union local was reported to have \\"at least 80 percent colored men\\".Booker T. Washington, \\"The Negro and the Labor Unions,\\" The Atlantic Monthly (June 1913); page 761. With 1508 members, Local 1799 at Buxton was the largest UMWA local in the country.Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Convention of the United Mine Workers of America, Jan. 16 ‚Äì Feb. 2, 1912, Indianapolis; page 78A. Note: Only three other locals had more than 1000 members. African Americans continued operating the benevolent society they had established at Muchakinock, renaming it as the Buxton Mining Colony.Richard R. Wright, Jr., \\"The Economic Conditions of Negroes in the North ‚Äì IV Negro Governments in the North\\", Southern Workman, Vol. XXXVII, No. 9 (Sept. 1908); pages 494‚Äì498 Buxton was a classic company town; it was unincorporated, and the CCC was the sole landlord. In the words of one commentator, \\"Mr. Buxton ... has not attempted to build up a democracy. On the contrary he has built up an autocracy and he is the autocrat, albeit a benevolent one.\\" Booker T. Washington, educator and president of Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, described justice in Buxton as being \\"administered in a rather summary frontier fashion\\" that reminded him \\"of the methods formerly employed in some of the frontier towns farther west.\\"Booker, T, Washington, Chapter VIII: \\"The Negro as Town-Builder,\\" The Negro in Business, Hertel, Jenkins & Co, 1907; pages 76‚Äì77. The Consolidation Coal Company took a paternal attitude toward the town. In 1908, the town covered approximately one square mile, with about 1000 houses, typically with 5 or 6 rooms each. Everything was owned by the coal company. It provided rental housing only to married couples, at a rate of $5.50 to $6.50 per month. Families having any kind of disorder were evicted on 5 days' notice. The average wage in the mines was $3.63 per day in 1908, when the mines employed 1239 men. Monthly wages varied from $70.80 for day laborers, but about 100 men made more than $140 per month. There was no discrimination between the races in pay. As in Muchakinock, African Americans held many leadership roles in the integrated town. The US postmaster, superintendent of schools, most of the teachers, two justices of the peace, two constables, and two deputy sheriffs were all African American. The Bank of Buxton, with deposits in 1907 of $106,796.38, had only one cashier, also African American. One of the civil engineers working for the mining company was African American. For a brief time between 1903 and 1905, The Buxton Eagle was the community's newspaper.About this Newspaper: The Buxton Eagle, Library of Congress Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers web site. African-American physicians included Edward A. Carter, MD, who was born in Muchakinock and was the first \\"colored\\" graduate of the University of Iowa College of Medicine. He came to Buxton as assistant physician to the Buxton Mining Colony. He also served as company surgeon to the mining company and to the Chicago and Northwestern Railway.\\"Men of the Month: A Busy Physician,\\" The Crisis, Vol. 8, No. 4 (Aug. 1914); page 170Edward A. Carter, Letter, The Iowa Alumnus, Vol. XIII, No. 1 (October 1915); page 48. George H. Woodson and Samuel Joe Brown were African-American attorneys who lived in Buxton for a time; they were among the co-founders in 1905 of the Niagara Movement, a predecessor to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Richard R. Wright Jr. wrote in 1908 that > The relations of the white minority to the black majority are most cordial. > No case of assault by a black man on a white woman has ever been heard of in > Buxton. Both races go to school together; both work in the same mines, clerk > in the same stores, and live side by side.\\" In the same year, Booker T. Washington wrote of Buxton as \\"a colony of some four or five thousand Colored people ... to a large extent, a self-governing colony, but it is a success.\\" He recommended a study of Buxton to a textile manufacturer interested in raising capital for a cotton mill employing black labor.Booker T. Washington, letter to Fredrick Barrett Gordon, May 17, 1909, The Booker T. Washington Papers, Vol. 10, University of Illinois Press, 1981; page 108. By 1908, as mines 11 and 13 were almost exhausted, the population of Buxton had declined to about 5000. It was still the largest town in the country with a majority-black population. In addition, it was the \\"largest unincorporated city in the nation and the largest coal town west of the Mississippi River.\\" Unlike smaller company towns, where miners usually lived within walking distance of the mines, Buxton was the residential center for men who worked at mines spread out over a considerable distance. The company ran commuter trains to ferry the men to the mines. A group of Buxton men in the YMCA circa 1915. The coal company gave the YMCA free use of a building, valued at $20,000.Henry Hinds, \\"The Coal Deposits of Iowa,\\" Iowa Geological Survey Annual Report, 1908, Des Moines, 1909; page 232. The YMCA had a reading room and library, gym, baths, kitchen, dining room, and a meeting hall available for use of labor unions and lodges.\\"Gives Building to YMCA ‚Äì Coal company at Buxton, Iowa, helps association work among its colored employees\\" New York Times, Dec. 14, 1903. The Buxton YMCA drew \\"the color line\\" and did \\"not allow white men in the membership,\\" although they were \\"allowed to attend the entertainments, a privilege freely used.\\"\\"In the World of Labor,\\" Association Men Vol. XXXV, No. 3 (Dec. 1909); page 104. The Buxton YMCA offered a variety of adult education programs, including literacy and hygiene classes, as well as a variety of public lectures. The YMCA also controlled the Opera House, keeping out \\"objectionable and immoral shows.\\"\\"Notes on Progress and Service,\\" Association Men, Vol. XXXVI, No. 9 (June 1911); page 407. As is typical of mining company towns, there was a company store, the Monroe Mercantile Company. This was a big operation, with 72 employees, some paid as much as $68 per month, and many of them African Americans. But there was competition for the company store. Buxton was unusual for its more than 40 independent businesses that operated in town, including a hotel, grocery, general store, meat market, lumber yard, barber shops, tailor and butcher, and clothing stores. Many were run by African Americans. Consolidation Mine No. 18, under construction. In 1919, Consolidation Mine No. 18, 12 miles southwest of Buxton (Melcher, Iowa Quadrangle 1:62500 series, USGS, 1924.), was the most productive coal mine in Iowa. This mine employed 498 men year round, producing almost 300,000 tons in that year, which was more than 5% of the total production for the state.H. E. Pride, \\"Iowa Coal\\", Bulletin No. 48, Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts Engineering Extension Department, Oct. 6, 1920. Mines 16 and 18 exploited a coal seam 4 to 7 feet thick.Coal Field Directory and Mining Catalog, Keystone, Pittsburgh, 1915, page 146. But after World War I, the demand for Buxton coal declined. Competitive coal was being marketed by overseas locations. The remains of Mine No. 18 were dynamited in 1944.Greg A. Brick, Iowa Underground, Trails Books, 2004; Chapter 42, page 144. By the time Mine No. 18 had opened, the center of CCC mining activity had moved 10 miles to the west of Buxton, and the company opened new mining camps closer to the mines. As a result, the population shifted and Buxton declined markedly in the 1920s; its last mine closed in 1927. By 1938, the Federal Writers Project Guide to Iowa reported that the site of Buxton was abandoned and that the locations of Buxton's former \\"stores, churches and schoolhouses are marked only by stakes.\\" Every September, hundreds of former Buxton residents met for a reunion on the site of the former town.Federal Writers' Project, The WPA Guide to 1930's Iowa, Viking Press, 1938; reprinted by the University of Iowa Press, 1986, page 81. The abandoned Buxton town land has been cultivated as farmland. The town site was the subject of an archaeological survey in the 1980s, which investigated the economic and social aspects of material culture of African Americans in Iowa.Gradwohl, David M., and Nancy M. Osborn (1984/1990), Exploring Buried Buxton: Archaeology of an Abandoned Iowa Coal Mining Town with a Large Black Population, Ames, Iowa: Iowa State University Press, available online through Project MUSE As a result of the finds and the regional and national significance of Buxton, the archeological site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The company town is notable as a former \\"black utopia.\\" Consol and Bucknell The mining camps of Consol and Bucknell were two miles apart along the Chicago and Northwestern tracks along Whites Creek, north of Mine No. 18. The Consol and Bucknell US post offices operated from 1917 to 1930.Consol Post Office (historical), in the USGS Geographic Names Information SystemBucknell Post Office (historical), in the USGS Geographic Names Information System Ed. Bucknell was one of the Consolidation Coal Company's mining superintendents. In 1917, Consol was the end of the line for passenger service, with one train per day each way between Belle Plaine, Iowa and Consol.Warnock v. Chicago and North Western, case 8093-1917, Fortieth Annual Report of the Board of Railroad Commissioners for the Year Ending December 3, 1917, State of Iowa, Des Moines, pages 127-128.

They are found from Contra Costa County in northern California, all the way south to Baja California, although occurrences are often scattered. They require moisture to aid in shedding their skin. Without it, their vision and feeding can be affected, potentially starving the animal.Animal Diversity Web: Anniella pulchra Diet Their diet consists of mainly beetles, larval insects, termites, ants, and spiders. Reproduction Males are slightly smaller than females, otherwise there is no discernible difference between the two sexes. Females are ovoviviparous and probably breed between early spring and July, with 1 to 4 young born September‚ÄìNovember.

Declan would have preferred being more recognised for his first sport, kayaking, but his all round ability as an athlete led him to this new challenge. Declan won the 1980 Irish Superstars and went on to compete on the world stage in Key Biscine, Florida. Declan performed well in all events and set a new world record for pull-ups in a minute (57 at the time) but fell just short of first place to South African racing driver Jody Schekter. Declan's incredible performance on the world stage propelled him to fame in his own country of Ireland, he became a household name in the process. He broke the world record for pull-ups on numerous occasions and is what he became most famous for in his home country. Declan also participated at many world championships, most notably in Duisburg in '79 when he exited at the semi-final stage of the K1-500 after coming 4th, to the eventual gold, silver and bronze medal winners of the event. It would have been Declan's maiden final appearance. Declan also tried his hand at triathlon during the mid-80s to good success but he returned to kayaking in '87 and made the '88 Olympics with K2 partner Peter Connor.

AnyDoc developed technologies to process structured, semi-structured, and unstructured (free-form) documents, as well as classification, and workflow. Structured documents, where data appears in the same location on each form (such as a credit application or order form), use template-based technology. A template in essence, is a map telling the software where the data is located on the document and how to process that data. While template-based data capture is still widely used to eliminate the manual data entry previously required to process structured documents, it is not a feasible solution to efficiently process semi-structured documents, such as invoices, remittances, and checks. AnyDoc developed AnyApp technology to capture the data for these more complex documents and to memorize the data locations for subsequent encounters with the same document types for expedited processing.

This example was formed during the Ordovician Period and it is of andesitic composition. A peperite is a type of volcaniclastic rock consisting of sedimentary rock that contains fragments of younger igneous material and is formed when magma comes into contact with wet sediments.Skilling, I.P., White, J.D.L/ & McPhie, J. 2002. Peperite: a review of magma-sediment mingling, Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, 114, 1-17 The term was originally used to describe rocks from the Limagne region of France, de Goer de Herve, A. 2008.

Volcaniclastic rocks, from magmas to sediments, Taylor & Francis, 270pp. from the similarity in appearance of the granules of dark basalt in the light-coloured limestone to black pepper. Typically the igneous fragments are glassy and show chilled-margins to the sedimentary matrix, distinguishing them from clasts with a sedimentary origin. Terminology The term has been used to describe a wide variety of rocks that are interpreted to have formed by the interaction between magma and sediments. This usage has led to overlap with other terms such as hyaloclastite. In the most recent edition of 'Igneous rocks' by Le Ma√Ætre et al. Le Ma√Ætre, R. W. et al. (Eds.) 2002. Igneous Rocks: A Classification and Glossary of Terms: Recommendations of the International Union of Geological Sciences Subcommission on the Systematics of Igneous Rocks the definition is given as \\"A local term for a tuff or breccia, formed by the intrusion of magma into wet sediments. Usually consists of glassy fragments of igneous rock and some sedimentary rock\\", while White (2000) defines peperite as \\"a genetic term applied to a rock formed essentially in situ by disintegration of magma intruding and mingling with unconsolidated or poorly consolidated, typically wet sediments. The term also refers to similar mixtures generated by the same processes operating at the contacts of lavas and other hot volcaniclastic deposits with such sediments\\". Formation When magma comes into contact with wet sediment several processes combine to produce the mixture of sedimentary and igneous clasts which is characteristic of a peperite. These processes are required to produce both the disintegration or fragmentation of magma to form juvenile clasts and the mingling of these clasts within the sediment. Mechanisms proposed for the fragmentation of the magma include; fracturing due to the stresses associated with quenching, autobrecciation due to continuing flow in the cooling magma, pore-water steam explosions and magma-sediment density contrasts. The main mechanism suggested for mingling of the igneous clasts with the sediment is fluidisation, in the sense of particle support and transport by a fluid. Occurrence Peperites are found world-wide in sediments with a significant water content at the time of formation associated with igneous rocks covering the compositional range from basalt to rhyolite.

U.S. prosecutors said Saleh al-Somali, al-Qaeda's head of external operations, and Rashid Rauf, an al-Qaeda operative, ordered the attack. Both were later killed in drone attacks. Zazi underwent weapons and explosives training at an al-Qaeda training camp in Pakistan in 2008. On September 9, 2009, he drove from his home in Aurora, Colorado, to New York City, intending to detonate explosives on the New York City subway during rush hour as one of three coordinated suicide \\"martyrdom\\" bombings. Spooked, however, by surveillance by U.S. intelligence, and warned by a local imam that the authorities were inquiring about him, he abruptly flew back to Colorado. He was arrested days later. On February 22, 2010, he pleaded guilty to conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiring to commit murder in a foreign country, and providing material support to a terrorist organization. He said he was recruited by al-Qaeda in Pakistan for a suicide \\"martyrdom\\" attack against the U.S., and that his bombing target was the New York City subway system. Zazi faced a possible life sentence without possibility of parole for the first two counts, and an additional sentence of 15 years for the third count. Sentencing was initially scheduled to take in June 2011. In May 2019, it was announced Zazi would be released from prison after serving 10 years due to extensive cooperation with law enforcement.http://time.com/5582513/najibullah-zazi-sentenced-nyc-bomb-plot Two of his high school classmates who had traveled with him to Pakistan, his father, his uncle, and an imam from Queens were indicted on related charges. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder referred to the planned attack as \\"one of the most serious terrorist threats to our nation since September 11, 2001.\\" Early life Zazi was born in a village in Paktia Province, Afghanistan. He has two sisters and two brothers. At the age of 7 in 1992, he and his family moved to the city of Peshawar in Pakistan where they settled as Afghan refugees. In 1999, he and the family left Pakistan and immigrated to New York City. They moved into a two-bedroom apartment in the Flushing, Queens section of the city. Mohammed Wali Zazi, Najibullah's father and now a naturalized U.S. citizen, found work as a New York City taxi driver. From 1999‚Äì2009, Zazi lived with his family in Flushing. While he was a teenager, he and his family lived in the same apartment building and attended the same mosque, the Afghan Hazrat-i-Abu Bakr Sadiq mosque, as Saifur Rahman Halimi. Halimi was a vocal pro-global-jihad imam. He was chief representative to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, an Afghan warlord who was declared a \\"Specially Designated Global Terrorist\\" by the U.S. in 2003. Halimi and the Zazi family, among others, left the mosque at the same time, during a leadership disagreement. According to one of his friends, Zazi liked listening to Zakir Naik, an Indian Muslim televangelist who is an expert on comparative religion and theology. Zazi struggled as a student at Flushing High School in Queens, eventually dropping out. From 2004‚Äì09, he operated a coffee and pastries vending cart on Stone Street in Lower Manhattan's Financial District. He displayed a \\"God Bless America\\" sign on his cart. In 2006, he traveled to Pakistan and married his 19-year-old cousin in an arranged marriage. He claimed several trips he made to Pakistan between 2006 and 2008 were to visit his wife. In the course of his visits, Zazi and his wife had two children, whom he planned to move to the U.S. Events leading to arrest Al-Qaeda training and direction On August 28, 2008, Zazi and others flew from New York to Peshawar, Pakistan, a city just east of Pakistan's volatile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (the FATA). The Center for Strategic and International Studies describes the FATA as: > ground zero in the U.S. Jihadist war, and home to many al-Qaeda operatives, > especially the numerous foreigners from the Arab world, Central Asia Muslim > areas of the Far East, and even Europe who flock to this war zone for > training [and] indoctrination. Map of Pakistan and Waziristan While there, they were recruited by al-Qaeda instead, and taken to a training camp in Waziristan, where they received training on several kinds of weapons. Al-Qaeda leaders asked them to return to the U.S. and conduct a suicide bombing martyrdom operation, and they agreed to do so. Later, he received additional training at the camp on explosives construction for an attack in the U.S., or to carry out a martyrdom operation. He took lengthy notes and emailed them to himself, so he could access them upon his return to the U.S. Al-Qaeda leaders also discussed target locations with Zazi, such as New York City subways. He gave money and computers to al- Qaeda before leaving Pakistan.

There, he also underwent weapons and explosives training (from late 2007 through August 2008). A senior al-Qaeda leader also discussed the operation of the New York City transit system with Vinas, in his case to help plan a bomb attack on a Long Island Rail Road commuter train in New York's Penn Station. Vinas was arrested in Peshwar, Pakistan, in November 2008, and pleaded guilty in the U.S. in February 2010 to participating in and supporting al-Qaeda plots in Afghanistan and the U.S. Jihad Jane plot Over the internet, Zazi befriended Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, a Kansas City, Missouri-born medical assistant from Leadville, Colorado, who had converted to Islam, according to her family. She was arrested in March 2010 in the Jihad Jane plot to wage jihad and murder Swedish artist Lars Vilks, collecting the bounty offered by an al-Qaeda affiliate for his assassination. Return to United States On January 15, 2009, Zazi returned to the United States Within days of his return, he moved to Aurora, Colorado, to live with his aunt and uncle. He worked as a driver for a company named \\"Big Sky\\", and then for ABC Airport Shuttle, driving a 15-person airport shuttle van between Denver International Airport and downtown Denver. Zazi filed for bankruptcy in New York State on March 26, 2009, with $51,000 in debts, and his bankruptcy was discharged on August 17, 2009. He lived with his aunt and uncle until July 2009, when his uncle kicked him out for not paying rent. His parents moved to Aurora from New York, and the three took up residence together. Acetone peroxide Beginning around June 2009, he began looking for ingredients to make bombs. He conducted several internet searches for hydrochloric acid. He made some acetone peroxide for use as a detonator. He went to New York, where he reportedly had planning sessions with other conspirators. Over the course of several months, the FBI listened to Zazi's phone conversations. In August 2009, the FBI overheard him speaking about mixing chemical substances. It learned that in July and August 2009 he and his three associates were buying large quantities of hydrogen peroxide and acetone products from beauty supply stores around Denver, Colorado. Workers at the Beauty Supply Warehouse in Aurora, Colorado would later tell CNN that Zazi was \\"a regular\\" at the store and had made several recent purchases shortly before his arrest, telling them that he had \\"a lot of girlfriends.\\" Hydrogen peroxide and acetone are components of triacetone triperoxide (TATP; also known as acetone peroxide)-based bombs.

Zazi drove from Denver to New York City on September 9 and 10, 2009. On September 9, 2009, he began a drive in a rented car from Denver to New York with bomb-making materials. Agents followed him. The day after he left Denver, two New York City Police Department Intelligence Division detectives asked imam Ahmad Wais Afzali, a Muslim cleric whom they had developed as an informant, to identify and provide information with regard to four individuals whose photographs they showed him. Afzali identified Zazi, who had prayed at Afzali's mosque, and two of the other three photos. Zazi arrived in New York City on the afternoon of September 10, and spent the night at the residence of his childhood friend Naiz Kahn in Flushing, Queens.\\"Target of NYC terror probe says he's innocent; Authorities warn police to be on look out for bomb materials\\" , NBC News, September 15, 2009. Retrieved February 23, 2010 He intended to finish building the bomb that weekend. Bombing plot The plan was for him and two high school friends to conduct coordinated suicide bombings early in the week. They planned to detonate backpack bombs on New York City Subway trains near New York's two busiest subway stations, the Grand Central and Times Square stations in Manhattan, during rush hour. They planned to board the middle of packed trains on the , , , and/or trains, to cause maximum casualties. Zazi rode the subway numerous times to try to determine where to set off the bombs. According to TIME, authorities believe Zazi was possibly planning an attack using backpack bombs, as previously used in the Madrid and London bombings. The Daily Telegraph reported that the plot had been uncovered by Scotland Yard, which intercepted an e-mail from a senior al-Qaeda member in Pakistan to Zazi, instructing him how to implement his attack. The e-mail was intercepted as part of \\"Operation Pathway\\". Scotland Yard notified the FBI, which led to the operation that resulted in his arrest. Capture On September 10, as he crossed the George Washington Bridge headed for New York City, Zazi was pulled over by Port Authority Police, acting at the FBI's request, for what he was told was a routine random drug search, and his car was searched. They did not find anything of note, and he was allowed to go. Afzali's lawyer later wrote the court: \\"Even though [Zazi] is not the brightest bulb in the terrorist chandelier, the thinly-transparent ruse of a 'random' checkpoint stop did not fool him.\\" On September 11, Afzali called Zazi's father. Zazi's father then spoke with Zazi, told him that \\"they\\" had shown Afzali his photos and photos of others, said Afzali would call him and he should speak with him as soon as possible, and added \\"So, before anything else, speak with [Afzali]. See if you need to go to [Afzali] or to make ... yourself aware, hire an attorney.\\" Afzali called Zazi, and told him that the authorities had asked him about \\"you guys.\\" He also asked Zazi for the telephone number of one of the other men whose photos he had been shown, and set up a meeting with him. Later that day, Zazi's rental car was towed due to a parking violation, and was searched. Agents found a laptop with a JPEG image of nine handwritten pages on how to make initiating explosives, main explosive charges, detonators, and fuses. The FBI asserted the nine pages of handwritten notes were in Zazi's handwriting. Zazi called Afzali, said his car had been stolen and he feared he was being \\"watched\\", and that the people watching him took his car. Afzali asked if there was any \\"evidence\\" in the car, and Zazi said no. When Zazi realized they were under investigation, the group threw away their bomb-making materials. Arrest and incarceration On September 12, Zazi flew back to Denver. FBI agents searched several homes in New York on September 14, and found his fingerprints on an electronic scale and several AA batteries at the home he had stayed at in Queens, as well as a dozen black backpacks.Hays, Tom (October 1, 2009). \\"Officials: NY men being watched in terrorism probe\\" , The Guardian, Retrieved July 15, 2015 An alert was issued to American law enforcement officials to be on the lookout for hydrogen peroxide-based bombs. On September 16, Zazi voluntarily appeared and was interviewed by members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force at the Denver FBI offices in the presence of his lawyer. During his eight-hour interview, he denied knowing anything about the nine-page handwritten document found on his hard drive, and speculated he must have accidentally downloaded it in August as part of a religious book which he had downloaded and later deleted. In subsequent interviews on September 17 and 18, however, he acknowledged receiving explosives and weapons training in the tribal areas of Pakistan. On September 19, 2009, authorities arrested Zazi, and on September 21 they charged him in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado with making false statements in a matter involving international and domestic terrorism. He testified against fellow American al-Qaeda recruit Muhanad Mahmoud Al Farekh at his trial in 2017. He testified he provided Al Farekh with military training when he arrived in 2007. Charges Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn Najibullah Zazi New charges and allegations were filed against Zazi in the Eastern District of New York on September 23, 2009, and the prior charges dropped.

It focuses deeply on the subject of cerebral palsy, quality of life, and euthanasia. The main character is Shawn McDaniel, a fourteen-year-old who has cerebral palsy. The story, told from Shawn's perspective, also focuses on how his family copes with the condition. Shawn's mother, brother, sister, and father are all talked about in the book. Stuck in Neutral received recognition as an Honor Book for the Michael L. Printz Award in 2001. Trueman wrote the novel because his own son has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and he wanted to educate young readers both about the condition and about showing tolerance for those with severe disabilities. Plot summary The book follows Shawn McDaniel's first- person point of view. He is a 14-year-old boy with cerebral palsy, a neurological disorder that affects motor control. In Shawn's case, his entire body is affected; he has absolutely no control over any of his bodily functions. Shawn's condition is a major part of the story In the first few chapters, Shawn McDaniel explains his condition to the reader. He includes what he feels to be positive sides of his condition, such as his perfect memory. Shawn remembers every experience, every sensation, and everything he's ever learned from school or television. Unfortunately due to his complete lack of motor control Shawn is unable to talk or make contact with his family in any way; it is believed by those around him that Shawn's mind has no higher functional skills. A running theme throughout the book is Shawn's desire to be truly known by someone. Shawn introduces his family to the reader. His mother is his main caretaker and his father is a writer who has won a Pulitzer Prize for a poem about Shawn. The main story is about euthanasia. Shawn feels that his father Sydney McDaniel is trying to kill him. Sydney constantly talks about euthanasia. On an interview during a Jerry Springer-style show Sydney interviews a man who killed his son with a similar condition, who reveals that he just wanted to end his son's pain. In the end, the reader is left to wonder if Sydney follows the other man's example, or allowed Shawn to continue his life. Shawn frequently expresses that he dislikes being talked down to as if he were a baby. He stresses throughout the novel that he is just as intelligent, or more intelligent, than others around him. We are also introduced to his school life in the middle of the novel. Reception Stuck in Neutral caused some controversy at a school in Evansville, Wisconsin, where the book was required reading. Parents felt the subject matter was too sad and violent. Trueman strongly defended his book and school officials in Wisconsin eventually agreed. Stuck in Neutral remains required reading in Special Education classrooms.Forward; \\"Stuck in Neutral\\" Letter to Author http://www.terrytrueman.com/about_E-mailsLetters.html Play In 2013 Allison Cameron Gray and Matt Corpenning adapted the novel into the play Stuck in Neutral.

It is a white frame house from the 18th century that is currently used as the local branch of the Schenectady County public library system. Built in the 1730s, it is a rare surviving example in the region of a Dutch Colonial heavy timber frame house. It was extensively modified at the beginning of the 20th century but still retains its basic form and original materials. In 2004 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building The house is situated in Collins Park, on the north side of Route 5 just west of the Western Gateway Bridge which crosses the Mohawk River to nearby Schenectady. It is aligned north‚Äìsouth, giving it a diagonal orientation from the road. Mature trees screen it on several sides. There is a parking lot to the north, accessible from nearby Collins Street, and a baseball field to the northeast. Its main block is a two-and-a-half-story rectangular () steeply pitched gable-roofed frame house on a mortared fieldstone basement. Two wings extend from the north end, both built later on. The larger is one and a half stories high, with full basement. A one-story storage wing projects from its north end. Mortise and tenon joints were used in the framing. Rafters rest on the roof plate. The slate-shingled roof is pierced by brick chimneys at either end and three shed dormer windows on both east and west elevations. A wraparound porch on the first story has turned posts and is enclosed on the east side. Siding includes a variety of materials, from early weatherboard to later clapboard. Inside, the first floor consists of two large rooms with the fireplaces in their original positions. The second story's bedrooms have been divided to create office space. The larger of the north wings has three rooms on the first floor and five on the second arranged around a narrow hallway. The smaller wing is a single room. History Scotia owes its name to Alexander Lindsey, the only one of the original founders of Schenectady who was not Dutch. He was a Scotsman who, after taking refuge in the Netherlands, emigrated to New Netherland. There he obtained a patent to land on the north side of the Mohawk. Upon his death, his three sons divided the estate, which had been named Scotia for Lindsey's native country, and changed their last names to Glen in Scotland's honor (this led to the surrounding town taking the name of Glenville, as well). Later, one of those sons dictated in his own will that a house be built on his property for his son Abraham. This, the main block of the current building, was erected around 1730. Its vernacular Dutch framing is responsible for its steeply- pitched roof. Masonry fragments found in the basement suggest that at the time of its construction it may have the standard Dutch-style jambless fireplaces. The larger of the northern wings was built at some yet-undetermined time around the end of the 18th century. The Glen descendants continued to own the house until 1842, when it was sold to Charles and James Collins. The two continued to farm the land and harvest ice from the nearby lake. In 1880 James Collins converted the land around the house into a garden and landscaped park. When the last member of the family died in 1924, the village acquired the property. Five years later, in 1930, a new village library was opened in the house. Since 1948 it has been part of the county library system. During the 1980s the interior was renovated and, on the upper floors, its layout altered.

Microsoft Flight Simulator (1.0) is a flight simulator video game, released in November 1982 for the IBM PC. History Around the years of 1981‚Äì82, Microsoft contacted Bruce Artwick of subLOGIC, creator of FS1 Flight Simulator, to develop a new flight simulator for IBM compatible PCs. This version was released in November 1982 as Microsoft Flight Simulator. It featured an improved graphics engine, variable weather and time of day, and a new coordinate system (used by all subsequent versions up to version 5). It was later updated and ported to other home computers as Flight Simulator II, published by Sublogic. Advertisements claimed \\"If flying your IBM PC got any more realistic, you'd need a license\\", and promised \\"a full-color, out-the-window flight display\\". Early versions of Microsoft Flight Simulator were used as a test for PC compatibility. If a computer could run Microsoft Flight Simulator and Lotus 1-2-3, it was 100% IBM PC-compatible. Gameplay In Microsoft Flight Simulator (1.0), the player flies a Cessna 182 in one of four US regions: Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, or Seattle. The starting airport was Meigs Field in Chicago, with a view of the city skyline to the left and Lake Michigan to the right. It would remain the default airport in future versions of Microsoft Flight Simulator, until the real airport was closed. There was also a \\"Europe 1917\\" mode which was similar to the \\"British Ace\\" mode of FS1 Flight Simulator. This had the player flying a Sopwith Camel in a grid-divided area with mountains on two sides. They could declare war and fire at enemy aircraft.

Founded in 1954 in a house in Notting Hill by a group of √©migr√© Russian friends, led by Maria Mikhailovna Kullmann (Zernova). Their aim was to create a welcoming meeting-place \\"for the enjoyment, understanding and promotion of Russian culture in all its forms, and for the exchange of views in a lively, informal atmosphere, with freedom of speech a core principle\\". Today, Pushkin House remains true to its original mission. In its current home, a 300-year- old listed building on Bloomsbury Square, Pushkin House hosts a varied programme of Russian literature, poetry, art, cinema, music, theatre and dance, history, philosophy and current affairs. Events include lectures, exhibitions, films, concerts, readings, panel discussions, debates and its celebrated annual Book Prize. Pushkin House is a politically independent, Registered UK Charity, owned and run by the Pushkin House Trust. While the original endowment set up more than half a century ago ensures its independence, Pushkin House relies on ticket sales and unconditional donations from the public to maintain quality programming. History Pushkin House has existed in London since 1954 and has borne witness to dramatic changes in the relationship between Britain and Russia. It was in 1953 that Maria Kullmann recognised a need in London for a politically neutral centre of Russian culture. With a small group of family and friends she bought 24 Kensington Park Gardens as a house for students and academics of all nationalities. The first meeting of the Pushkin Club was held there in 1954. By 1956 it was clear that the Pushkin Club needed a premises of its own; and it subsequently bought 46 Ladbroke Grove, which remained its home until 2005. The establishment of the original Pushkin House coincided with the immediate post-Stalin years and the Thaw, when interest in things Russian was intense. These years were marked, for example, by the first yearly visits of the Bolshoi and Kirov (now Mariinsky) Opera and Ballet companies. Several distinguished scholars, writers and artists of the post-revolutionary emigration were still alive, and the Pushkin Club provided them with an effective platform. Speakers in the early days included Metropolitan Anthony, Sir Isaiah Berlin and Dame Elizabeth Hill. In 1955, Tamara Karsavina spoke of her life in ballet; the following year Edward Crankshaw talked of the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the 20th Party Congress. Scriabin's sister and Medtner's widow were both regular attendees. The poet Korney Chukovsky performed at the club in June 1962. Mstislav Dobuzhinsky, one of the last surviving members of Mir Iskusstva, held more than one exhibition in the Club and presented several of stage designs to the Club. There was an exhibition of paintings and lithographs by Leonid Pasternak. Soviet writers brought to the UK by the British Council would often come and talk at the Pushkin Club; they included Konstantin Fedin and Alexander Tvardovsky in 1960. It also provided a rehearsal venue for the London Balalaika Ensemble, also popular during the 1960s. The Pushkin Club enabled people from opposite ends of the political spectrum to meet and discuss; this remains a firm commitment of Pushkin House to the present day.P O'Neill, orchestra member at the time Current activities Pushkin House has been established to serve as a home and dedicated showcase for Russian culture in London, a focus for Anglo-Russian cultural exchange, a provider of education and information on Russian language and culture, a resource and networking centre for individuals and institutions. In pursuit of these aims, Pushkin House has developed a lively and varied cultural programme on Russian literature, art, film, music, theatre and dance, as well as history, philosophy and politics. Events include lectures and talks, seminars, conferences, exhibitions, films, concerts and readings. Besides its own events, Pushkin House welcomes and encourages collaboration with other institutions and groups dedicated to Russian culture. The House currently hosts lectures run by the Pushkin Club and the GB-Russia Society, amongst other collaborators. Regular Russian language courses are provided by the Russian Language Centre, located on the top floor of Pushkin House. Creative partnerships are being established with major museums and libraries in Russia.

Prorogatio developed as a legal procedure in response to Roman expansionism and militarization; the number of annexed territories and theaters of operations outgrew the number of elected officials available to take on military and administrative duties.Andrew Lintott, The Constitution of the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 1999.), p. 113 ff. online. Although in theory prorogation fostered continuity under an experienced commander with \\"expert knowledge of local conditions,\\" thereby increasing the chances of victory; in practice, politics often motivated by the ambitions of individuals, decided whose commands were extended.Miriam R. Pelikan Pittenger, Contested Triumphs: Politics, Pageantry, and Performance in Livy's Republican Rome (University of California Press, 2009), p. 77, note 35 online, with additional references. Sometimes men who held no elected public office ‚Äî that is, private citizens (privati) ‚Äî were given imperium and prorogued, as justified by perceived military emergencies. By the Late Republic, prorogation of provincial assignments had become the norm; by enabling individuals to accumulate disproportionate military power and wealth, the practice contributed to the breakdown of constitutional checks and balances and to the civil wars that led to the collapse of the Republic. Constitutionality In his study of the praetorship in the Republic, T. Corey Brennan has argued that originally prorogation was of two types, granted either by the Roman People or by the Senate: a prorogatio was put to a vote by the People (rogare) to determine whether a provincial command should be extended; propagatio was an extension by the Senate in other cases. By the mid-2nd century BCE, the Senate had usurped the People's power, and eventually all extensions of imperium were called prorogatio.T. Corey Brennan, The Praetorship in the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 603. After the 190s BC, when the Senate no longer submitted its decisions on extending commands to a popular vote, the term prorogatio becomes a technical misnomer, since no rogatio (legislative bill) was involved.Harriet I. Flowers, The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 45 online. As Rome annexed more territories, its mechanisms of government had to evolve. A provincia was originally a task assigned to an official, the sphere of responsibility within which he was authorized to act, which might be specified geographically; when such territories were formally annexed,What precisely \\"formally\\" means in this sense is a subject of much scholarly discussion. the fixed geographical entity was a \\"province.\\" In the Early and Middle Republic, the \\"task\\" was most often a military command within a defined theater of operations, the physical borders of which were regularly transgressed. The English term \\"governor\\"The Latin word gubernator meant \\"helmsman, pilot.\\" is used to encompass several Roman titles as they pertained to provincial assignments, including consul, praetor, dictator, pro consule, pro praetore and ‚Äúpromagistrate.‚Äù A Roman governor had the right, and was normally expected, to remain in his province until his successor arrived, even when he had not been prorogued. According to the Lex Cornelia de maiestate, a governor was then required to give up his province within 30 days.Andrew Lintott, Imperium Romanum: Politics and Administration (Routledge, 1993), pp. 46‚Äì47 online. A prorogued magistrate could not exercise his imperium within Rome.Brennan, Praetorship p. 606. See also Fred K. Drogula, \\"Imperium, potestas, and the pomerium in the Roman Republic,\\" Historia 56 (2007) 419‚Äì452. Prorogatio has been characterized by modern scholars as a \\"dodge\\"Brennan, Praetorship pp. 598 and 602; see also \\"dodge\\" or \\"dodges\\" et passim. or a \\"legal fiction\\"Harriet I. Flowers, The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic p. 57. for maintaining the illusion that imperium was a property of the office and not the individual. In the Late Republic, the prorogatio imperii for supposed military crises provided one precedent for the legal maneuvering that permitted the multiple and sequential consulships of Gaius Marius in the context of the Cimbrian War,Lintott, Constitution p. 114. as later when constitutional mechanisms were sought for consolidating the powers that created Augustus.W. Eder, \\"The Augustan Principate as Binding Link,\\" in Between Republic and Empire (University of California Press, 1993), p. 98 online. The nature of promagisterial imperium is complicated by its relation to the celebrating of a triumph as awarded by the senate. Before a commander could enter the city limits (pomerium) for his triumph, he had to lay aside arms formally and ritually, that is, he had to reenter society as a civilian.After his term as governor in Spain in the late 60s BC, for instance, Julius Caesar was awarded a triumph which he never got to celebrate; in order to register his candidacy for what would prove to be his first consulship, he had to meet a deadline for appearing in person in the city. The senate declined to allow him to register in absentia, a privilege that had been granted to Marius when he was conducting wars abroad. Caesar thus had to choose between celebrating what would have been his first triumph, and running for the consulship. Rather than delay his political advancement, he gave up the gloria of the grand parade. Some biographers of Caesar have suggested that this insulting treatment by the senate, spearheaded by Cato, was one of the motivations in his drive for achievement, which had not been exceptional up to this point. There are several early instances, however, of a commander celebrating a triumph during his two- or three-year term; it is possible that the triumph was held at the completion of his consulship (more rarely a praetorship) and before he returned to the field with prorogued imperium.H.S. Versnel, Triumphus: An Inquiry into the Origin, Development and Meaning of the Roman Triumph (Brill Archive, 1970), p. 189 online. This pattern is visible, for instance, in provincial commands and prorogations in Cisalpine Gaul during the Middle Republic. Early Republic In the Early Republic, only three magistrates ‚Äî the two consuls and the sole praetor ‚Äî held imperium. At first, the appointment of dictatores and magistri equitum filled the need for additional military commanders.Lintott, Constitution p. 113. The first recorded prorogation was that of the consul Q. Publilius Philo in 327 BC. Philo was in the middle of a siege of Naples when his term in office was due to expire. The Senate decided that it was imprudent to recall him; instead, the tribunes of the plebs were to propose that \\"on the expiration of his consulship he conduct the campaign pro consule (in place of a consul) until the war was concluded.\\" The first prorogation thus was brought before the People's Assembly for a vote (rogatio).Livy 8.23.11‚Äì12; T.J. Cornell, \\"The Recovery of Rome,\\" in Cambridge Ancient History (Cambridge University Press, 1989, reprinted 2002), p. 347 online. During the Second and Third Samnite Wars (326‚Äì290 BC), prorogation became a regular administrative practice that allowed continuity of military command without violating the principle of annual magistracies, or increasing the number of magistrates who held imperium.Brennan, Praetorship p. 602 online; E.S. Staveley, \\"Rome and Italy in the Early Third Century, \\" Cambridge Ancient History (Cambridge University Press, 1989, reprinted 2002), p. 437 online. In 307, Q. Fabius Maximus Rullianus became the second magistrate to have his command prorogued.Livy 9.42.2, as cited by Cornell, \\"The Conquest of Italy,\\" p. 378 (following). Instances in the 5th century BC are dubious. But in the years 296‚Äì295, several prorogations are recorded at once, including four promagistrates who were granted imperium while they were private citizens (privati). Territorial expansion and increasing militarization drove a recognition that the \\"emergencies\\" had become a continual state of affairs, and a regular system of allotting commands developed.T.J. Cornell, \\"The Conquest of Italy,\\" in Cambridge Ancient History (Cambridge University Press, 1989, reprinted 2002), p. 378 online. See also (though on the Middle Republic) Fergus Millar, \\"The Political Character of the Classical Roman Republic, 200‚Äì151 B.C.,\\" as reprinted in Rome, the Greek World, and the East (University of North Carolina Press, 2002), p. 110, originally published in Journal of Roman Studies 74 (1984) 1‚Äì19: \\"Roman militarism was demonstrated consistently in northern Italy and Spain, at various periods in Greece and Macedonia (200‚Äì194, 191‚Äì187‚Äì171‚Äì168), and for one period of three years in Asia Minor (190‚Äì188).\\" Because the promagistracies, like the dictatorship, originated as special military commands, they may at first have been limited in practice to about six months, or the length of the campaigning season.Brennan, Praetorship pp. 38‚Äì43 on the dictatorship; p. 603 on original length of prorogations, based on a study of triumphal dates. Middle Republic Commanders were often prorogued during the First Punic War (264‚Äì241 BC). By the end of this long conflict, a second praetor had been added to the three magistrates holding imperium. The new office was the praetor qui inter peregrinos ius dicit (\\"praetor who administers justice among foreigners\\"). Brennan has argued that the purpose of this new office was not, as is often thought, to administer justice to foreigners living in Rome, but inter peregrinos in the provinces as the situation seemed to require. When the peregrine praetor was abroad with a military command, the urban praetor could remain in Rome to avoid suspending public and judicial business. The praetor urbanus, however, might also go abroad to take on a military command if the situation seemed to warrant it. During the 220s and 210s, the praetor peregrinus is found most often in northern Italy, fighting without much success against various Gallic polities.Brennan, Praetorship pp. 603‚Äì605. An increase in the number of praetors during this period is linked to the annexation of territories as \\"provinces\\" in the modern sense of a geographical region organized under formal administration. In 228‚Äì227 BC, two new praetorships were created and assigned to Rome's first administrative provinces, Sicily (Sicilia) and Sardinia (Corsica et Sardinia).Brennan, Praetorship, p. 605. Earlier dates for Sicily and Sardinia as provinciae refer to military commands prior to formal annexation ‚Äî though what constitutes \\"annexation\\" during this period is sometimes unclear. In 197 BC, two more praetorships were created along with the administrative provinces of Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior, bringing the number to six.Lintott Constitution, p. 114. While modern scholars often suppose that prorogation was intended originally to ensure that an experienced commander with hands-on knowledge of the local situation could conclude a successful campaign, in practice the extension of command was subject to \\"unsteady ad-hoc politics.\\"Pittenger, Contested Triumphs p. 77, note 35. On the political realities, see Erich S. Gruen, The Hellenistic World and the Coming of Rome (University of California Press, 1984), p. 203ff. online. During the Second Punic War (218‚Äì201 BC), commands were also prorogued out of necessity, because so many of Rome's ruling elite had died in the conflict; prorogation became almost the norm for the provinciae of Sicily, Sardinia, Hispania (as a military command prior to annexation), and the naval fleets.Gruen, The Hellenistic World p. 215 online. As consul in 218 BC, P. Cornelius Scipio was assigned to Spain, and had his command prorogued through 211, when he was killed and his army defeated by Carthaginian forces. It was under these pressures that private citizens (privati) were granted imperium. Precedent was established in 210 when a vote by the assembly gave Scipio's son, later to be known as Africanus, a long-term command pro consule in Spain, although he was privatus; his second-in-command acted pro praetore. Scipio did not return to Rome until 206, and proconsuls continued to be appointed specifically for Spain after that.Lintott, Constitution p. 114. In the 2nd century BC, proconsular imperium had ceased to be granted by the popular assembly; the now-fictional prorogatio was justified by military emergencies as decided by the Senate. \\"Unusual political influence\\" was required for prorogations of longer than one year.Lintott, Constitution p. 114. The Lex Baebia of 181 BC, which cracked down on electoral bribery, was accompanied by an attempt to regulate prorogation in relation to the praetorship. Advancement through the political career track had not been regularized before the 190s; the consulship and praetorship might be held in either order, without prerequisites. A law dating around 196 BC began to require that candidates for the consulship first serve as praetors, now numbering six. Competition for the praetorship became fierce, and campaign corruption (ambitus) virulent. The Lex Baebia et Cornelia of 181 devised a complicated system aimed at limiting the number of ex-praetors vying for the consulship. In the sortition for provinciae, the two Spains were to be left out in odd-numbered years, and only four praetorships would be available in those years. In effect, a provincial appointment in Spain meant automatic prorogation, resulting in a two-year term ‚Äî and sometimes a shortage of administrators for other provinces that in turn required further prorogation. Six praetors become the norm again in the mid-170s, with administrative needs prioritized over the moral issues.Brennan, Praetorship pp. 625‚Äì626. Late Republic Prorogation takes on a new importance with the annexation of Macedonia and the Roman province of Africa in 146 BC. The number of praetors was not increased even though the two new territories were organized as praetorian provinces. For the first time since the 170s, it became impossible for sitting magistrates to govern all the permanent praetorian provinciae, which now numbered eight.This includes the six territorial provinces requiring a governor (Sicily, Sardinia, the two Spains, Macedonia, and Africa), and the two city jurisdictions of the praetor urbanus and the praetor peregrinus. This point marks the beginning of the era of the so-called \\"Roman governor,\\" a post for which there is no single word in the Republic. Prorogation became fully institutionalized, and even the praetor urbanus was sometimes prorogued. Governors who received established territorial provinces could expect longer tenures.Brennan, Praetorship pp. 626‚Äì627. The addition of the wealthy Asian province in 133 BC as a bequest of Attalus III put further pressure on the system, again without increasing the number of praetorships: In one major administrative development for which the career of Marius offers the clearest evidence, praetors now needed to remain in Rome to preside over increased activity in the criminal courts, often occasioned by prosecutions for extortion in the provinces or electoral corruption,Asconius remarks that when a praetor was given an extended command, it allowed him to extort enough money out of allies to buy the consulship, which in turn would give him another chance to plunder a province before he lost his immunity from prosecution as a magistrate; scholion to Pro Scauro 14.3, as cited by Brennan, p. 584. and only after their term were praetors regularly assigned to a province as proconsul or propraetor.Lintott, Constitution p. 114; Brennan, Praetorship p. 628. The scale of Roman military commitments in annexed territories during the Late Republic required regular prorogation, since the number of magistrates and ex-magistrates who were both able commanders and willing to accept provincial governorships did not increase proportionally. The holding of imperium thus depended less and less on elected office, detaching power further from its foundation in the People. \\"In the era 122‚Äì91,\\" Brennan notes, \\"the Senate used prorogation as a panacea for its ailing administrative system.\\" Emergency grants of imperium in the field during the Social War (91‚Äì87 BC) made the granting of extra-magisterial command seem routine. When Sulla assumed the dictatorship in late 82 BC, the territorial provinces alone numbered ten, with possibly six permanent courts to be presided over in the city.Brennan, Praetorship pp. 583 and 629. Prorogations of three years were not uncommon during this period, and the Senate begins to assign commands predetermined at three years or more in length.Lintott, Constitution p. 114 online; Brennan, Praetorship pp. 583‚Äì584, pp. 636‚Äì637, with numerous examples. C. Valerius Flaccus held various combinations of provincial assignments on the Iberian peninsula and in Gaul for more than a decade (92‚Äì81 BC), without any indication that he ever returned to Rome or was without a command. On more than one occasion,In Hispania Citerior 77‚Äì71 BC, against the pirates in 67, in the East 66‚Äì62; Brennan, Praetorship p. 636. Pompeius Magnus (\\"Pompey the Great\\") received imperium pro consule before he ever held a magistracy ‚Äî at first from the Senate, then by vote of the People, the latter perhaps indicative of the revival of popularist politics. Given the extended prorogations, the five-year proconsular commands assigned to Julius Caesar in Gaul and Marcus Crassus in Syria are less exceptional than they have sometimes been regarded; it could be argued that the five-year appointment was a realistic assessment of the time required to accomplish the task, and avoided the uncertainty, delays, and political jockeying of year-by-year prorogation. Although competition for remunerative provinces, especially Asia, might be fierce,Brennan, Praetorship p. 584. provinces that offered more administrative headaches than kickbacks were regarded as drudge duty. Cicero indicated his lack of enthusiasm for provincial governing when he repeatedly wrote to friends asking them to make sure that his proconsulship in Cilicia (51‚Äì50 BC) would not be prorogued.Andrew Lintott, Cicero as Evidence: A Historian's Companion (Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 253 online, citing at least ten surviving letters to Atticus and others. The titles \\"proconsul\\" and \\"propraetor\\" are not used by Livy or literary sources of the Republican era.Brennan, Praetorship p. 603. Pompey's status as privatus cum imperio established a precedent that was resorted to during attempts at carrying on a republican form of government in 43 BC, following Caesar's assassination, as evidenced in particular by the commands of Marcus Brutus, Cassius Longinus, Sextus Pompeius, and most fatefully Octavian.Lintott, Constitution p. 114.

Synopsis The plot of The Beauty Prize involves two pairs of lovers who are kept apart by a succession of complications, before everything is satisfactorily resolved in the final act.Play Pictorial, 1924, p 6Day 2004, p 317 John Brooke is a wealthy young Englishman. Carol Stuart is the daughter of James K Stuart, a rich American. Meeting at a charity ball, each is attracted to the other, but pretends to be poor, a deception that continues even after they have become engaged. ;Act 1: Scene 1: The Supper Room at Carl's Private Club The girls discuss a newspaper beauty competition in which the winner will receive a substantial cash prize, plus a husband. John arrives and tells his secretary, Flutey, that he and Carol have set a date for their wedding, but is startled to see Carol's photograph in the newspaper as an entrant in the beauty competition. He does not know that Carol's portrait has been entered, without her knowledge, by Lovey Toots, a milliner's assistant who is an admirer of Carol's. Scene 2: Carol Stuart's Home, Kensington ‚Äì A few days later Carol's servants and friends are preparing for her wedding when Odo Philpotts arrives at her Kensington apartment. she has won the newspaper competition and he is the prize. Meanwhile, Mrs Hexal, Carol's chaperone‚Äîwho had hoped to win John for herself and who sees it as her duty to separate Carol from her seemingly impecunious fianc√©‚Äîhas learnt from the morning newspaper that Carol has won the beauty competition; she reveals to John that Carol is a wealthy heiress and manages to insinuate that it was Carol herself who entered the competition, seeking a husband. John is incensed and, believing that Carol has tricked him and that he was nothing more than her latest \\"purchase\\", he upbraids her. She, in turn, is angered by his attitude and, in a fit of pique, announces that she will marry Odo. John retaliates by threatening to marry Lovey, unaware that she and Odo are mutually attracted to each other. ;Act 2: On board the SS Majestania ‚Äì A few days later All the principal characters are on board the Majestania, apparently bound for Carol's home in Florida. Odo has established himself as the life and soul of the party, organising events, winning all the sports contests, and finding ample time to pursue his interest in Lovey. Carol cannot abide him, and John feels the same about Lovey; they argue whenever they meet, but are clearly still in love and regretting their hasty action on the morning of their intended wedding. Flutey sees a way of resolving the situation: he suggests that each, without telling the other, should bribe the wireless operator to deliver to them a phony telegram announcing that their fortune has been lost in a financial crisis; this will restore the situation to what they understood it to be when they first met, thus removing the obstacle to their reconciliation. But Flutey has reckoned without Odo, who nobly announces that he and Lovey are engaged to Carol and John respectively and will not abandon them just because they are now impoverished. ;Act 3: Gardens of James Stuart's Home, Long Island ‚Äì A few days later In a brisk denouement, Carol and John confess that they are not really ruined, and are reconciled; Odo and Lovey, released from their engagements, can look forward to life together in a little cottage in Kent; and Flutey finds a new position as personal secretary to Carol's father.

By pressurizing the air available to the engine intake system, the air becomes more dense, and is matched with more fuel, producing the increased horsepower to the wheels. History BorgWarner tested with the idea in 1990s, but had never produced part for production vehicle because of high power consumption, until Mercedes- Benz M 256 engines, which used 48-volt electrical systems.A Little Fan That Fixes the Turbocharger's Biggest Problem In 2010, Volvo started to add electric booster for turbocharger, resulting in High Performance Drive E Powertrain Concept engine, which used 48-volt electrical system for the electric booster.Volvo Bets Its Future on Small, Turbocharged Engines In 2019-10-17, Garrett Motion Inc. announced its first electric turbocharger for market passenger vehicles, with expected launch in 2021.Garrett To Launch Industry's First Electric Turbo The design adds electric motor between the turbocharger's wheels.  Power supply for electric superchargers  An electric supercharger, if supplied by common stock electric accumulators, runs independent of the engine to which it provides its boost. However, electrical energy consumed is often higher than what a production-line generator (e.g. alternator) of the engine can supply. Larger alternators are therefore fitted to recharge accumulators during the engine run.  Efficiency  The efficiency of an electric supercharger is curbed by several energy conversion losses (alternator for charging), damp energy while charging the accumulators and the compressor providing boost. The losses are in general higher than direct kinematic linkage of intake air compressor to engine crankshaft. If the vehicle implements kinetic energy recovery, then the battery can be charged on otherwise wasted energy.  Electric assisted turbochargers  Electric assisted turbochargers are turbochargers employing a coaxial electric motor to overcome the time lag of the exhaust gas driven turbine. The electric motor supports the exhaust gas driven turbine at low-end revolutions to compress enough air into engine's intake, while it can be configured as an alternator to extract energy from the exhaust gas driven turbine at high-end revs, which would otherwise need be bypassed via wastegate and eventually replacing the current mechanically driven alternator. Special consideration need be given to the coaxial electric motor operating in proximity of a hot turbine at very high rotational speed (up to 100,000 rpm).  Aftermarket scams  Several companies sell low-cost aftermarket products, claimed to be electric superchargers. These devices are typically simple ducted fans or blowers, often directly repurposed from marine and naval supplies, and are simply not capable of providing an intake manifold pressure increase, or a flow rate greater than what an engine draws. They can not measurably compress air or increase airflow, and instead draw electrical power and act as an obstruction for air flow to the engine. Usually, this leads to a slightly reduced power output, never an increased one. In order to increase performance in any automotive engine, a compressor must force (compress) a significantly greater volume of air into the engine than it would otherwise draw naturally. This requires a large amount of energy. An effective electric supercharging system requires additional batteries onboard, and uses multi-horsepower electric motors and high-speed compression impellers similar to those used in exhaust- coupled turbochargers. Every psi of boost uses 6-7bhp from power source, but many such kits use 12-volt battery system instead of 48-volt battery system used in the chargers for production vehicles, so the gain from a 12-volt kit is effectively cancelled.What Are Electric Superchargers, And Do They Actually Work?

The 13th-century Donjon of Zweder I van Zuylen van Abcoude in 2006 The 15th-century Burgundian tower in 2006 Origin and development The castle originated in the 13th century. Around 1270, Zweder I van Zuylen van Abcoude built a freestanding keep on a raised and moated site near the lost city Dorestad. Until the beginning of the 15th century Duurstede Castle was in possession by the Van Zuylen van Abcoude family, until they were forced to sell it to the bishops of Utrecht in 1449. Bishop David of Burgundy, who reigned from 1459 to 1496, completely rebuilt the castle. The old donjon was enclosed by new buildings. The still intact burgundian tower was also built around this time. His successors Frederick IV of Baden and Philip of Burgundy also used the castle as their residence, and Philip of Burgundy embellished the castle with renaissance features. Philip of Burgundy settled at Duurstede Castle when he became bishop of Utrecht in 1517. He was accompanied by his court painter Mabuse (Jan Gossaert), who helped to decorate the new palace of his master. At Philip's death, in 1524, Mabuse designed and erected his tomb in the church of Wijk bij Duurstede. After Philip's death, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor confiscated all territorial possessions of the bishopric of Utrecht, including Duurstede Castle. Later years In 1580, as a result of the Dutch Revolt, the castle fell into the hands of the States of Utrecht. The states, however, invested their money into building modern fortification around Wijk bij Duurstede, and as a result the castle fell into neglect. Further damage was done when French troops devastated Wijk by Duurstede in 1672, after which the townspeople used stone from the castle to rebuild their homes. In 1852 the town council became owner of the castle and turned the surrounding fortifications into a park. Until 1925 the castle could only be reached by a little ferry. The Donjon The old donjon built by Zweder van Abcoude in the 13th century has withstood the passage of time reasonably well, and is an excellent example of medieval towers. The walls are 2.5 metres thick; the original entrance was at the second level and could only be reached with a wooden ladder that could be removed or destroyed in times of need. The Burgundian Tower One of the corner towers of the old castle was expanded in the 15th century into its current form. While the rest of the castle had a more residential purpose, the Burgundian tower obviously had a military purpose. It is more than 40 metres high, and has very thick walls.

He was a right-arm fast-medium pace bowler who, in the opinion of Sir Garry Sobers, was never far away from a place in the West Indies team. Career Touring England at the age of 21 with a team from his native Barbados, Moseley caught the eye of Bill Andrews, and with the recommendation of Sir Garry Sobers, he arrived in Taunton within a year. However, qualification problems were to delay his debut for Somerset until the fourth match of the 1971 John Player League. He provided good support for Allan Jones and Tom Cartwright, taking 19 one-day wickets at 20.26 in his first season. A particularly strong one-day bowler, Moseley led Somerset in wickets in the John Player League in 1973, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1980 and 1982, never quite showing the consistency needed to break into a West Indies squad already full of pacy seam bowlers. His relationship with the fans was exceptional; a happy, smiling, bespectacled West Indian whose distinctive under-arm returns to the wicket-keeper drew whistles of admiration and envy, and whose batting exploits, while unsuccessful helped turn him into a local star. He received his county cap during his second season at Somerset. Moseley's later career suffered greatly with the two overseas players limitation, with Joel Garner and Viv Richards filling those slots whenever available.

The company is most famous for having built the town of Levittown, New York. The company's designs and building practices revolutionized the home building industry and altered the north eastern landscape of the United States with massive suburban communities. Levitt & Sons was America's biggest home builder by 1951, and William Levitt was named one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. Historian Kenneth T. Jackson wrote of Levitt & Sons, \\"The family that had the greatest impact on postwar housing in the United States was Abraham Levitt and his sons, William and Alfred, who ultimately built more than 140,000 houses and turned a cottage industry into a major manufacturing process.\\" Founding and early years Abraham Levitt founded a real-estate development company near the start of the Great Depression.Levittown Historical Society Garvin, Alexander (2001) American Cities: What Works, What Doesn't New York: McGraw Hill, p.397. His son William became company president at the age of 22, handling the advertising, sales, and financing. Alfred Levitt, still a teenager, became vice president of design and drafted plans for the first Levitt house, a six bedroom, two bathroom Tudor style home that sold for over $14,000 in 1929 (roughly $ today). The Levitts sold 600 of these upper-middle-class homes, part of the Strathmore project, in four years during the Great Depression. William earned a reputation as the person to see for high-end, custom homes on Long Island's North Shore, called the Gold Coast. Prior to World War II, Levitt & Sons built mostly upscale housing on and around Long Island, New York. During the 1930s, they built the North Strathmore community at Manhasset, New York, on the former Onderdonk farm. The North Strathmore homes sold for $9,100 to $18,500. The Levitts built another 1,200 homes in Manhasset, Great Neck, and Westchester County. Radio stars, prominent journalists, surgeons, business people, and lawyers bought the upscale Levitt houses.\\"William Levitt Facts\\" Your Dictionary website Levitt & Sons also built Strathmore at Roslyn a few years later, in the late 1940s.  Construction of Levittown, New York  After World War II, America's post-war prosperity and baby boom had created a crisis of affordable housing, especially for returning veterans. Levitt & Sons chose an area known as Island Trees near Hempstead, Long Island, as the site for a huge building project for housing these veterans. The company named it Levittown. The community was planned to have 6,000 low-priced homes, making it much larger than any other U.S. development. The company bought of potato farms on Long Island. On July 1, 1947, Levitt & Sons broke ground on the $50 million ($ million today) development of Levittown, which ultimately included 17,000 homes on 7.3 square miles of land. Alfred created the mass production techniques and designed the homes and the layout of the development, with its curving streets. Abraham directed the landscaping, whose focus was two trees to each front yard, all planted exactly the same distance apart. William was the financier and promoter, who persuaded lawmakers to rewrite the laws that made Levittown possible. The houses, which were in the Cape Cod and ranch house styles, sat on a seventh-acre (0.06 ha) lot. They had with two bedrooms, a living room with a television and a kitchen with modern appliances, an unfinished second floor and no garage. Levitt's innovation in creating this planned community was to build the houses in the manner of an assembly line. In normal assembly lines, the workers stay stationary and the product moves down the line; in Levitt's homebuilding assembly line, the product‚Äîthe houses‚Äîstayed in place and specialized workers moved from house to house. The assembly line construction method allowed Levittown to be constructed more efficiently than other development at the time, with teams of specialized workers following each other from house to house to complete incremental steps in the construction. Levitt also reduced costs by freezing out union labor - a move which provoked picket lines - enabling him to use the latest technology, such as spray painting. He also cut out middlemen and purchased many items, including lumber and televisions, directly from manufacturers, as well as constructing his own factory to produce nails. The building of every house was reduced to 26 steps, and sub-contractors were responsible for each step. During the project, Levitt & Sons emphasized speed, efficiency, and cost- effective construction; these methods led to a production rate of 30 houses a day by July 1948. The mass production of thousands of houses at virtually the same time allowed the company to sell them for as little as $8,000 each ($65,000 in 2009 dollars), which, with the G.I. Bill and Federal housing subsidies, reduced the up-front cost of a house to many buyers to around $400. Levitt & Sons was the cover story in Time magazine for July 3, 1950. William Levitt was pictured on the cover, with the tag line \\"For Sale: a new way of life.\\" Discriminatory practices As well as a symbol of the American Dream, Levittown would also become a symbol of racial segregation, due to Clause 25 of the standard lease agreement signed by the first residents of Levittown, who had an option to buy their homes. This \\"restrictive covenant\\" stated in capital letters and bold type that the house could not \\"be used or occupied by any person other than members of the Caucasian race.\\"Lambert, Bruce (December 28, 1997) \\"At 50, Levittown Contends With Its Legacy of Bias\\" The New York Times Such discriminatory housing standards were consistent with government policies of the time.Gotham, Kevin Fox (Summer 2000) \\"Racialization and the State: The Housing Act of 1934 and the Creation of the Federal Housing Administration,\\" Sociological Perspectives, 43/2 p.309 The Federal Housing Administration allowed developers to justify segregation within public housing. The FHA only offered mortgages to non-mixed developments which discouraged developers from creating racially integrated housing.Kushner, David (2009) Levittown: Two Families, One Tycoon, and the Fight for Civil Rights in America‚Äôs Legendary Suburb. New York: Walker & Company. p.43 Before the sale of Levittown homes began, the sales agents were aware that no applications from black families would be accepted. As a result, American veterans who wished to purchase a home in Levittown were unable to do so if they were black.Kushner 2009, p.44. William Levitt attempted to justify their decision to only sell homes to white families by saying that it was in the best interest for business. He claimed their actions were not discriminatory but intended to maintain the value of their properties. The company explained that it was not possible to reduce racial segregation while they were attempting to reduce the housing shortage. Levvitt said \\"As a Jew, I have no room in my heart for racial prejudice. But the plain fact is that most whites prefer not to live in mixed communities. This attitude may be wrong morally, and someday it may change. I hope it will.\\"\\"When the Niggers Moved into Levittown: a review of David Kushner's Levittown: Two Families, One Tycoon, and the Fight for Civil Rights in America's Legendary Suburb\\" Journal of Blacks in Higher Education 63 (Spring 2009): 80‚Äì81 The Levitts explained that they would open up applications to blacks after they had sold as many homes to white people as possible. They believed that potential white buyers would not want to buy a house in Levittown if they were aware that they would have black neighbors. Though the Levitts were Jewish, they did not wish to sell homes to Jewish families either; despite this, by 1960, although it was still a completely \\"white\\" suburb,Gotham 2000, p.309 the population of Levittown was roughly a third Jewish, with the remainder about a third Roman Catholic, and a third Protestant.Manton, Paul (May 9, 2013) \\"The Ecclesiastical History of the Levittown People \\" Levittown Patch An opposition group was formed, the Committee to End Discrimination in Levittown, to protest the restricted sale of Levittown homes, and to push for an integrated community. In 1948 a ruling in another case by the United States Supreme Court declared that property deeds stipulating racial segregation were \\"unenforceable as law and contrary to public policy\\".Jones, Michael E. (2004) \\"The Slaughter of Cities: Urban Renewal as Ethnic Cleansing\\". South Bend, Indiana: St. Augustine's Press. p.188. Only well after the 1954 racial integration decisions, including Brown v. Board of Education, was Levittown racially integrated, and even as late as the 1990 census only a tiny fraction of the community was non-white, a stigma that still exists until this day.Hales, Peter Bacon (September 2016) \\"Levittown's Palimpsest: Colored Skin\\" in \\"Levittown: Documents of an Ideal American Suburb\\" Other Levittown projects The Levitts went on to plan and build another community of more than 17,000 homes in Levittown, Pennsylvania, which saw its first residents in 1952. Willingboro, New Jersey, was built as a Levittown in 1958, and bears several Levittown-specific street names such as Levitt Parkway. Discord in the Levitt family caused a split in 1954. Alfred left the company, and William took full control of Levitt & Sons. During the late 1950s, Levitt and Sons developed the community known as \\"Belair at Bowie,\\" in Bowie, Maryland. In 1957 they acquired the historic Belair Mansion and estate, home of Maryland's colonial Governor Samuel Ogle and his Belair Stables. In 1959 the community was annexed by Bowie. The company went public in 1960. Through the 1960s, the Levitts constructed houses in six Eastern states. In 1961, the company started development in Aberdeen, New Jersey (formerly Matawan Township), known as \\"Strathmore at Matawan.\\" the Strathmore name had originally been used by Levitt & Sons in its upper middle class developments on Long Island in the 1930s. Levittown, Puerto Rico, built in the 1960s, was a Levitt project. In 1966, Levitt & Sons built a development in Somerset, New Jersey, and in 1966‚Äì72, it built another development in Greenbriar, Virginia. In 1967, the company developed Montpelier, near Laurel, Maryland. Levitt & Sons even went international. The company built a large development near Paris at L√©signy in Seine-et-Marne, and at Mennecy in Essonne, France. By the late 1960s, Levitt & Sons had built more than 140,000 houses. Under ITT Levitt & Sons was sold to ITT in 1964 for a reported $90 million ($ million today). The company continued to build housing developments as an ITT subsidiary, under a variety of names that usually included \\"Levitt\\". Development in Florida started two years later. In the United States, Levitt houses were built in the states of Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington, as well as in Puerto Rico. Around the world, Levitt houses were built in Canada, France, and Spain. Later years Starrett Housing Corporation purchased ITT's Levitt subsidiary in 1979. Houses continued to be built in Florida, Illinois, New York, and Virginia. A completely separate company called Levitt Homes Corp. operated in Puerto Rico during the 1980s. Levitt was sold to BankAtlantic in 1999. In 2003, Levitt was established as independent entity from BankAtlantic. Levitt & Sons were restricted to building in Florida alone by the 2000s. Levitt filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late 2007 as a result of the housing crash. The parent company was renamed in 2008 to Woodbridge Holdings Corporation, which shortly afterwards ceased trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

After the break-up, Moten's pianist and arranger, known then as \\"Bill Basie,\\" organized a small band of his own, composed of several leading musicians from the Moten band. Eventually (still in 1935), Basie enlarged the band at the Reno Club in Kansas City to the big band model that sustained him the rest of his career.Nat Shapiro, Nat Hentoff, Hear Me Talkin' To Ya: The Story Of Jazz As Told By The Men Who Made It, pg. 300, Dover Publications (1966)  Ownership  In 1933, its owner, Orlaf K. Farr (b. 1894 Ogden, Utah; d. 1981 Sun City, CA; married to Dorcas N. Farr), hired Rudolph Michael Schindler, a well-known architect, to design a conversion from an existing arena amusement hall that had been built in 1927. Schindler's task, essentially was to design the installation of a $50,000 dance floor. The building, still in existence, is located on the southwest corner of 5th Avenue and Lincoln, Denver, Colorado. Beyer was owner of the York Hotel in Denver and Norton was the owner of the Lewiston Hotel at 731 18th Street, Denver (both hotels may have been more like boarding houses). Farr operated Rainbow Ballroom since its opening until selling in December 1946 to Felix Bernard Beyer (b. Sept. 28, 1888, Denver, CO; d. Oct. 4, 1977, Lakewood, CO)Obituary: Felix B.

Verne Byers, Felix Beyer's son, became manager of the Rainbow Room January 24, 1947. Byers continued the past policy of booking territory bands and name bands. The hall had a capacity of 3000 and was open six nights a week. In 1948, James Norton purchased Felix Beyer's interest in the ballroom and then leased it for 10 years to Joseph Leher, an ex-GI. At some point in the 1950s, Joseph Leher (1921‚Äì1990) purchased the Rainbow Ballroom.Denver's Ballroom Owner Puts Rainbow to Lot of Uses, _The Billboard_ , pg 41, col. 1, Dec. 17, 1955  Affiliations  Its original owner, Orlaf K.

Riot at the ballroom  In July 1959, a race riot broke out during a Fats Domino concert/dance when an unidentified man kicked over the table of a man and woman who had just finished a dance - the man was African American and the woman was Caucasian. It took more than an hour to quell the disturbance which drew 18 police patrol cars, three police paddy wagons, and an ambulance. Police estimated that were 2,500 people in the ballroom during the disturbance and that 40 different fights were going on when they arrived. The concert promoter, LeRoy Smith (1911‚Äì1989), estimated that 1,600 were in attendance and that only 4 fights had broken out. There were no serious injuries or damage to the ballroom. No arrests were made.Rock 'n' Roll Riot Hospitalizes Two, _Stars and Stripes_ , July 29, 1959Fight Breaks Out at Domino's Show, _Greeley Daily Tribune_ , col. 4, pg. 16, July 27, 1959.

He was also connected with the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, the Kashmir conflict and attacks against India and the United States. In August 2010, the US and the United Nations designated him a terrorist. NBC News reported that United States officials had mentioned him as a possible successor to Osama bin Laden as head of al-Qaeda.

Kashmiri also spent a year studying communications at the Allama Iqbal University. He also studied for some time in Karachi's Jamia Uloom-ul-Islamia, a madrasa known to produce Islamist militants, where he'd form, with two follow students, the nucleus of what would become the first jihadi outfit of the country, Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI).Alex Strick van Linschoten, Felix Kuehn, An Enemy We Created: The Myth of the Taliban-Al-Qaeda Merger in Afghanistan, 1970-2010, Hurst Publishers (2012), p. 460 In the Soviet war in Afghanistan, he trained the Afghan mujahideen in mine warfare in Miranshah on behalf of Pakistan. During the fighting he lost an eye and an index finger. He continued his militant activities in Kashmir after the war as a member of Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI), though disagreements with leader Qari Saifullah Akhtar several years after initially joining in 1991 led Kashmiri to establish his own new unit within HuJI known as the 313 Brigade. During the mid-1990s, Kashmiri and Nasrullah Mansoor Langrial were near Poonch when they were seized by the Indian Army and sent to prison, where he would spend the next two years before escaping and returning to Pakistan. Upon his return Kashmiri continued to conduct operations against India, once reportedly being rewarded personally with Rs 100,000 (about US$1,164.24) by then Army Chief General Pervez Musharraf for presenting the severed head of Bhausaheb Maruti Talekar, an Indian Army Soldier to him.According to The Indian Express, the man beheaded was Bhausaheb Maruti Talekar (aged 24) of the 17 Maratha Light Infantry posted in the Nowshera sector when attacked on 27 February 2000. A memorial is to be built in Talekar's memory in Kolgaon, where his parents live. Pictures of Kashmiri with the head of the soldier in his hands were published in some Pakistani newspapers. Post-Kashmir activities Kashmiri rejected orders to serve under Maulana Masood Azhar in the newly founded jihadist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed and was once even targeted by the group. Falling out of favour with the Pakistani military, he was taken into custody and tortured in late 2003 in the wake of an attempt to assassinate President Musharraf. From his release in February 2004 until the 2007 Siege of Lal Masjid he apparently did little, but later returned to the 313 Brigade in the terrorist organisation Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HUJI), which is closely tied to al-Qaeda. Kashmiri rebuilt its strength while collaborating with the Taliban. This was part of a broader movement of Kashmir militants moving to Waziristan, and Kashmiri reportedly moved personnel from his Kotli (Kashmir) training camp to a new one in Razmak (North Waziristan). A U.S. indictment of Kashmiri stated that he \\"was in regular contact with al Qaeda [their italics] and in particular with Mustafa Abu al Yazid...\\" He has been associated with a number of attacks, including the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the 2010 Pune bombing, the assassination of Benazir Bhutto and the killing of Ameer Faisal Alavi.http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012%5C02%5C22%5Cstory_22-2-2012_pg1_1http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays- News-13-2657-Growing-Pakistanisation-of-al-Qaeda Syed Saleem Shahzad wrote that Kashmiri proposed the Mumbai attacks to al-Qaeda leaders as a way to create a war that would bring operations against al-Qaeda to a halt. The plan was approved and given to former LeT commander Major Haroon Ashik. According to Asia Times Online, Kashmiri was behind a 2008 plan to assassinate Chief of Army Staff General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani as he stepped out of his car during daily visits to a gym; however, the al-Qaeda leadership rejected the plan on strategic grounds. According to The News International, Kashmiri is accused of organising the December 2009 Camp Chapman attack against the CIA and the United States was seeking his arrest and extradition. In early 2010, Kashmiri was reported to be the new leader of al-Qaeda's Lashkar al Zil, or Shadow Army, following the death of its former leader Abdullah Said al Libi by an American drone. According to journalist Amir Mir, citing Pakistani security sources, Kashmiri was subsequently assigned the role of organising attacks against Western targets after the regional command was taken by Saif Al-Adel, a former Egyptian army colonel newly released from Iran. Before his death, bin Laden had asked Kashmiri to plan an attack on Barack Obama, according to a column by David Ignaitius published on the Washington Post web site. Ignaitius stated that his column was based on documents seized from the raid on bin Laden's compound. In the wake of the killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden on 2 May 2011 during an American operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan, terrorism analysts put forth Kashmiri's name as one of several possible successors to lead the organisation. U.S. indictment On 27 October 2009, a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice named Kashmiri as a conspirator to whom an American citizen from Chicago, David Headley, arrested on terrorism related charges, \\"allegedly reported and attempted to report\\". The statement also noted that Kashimiri \\"issued a statement this month that he was alive and working with al Qaeda\\". A report on details of the investigation stated that Kashmiri \\"was in regular contact with Headley for some time and their communications suggested that they were in the process of plotting fresh attacks in India.\\" Headley was reportedly distraught at news of Kashmiri's death, but after receiving confirmation that he was still alive, set off for Pakistan, at which time he was arrested by the FBI. Kashmiri was officially indicted on two counts, for \\"conspiracy to murder and maim in Denmark\\" (against the newspaper Jyllands-Posten) and \\"conspiracy to provide material support to terrorism in Denmark\\". During court testimony on 31 May 2011, Headley indicated that he had conducted preliminary research for Kashmiri in a plot targeting Robert J. Stevens, the CEO of Lockheed-Martin, the defence contractor. Blacklisted as a terrorist by US and UN On 6 August 2010, the United States labelled Kashmiri a \\"Specially Designated Global Terrorist\\" while the United Nations added him and his group HuJI to its blacklist established under UN Security Council Resolution 1267. The label allows the United States to freeze any of his assets in US jurisdiction and to \\"prohibit US persons from engaging in any transactions with him.\\" The UN resolution requires UN member states to freeze assets, ban travel and ban the sale of arms to Kashmiri and HuJI. Assassination attempt and reported death in 2009 Kashmiri was reported killed along with Hanifullah Janikhel and Kaleemullah in Machikhel, North Waziristan on 7 September 2009 when they were hit by a missile fired from a U.S. drone. At the time he was reportedly one of the top 10 most wanted militant commanders in Pakistan. However, in mid- October Kashmiri was reported to have survived the airstrike and granted an interview to Asia Times Online's Syed Saleem Shahzad. A senior American official was later quoted by The Washington Times as saying \\"While there were preliminary indications that Kashmiri may have been dead, there is now reason to believe that he could be alive\\". One rumour among militants asserted that Kashmiri had been outside urinating when the house he was staying at was hit. Death On 3 June 2011, a US drone attack targeted a compound in the Ghwakhwa area of South Waziristan, a Taliban stronghold. Nine militants, including Kashmiri, were reportedly killed in the missile strike.US strike 'kills' key Pakistan militant Ilyas Kashmiri, BBC News, 4 June 2011 Three other militants were badly injured in the attack. Local officials reported that the militants in the compound were all members of the Punjabi Taliban. Kashmiri had moved to Wana from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 10 days earlier. Lala Wazir, a spokesman for Mullah Nazir, a Taliban commander associated with the owner of the compound which was attacked, confirmed his death. Qari Muhammad Idress, a close aide to Kashmiri and a senior HUJI commander, also claimed he was killed in the drone strike. Al Qaeda also eulogised Kashmiri in the August issue of the Nawai Afghan Jihad magazine. On 7 July 2011, CNN reported that an unnamed US Intelligence official said US officials were 99 percent certain Kashmiri was killed but he added \\"the folks that make that determination aren't ready to say so definitively.\\" The US State Department's Rewards for Justice Program, which at one at point designated Kashmiri as a wanted terrorist and offered a $5,000,000 bounty for information leading to his capture, removed him from the list after he was killed.https://web.archive.org/web/20110614064302/http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/index.cfm?page=wanted_terrorist&language;=english On 31 August 2011, Asia Times Online reported that a well known Taliban commander named Shah Sahib had replaced Kashmiri as commander of the Brigade 313. However, doubts remained of his death. A spokesman for the Tehrik-i- Taliban Pakistan (TTP) stated in June 2011 that Kashmiri was alive and well. In mid-July 2011, Dawn reported that Kashmiri was still alive and active in the border areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan. On 30 July 2011, the Indian government listed him as one the nation's five most wanted fugitives, indicating that Indian authorities think Kashmiri might still be alive. In March 2012, the Daily Times reported that \\"reliable sources\\" had recently seen Kashmiri meeting with TTP head Hakimullah Mehsud in North Waziristan, but that journalists were unable to access the tribal regions in northern Pakistan to verify the report. Shortly after his death, the Pakistan Ministry of Interior alleged that Kashmiri's group had organised the assassination of Minister of Minority Affairs Shahbaz Bhatti and The Telegraph reported based on unnamed Pakistani officials that Kashmiri was organising a death squad to avenge Osama Bin Laden's death. On 16 March 2012, Ustad Ahmad Farooq, Al Qaeda's lead spokesman in Pakistan, confirmed Kashmiri's death in an audiotape and eulogised him along with other pro-Al Qaeda militant leaders that were killed by US airstrikes in the tribal region. On 10 May 2012, the United Nations Security Council officially labeled Kashmiri as \\"reportedly deceased\\" on the Al Qaeda Sanctions list and made it clear that they would treat him as dead until it could be proven otherwise.

He is the longest serving locally elected city mayor in Turkey, currently at his 5th term. Adding his 17 years as a municipal councillor, he will have served the municipality of Adana for 42 years by the end of this term. He was the president of the Municipalities Union of Turkey for 17 years and the √áukurova Municipalities Union for 12 years. Ayta√ß Durak is the only politician to have run in all the municipal elections since 1973; twice as councillor, six times as mayoral candidate, losing only once in the 1989 mayoral race. He is regarded as the doyen of Turkey's local politics. Early life Ayta√ß Durak was born in Karaisalƒ± district of Adana Province in 1938 to a middle-class merchant family. He was the second eldest of the six siblings. He completed his primary education (Grade 1-5) at Gazipa≈üa Public School, secondary education at Tepebaƒü Middle School (Grade 6-8) and at Adana Lycee for Boys (Grade 9-11). He studied Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University from 1957 to 1963. Career He started his career in 1963 at State Hydraulic Works(DSƒ∞) as Drinking Water Chief of Adana. In 1965, he was appointed as YSE (Road-Water-Electric Agency now called Rural Services) Director for Adana Province. At the mean time, he became the member of Adana Chamber of Commerce. He completed compulsory military service at Ankara-Mamak War Institute and Military Research and Development Agency. Later in his life, he founded a construction company (Durak ƒ∞n≈üaat) with his 2 civil engineer brothers and, during the 1970s and early 1980s, he built over 2000 homes. Adana Municipal Councillor  In 1963, after starting his career at DSƒ∞, he was appointed as Adana municipal councillor representing DSƒ∞. After two terms as appointed Municipal Councillor, in 1973 municipal elections, he ran from Justice Party and elected as municipal councillor. In 1977 he was re-elected and also acted as the speaker of the Justice Party at the council. He served two terms as elected councillor and removed from the council by coup d'√©tat on September 12, 1980 with all the other politicians in Turkey. Municipal democracy was suspended until 1984. During the years that he was at the council, he formed the ideas that will later revolutionize the cityscape; expanding city to north and revitalizing Seyhan River and building large recreational areas around it. Mayor of Adana At the municipal elections on March 25, 1984, he was elected Mayor of Adana representing Motherland Party(ANAP). During his first term as mayor, he expanded city to north by planning a modern residential district to house 200 thousand residents. He named this district as Yeni Adana (New Adana). He constructed Adnan Menderes Boulevard along the south shores of Seyhan Reservoir and built parks, picnic areas around it. Adnan Menderes Boulevard then became the main recreational area for the city. He built Reg√ºlat√∂r K√∂pr√º on Seyhan river south of the old town, a bridge which also acts as a regulator of river water. This caused the part of the river, that is within the city limits, to be full all year around. The river which used to partially dry and have odour in summer times, revitalized and became the core recreational area of the city. During this term, he also founded municipal- owned not-for-profit construction company which built thousands of homes for low-income residents. Although having a successful term, at the municipal elections of 1989, he lost his post to Selahattin √áolak. This was due to the partisan municipal election system in Turkey. His party ANAP was the governing party, but became very unpopular during this time. To protest the governing party, voters chose opposition parties' candidates during the municipal elections without considering candidates' individual skills. At the municipal elections of March 27, 1994 he was re-elected as mayor of Adana again representing ANAP, this time voters focusing on candidates' skills by comparing his term to Selahattin √áolak's term. At this term, he started building recreational pathways on both banks of Seyhan river from south end to Seyhan Reservoir. He gave special attention to Dilberler Sekisi, most scenic part of the recreational pathway between the old and the new dam. He renovated Atat√ºrk Park and many other parks, built new recreational areas on the northern section of the city. He continued building infrastructure to expand city to north. The construction of Adana Metro, 13.5 km long rapid transit system, started in 1997. He was re-elected to the office in 1999 representing ANAP for the third term. At this term he started the construction of Merkez Park, a 33-hectare urban park along Seyhan river, which is now one of the largest urban parks in Turkey. At this period, he also started building public pools for safe swimming mostly at low-income neighborhoods due the fact that nearly 100 children suffocate every year when chilling out at Seyhan river and irrigation canals during the hot and humid summers. Currently city boasts 35 municipal swimming pools built only within the last 10 years. Before the municipal elections of 2004, he resigned from ANAP and joined Justice and Development Party(AK Party). ANAP had only 5.1% of the popular votes in 2002 General Elections and became a minor party after. On March 28, 2004 he was re- elected as mayor of Adana for the fourth term receiving 39% of popular votes. During this period, he completed the construction of Merkez Park and many other parks, thus, city became much greener. The construction of Adana Metro was suspended during this period due to financial reasons. Construction resumed in 2008 and expected to be completed by the end of 2009. Metro that is under construction for 12 years is the major headache for Ayta√ß Durak. In late 2008, AK Party decided not to make Ayta√ß Durak their candidate for 2009 municipal elections. Following immediately, Durak resigned from AK Party and joined Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). This election was one of his most difficult elections and although being a candidate of the third popular party, his high profile helped him win the elections with only 1,500 vote margin against governing AK Party candidate. For his 5th term, Durak promised to complete urban redevelopment projects for Sinanpa≈üa, G√∂l and Fatih neighborhoods, and building the second line for Metro which will extend from Sinanpa≈üa to √áukurova University. On March 17, 2010 Ayta√ß Durak resigned from MHP until being cleared from allegations for fortune building by raising the land value of his family property. On March 28, Ayta√ß Durak is suspended from mayoral duties by Ministry of Internal Affairs for two months. President of Municipalities Union of Turkey (TBB) In 1987, he was elected the president of TBB, an agency to build co-operation among municipalities. He left this position in 1989, due to not being re-elected as mayor of Adana. After his election as Adana mayor in 1994, he was elected again as the president of the Union of Municipalities of Turkey. He held the title until April'09, when he was removed from the post by Ministry of Internal Affairs. Durak and his party MHP protested removal, stating that presidency ends naturally at Union's Directors' Elections by not being re-elected. During his presidency of TBB, he went to court for the unequal municipal taxation law. With the old municipal tax law, the corporates used to pay municipal taxes at the location of their headquarters which are mainly in Istanbul and Ankara. This caused lack of revenue for other cities. The court found municipal taxation system was not fair and the parliament changed the law, which made a better distribution of municipal revenue among cities. One of his major concerns as TBB president was the partisan municipal election system. He criticized the current system for creating dependency to national politics. Almost all the time, mayor of a municipality is chosen among the candidates of the national parties. Independent candidacy is possible, but very difficult to succeed; the only independent winner of a city in 2009 was E≈üref Fakƒ±baba of ≈ûanlƒ±urfa. Before 2009 elections, Durak lobbied at the national level for change in the municipal election system. He proposed an election system where all the candidates have to run independently without representing any political party; a system that is used in many western countries. President of √áukurova Municipalities Union (√áBB) √áukurova, a geographical, economical and cultural region, is separated with high mountains from other regions and resembles more like a state of its own. Although, the economical and cultural issues that communities in √áukurova face are similar, interrelations among the communities were poor. Durak with other mayors of the region wanted to improve co-operation among the communities of √áukurova. √áukurova Municipalities Union was incorporated in 1997 to be a voice of the local governments in the region. Durak was elected the first president of √áBB. Ayta√ß Durak focused on improving the municipal governing skills of all the municipal staff in √áukurova. Regular internal education seminars are held throughout the region. Organized with the support of the municipalities, region-wide cultural events became common. √áukurova Art Days is a four-day festival that takes place throughout √áukurova since 2007. After 12 years as the president of √áBB, Durak did not run again in the 2009 General Assembly. Mayor of Mersin, Macit √ñzcan, is elected the second president of √áBB. Personal life He is married to T√ºrkan Durak and has two children. His son, G√∂khan Durak, who is also a Civil Engineer, runs a local television (√áukurova TV) in Adana. His daughter has a degree in Landscape Architecture. Durak likes spending his summer leisure times with his grand children at his cottage in Kƒ±zƒ±ldaƒü plateau of Karaisalƒ±. He regularly goes to 5 Ocak Stadium to watch the football games of Adanaspor and Adana Demirspor. He frequently attends theaters and music concerts. Ayta√ß Durak is famed in Turkey, for avoiding kissing men when greeting. In greeting traditions of Turkey, men shake hands and kiss each other on both cheeks. During the long greeting ceremonies of political parties, Durak considers kissing each member unhealthy and time consuming. He prefers to just shake hands.

the Normandy region of northern France. Located approximately north of Le Molay-Littry, the United States Army Air Force established a temporary airfield after D-Day on 21 June 1944, shortly after the Allied landings in France The airfield was one of the first established in the liberated area of Normandy, constructed by the IX Engineering Command, 834th Engineer Aviation Battalion. History Known as Advanced Landing Ground \\"A-9\\", the airfield consisted of a single Square-Mesh Track runway. Tents were used for billeting and for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting.IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout The 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Group based F-4/P-38 Lightnings and F6/P-51 Mustang photo-reconnaissance aircraft at Le Molay from July though August 1944. The units based on A-9 were all reconnaissance units and this for two likely reasons. First the use of cameras, loading and retrieval of films and finally demanded their development know-how and equipment that were there, A 9 is a deposit. In addition, the 17th Signal Operation Battalion (communications and photographic service) had taken up residence on July 1 and must spend the photos taken by the Signal Service. Also the fact that pictures taken to be operated quickly, the nearby headquarters of Montgomery assiduously frequented (too much for his taste) U.S. generals allowed an almost instantaneous operation of clich√©s. Finally the 67th TRG (Tactical Reconnaissance Group) was already based at Air Depot at Membury before his departure for France and A 9. The first aircraft arrived on July 2 but some confusion seemed to reign in first 15 days as before, Brereton and his General Staff had decided to redeploy a total overhaul and reconnaissance units of paramount importance in the preparation and conduct Overlord then in the course of the Battle of Normandy then, their role is to look around the weaknesses of the enemy. After the Americans moved east into Central France with the advancing Allied Armies, the airfield was used for resupply and casualty evacuation by IX Air Force Service Command. It was re-designated Advanced Landing Ground A-9D, and became the Le Molay Air Depot, becoming the home of the 16th Air Depot Group. Le Molay became the home of a vast store of spare parts, and also a workshop for heavy repairs or aircraft. There were also general stores as well as providing aviation ground troops. Food and consumables, tools, fuel for land vehicles, machinery and engineering equipment service centers require as much as there were specialties. After the Americans and British moved east into Central France with the advancing Allied Armies, the airfield was left un-garrisoned and used for resupply and casualty evacuation. It was closed on 5 October 1944 and the land returned to agricultural use.Johnson, David C.

Poland (Application no. 5410/03) was a case decided by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in 2007. A pregnant woman from Poland, diagnosed with a severe eye disease, tried to get an abortion to avoid an escalation of her disease. Her requests were rejected by several medical doctors and she underwent labor of her third child. Her condition later deteriorated, and she sued one of the doctors. Her criminal lawsuits were rejected in Poland and the case was appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, which accepted one part of the complaint, and the plaintiff was awarded damages. Background Alicja TysiƒÖc Ms. A. TysiƒÖc suffered from severe myopia. During her third pregnancy in 2000, she was examined by three ophthalmologists. All of them concluded that, due to pathological changes in her retina, the pregnancy and delivery constituted a risk to her eyesight. However, they refused to issue a certificate for the pregnancy to be terminated, despite TysiƒÖc's requests, saying that the risk of the retina detaching itself due to the strain caused by giving birth could be avoided if Mrs. TysiƒÖc delivered through cesarean section. Subsequently, Ms. TysiƒÖc sought further medical advice. A general practitioner (GP) issued a certificate stating that the third pregnancy constituted a threat to Ms. TysiƒÖc's health as there was a risk of rupture of the uterus, given her two previous deliveries by caesarean section. She further referred to Ms. TysiƒÖc's short-sightedness and to significant pathological changes in her retina. These considerations, according to the GP, also required that Ms. TysiƒÖc should avoid physical strain which in any case would hardly be possible as at that time the applicant was raising two small children on her own. Ms. TysiƒÖc understood that on the basis of this certificate she would be able to terminate her pregnancy lawfully. Subsequently, Ms. TysiƒÖc contacted a state hospital, the Clinic of Gynaecology and Obstetrics in Warsaw, in the area to which she was assigned on the basis of her residence, with a view to obtaining the termination of her pregnancy. On 26 April 2000 she had an appointment with dr Romuald Dƒôbski, head of the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Department of the Clinic.https://wiadomosci.wp.pl/prof-romuald-debski-uratowalem-dziecko-alicji- tysiac-6031558758273665a Dƒôbski examined her, but did not examine her ophthalmological records. Afterwards, he made a note on the back of the certificate issued by the GP that neither her short-sightedness nor her two previous deliveries by caesarean section constituted grounds for therapeutic termination of the pregnancy. He was of the view that, in these circumstances, the applicant should give birth by caesarean section. As a result, Ms. TysiƒÖc's pregnancy was not terminated. She delivered the child by caesarean section in November 2000. Some time after the delivery, her eyesight deteriorated. On 11 January 2001 the social welfare centre issued a certificate to the effect that she was unable to take care of her children as she could not see from a distance of more than 1.5 metres. Ms. TysiƒÖc lodged a criminal complaint against Romuald Dƒôbski, stating that he had prevented her from having her pregnancy terminated on medical grounds as recommended by the GP and permissible as one of the exceptions to a general ban on abortion. She complained that, following the pregnancy and delivery, she had sustained severe bodily harm by way of almost complete loss of her eyesight. The investigation of the applicant's complaint was carried out by the Warsaw- ≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie District Prosecutor. The prosecutor heard evidence from the ophthalmologists who had examined the applicant during her pregnancy. They stated that she could have had a safe delivery by caesarean section. The prosecutor further requested the preparation of an expert report by a panel of three medical experts (ophthalmologist, gynaecologist and specialist in forensic medicine) from the Bia≈Çystok Medical Academy. According to the report, the applicant's pregnancies and deliveries had not affected the deterioration of her eyesight. Given the serious nature of the applicant's sight impairment, the risk of retinal detachment had always been present and continued to exist, and the pregnancy and delivery had not contributed to increasing that risk. Furthermore, the experts found that in the applicant's case there had been no factors militating against the applicant's carrying her baby to term and delivering it. The criminal investigation against Dƒôbski was therefore discontinued. Judgment By 6 votes to 1, the court held that there was a violation of Article 8 ECHR (right to private life), as \\"it is not the Court's task in the present case to examine whether the Convention guarantees a right to have an abortion\\" and \\"it has not been demonstrated that Polish law as applied to the applicant's case contained any effective mechanisms capable of determining whether the conditions for obtaining a lawful abortion had been met in her case.... the provisions of the civil law on tort as applied by the Polish courts did not afford the applicant a procedural instrument by which she could have vindicated her right to respect for her private life. The civil law remedy was solely of a retroactive and compensatory character. It could only, and if the applicant had been successful, have resulted in the courts granting damages to cover the irreparable damage to her health which had come to light after the delivery.... Crucially, the examination of the circumstances of the case in the context of criminal investigations could not have prevented the damage to the applicant's health from arising. The same applies to disciplinary proceedings before the organs of the Chamber of Physicians.\\" The court also ruled that there was no violation of Article 3 (no torture, inhuman or degrading treatment).

The department is part of the Executive branch of the government and reports to the Governor of Maryland. The Maryland Department of Planning works with State and local government agencies to ensure comprehensive and integrated planning for the best use of Maryland's land and other resources. To local governments, the Department provides technical expertise, such as surveys, land use studies, and urban renewal plans. Also, the Department compiles data on the State for use in planning, including congressional redistricting. Implementing State planning and smart growth policies also is the responsibility of the Department of Planning.  Background  The history of State land use planning in Maryland goes back further than that of most states in the U.S. Although Maryland is 42nd among the 50 states in size (9,843.62 sq. miles),MARYLAND AT A GLANCE; Maryland Manual On-Line, Copyright July 16, 2004 Maryland State Archives it is 19th in population (5,633,597)United States ‚Äì States, GCT-T1-R.

The issues of uncontrolled growth, premature rural subdivision, loss of productive soils, strip growth, loss of forest land, loss of Bay fisheries, loss of public Bay access, the need to plan for infrastructure and other capital improvements and the need to acquire forest land and set goals for agricultural land preservation have been troubling state planning officials since the late 1930s! This according to the report of the State Planning Commission, entitled Five Years of State Planning, published in 1938. The Department of Planning started out as the State Planning Commission in 1933, the first of its kind in the U.S. The commission was created to coordinate Depression-era public works programs of the National Resources Planning Board and the Works Projects Administration (WPA). Governor Albert C. Ritchie appointed the first five members. Dr. Abel Wolman served as chairman, with other members from the State Department of Health, Board of State Aid and Charities, State Roads Commission, and one member at-large.  History  The Maryland Department of Planning began in 1933 as the State Planning Commission. When the State Planning Department formed in 1959, the Commission became part of the new department. In 1969, the Department reorganized as the Maryland Department of State Planning. The Department was restructured in 1989 to become the Maryland Office of Planning (Chapter 540, Acts of 1989). Effective July 1, 2000, the Maryland Office of Planning was renamed the Maryland Department of Planning and became a cabinet- level agency. The Department is the principal staff agency for land use planning matters concerned with the resources and development of the State. In July 2005, the Division of Historical and Cultural Programs(DHCP) transferred to the Department of Planning from the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD). The transfer of DHCP to MDP added the Maryland Historical Trust (Maryland's State Historic Preservation Office, or SHPO), the Jefferson Patterson Park and Museum and the Banneker-Douglass Museum (preserving Maryland's African American heritage). The Banneker-Douglass Museum was transferred to the Governor's Office of Community Initiatives in 2007. In 2007, the Department organized to oversee three main functions: Communications and Intergovernmental Affairs; Planning Services; and Historical and Cultural Programs.

In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting.IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout Construction of the airfield began on the morning of June 8, when an advanced element stronger than fifty men began work at about 10:00 a.m. After a day of hard work almost in the heart of the fighting during which the battalion will lose 7 men, the runway was almost ready. The presence of snipers and enemy aircraft at night prohibit night work. First the land is put to the standard R & R (refueling and rearming). In this configuration, it ended 14 June Nevertheless, from the June 10, 3 spitfires a Polish squadron of the 2nd Tactical Air Force British had already laid on the ground. The first American plane landed there on 11 the same day, 5 Waco gliders filled with ammunition and reinforcements to the 82nd Airborne also present there. The next day a drop of more than 20 tons of ammunition occurs above the airfield. The rest of the battalion joined the media company on 11 and 12 June. It was declared operational on 14 June, 8 days after D-Day, and served as the first airfield on the beachhead. The fighter planes flew support missions during the Allied invasion of Normandy, patrolling roads in front of the beachhead, strafing German military vehicles and dropping bombs on gun emplacements, anti-aircraft artillery and concentrations of German troops in Normandy and Brittany when spotted. After the Americans moved east into Central France with the advancing Allied Armies, the airfield was left un-garrisoned and used for resupply and casualty evacuation.

The journal was discovered after his death, with a covering letter to his literary executor, \\"a sort of White Book concerning my negotiations with myself - and with God.\\" After the original Swedish version was published in 1963, the English translation came out in 1964, The translation was done by noted Swedish scholar Leif Sj√∂berg, and was refined by the poet W. H. Auden, who also wrote a foreword. This brought the book immediate literary notice, and even a front- page rave in The New York Times Book Review. It is highly regarded as a classic of contemporary spiritual literature.  Personal significance  Dag Hammarskj√∂ld, author of MarkingsA collection of his diary reflections, the book starts in 1925, when he was 20 years old, and ends at his death in 1961. The typewritten manuscript was found in the bedside table of his New York apartment after Hammarskj√∂ld's death in the Congo. As van Dusen writes: \\"His last night had been spent in the residency of Sture Linner (sv), head of the United Nations mission to the Congo. He left there the copy of the German original of Ich und Du (I and Thou) presented to him by Martin Buber and the first dozen pages of his translation into Swedish...Beside the bed was the cherished copy of Thomas a Kempis' The Imitation of Christ which was always on the table of his New York City apartment next to his bed where the manuscript of Markings was found.\\"Henry P Van Dusen. Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. A Biographical Interpretation of Markings Faber and Faber London 1967 p 169 Many of the entries in Markings describe Hammarskj√∂ld's struggles to view his professional duty as a spiritual responsibility. The entry on June 11, 1961, for example, reads: \\"Summoned/To carry it,/Aloned/To assay it,/Chosen/To suffer it,/And free/To deny it,/I saw/For one moment/The sail/In the sun-storm,/Far off/On a wave-crest,/Alone,/Bearing from land./For one moment/I saw.\\"Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. Markings Leif Sj√∂berg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p175 Hammarskj√∂ld died in a plane crash in Zambia, near midnight, on September 17‚Äì18, 1961. The last entry of Markings is dated 24 August 1961: \\"Is it a new country/In another world of reality/Than Day's?/Or did I live there/Before Day was?/ I awoke/To an ordinary morning with grey light/Reflected from the street,/But still remembered/The dark-blue night/Above the tree line,/The open moor in moonlight,/The crest in shadow,/Remembered other dreams/Of the same mountain country:/Twice I stood on its summits,/I stayed by its remotest lake,/And followed the river/Towards its source./The seasons have changed/And the light/And the weather/And the hour./But it is the same land./And I begin to know the map/And to get my bearings.\\"Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. Markings Leif Sj√∂berg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 181  Spiritual significance  Markings was described by the late theologian Henry P. Van Dusen as \\"the noblest self-disclosure of spiritual struggle and triumph, perhaps the greatest testament of personal faith written ... in the heat of professional life and amidst the most exacting responsibilities for world peace and order.\\"Henry P Van Dusen. Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. A Biographical Interpretation of Markings Faber and Faber London 1967 p 5 He notes that \\"among the approximately six hundred 'Road Marks' staked down along the \\"Way' of Dag Hammarskj√∂ld's pilgrimage, almost exactly a hundred are concerned in greater or lesser measure with God.\\"Henry P Van Dusen. Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. A Biographical Interpretation of Markings Faber and Faber London 1967 p200 Hammarskj√∂ld writes, for example, \\"We are not permitted to choose the frame of our destiny. But what we put into it is ours. He who wills adventure will experience it‚Äîaccording to the measure of his courage. He who wills sacrifice will be sacrificed‚Äîaccording to the measure of his purity of heart.\\" Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. Markings Leif Sj√∂berg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 63. The entry of 4 August 1959 reads: \\"To have humility is to experience reality, not in relation to ourselves, but in its sacred independence. It is to see, judge, and act from the point of rest in ourselves. Then, how much disappears, and all that remains falls into place. In the point of rest at the centre of our being, we encounter a world where all things are at rest in the same way. Then a tree becomes a mystery, a cloud, a revelation, each man a cosmos of whose riches we can only catch glimpses. The life of simplicity is simple, but it opens to us a book in which we never get beyond the first syllable.\\"Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. Markings Leif Sj√∂berg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 148  Literary significance  Markings is characterised by Hammarskj√∂ld's intermingling of prose and haiku poetry in a manner exemplified by the 17th-century Japanese poet Basho in his Narrow Roads to the Deep North.Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. Markings Leif Sj√∂berg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p149 Representative examples include: The Easter-lily's dew-wet calyx. Drops pausing Between earth and sky.Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. Markings Leif Sj√∂berg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p150 They laid the blame on him. He didn't know what it was, But he confessed it.Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. Markings Leif Sj√∂berg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 152 Trees quiver in the wind, Sailing on a sea of mist Out of earshot.Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. Markings Leif Sj√∂berg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 157 In his foreword to Markings, the English poet W. H. Auden states: \\"Markings, however, was not intended to be read simply as a work of literature. It is also an historical document of the first importance as an account‚Äîand I cannot myself recall another‚Äîof the attempt by a professional man of action to unite in one life the Via Activa and the Via Contemplativa.\\" WH Auden Foreword to Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. Markings Leif Sj√∂berg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 23 Auden quotes Hammarskj√∂ld as stating \\"In our age, the road to holiness necessarily passes through the world of action.\\"WH Auden Foreword to Dag Hammarskj√∂ld.

The Spartakiads took place at the Strahov Stadium, the largest stadium ever built and the venue of the last pre- war Sokol gathering. Most of the organisers of the Spartakiads were former Sokol officials. The first Spartakiad took place in 1955, and was subsequently held every five years. The Spartakiad scheduled for 1970 was canceled in the wake of the Prague Spring and the beginning of normalization. Preparations for the Spartakiad scheduled for 1990 were interrupted by the Velvet Revolution, but the event still took place, although on a much smaller scale than the previous ones. The Spartakiads were attended by large numbers of people; for example, at the 1960 Spartakiad about 750,000 gymnasts from the whole country took part and over 2,000,000 spectators witnessed the event. Men and women of all ages practiced their exercising routines for the event. Appearance was originally mandatory for students and servicemen of the armed forces and police.

Its drainage basin consists of approximately of Jackson County and another of Klamath County. Its two forks, the North Fork and the South Fork, both begin high in the Cascade Range near Mount McLoughlin and Brown Mountain. They both flow generally west until they meet near Lake Creek. The main stem continues west, flowing through the communities of Brownsboro, Eagle Point, and White City, before finally emptying into the Rogue River about southwest of Eagle Point. Little Butte Creek's watershed was originally settled by the Takelma, and possibly the Shasta tribes of Native Americans. In the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s, most of the Native Americans were either killed or forced onto Indian reservations. Early settlers named Little Butte Creek and nearby Big Butte Creek after their proximity to Mount McLoughlin, which was known as Snowy Butte. In the late 19th century, the watershed was primarily used for agriculture and lumber production. The city of Eagle Point was incorporated in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town within the watershed's boundaries. Large amounts of water are diverted from Little Butte Creek for irrigation, water storage, and power generation. Canal systems deliver the water to nearby Howard Prairie Lake and the Klamath River watershed, Agate Lake, and the Rogue Valley. Despite being moderately polluted, the creek is one of the best salmon-producing tributaries of the Rogue River. Coho and Chinook salmon migrate upstream each year; however, several dams hinder their progress. A fish ladder was built in 2005 to help fish swim past a dam constructed in Eagle Point in the 1880s, but was destroyed by flooding just three months later. It was rebuilt in 2008. Restoration of a artificially straightened section of the creek in the Denman Wildlife Area was completed in 2011.  Course  Little Butte Creek begins in the Cascade Range near Mount McLoughlin and Brown Mountain. It flows generally west over approximately to its confluence with the Rogue River. There are two main forks of Little Butte Creek: the North Fork and the South Fork. The South Fork's headwaters are at above sea level, while the North Fork's headwaters are considerably lower at . They meet each other at , creating the main stem itself. Little Butte Creek's mouth is at above sea level, giving the creek an overall gradient of approximately . The north fork begins at Fish Lake, near Mount McLoughlin. It flows west, collecting only minor tributaries, before merging with the south fork. The south fork's headwaters are just south of the Brown Mountain. The Pacific Crest Trail passes through this area. It flows west, receiving Beaver Dam Creek and Dead Indian Creek on the left bank. Beaver Dam Creek drains approximately , and Dead Indian Creek has a watershed of about . The Dead Indian Soda Springs are on Dead Indian Creek, about a mile south of its confluence with the south fork. The south fork then turns northwest, collecting water from Lost Creek on the left, near the Lost Creek Bridge, built in 1919. Lost Creek drains about . Lake of the Woods, near the headwaters of the south fork|alt=A parking lot with a forest-lined lake behind it, and a gentle sloping mountain in the background Just after the two forks merge about northeast of Medford, Little Butte Creek receives Lake Creek on the left bank, flowing through the community of the same name at river mile (RM) 17 or river kilometer (RK) 27. Lake Creek drains . The main stem is crossed by South Fork Little Butte Creek Road in Lake Creek. Water is diverted here into the Joint System Canal for storage in Agate Lake and to provide irrigation for the Medford region. A few miles west, the creek receives Salt Creek and Lick Creek on the right bank, which have watersheds of , respectively. Oregon Route 140 crosses the creek at RM 10 (RK 16). The creek turns southwest, flowing through Eagle Point. Four bridges span the stream in Eagle Point: East Main Street, Loto Street, and the Antelope Creek Bridge near RM 5 (RK 8), and Oregon Route 62 at RM 4 (RK 6). Near RM 3 (RK 5), Little Butte Creek receives Antelope Creek on the left. Antelope Creek is its largest tributary, draining . Agate Lake on Dry Creek is in the Antelope Creek watershed. At RM 1.5 (RK 2.4) the creek is crossed by Agate Road. It then flows into the Rogue River from its mouth at the Pacific Ocean. Little Butte Creek's mouth is in the Denman Wildlife Area, approximately southwest of Eagle Point, and about a mile southeast of Upper Table Rock.  Discharge  alt=A large stream about 15 feet (4.5 m) across, spanned by a concrete bridge (not Antelope Creek Bridge) with metal pipes underneath it. Sparse vegetation grows along the creek's banks. The United States Geological Survey monitored the flow of Little Butte Creek at seven different stream gauges: two on the south fork, three on the north fork, and two on the main stem. The first opened in 1908 at the newly constructed Fish Lake Dam on the north fork, while the last opened in 1927 near the Big Elk Ranger Station on the south fork. By 1989, all seven were closed. The data recorded by the lowermost gauges of both forks and the main stem are listed below. { |+ Discharge  Stream  Location  Drainage basin  Years recorded  Average flow  Maximum flow  Minimum flow |-  North Fork near mouth  1922‚Äì1931  (December 22, 1964) (numerous times 1922‚Äì1968) |-  South Fork near mouth  1922‚Äì1982  (May 25, 1942) (July‚ÄìAugust 1931) |-  Main stem RM 4 (RK 6.5)  1908‚Äì1950  (January 7, 1948) (June 6, 1926) |}  Watershed  alt=Forested land with a lake in the foreground and a snow-covered mountain in the background Little Butte Creek drains approximately of southern Oregon. Elevations range from at the mouth of the creek to at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of . Forest accounts for about 65 percent of the total area of the watershed, while 32 percent is farmland. The remaining three percent is within the Eagle Point city limits. Forty-eight percent of the watershed is federally owned, 50 percent is privately owned, and Eagle Point accounts for the remaining two percent. Over 10,000 people live within the watershed's boundaries. The region experiences a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures average from in the summer to in the winter. The average precipitation in the area ranges from in the lower regions to over in the upper reaches. July through October are the driest months, while December through April are the wettest. Thirty-four percent of the surface runoff in the watershed is collected from rain, 31 percent from rain on snow, and 35 percent from snowmelt. The two main geologic regions in the Little Butte Creek watershed are the High Cascades and the western Cascades. The western Cascades make up the western two thirds of the watershed, generally below in elevation. Steep, rugged canyons are common in this region. The lower stretches of the watershed contain soils such as decomposed lavas, clay, and gravel. The High Cascades compose the eastern third of the watershed, including volcanoes such as Brown Mountain and Mount McLoughlin, and lava plateaus. In some places, streams descend over . Nearby watersheds include two Rogue River tributaries‚ÄîBig Butte Creek to the north and Bear Creek to the south‚Äîand small Klamath River tributaries to the east. As of 2003, there were 581 water rights recorded in the watershed, with 394 of them related to irrigation. Four hundred sixty-six water diversions were also recorded. In the summer, many streams are over-appropriated, leading to frequent water shortages along the lower portion of the creek.  Flora and fauna  The alt=A small bird perched on a limb of a tree. It has predominantly brown feathers, with white spots on its head and back, while its chest is mostly white. Its eyes are round and yellow, and its beak is short and curved downward. The flora in the Little Butte Creek watershed is predominately temperate coniferous forest, which makes up approximately 65 percent of the total area. The lower regions are covered with chaparral, and the upper regions by fir forests. The chaparral region is inhabited by oaks such as garry oak and California black oak, with an understory of buckbrush and manzanita. Coast douglas-fir, sugar pine, ponderosa pine, California incense-cedar, and white fir are the most common trees found in the mixed coniferous forest. Shasta red fir, white fir, and the noble fir grow in the higher elevations of the watershed. Mountain hemlock, lodgepole pine, Sitka mountain-ash, and squashberry also grow in this region. Chinquapin can be found around Fish Lake. The most common species of plants above near the tree line on Mount McLoughlin and Brown Mountain include whitebark pine, mountain hemlock, Coast Range subalpine fir, heather, and mountain heather. Many species of birds have been spotted in the Little Butte Creek region. Twenty- two species are known to breed in the chaparral region, including several species of wrens, blackbirds, and sparrows. The mixed coniferous forest is home to white-headed woodpeckers, pygmy nuthatches, green-tailed towhees, northern pygmy-owls, Vaux's swifts, winter wrens, and MacGillivray's warblers. The American coot has also been spotted in several places along the creek. Williamson's sapsuckers, black-backed woodpeckers, Canada jays, and hermit warblers frequent the higher elevations. The near-threatened olive-sided flycatcher and Cassin's finch also live in this area. Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers and Clark's nutcrackers have been spotted near the tree line. The endangered Townsend's big-eared bat is known to live in the watershed. Little Butte Creek is known to be one of the best salmon producing tributaries of the Rogue River, and is also one of only a few streams in the Upper Rogue watershed to support salmon populations. The most common anadromous fish inhabiting the creek include chinook and coho salmon, and sea-run cutthroat trout. The Southern Oregon/Northern California Coast Coho Salmon Evolutionary Significant Unit is listed as threatened (2011). Coho salmon are known to spawn in of streams in the Little Butte Creek watershed. An estimated 35,131 Coho salmon lived in the creek in 2002. Resident fish include coastal cutthroat trout, sculpins, rainbow trout, and brook trout.  History  The Little Butte Creek area was originally settled by the Takelma, and possibly the Shasta tribe of Native Americans. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the Eagle Point region in 1852. Little Butte Creek was named by the early settlers for its close proximity to Mount McLoughlin (also known as Snowy Butte), as was nearby Big Butte Creek. Due to conflicts with the Rogue River Indians, Major J. A. Lupton gathered 35 men from Jacksonville on October 8, 1855, and attacked the Native Americans near the mouth of Little Butte Creek, killing about 30 of them. Lupton was also killed, and eleven of his men were injured. On December 24 of the same year, Captain Miles Alcorn discovered and attacked a Native American camp on the north fork, killing eight. On Christmas, the following day, another band of Native Americans were attacked near Little Butte Creek's mouth; some fled, while the rest were either captured or killed. By the late 1850s, the land was primarily used for agriculture and lumber in the upper regions. A sawmill was constructed on the north fork in the 1870s. In 1901, the Sunnyside Hotel was built by Alfred Howlett on the banks of the creek in Eagle Point. Eagle Point was later incorporated in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town in the watershed. In 1917, manganese ore was discovered near the confluence of South Fork Little Butte Creek and its tributary, Lost Creek. Mined nodules consisted of approximately 55 percent manganese and weighed up to . Cinnabar was also discovered in the area. In 1922, the Antelope Creek Covered Bridge was constructed on Antelope Creek. It was moved to Little Butte Creek in Eagle Point in 1987.  Diversions and dams  alt=The Cascade Canal connects Fourmile and Fish lakes in the northeast portion of the watershed. Four dams divert water from the south fork of Little Butte Creek and its tributaries through the Deadwood Tunnel to Howard Prairie Lake to the south. Two other dams from Dead Indian and Conde creeks also divert water to Howard Prairie Lake. Water from Howard Prairie Lake flows through a canal to Keene Creek Reservoir, then through the Cascade Tunnel and Greensprings Power Plant. It travels through Greensprings Tunnel and spreads out into a large system of canals in the Rogue Valley. To the north, Water from the north and south forks are diverted to Agate Lake and also to the Rogue Valley. In total, 18 canals and 21 dams are related to the Little Butte Creek watershed. Some of the water in the Little Butte Creek watershed is diverted to irrigate the Rogue Valley and to supplement Bear Creek, both roughly to the southwest. In the late 19th century, a large number of orchards were planted near Ashland. They were initially irrigated by Bear Creek; however, there was not enough water to satisfy the orchards' needs. In 1898, the Fish Lake Water Company was established to solve the problem. The company proposed the enlargement of Fourmile and Fish lakes by impounding Fourmile Creek and North Fork Little Butte Creek, respectively, and connecting them via the Cascade Canal. Construction of the temporary Fish Lake Dam began in 1902. Around this time, construction of the Joint System Canal to the west also began. Construction of Fourmile Lake Dam started in 1906, along with the Cascade Canal. A network of other small canals, such as Hopkins Canal and the Medford Canal, were also built in the Rogue Valley around this time. Fish Lake Dam was completed in 1908, creating the reservoir. The Cascade Canal was completed in 1915, delivering about of water from Fourmile Lake in the Klamath River watershed southwest to Fish Lake in the Rogue River watershed. The temporary Fish Lake Dam was also replaced by a permanent earthfill dam. It was later modified in 1922 and 1955. In 1996 an auxiliary spillway was added. The dam stands high and has a length of . In 1956, the United States Bureau of Reclamation awarded a contract to Portland, Oregon-based Lord Brothers to build the Deadwood Tunnel. The tunnel was finished in 1957. Howard Prairie Lake was completed in 1958, and is about east of Ashland. Excess water is diverted from the South Fork, Beaver Dam Creek, and two of its tributaries south into the Deadwood Tunnel to supplement the lake and the surrounding regions. Dead Indian Creek is also diverted into Howard Prairie Lake. About annually, or about , was diverted into the Klamath River watershed between 1962 and 1999. The Howard Prairie Delivery Canal was completed in 1959, along with Keene Creek Reservoir, Cascade Tunnel, and Greensprings Tunnel. Water from Howard Prairie Lake is diverted into the canal west to Keene Creek Reservoir, about east of Ashland. Nearby Hyatt Reservoir also provides water. It is then piped through the mile-long Cascade Tunnel to the Greensprings Power Plant, which generates about 18 megawatts of power. Afterward, the water is conveyed from the power plant through the Greensprings Tunnel into Emigrant Creek, a tributary of Bear Creek. An average of approximately of water flows through the tunnel. The water eventually ends up in Emigrant Lake, about southeast of Ashland, where it either continues along Bear Creek, or is diverted for irrigation.  Butte Creek Mill  The Butte Creek Mill in Eagle Point, Oregon The Butte Creek Mill, originally named Snowy Butte Mill, was built in 1872 on the banks of Little Butte Creek about from its mouth. A diversion dam was built in the 1880s to provide water for the turbine that powers the mill. The dam was a damaging fish barrier in the watershed. In 2005, the Rogue Basin Fish Access Team built a $250,000 concrete fish ladder to allow fish to swim past the dam. A small weir made of boulders was built at the base of the ladder, creating a jump between the creek and the ladder; however, the boulders were washed away in a severe storm just three months later, making the distance between them over . The weir was rebuilt in 2008 for about $122,500, with concrete instead of boulders. The mill is now included on the National Register of Historic Places, and is the only gristmill in Oregon to still grind flour. It is also the oldest water-powered gristmill west of the Mississippi River. On Christmas morning, December 25, 2015, the store had a fire and was considered a total loss. There are plans to rebuild. To assist in helping with the rebuild visit their website: buttecreekmill.com.  Restoration  Intense flooding occurred throughout the Rogue Valley in 1955, and Little Butte Creek's meanders in the Denman Wildlife Area between Eagle Point and the Rogue River were blamed for severe erosion. The section of the creek was subsequently bulldozed and straightened in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The straightness forced water downward instead of outward like a typical creek, scouring the stream bed down to bedrock and creating an unsuitable habitat for wild salmon. In 2007, a plan to divert the creek back into its old meanders was proposed. The $700,000 project involved building engineered riffles and log jams and adding boulders, extending the creek by approximately . It was completed in September 2011.  Pollution  A wild alt=Several large, thorny, purple vines with green leaves. The ground below is covered in gravel, grass, and dead leaves and vegetation. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has monitored Little Butte Creek for eight different parameters that affect water quality: temperature, oxygen saturation, pH, nutrients, bacteria, chemical contaminants such as pesticides and metals, turbidity, and alkalinity. Streams that exceed the standard level are then placed on the DEQ 303d list in accordance with the Clean Water Act. About 40 percent of the streams in the Little Butte Creek watershed were listed on the 2002 DEQ 303d list. The entire main stem exceeded the standard level for temperature, oxygen saturation, fecal coliforms (bacteria), and turbidity. The lower of the North Fork were listed for high temperature and elevated levels of E. coli, while the upper region was affected by chlorophyll a and pH levels. The South Fork was listed for turbidity and temperature. Overall, high temperature is the most common problem in the Little Butte Creek watershed. This is most likely caused by water diversion and depleted riparian zones. Approximately 53 percent of riparian zones in the watershed are damaged due to agriculture or deforestation, while 43 percent are classified as healthy. Another threat to healthy riparian zones are invasive blackberries, which crowd out native vegetation and provide little shade. The resulting higher water temperatures can be very harmful to anadromous fish. High concentration of bacteria is also an issue. In 2003, the Little Butte Creek Watershed Council rated the health of the Little Butte Creek watershed on a scale of 1 (slightly degraded) to 5 (severely degraded). Overall, the watershed received 2.95, or moderately degraded. On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, water quality scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). The average for Little Butte Creek at RM 1.4 (RK 2.3) between 1998 and 2007 was 72 (poor) in the summer and 82 (fair) in the fall, winter, and spring.  Recreation  The Little Butte Creek watershed contains several points of interest. Popular activities in and around Fish Lake include fishing, swimming, and boating. Two campgrounds are on the banks of the lake: Doe Point and the Fish Lake Resort. Several trails in the area lead to the much larger Pacific Crest Trail. Two snowparks are on Oregon Route 140. The Eagle Point Golf Course is in the watershed, built in 1995 by the world-renowned golf course architect Robert Trent Jones, Jr. Another course, Stone Ridge Golf Course, is near Agate Lake. The Butte Creek Mill and the Antelope and Lost Creek covered bridges are also popular attractions. Several historic structures can be found in Eagle Point, including the Eagle Point Museum, built in 1925 as the Long Mountain School, and the Walter Wood House, constructed in 1879. The Denman Wildlife Area is at the mouth of Little Butte Creek, as is nearby TouVelle State Park.

The Yarrow boiler design is characteristic of the three-drum boiler: two banks of straight water-tubes are arranged in a triangular row with a single furnace between them. A single steam drum is mounted at the top between them, with smaller water drums at the base of each bank. Circulation, both upwards and downwards, occurs within this same tube bank. The Yarrow's distinctive features were the use of straight tubes and also circulation in both directions taking place entirely within the tube bank, rather than using external downcomers.  Early watertube boilers  Early use of the water-tube boiler within the Royal Navy was controversial at times, giving rise to the 'Battle of the Boilers' around 1900. These first boilers, such as the Belleville and Niclausse, were large-tube designs, with simple straight tubes of around 4\\" diameter, at a shallow angle to the horizontal. These tubes were jointed into cast iron headers and gave much trouble with leakage at these joints. At the time, an assumption was that thermal expansion in these straight tubes was straining the joints. These boilers were also large, and although fitted to many pre-dreadnought battleships, could not be fitted to the small torpedo boats and the early destroyers then under very active development. To provide a lighter boiler for smaller vessels, the 'Express' types were developed. These used smaller water- tubes of around 2\\" diameter, giving a greater ratio of heating area to volume (and weight). Most of these were of the three-drum pattern, particularly of the Du Temple and Normand designs. This gave a more vertical arrangement of the water-tubes, thus encouraging thermosyphon circulation in these narrow tubes. The previous problems of tube expansion were still a theoretical concern and so the tubes were either curved, or even convoluted into hairpins and S shapes, so as to increase heating area. In practice these shapes gave rise to two more practical problems: difficulty in cleaning the tubes and also difficulty in forming a reliable joint into the water drums, particularly where tubes entered the drum at a variety of angles.  Yarrow's water-tube boiler  right Alfred Yarrow developed his boiler as a response to others that had already developed water-tube boilers. This was a long process based on theoretical experiment rather than evolution of practical boilers. Work began in 1877 and the first commercial boiler was not supplied until 10 years later, a torpedo boat of 1887.Yarrows, The First Hundred Years, pp. 36-37 Despite this long gestation, the boiler's origins appear to have been most direct. Yarrow's initial conversation with William Crush, head of the boiler department, is recorded to have included a rather direct approach and Yarrow's statements, \\"We must wake-up about water-tube boilers\\", \\"Why not a boiler like this?\\" (placing his fingers together as if praying), and \\"Straight tubes?\\" already expressed two of the boiler's three basic design principles.  Straight tubes  Early water-tube designers had been concerned with the expansion of the boiler's tubes when heated. Efforts were made to permit them to expand freely, particularly so that those closest to the furnace might expand relatively more than those further away. Typically this was done by arranging the tubes in large looping curves, as for the Thornycroft boiler. These had difficulties in manufacturing and required support in use. Yarrow recognised that the temperature of a water-filled tube was held relatively low and was consistent amongst them, provided that they remained full of water and boiling was not allowed to occur within the tubes themselves. High temperatures and variations only arose when tubes became steam filled, which also disrupted circulation. His conclusion was thus that straight water-tubes were acceptable, and had obvious advantages for manufacture and cleaning in service. Obtaining tubes capable of withstanding the increasing boiler pressures was difficult and most makers had already experienced problems with the welds in the tubes. A less obvious benefit of straight tubes was that they could make use of the newly developed seamless-drawn tubes now being produced for bicycle manufacture.  Yarrow's circulation experiments  Yarrow's U-tube circulation experiment Cleaning a Yarrow boiler It was already recognised that a water-tube boiler relied on a continuous flow through the water-tubes, and that this must be by a thermosyphon effect rather than impractically requiring a pump. The heated water-tubes were a large number of small diameter tubes mounted between large drums: the water drums below and steam drums above. Fairbairn's studies had already showed the importance of tube diameter and how small diameter tubes could easily withstand far higher pressures than large diameters. The drums could withstand the pressure by virtue of their robust construction. Manholes fitted to them allowed regular internal inspection. The assumption was that flow through the water-tubes would be upwards, owing to their heating by the furnace, and that the counterbalancing downward flow would require external unheated downcomers. In most water-tube designs these were a few large-diameter external pipes from the steam drum to the water drum. These large-diameter pipes were thus a problem for reliability owing to their rigidity and the forces upon them. Alfred Yarrow conducted a famous experiment where he disproved this assumption.Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol VI, pp. ????Yarrows, First Hundred Years, pp. Sources are unclear as to whether he discovered this during the experiment, or conducted the experiment merely to demonstrate a theory that he already held. A vertical U-shaped tube was arranged so that it could be heated by a series of Bunsen burners on each side. A simple flow meter indicated the direction and approximate strength of any flow through the tank at the top linking the two arms of the U. When only one side of the U was heated, there was the expected upward flow of heated water in that arm of the tube. When heat was also applied to the unheated arm, conventional theory predicted that the circulatory flow would slow or stop completely. In practice, the flow actually increased. Provided that there was some asymmetry to the heating, Yarrow's experiment showed that circulation could continue and heating of the cooler downcomer could even increase this flow. Yarrow then repeated the experiment, first with the U-tube at a shallow angle to the horizontal, finally with the entire system under pressure. The results were the same and circulation was maintained. The Yarrow boiler could thus dispense with separate external downcomers. Flow was entirely within the heated watertubes, upwards within those closest to the furnace and downwards through those in the outer rows of the bank.  Description  End half-section of a boiler, showing the enclosing furnace and flue Yarrow's production boiler had a simple and distinctive design that remained broadly unchanged afterwards. Three drums were arranged in a triangular formation: a single large steam drum at the top and two smaller water drums below. They were linked by straight watertubes in a multi-row bank to each water drum. The furnace was placed in the space between the tube banks. Early boilers were manually coal fired, later oil fired. The boiler was enclosed in a sealed casing of steel, lined with firebricks. Brick-lined end walls to this casing housed the firedoors or oil burner quarls, but had no heating surface. The uptake flue from the boiler was in the centre top of the casing, the exhaust gases passing around the steam drum. To reduce corrosion from flue gases over the drum, it was sometimes wrapped in a simple deflector shroud. Usually the lower part of the water drums were exposed outside the casing, but only the ends of the steam drum emerged. The water level was at around one-third of the steam drum diameter, enough to cover the ends of the submerged water-tubes. The weight of the boiler rested on the water drums, and thus on supports from the firing flat's deck. The steam drum was only supported by the watertubes and was allowed to move freely, with thermal expansion. If superheated, the superheater elements were hung from this drum. Compared to the earlier Scotch and locomotive boilers, water-tube boilers with their reduced water volumes were considered lightweight and didn't require extensive supports.  Later evolution in design   Water drums  Early Yarrow boiler, showing the D-shaped water troughs The first Yarrow water drums or \\"troughs\\" were D-shaped with a flat tubeplate, so as to provide an easy mounting for the tubes. The tubeplate was bolted to the trough and could be dismantled for maintenance and tube cleaning. This D shape is not ideal for a pressure drum though, as pressure will tend to distort it into a more circular section. Experience of boiler explosions had shown that sharp internal corners inside boilers were also prone to erosion by grooving. Later boilers used a more rounded section, despite the difficulty of inserting and sealing the tube ends when they were no longer perpendicular. These later drums had a manhole in the ends for access.  Downcomers  The circulation in a Yarrow boiler depended on a temperature difference between the inner and outer tube rows of a bank, and particularly upon the rates of boiling. Whilst this is easy to maintain at low powers, a higher pressure Yarrow boiler will tend to have less temperature difference and thus will have less effective circulation. This effect can be counteracted by providing external downcomers, outside the heated flue area. Although most Yarrow boilers did not require downcomers, some were fitted with them.  Double-ended boilers  The first double-ended boiler was built in 1905 for the Spanish government. The design was already well-suited to being fired from both ends and it was discovered that double-ended boilers were slightly more efficient in use. Yarrow's shipyard was always restricted in the size of ships that it could build. Many of their boilers were intended for larger warships and Yarrow supplied these as components to the building yards with larger slipways.  Superheaters  Asymmetric 'double-flow' Yarrow boiler, with superheater Early Yarrow boilers were not superheated, but with the introduction of steam turbines, there was a demand for increasingly higher steam temperatures.  Asymmetric boilers  The Yarrow superheater consisted of hairpin tubes, parallel to the existing steam generator tubes. One bank of the generator tubes was separated in two, with individual lower water drums for them. The superheater was placed in the gap formed between these, with both ends of its tubes connected to a single superheater header drum, and an internal baffle to separate wet and dry steam.Milton, Marine Steam Boilers, pp. 109-111 A secondary effect of the superheater was to increase the temperature differential between inner and outer tubes of the bank, thus encouraging circulation. The two water drums were often linked by unheated downcomers, to allow this flow between the drums. This effect was later encouraged in the Admiralty boiler, where the tubes of a bank were curved apart to leave space for a superheater, whilst retaining the single water drum.  Controlled flow  Only a single superheater was ever installed, on just one side of the boiler. The simplest, and smallest, boilers moved their exhaust flue to this side, passing all of the exhaust through the bank with the superheater. The now-asymmetric boiler could pass all of its exhaust gas through the superheated side as the single flow type. The other bank remained in use for purely radiative heating, often with fewer rows of tubes. Alternatively the 'double flow' boiler retained full gas flow through both sides, although only one of these contained a superheater. A controllable baffle on the non-superheated side could be closed to increase flow through the superheater. These boilers usually incorporated additional feedwater heaters in the updraught above these baffles.  Admiralty three-drum boiler  A later development from the Yarrow was the Admiralty three-drum boiler, developed for the Royal Navy between the wars. This was broadly similar to later, high-pressure and oil-fired, versions of the Yarrow. The waterdrums were cylindrical and downcomers were sometimes, but not always, used. The only major difference was in the tube banks. Rather than straight tubes, each tube was mostly straight, but cranked towards their ends. These were installed in two groups within the bank, so that they formed a gap between them within the bank. Superheaters were placed inside this gap. The advantage of placing the superheaters here was that they increased the temperature differential between the inner and outer tubes of the bank, thus encouraging circulation.  Marine use  Triple group of boilers for a Chilean battleship , a Havock class destroyer. , the lead ship of the class, was built with the then current form of locomotive boiler, Hornet with a Yarrow boiler for comparison. The first Yarrow boilers were intended for small destroyers and filled the entire width of the hull. In the early classes, three boilers were used arranged in tandem, each with a separate funnel. The later sets supplied for capital ships used multiple boilers and these were often grouped into sets of three, sharing an uptake.  Land-based boilers  In 1922, Harold Yarrow decided to exploit the increasing boom for electricity generation as a market for Yarrows to build land-based boilers. Yarrows, First Hundred Years, pp. 58-65 The first boilers, at Dunston Power Station and Brighton, were of the same marine pattern. As for their naval success, they were recognised for having a large radiant heating area and being quick to raise steam. Large land-based turbines required high efficiency and increased superheat, so the marine pattern was revised to the distinctive land-based Yarrow boiler. This became asymmetrical. One wing was enlarged and received most of the gas flow. The inner tube banks remained and received radiant heat from the furnace, but the gases then flowed through one of them, over a superheater bank, then through an additional third bank to increase the heat extracted. Working pressures also increased. From a working pressure of 575 psi in 1927, by 1929 an experimental boiler was operated at 1,200 psi.  Engine 10000  Only one \\"Yarrow\\" boiler was used in a railway locomotive, Nigel Gresley's experimental Engine 10000 of 1924 for the LNER company. Having observed the benefits of higher pressures and compound engines in marine practice, Gresley was keen to experiment with this approach in a railway locomotive. As with the land-based boilers, Harold Yarrow was keen to expand the market for Yarrow's boiler. The boiler was not the usual Yarrow design. In operation, particularly its circulation paths, the boiler had more in common with other three-drum designs such as the Woolnough. It has also been described as an evolution of the Brotan-Deffner water-tube firebox, with the firebox extended to become the entire boiler.

It is well known for its varied wildlife, particularly deer and birds. Wolves were historically a common feature of the forest, the last recorded capture being in 1882. The Lothar Storm hit the forest on 26 December 1999, with recorded gusts reaching 166 km/h.Report into Wind Damage of Lothar Storm This devastated 838 hectares, felling 180,000 m3 of woodland (approximately 40% deciduous and 60% coniferous trees).

The 2nd French Armoured Division had landed at Utah Beach in Normandy on 1 August 1944, about two months after the D-Day landings, and served under General Patton's Third Army. Following the recapture of Alen√ßon on 12 August 1944, the Division, led by General Leclerc, proceeded north towards Argentan. The armoured column entered the forest by the south in order to tackle the 9th Panzer Division, which was hidden in the forest. In Le Gateys, on the only road, a Sherman tank was hit by a German anti tank missile, resulting in the death of Colonel R√©my's eighteen-year-old son, Roger. At La Croix de Medavy, Sherman and Panzers clashed but the French were reinforced by the Putz armoured column which had recently set out from S√©es.

A keen pianist, he also co-founded the St Petersburg Conservatory with Anton Rubinstein.  Bolshevik revolutionary  When the RSDRP split into Bolshevik and Menshevik factions in 1903, Stasova cast her lot with Lenin and the Bolsheviks as a professional revolutionary. Over the next two years Stasova adopted the pseudonyms \\"Absolute\\" and \\"Thick\\". N.K. Krupskaya, Reminiscences of Lenin. Bernard Isaacs, trans. New York: International Publishers, 1970; pg. 77. Other pseudonyms which Stasova used during the underground period included \\"Delta,\\" \\"Heron,\\" \\"Knol,\\" and \\"Varvara Ivanovna.\\"Reference Index to V.I. Lenin Collected Works: Part One: Index of Works, Name Index. Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1978; pg. 312. She served as the conduit for Lenin's newspaper, Iskra, in St. Petersburg, until her arrest in January 1904, which forced her to leave the capital and hide in Minsk. For the rest of that year she traveled to several cities, acting as a specialist in 'technical matters', such as creating false passports, organising escape routes, and making contact with sympathisers in the Russian army. She also taught new members how to encode and decode.Branko Lazitch and Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pg. 444. In spring 1904, Stasova was appointed secretary of the Northern Bureau of the Bolshevik Central Committee. In June, she was assigned to take over the Southern Bureau, based in Odessa, but was arrested and held in Taganka Prison for six months. She was released on bail in December 1904, and returned to St Petersburg, where she took over as secretary of the city Bolshevik organisation, and later as secretary of the Central Committee. Stasova emigrated to Geneva, Switzerland in August 1905, to run the Bolshevik organisation abroad while Lenin was in Russia for the Russian Revolution of 1905. She returned to St Petersburg in January 1906 and then moved to Finland to organise arms smuggling, and to assist in organising the Congress in Stockholm that was supposed to unify the Bolshevik and Menshevik factions of the RSDRP. Arrested in July 1906, after her return to St Petersburg, she was banned for the second time from living in the capital. In 1907, she settled in Tiflis (now Tbilisi), the capital of Georgia. In January 1912, Stasova was elected as an alternate member of the Bolshevik party's Central Committee. She was then secretary to the party's Russian bureau.Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 205 Arrested on her return to Tiflis, in May 1912, she was tried in May 1913, with Suren Spandaryan and others, and sentenced to deportation to Siberia. She was allowed to return to St Petersburg in autumn 1916, and was arrested there and held in a police station overnight in February 1917, but released in the morning because of the outbreak of the February Revolution. Political career After the February Revolution of 1917, Stasova was named a secretary of the Central Committee ‚Äî a position which she retained through the October Revolution, finally standing down in March 1920. She was also returned as an alternate member of the Bolshevik Central Committee by the 6th Congress of the Russian Communist Party in 1917. She was the only woman elected to full membership on the CC by the 7th Congress of 1918 and the 8th Congress of 1919. However, the 9th Congress of 1920 dropped her both from the Central Committee and from the party secretariat. After being removed from the Central Committee, Stasova worked for the Petrograd party organization, from where she was brought into the Comintern's apparatus. She was appointed Comintern representative to the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in May 1921, where she used the pseudonym \\"Hertha.\\" Stasova remained in Germany through 1926, where she played a leading role in the German affiliate of the International Red Aid (MOPR) organization, Die Rote Hilfe. Stasova returned to the USSR in February 1926. The next year she was named deputy director head of the international MOPR as well as head of the Central Committee of the MOPR organization in the USSR, positions which she retained through 1937.G.M. Adibekov et al. (eds.), Politbiuro TsK RKP(b) - VKP(b) i Komintern: 1919-1943 Dokumenty (\\"Politburo CC RKP(b)-VKP(b) and the Comintern: 1919-1943 Documents\\"). Moscow: ROSSPEN, 2004; pg. 885. Stasova served as a member of the Central Control Commission of the Russian Communist Party from 1930 to 1934 and in 1935 the 7th World Congress of the Comintern named her a member of the International Control Commission. Unlike so many other \\"Old Bolsheviks,\\" Stasova was not arrested during the spy mania and secret police terror which swept the Soviet Union in the late 1930s, although in November 1937, Joseph Stalin told the head of Comintern, Georgi Dimitrov that Stasova was \\"scum\\" and \\"probably\\" would be arrested. She was dismissed from her post on MOPR five days later, on 16 November 1937. Unusually, she retained her place on the International Control Commission until Comintern was abolished in 1943Adibekov et al. (eds.), Politbiuro TsK RKP(b) - VKP(b) i Komintern, pg. 885., and in 1938 was re-employed as an editor of the magazine International Literature. Stasova continued in this role until 1946, when she retired. In 1948, she received a \\"severe reprimand\\" for saying in a public lecture that \\"Lenin treated all comrades equally and even called Bukharin 'Bukharchik'\\" - ten years earlier Bukharin had been shot on trumped-up charges. She wrote later that the words 'slipped out' and that it was \\"a grave political mistake\\" on her part. Death and legacy After Stalin's death, Elena Stasova was the last surviving Old Bolshevik who had served on the Central Committee during the 1917 revolution. She made very few public appearances after retiring, but in 1961, she was one of four Old Bolsheviks who signed an appeal to the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for the posthumous rehabilitation of Nikolai Bukharin. She died on 31 December 1966. A boarding school for foreigners in Ivanovo, Russia called the Ivanovo International Boarding School (\\"Interdom\\"), established by MOPR in 1933, was named after Elena Stasova.

In it, Spider-Man must face the Sandman, a former petty thug who now can manipulate his sand body at will. \\"Competition\\" was written by Kevin Hopps and directed by Troy Adomitis. Hopps and Adomotis each had their respective roles previously in \\"Interactions.\\" Victor Cook, a developer, producer, and supervising director for The Spectacular Spider-Man, was thrilled to use Sandman because he felt he was \\"a perfect character for animation.\\" \\"Competition\\" aired on March 29, 2008, on the Kids WB! block for The CW. The episode received warm reviews from television critics - IGN wrote that the fight scenes were the greatest of the series at the time. Plot summary Peter, as Spider-Man, effectively defeats two common thugs - Flint Marko and Alex O'Hirn - and puts them in prison. While discussing their outrage towards Spider-Man, their bail is paid and they go into a limousine outside. Inside the limousine, Hammerhead tells them he has big plans for them, taking them to a secret base. The next day, Peter practices his web slinging in his bedroom, when Aunt May walks in. He stops and she suggests he takes their neighbor Mary Jane Watson to the upcoming Fall Formal. Peter cringes at the idea and heads off to school. There, it is announced football practices will be held that day and Harry wants to try out. Peter passes on joining him as he feels it will reveal his abilities. When he hears Flash Thompson planning on specifically going after Harry during tryouts, he decides to keep him safe and try out anyway. They each do good at tryout - Harry impresses the coach and the other player, while Peter does the same using his extra abilities. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn arrives at the warehouse to supervise an experiment on Marko. Restrained Marko will be given subdermal silicon transplants giving him a hardened untraceable silicon armor. Dr. Octavius says that the experiment has too many flaws but Osborn commands him to go with it anyway. The experiment malfunctions and the silicon violently mutates him. His body evaporates into sand and Octavius, terrified, thinks he has just killed him. Suddenly, Marko reshapes himself, still made of sand, and viciously thrashes against the walls for them to let him out. Hammerhead and Osborn take him outside in their limousine, where Marko is able to reform himself in his old appearance. When they tell him he will work for \\"the Big Man,\\" but he decides to go alone and leaves. Hammerhead is fine with that as it means they will now have a distraction for Spider-Man. Now codenamed \\"Sandman,\\" Marko robs a bank and Spider-Man arrives immediately. He is overpowered by Marko's new powers and finds himself out of web fluid. After defeating Spider-Man, Sandman escapes through a sewer drain, after accidentally mentioning the \\"Big Man's\\" name. The next day, Peter wanted to go find Sandman after school, but Liz Allan went to Peter and wishes him good luck on the football tryouts. Peter goes to tryouts again, doing well once more and being invited for the last day of tryouts along with Harry. Harry is upset that he outshined him and invites the other players to hang out at a soda shop. Meanwhile, Peter goes on the city bus and sits next to Gwen, whom he apologizes to for ignoring her lately and she accepts. She also hints that he should take her to the fall formal, but he does not get the clue and tells her he is going to ask Betty Brant, J. Jonah Jameson's secretary at the Daily Bugle. After departing from the bus, Peter goes off as Spider-Man to an armored truck, which Sandman is robbing. In their struggle, the truck goes out of control and lands in a construction site. When Spider-Man tries to web him up, it proves to be ineffective as Sandman can slip through them; the villain then starts to attack Spider-Man with girders. Meanwhile, at the soda shop, Harry tries to impress the jocks, catching Kenny's girlfriend Glory's attention. Kenny plays a prank on Harry, which enrages Glory and she asks Harry to take her home. Back on the construction site, Spider-Man gets out from the pile of girders and gets the head on Sandman. He lures him up to the roof and encasing him in cement from the nearby cement maker. That night, Harry comes home to tell his father that he's tried out for the football team, but he is unimpressed. Harry walks off, darkly remarking that he will \\"show them tomorrow.\\" At final tryouts the next day, Harry makes the team, and Peter purposely does terrible so he doesn't outshine his friend. Gwen then cheers him up with ice cream. Production alt=A bearded man wearing a black shirt and a gray beret sits in front a microphone. Sunglasses are han Hopps and Adomotis had written and directed the episode \\"Interactions,\\" respectively, which featured the introduction of the villain Electro. The crew were very excited about working with Sandman. Victor Cook, supervising producer and story editor of the series, thinks that he was \\"designed for animation.\\" Hopps \\"love[s] the ordinary-ness of the motivation for [him]\\" and finds that he is \\"just basically a crook who suddenly finds himself with super powers.\\" John DiMaggio provided his voice for the character. Thomas F. Wilson, known for playing the character Biff Tannen in the Back to the Future films, began his recurring role as policeman Stan Carter. In the comic books, Stan Carter was a vicious serial killer by the name of Sin-Eater. Due to the show being for youth-oriented audiences, it is highly unlikely the series will make him the murdering alter-ego. \\"Competitions\\" originally aired on March 23, 2008, on the Kids WB! block for The CW. Cultural references The majority of \\"Competition\\" focuses on alt=Several men dressed in football uniforms dart down a field. Another football-suited man is collapsed on the ground, while a man is scene in the background wearing a black and white striped shirt holding a whistle. Behind the scene are hundreds of people cheering in stands. The title of the episode is referent to economics - the title scheme was used for the arc the episode fell inside and was pitched by Greg Weisman, story editor and producer for The Spectacular Spider-Man. It also refers to the episode's theme of people competing for glory. Several scenes from the episode were taken directly from the film Spider-Man 3. Spider-Man does a leg-sweep on Sandman in the same manner as in the film. Flint Marko's transformation into the Sandman was also based executed in the same manner as it was in the film's version of his transformation. A main focus in the episode features Peter and Harry trying out for high school football. The origin of this incarnation of sandman shares similarities to his ultimate counterpart version while sharing similarities to the comics and the film. Reception \\"Competition\\" was well received by television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8.6. (\\"Great\\") Goldman enjoyed Sandman's nonchalant behavior, favoring using his newfound powers for money over getting his revenge on Spider-Man. He wrote that the episode \\"delivered some of the best fight scenes yet,\\" including the Spider-Man punching Sandman only to discover he is made of sand, which he called his favorite fight scene in the entire episode. On Peter's personal life being portrayed, Goldman wrote that he \\"had to deal with the age old superhero conflict regarding whether he could use his powers to help himself in everyday ways ‚Äì not just whether it was 'right' but whether it might give him away.\\" See also *List of The Spectacular Spider-Man episodes References External links *\\"Competition\\" at the Internet Movie Database \\"Competition\\" on Marvel.com Category:2008 American television episodes Category:The Spectacular Spider-Man episodes ","title":"Competition (The Spectacular Spider-Man)"},{"id":"24423136","text":"Global listings format (GLF) refers to metadata for transferring program guide information and multimedia information.

It was created by Pr.

Red and yellow have been considered the main colors representing Macedonia since the end of World War II. The new eight-rayed sun represents \\"the new sun of Liberty\\" referred to in the national anthem, Denes nad Makedonija.

The Vergina Sun is a 16-ray star covering what appears to be the royal burial larnax of Philip II of Macedon, discovered in Vergina, Greece, and it is believed to have been associated with ancient Macedonian kings such as Alexander the Great and Philip II, although it was used as a symbol in Greek art long before the Macedonian period. The symbol was discovered in the present-day Greek region of Macedonia, and Greeks regard it as an exclusively Greek symbol. The Vergina sun on a red field was the first flag of the independent Republic of Macedonia, until it was removed from the state flag under an agreement reached between the Republic of Macedonia and Greece in September 1995. Greece had also lodged a claim for trademark protection of the Vergina Sun as an official state emblem at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in July 1995. Nevertheless, the Vergina sun is still used unofficially as a national symbol by many Macedonians and organisations in the Macedonian diaspora.

It premiered on Fox in the United States on November 8, 2009. The episode follows anthropomorphic dog Brian as he dates a middle-aged woman named Rita whose daughter has stood Brian up. He becomes reluctant to continue their relationship after discovering her numerous health concerns; also, his family continually harasses him.The episode premiered during an \\"all-Seth MacFarlane\\" schedule, preceding the live-action episode Seth and Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show. The episode was written by series regular Tom Devanney and directed by Pete Michels. It received very mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 7.38 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Hart Bochner, James Burkholder, Aimee Garcia, Jack Samson, Stacey Scowley, Debra Skelton, Reginald VelJohnson, Nana Visitor, Tico Wells, Mae Whitman, and Bruce Willis, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \\"Brian's Got a Brand New Bag\\" was released on DVD along with seven other episodes from the season on June 15, 2010. The episode is dedicated to Patrick Swayze. Plot During a visit to a closing video store during a DVD sale, Peter decides to buy Road House and, after watching it, decides to start roundhouse kicking everything in sight including his family. While driving with Brian and using his feet on the steering wheel, Peter crashes into a young woman's car and Brian rushes to make sure she's all right.The woman apologizes to Brian and he asks her out. She accepts, but when he comes to her house to pick her up, her mother Rita says she has just left with somebody else. Brian keeps talking to Rita and finds himself attracted to her. After dating for several weeks, they sneak into the Griffin home late one night, but the family finds out the next morning and ridicules Rita behind her back. Brian attempts to convince the family that Rita is a wonderful, charming woman despite the fact that she's significantly older than he is, and invites her to dinner to prove his point. It doesn't go well: they demand that she reveal her age, and she breaks down and admits that she's 50. Infuriated with the Griffins, Brian goes to console Rita, and proposes to her. Feeling guilty for how they treated him, the Griffins give Brian their blessings. Rita breaks her hip while she and Brian are having sex. Peter warns Brian that their relationship will not last much longer now that he must run errands for her. Brian goes out to pick up medicine for bedridden Rita, but is distracted by the sight of a group of young women entering a bar. One of them offers to have sex with Brian in the bathroom, after which he returns with her medicine. Realizing that he still loves Rita, he admits his infidelity. However, Rita decides he is far too young for her and breaks off their engagement. A regretful Brian understands that it is for the best and leaves her. Production and development Nana Visitor provided the voice of Rita. The episode was directed by former Simpsons artist Pete Michels, and written by Tom Devanney, shortly after the conclusion of the seventh production season. Both are series regulars for the show, who joined in its third and fourth seasons, respectively. Prior to providing minor voice-over roles for the series, actress Nana Visitor portrays the episode's featured character, Rita. Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors, with series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane and David Zuckerman serving as staff writers for the episode. \\"Brian's Got a Brand New Bag\\", along with the seven other episodes from Family Guys eighth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on June 15, 2010. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Seth MacFarlane and various crew and cast members for several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes, a special mini-feature which discussed the process behind animating \\"Road to the Multiverse\\", and mini-feature entitled Family Guy Karaoke. In addition to Visitor and the regular cast, actor Hart Bochner, James Burkholder, actress Aimee Garcia, Jack Samson, actress Stacey Scowley, Debra Skelton, Reginald VelJohnson, actor Tico Wells, actress Mae Whitman, and actor Bruce Willis guest-starred in the episode in both voice and live-action appearances. Recurring guest voice actors Alexandra Breckenridge, writer Steve Callaghan, voice actor Ralph Garman, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin, and writer John Viener also made minor appearances. Recurring guest cast members Adam West and Patrick Warburton also made appearances in the episode. Cultural references The title is a reference to the James Brown song \\"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag.\\" Peter buys the film Road House starring Patrick Swayze. While at the movie store's going out of business sale ‚Äì where Mayor West buys The Garbage Pail Kids Movie ‚Äì Peter refuses to take the Robin Williams' film What Dreams May Come, even though it's free, causing the DVD to wistfully sing the song \\"Maybe\\" from Annie. Meanwhile, Brian buys Dan in Real Life, which Stewie mocks. In another scene, Joe is dragged away by shadowy figures, a reference to a second Patrick Swayze film, Ghost. One cutaway gag features Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown romantically bonding over their shared love for crack cocaine. Another cutaway gag features Peter in the famed Peanuts bit in which Lucy pulls the football away from Charlie Brown, with Peter attacking her until she cries and promises to never pull the same stunt. Brian brags over his previous work as an actor, which he proves by showing a scene from Die Hard in which the animated Brian is inserted into the live action next to Reginald VelJohnson and Paul Gleason. When Rita is introduced to the Griffins, Peter jokes about her age by asking if anyone has made any \\"Jessica Tandy jokes\\" yet. Charlotte Rae from Facts of Life later appears in the Griffins' living room to say, \\"Whaaaaat?\\" Peter flips through Playboys \\"Women of the Olympics\\" issue, which Peter finds full of unattractive, manly women. Reception In a significant decline from the previous week's show, and despite being heavily promoted as an \\"all-Seth MacFarlane\\" night, the episode received a Nielsen Rating of 4.3/7 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and was viewed in 7.38 million homes. The episode received mostly mixed reviews from critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave it a 6.5/10, saying that the \\"episode felt very formulaic and a bit of a wasted opportunity\\" Emily VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave it a B, saying, \\"it's weird to see a Family Guy episode that has something approaching an actual story and even the cutaway gags were more muted than usual.\\" In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Ramsey Isler of IGN listed \\"Brian's Got a Brand New Bag\\" as \\"remarkably unfunny, with lazy and unoriginal writing.\\" References External links  Category:Family Guy (season 8) episodes Category:2009 American television episodes ","title":"Brian's Got a Brand New Bag"},{"id":"24423271","text":"Jersild v.

C. canis can reach in total length, but most other species are up to around half or one-quarter of that size. Like many other \\"barbs\\", it was long included in Barbus. It appears to be a fairly close relative of the typical barbels and relatives - the genus Barbus proper -, but closer still to the large hexaploid species nowadays separated in Labeobarbus. Because of the improved phylogenetic knowledge which indicates Barbus was highly paraphyletic in its wide circumscription -, Carasobarbus and some other closely related \\"barbs\\" (e.g. \\"Barbus\\" reinii) may be included in Labeobarbus to avoid a profusion of very small genera.de Graaf et al.

It is used as an asymmetric catalyst in the Jacobsen epoxidation, which is renowned for its ability to enantioselectively transform prochiral alkenes into epoxides. Before its development, catalysts for the asymmetric epoxidation of alkenes required the substrate to have a directing functional group, such as an alcohol as seen in the Sharpless epoxidation. This compound has two enantiomers, which give the appropriate epoxide product from the alkene starting material. Enantiomerically pure epoxides are desirable as building blocks for complex molecules with specific chirality. Biologically active compounds can exhibit radically different activity based on differences in chirality and therefore the ability to obtain desired stereocenters in a molecule is of great importance to the pharmaceutical industry. Jacobsen's catalyst and other asymmetric catalysts are particularly useful in this field; for example, Jacobsen's catalyst was used to synthesize phenylisoserine, a side chain to the famous anti-cancer drug Taxol, in a four-step synthesis as early as 1992. Structure and basic properties Jacobsen‚Äôs catalyst is typical of a transition metal oxidation catalyst: it has a high-valent metal center in a nitrogen and oxygen donor environment. The chelating salen ligand of Jacobsen‚Äôs catalyst is tetradentate, meaning it binds to the central manganese metal through four bonds, one to each oxygen and nitrogen atom of the salen backbone. It belongs to a class of chiral diimine ligands that are synthesized via the Schiff base condensation. Preparation Both enantiomers of Jacobsen's catalyst are commercially available. Jacobsen's catalyst can be prepared by separating 1,2-diaminocyclohexane into its component enantiomers and then reacting the appropriate tartrate with 3,5-di-tert- butyl-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde to form a Schiff base (see intermediate formed in the reaction scheme below). Reaction with manganese(II) acetate in the presence of air gives the manganese(III) complex, which may be isolated as the chloro derivative after the addition of lithium chloride. Shown below is the preparation of the (R,R)-enantiomer. The synthesis has been adapted for undergraduate level chemistry courses in order to stress the importance of enantiomerically pure compounds. :center Reaction mechanism In general, two mechanisms have been suggested. Because Jacobsen‚Äôs catalyst epoxidizes conjugated alkenes (i.e. those in which there are multiple double bonds on alternating carbons) most effectively, the generally accepted mechanism is based on a radical intermediate which is stabilized due to the conjugated nature of the substrate. For non-conjugated alkenes, the substrate is far less able to stabilize a radical, making a radical intermediate more unlikely. In this case, a concerted mechanism in which the bond to the oxygen is simultaneously broken with metal-center while it is formed with the substrate is probable. However, more recent studies have indicated a radical intermediate is possible, challenging the assumption that non-conjugated alkenes undergo concerted mechanisms. In the original catalytic reaction, iodosylarenes (PhIO) were used as the stoichiometric oxidant, but soon after it was found that chlorine bleach (NaClO), a cheaper alternative, works as well. While other oxidants subsequently have been used, bleach continues to be the most common. A simplified view of the catalytic cycle associated with Jacobsen's catalyst After the addition of the oxidant to the system, O=Mn(V) is generally accepted to be the active oxidant species formed (step A). The substrate is thought to approach the metal-oxo bond from the side at a perpendicular orientation in relation to the catalyst in order to allow favorable orbital overlap. This mechanism, which was originally proposed by John Groves to explain porphyrin-catalyzed epoxidation reactions, is commonly referred to as a \\"side-on perpendicular approach\\". The approach is over the diamine bridge, where the steric bulk of the tert-butyl groups on the periphery of the ligand do not interfere with the alkene‚Äôs approach (see below). However, as is the case with the overall mechanism, the pathway of alkene approach is also debated. One proposed substrate approach pathway - Note: Substrates are perpendicular to the plane of the catalyst. The ease with which Jacobsen's catalyst selectively epoxidizes cis-alkenes has been difficult to replicate with terminal and trans-alkenes. Structural changes to the ligand and adaptations to the protocol for the epoxidation reaction, however, have led to some successes in these areas. For example, derivatives of Jacobsen's catalyst with small structural changes to the salen backbone have been used in conjunction with low temperatures and the oxidant m-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) to epoxidize the terminal alkene styrene. The low temperature of the reaction favors only one pathway, the cis pathway, while m-CPBA is used because of water's high freezing point. Little success has occurred with the epoxidation of trans alkenes by manganese compounds but other salen coordination compounds, such as oxochromium complexes, can be used. Variations The ligand structure of Jacobsen‚Äôs catalyst is easily modified for use over a wide range of reactions, such as epoxide-ring openings, Diels-Alder reactions, and conjugate additions. For example, an analogous catalyst with an aluminum metal center has been used for the carbonylation of epoxides in order to obtain beta-lactones.

Roman, the late founder of Romandale Farms, built the Cathedral on land he donated. In the early 2000s, his daughter, Helen Roman-Barber, working with Donald Buttress, Surveyor of the Fabric Emeritus of Westminster Abbey, developed the design concept for Cathedraltown, based on European cathedral towns.https://urbantoronto.ca/forum/threads/cathedraltown- suburbia-with-a-twist.710/ The town began settlement in 2006 with the completion of homes north of the Cathedral. Since then, single- and multi- family housing and mixed-use condominiums have been built to the west and south of the Cathedral.https://www.yourmarkhamrealestate.ca/markham-ontario- neighbourhoods/north-markham-neighbourhoods/cathedraltown-markham-real-estate- homes-neighbourhood-townhomes/ This website contains a map showing homes for sale to the north, west and south of the Cathedral. Architecture and art thumb Designed under the direction of Donald Buttress, Cathedraltown reflects the Regency and Georgian architecture that was popular in London in the late 18th an early 19th centuries. In July 2017 a statue of the cow A Brookview Tony Charity was erected in Cathedraltown to some controversy. The statue is of a prize-winning cow that was owned jointly by Romandale Farms and Hanover Hill Farms, in the nearby town of Port Perry, where the cow resided. Romandale Farms donated the statue to honour Charity In October 2017, Markham City Council voted to search for a new location for the statue.https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/10/16/markham-cow-statue-to-stay- put-for-now.html , the statue has been taken down and placed in storage until a more suitable and accepted home for Charity can be found.

Suitability for certain applications, or technically a certain quality of service, is often assumed. For instance, low round trip delay (or \\"latency\\" in milliseconds) would normally be assumed to be well under 150ms and suitable for Voice over IP, online gaming, financial trading especially arbitrage, virtual private networks and other latency- sensitive applications. This would rule out satellite Internet as inherently high-latency. In some applications, utility-grade reliability (measured for example in seconds per 30 years outage time as in the PSTN network) or security (say AES-128 as required for smart grid applications in the US) are often also assumed or defined as requirements. There is no single definition of broadband and official plans may refer to any or none of these criteria. Beyond broad latency and reliability expectations, term itself is technology neutral; broadband can be delivered by a range of technologies including DSL, fiber optic cable, powerline networking, LTE, Ethernet, Wi-Fi or next generation access. Several operators have started to combine two of these technologies to create Hybrid Access Networks. This article presents an overview of official government plans to promote broadband - based on official sources that may be biased due to their promotion of the government plan as effective and positive. Such plans are recommended by OECD and other development agencies. All G7 countries except Canada have such a national broadband plan in place now. {Fixed broadband Internet subscriptions in 2012 as a percentage of a country's populationSource: International Telecommunication Union.\\"Fixed (wired)-broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants 2012\\", Dynamic Report, ITU ITC EYE, International Telecommunication Union.

It has released the World Bank Broadband Strategy ToolkitWorld Bank Broadband Strategy Toolkit: Module 3. Retrieved 2 November 2010. to assist in policy development. Furthermore, the close relationship of universal wired broadband and smart grid plans is the subject of much study particularly in the US and Europe. The US plan has ambitious energy demand management goals (see National Broadband Plan (United States) for more details on these and their relationship to other US national goals) and its broadband plan is generally considered to be a pre-requisite to its communications-intensive energy strategy. This is also true to some degree of other countries' broadband plans.  Americas   Northern America   Canada  As of early March 2009, colleagues in Industry Canada confirm that the current national broadband strategy is a short statement in the 2009 budget: \\"Canada was one of the first countries to implement a connectivity agenda geared toward facilitating Internet access to all of its citizens. To this day, Canada remains one of the most connected nations in the world, with the highest broadband connection rate among the G7 countries. However, gaps in access to broadband remain, particularly in rural and remote communities. \\"The Government is committed to closing the broadband gap in Canada by encouraging the private development of rural broadband infrastructure. Budget 2009 provides $225 million over three years to Industry Canada to develop and implement a strategy on extending broadband coverage to all currently unserved communities beginning in 2009‚Äì10.\\" The budget specifically includes: \\"Providing $225 million over three years to develop and implement a strategy on extending broadband coverage to unserved communities.\\" On 6 March 2009, Mr. John Duncan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Federal Interlocutor for M√©tis and Non-status Indians, announced that the Government of Canada will contribute $7.86 million to the First Nations Emergency Services Society (FNESS) and their partner, the First Nations Technology Council (FNTC) in British Columbia, for the construction and provision of satellite broadband network capacity connecting 21 remote First Nations communities in British Columbia. In a 4 June 2009 news release, the CRTC endorsed the National Film Board's call for a national digital strategy. No substantial action, followup or funding was announced in the 2010 or 2011 budgets. CANARIE remains Canada's only publicly funded backbone network. Several provinces, especially Nova Scotia, have their own plans for broadband universal service see Broadband for Rural Nova Scotia initiative but these are generally last-mile services using fixed wireless technologies (Motorola Canopy in the case of Nova Scotia). No province is covered with public backhaul available to general public & business, though some provinces, regions and municipalities own some fibre.  United States  In the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ‚Äì popularly referred to as a post-recession stimulus package ‚Äì Congress charged the US Federal Communications Commission with creating a national broadband plan. The Recovery Act required the plan to explore several key elements of broadband deployment and use, and the commission now seeks comment on these elements, including: * The most effective and efficient ways to ensure broadband access for all Americans * Strategies for achieving affordability and maximum utilization of broadband infrastructure and services * Evaluation of the status of broadband deployment, including the progress of related grant programs * How to use broadband to advance consumer welfare, civic participation, public safety and homeland security, community development, health care delivery, energy independence and efficiency, education, worker training, private sector investment, entrepreneurial activity, job creation, and economic growth, and other national purposes. The plan was published in March 2010, on the same website used to gather public comment during its preparation. The plan is integrated with the US smart grid policies. A major purpose of the broadband plan is to enable M2M communications for that purpose.  Latin America and the Caribbean  Argentina The number of Internet users in the country has been estimated at 26 million (2010), of which 5 million, by late 2010, were broadband users (82% of which were residential and 81% of which connected at a speed of least 512 kbit/s), and over 1.3 were wireless and satellite users. Among residential users, 38.3% were located in Buenos Aires Province (including Greater Buenos Aires), 26.0% in the city of Buenos Aires, 8.2% in C√≥rdoba and 7.4% in Santa Fe Province. According to a 2010 report by IDC Consulting, Argentina has a rate of 9.3 broadband accounts per 100 inhabitants, only surpassed in the region by Chile, which registered 9.7. Despite this relatively good national indicator, the penetration of Internet is not the same in all provinces, and some provinces, like Jujuy, have only 0.2 per 100 inhabitants; Formosa Province 0.3; Corrientes Province 0.4; and Tucum√°n Province 0.7. To reduce this disparity between provinces, in October 2010 the government presented a five-year plan, with an initial investment of 8,000 million pesos, called Plan Nacional de Telecomunicaci√≥n \\"Argentina Conectada\\" (\\"Connected Argentina\\" ‚Äì National Telecommunications Plan), under command of the state-owned enterprise ARSAT. Most of the financing is intended for the acquisition of the high-tech material required. The main goal is to expand broadband to the whole national territory, and to cover more than 10 million homes with a connection by the year 2015. This is supposed to duplicate the present number of residences which have access to these services, and to quintuple the penetration of optical fiber in the country.  Brazil  In October 2009, the Brazilian Agency of Telecommunicationsanatel.gov.br sought to tighten rules on domestic broadband service providers which, if implemented, could force firms such as Telef√≥nica of Spain and Mexico's Am√©rica M√≥vil to increase their investments in the country, according to local daily O Estado de S. Paulo reports. It is understood the new rules are designed to improve customer service with a specific focus on the delivery of stated broadband connection speeds; around 50% of users are currently thought to receive less than half the speed promised by their Internet service provider (ISP). New legislation could enter into force in 2010 requiring domestic broadband providers to comply with stricter standards on service quality. Anatel's move comes in the wake of an explosion in demand for broadband internet access which has seen user number swell to around 18 million, but also resulted in major disruptions to services ‚Äì such as the recent high-profile outage of Telef√≥nica's Speedy service which left millions of customers offline.  Chile  In October 2008, Chile's president, Michelle Bachelet, announced this week the countries' most ambitious telecoms subsidy plan ever, in terms of public investment and area of coverage. The project, which is aimed at boosting SMEs competitiveness in rural areas, will provide connectivity to more than three million people in 1,474 rural communities. The development is expected to cost US$100 million, 70% of which will be provided by the government through the Telecoms Development Fund. *Significance: At 30 March 2008, only 0.8% of the households in rural areas in Chile have internet access. Upon completion of the project, internet network coverage will reach from 71.6% of the population to 92.2%, according to the country's telecoms regulator. In January 2008, Chile announced its 2007‚Äì2012 Strategy for Digital Development that will articulate the efforts of the public and private spheres as to new technologies during the next years. The project was prepared by the Committee of Ministers for Digital Development and seeks to provide further impulse to the ICTs in the Trans-Andean country. The goals on which the Chilean government will place more emphasis are to double the broadband connections to reach 2 million by 2010, to increase SMEs competition, to advance on the digitalization of the public health system, and to implement new technologies in areas deemed key, such as the provisional reform and education. In June 2009, Chile launched a new portal in which consumers may compare offers of all internet providers.  Colombia  In April 2009, Internet usage has grown to 40 percent of the Colombian population in the last ten years, with internet subscriptions rising at an annual rate of 75 percent. Over 73 percent of internet subscribers use broadband. Despite the growth, Colombia's subscription penetration average remains sixth in Latin America, with a majority of internet subscriptions concentrated in Colombia's three largest cities. To promote information technologies (IT) and telecommunications services in rural areas, Colombia's Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications developed a comprehensive ten-year National IT plan. A US$750 million public- private Communications Fund administers plan implementation, with 60 percent of funds targeted to the Compartel rural and community development program. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) also supports the development of telecommunications networks in rural areas, as well as provides technical assistance to GOC telecommunications authorities. The percentage of internet users has grown from 1 to 40 percent of the population‚Äîor approximately 17 million people‚Äîwithin the last decade. Permanent internet subscribers have also grown at an annual rate of 75 percent in the last five years, although the actual number of subscriptions remains low at 2 million. Colombia's penetration average (the internet subscription to population ratio) is 4.3, ranking it sixth in Latin America behind Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico and Brazil. Likewise, 55 percent of subscriptions remain concentrated in the cities of Bogot√°, Medell√≠n and Cali. Colombia has 1.45 million internet subscribers with broadband access‚Äîapproximately 73 percent of total subscriptions.Colombia's Telecommunications Regulations Commission (CRT) defines broadband as an internet service with a minimum download speed of 512 kbit/s, which is faster than the 128 kbit/s download speed defined as broadband by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). DSL (63 percent) and cable (32 percent) dominate the broadband market share, with Wimax (5 percent) a distant third. The main providers according to market share are: Empresa de Telefonos de Bogota (25 percent); EPM Telecommunications (24 percent); Colombia Telecommunications (20 percent); Telmex Hogar (19 percent); and independent providers (12 percent). These providers focus on triple-play packages combining internet, television and telephone services, which has contributed to the rapid expansion of internet usage. Carlos Forero, the vice- president of the CRT, said that broadband and associated value-added services are now seen as the market differentiator between telecommunications providers. Last year the Ministry of Communications (MOC) announced a National IT Plan, establishing three main goals to be achieved before 2019: 70 percent of Colombians with internet subscriptions, 100 percent of health and education establishments with internet access, and 100 percent of rural areas with internet access. The MOC plans to achieve these objectives through its flagship community and rural development program Compartel, which is funded by a US$750 million public-private National Communications Fund.All telecommunications providers are required to assist the Ministry of Communications in financing the Compartel program, with private sector contributions equaling 15 percent of Compartel's total budget in 2008. Compartel provides subsidies or investment incentives to establish internet networks and telephony services in Colombia's most rural and impoverished areas. Since 2008, the program has invested US$421 million in rural networks, benefiting 16,000 rural educational, health and government institutions. In addition to Compartel, the GOC also supports additional programs in the educational, health, entrepreneurial, competitiveness, online-government and research sectors. Activities in 2008 included the distribution of refurbished computers to educational institutions (US$86 million), connectivity financing for small and medium enterprises ($15 million), conversion of all public institutions to online institutions ($70 million), and e-medicine ($5 million). USAID also promotes telecommunications connectivity for underserved and rural populations, as well as education and content to support economic and social development, through its Last Mile Initiative. Major contributors to this public-private alliance are Avantel, Intel, Cisco, Microsoft, Google, Polyvision, regional and local governments, and the MOC. Through the program, USG-provided equipment and training will connect 50 municipalities in the departments of Meta, Huila and Magdalena, including 21,000 small businesses and 325,000 institutions such as schools, hospitals, justice houses and local government offices. On the technical side, USAID assisted the MOC with the development of its National Plan and presently advises the CRT on \\"unbundling the local loop\\" to increase competition in broadband provision. Colombia remains behind Latin American neighbors such as Mexico, Brazil and Argentina in most IT indicators, but since the GOC privatized its state-owned National Telecommunications Company in 2003, the IT sector has expanded rapidly. The sector contributed a record 3 percent of total GDP in 2008. Local experts agree that IT sector will continue to experience accelerated growth as Colombia's domestic security situation improves and the legal economy strengthens. However, they also emphasize that continued private investment is key to the GOC achieving its lofty goals by 2019.  Dominican Republic  In October 2009, the Dominican Republic's telecoms regulator, Instituto Dominicano de las Telecomunicaciones (INDOTEL), has said it has plans to roll out fixed line telecoms services to an additional 1,000 rural communities as part of an initiative aimed at providing broadband and home voice services to all towns with more than 300 inhabitants. According to TeleGeography's GlobalComms database, the announcement comes just over a year after fixed line incumbent CODETEL inked a deal with INDOTEL to undertake a rural connectivity project that will see investment of US$100 million. In April 2009, this cable presents initial reporting on broadband deployment initiatives in the Dominican Republic (reftel). There is one ongoing government initiative to provide broadband access to 508 rural communities that is scheduled to finish by September. While future incentives are being considered by the regulatory agency, no others currently exist and broadband expansion is further hampered by 28 percent in taxes levied on all telecommunications sales. A Senate committee announced on 30 March it would review and update of the 1998 telecommunications law. The Dominican Telecommunications Institute (INDOTEL), the GoDR regulatory agency, launched a tender in 2007 for a Rural Broadband Connectivity Program. At that time, only 30 percent of the country's 383 municipalities had broadband capacity. The tender offered a subsidy of up to US$5 million. The winning bidder was Codetel (Mexican-owned), the largest company in the market, which offered to connect the 508 communities with no cash subsidy but rather in exchange for the rights to a WiMax frequency in the country. INDOTEL Executive Director Joelle Exarhakos told EconOff that the program has proceeded successfully and more than 100 rural communities have already been connected. She said Codetel would complete the broadband deployment plan by September 2009. By that time, every municipality in the country will have broadband access. Under the program, Codetel provides 256 kB/second or faster service to rural communities at prices that match the prices charged in urban centers where Codetel competes with other providers. Exarhakos told EconOff that INDOTEL does not have current plans for a second stage for the rural connectivity program, noting that with the completion of this plan, every municipality in the country will have broadband access. She said that in many of these communities, local entrepreneurs have built connections to the networks servicing even smaller communities nearby. Nonetheless, INDOTEL does not foresee a second stage of the rural program to venture into even smaller villages. But Exarhakos told EconOff that she believes such incentives might not be necessary; part of the goal of the Rural Connectivity Program was to demonstrate rural residents' capacity to pay and it has. In Monte Plata, a national provider, Dijitec, is developing infrastructure without any government incentive to compete with Codetel. In many of these communities, INDOTEL has set up Informatics Training Centers (CCI), where schoolchildren and residents can access the Internet and learn how to use computers. These centers are among the 846 centers around the country that INDOTEL has established as part of an information technology promotion program. INDOTEL provides the hardware and software for the centers and community groups, schools, churches or town governments maintain and operate the facilities. EconOff visited one such site in October 2008 at a church in Saman√° which was inoperable because there were no funds to pay the electricity bill. Asked about these issues, Exarhakos candidly acknowledged that some of the committees have not succeeded in maintaining the facilities.Following the meeting with INDOTEL, EconOff learned from the Samana church pastor that the facility remains closed six months later. Although the electricity bill is paid, they have been waiting for two weeks for INDOTEL to provide a needed battery. He said he does not know how to fund the CCI in the future. Sur Futuro is one of the non-governmental organizations that has taken on the operations of CCIs, and runs three centers in communities where the organization is also otherwise involved. The group's education director told EconOff that while INDOTEL's CCI program provides an excellent service to communities, the lack of long-term funding limits its impact. She said it costs between US$500 and 850 monthly to operate a CCI, funds that are difficult to come across in poor communities. Sur Futuro's president noted that she is aware that the Catholic Church struggles to maintain the CCIs it runs. Codetel's participation in the rural broadband program has been directed by Ahmed Awad, who said the company's total cost of the program is about US$50 million. He said that while Codetel views it as a social investment, it has also proven relatively commercially successful. In addition to installing and maintaining the infrastructure for broadband connectivity in the 508 communities, Codetel is responsible for setting up an entrepreneur program, establishing an Internet portal for the program and providing training in each community participating in the program. In the entrepreneur program, Codetel has helped small businesspeople in many of the communities invest an average of US$1000 to start up internet cafes or international call centers. The Internet portal, which Codetel hired an NGO to construct, features geographic, demographic and other facts about each of the 508 communities. Awad told EconOff he believes it is the only database of information about these forgotten locales. The training provided by Codetel is limited to a one-hour workshop provided to the highest level of school taught in each municipality. Awad said that while the schools have received the trainers positively, he noted that one hour was insufficient to provide much training to the students. Awad told EconOff that the installed connections are 80 percent wireless, but that despite the fact that this provides the opportunity for cellular-only service in these areas, many customers want wired hardware in their homes despite the higher costs. Because the service is wireless, many locales contiguous to the participating communities have gained broadband access, Awad said. \\"In addition to the 508 municipalities, another 150 or so villages will receive service because of the wireless reach,\\" he told EconOff. Awad said he hoped that INDOTEL would launch a sequel to this program, noting that there are another 1500 communities that lack broadband access. However, he lamented the fact that the sector does not have an ongoing focalized subsidy that would reduce costs to rural users, which would make these consumers a more attractive target for private investment. He also commented that the country needs more investment in information technology (IT) education in order to take advantage of the growing broadband penetration and stimulate demand for these services. Perhaps most importantly, though, he cited the lack of reliable electricity as one of the highest hurdles impeding broadband growth both in rural communities and nationwide. Instead of providing incentives for growth, the GoDR has a policy of discouraging it with high taxes. In a 2 April interview with the newspaper Hoy, Codetel President Oscar Pena complained that the Dominican Republic has the fourth highest taxes on telecommunications of any country in the world, at 28 percent, and a 3 percent municipal tax appears likely to increase this burden even further. Pena said that the implementation of the 3 percent tax would send a strong negative signal to investors.  Ecuador  In August 2009, BNamericas reports that Ecuador's telecoms watchdog Senatel aims to end 2010 with 9,000 schools connected to the internet via broadband networks under a national scheme, compared to 1,900 today, with 4,000 of the new connections to be made this year. A further 11,000 schools are to be covered by other public-funded social programmes, universal access fund Fodetel told BNamericas, adding that state-run telco Corporacion Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (CNT) is currently handling all rollouts, and as yet there had been no plans announced to open up tenders to private sector broadband operators. The news site wrote that telecoms regulator Conatel lists ongoing projects to connect 759 schools at a cost of US$4.56 million, or an average of US$6,000 per school.  Mexico  According to CEO Telecom Briefings, Latin America 2009, Telmex considers that the goal to connect 15 million to broadband by 2012 is impossible. This is reportedly one of the administration's goals. The Government also hopes that by that date 70 million people will be able to connect to the Internet. According to data from INEGI, 20% of the population had access to the Internet. Mexico presented the AgendaDigital.mx in 2012 establishing goals to increase fixed and mobile broadband penetration to 38% by 2015. In June 2013 a reform Telecommunications was adopted establishing access to broadband and Internet as a constitutional right. The Reform also includes connectivity goals such as connecting at least 70% of Mexican households and 85% of SME's with the average OECD countries connection speed at competitive prices. As part of this reform the past regulator, the Comisi√≥n Federal de Telecomunicaciones (COFETEL) created by presidential decree in 1996 is to be replaced by a newly created organism the Insitituto Federal de Telecomunicacioneshttp://www.ift.org.mx/iftweb/ (IFT). COFETEL, now IFT, went from being a division of the Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) to become an independent constitutional body, the number of commissioners increased from five to seven and the selection of the commissioners changed. Previously, commissioners were appointed by the president with Senate approval. Under the recent Reform, the commissioners are elected by an Evaluation Committee who proposes a list of candidates that meet specific requirements established by law to the Executive, who selects a candidate(s) to be ratified by the Senate. In terms of financing, COFETEL depended on the allocation of a resources by the Ministry of Finance which limited its independent operation. The new IFT exercises its budget autonomously, according to the law 'the House will ensure the adequacy budget to enable the effective and timely exercise of its powers' (Article 28 LFT, 2013).  Europe   European Union  The Digital Agenda for Europe is one of the seven flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy. The objective is to bring \\"basic broadband\\" to all Europeans by 2013 and also to ensure that, by 2020, all Europeans have access to much higher internet speeds of above 30 Mbit/s and 50% or more of European households subscribe to internet connections above 100 Mbit/s. On 20 September 2010 the European Commission published a Broadband Communication, which describes measures the commission will take to achieve the targets of the Digital Agenda.  Austria  In October 2009, the European Commission called on the Austrian telecommunications regulator, RTR, to suspend the adoption of regulatory measures governing the broadband access market, finding that RTR provided \\"insufficient evidence\\" that mobile broadband connections can be considered substitutes for fixed-line DSL (digital subscriber line) and cable modem connections. RTR had proposed to define the broadband access market for residential customers as including mobile, DSL, and cable modem connections and to consider that market as competitive. RTR allegedly found that the retail broadband market for business customers was not competitive and that wholesale regulation of the market, including requiring \\"bitstream access\\", remained necessary. The EC disputed the conclusion that mobile connections are substitutes for fixed-line broadband connections, which would require that all three types of connections can be equally used for downloading music or films or providing sufficiently secure connections for Internet banking. The EC also questioned the definition of the relevant wholesale product market \\"as a sufficiently detailed forward-looking analysis of the different wholesale inputs is missing.\\" Previously, in 2003, the Campaign for Broadband Internet Connection initiative was launched, seeking to achieve blanket broadband by 2007. Information is scarce on whether the campaign was continued since the 2007 has come and passed without their goals being met.  Belgium  The Belgian government owns over 50% of the incumbent telco provider Belgacom. As of April 2009, at the request of BIPT (the Belgian Institute for Postal service and Telecommunications), the consultancy firms Analysys Mason and Hogan & Hartson has drawn up a report regarding the development of the broadband market in Belgium and suggested a certain number of possible actions to promote competition on this market. At the request of Mr Vincent van Quickenborne, Minister of Enterprise and Simplification, the suggested action items have been submitted to the sector for consultation. According to the 2017 statistics, there are still 12% of the houses in Belgium that have broadband services with a bandwidth of less than 30 Mbit/s. Proximus has started to deploy Hybrid Access Networks] by combining XDSL and LTE to address this problem .  Bulgaria  In March 2009, the ‚ÄúNational Program for Development of Broadband Access in Republic of Bulgaria‚Äù, issued by the State Agency for Information Technologies and Communication, set the following targets by the year 2013:ITU WSIS Stocktaking Report 2012 http://www.itu.int/wsis/stocktaking/docs/reports/S-POL-WSIS.REP-2012-PDF-E.pdf * 100% coverage of population at 10 Mbit/s in large cities * 90% coverage of population at 6 Mbit/s in medium cities * 30% coverage of population at 1 Mbit/s in rural areas (90% mobile broadband)  Croatia  The Government of the Republic of Croatia adopted on 13 October 2006 the Strategy for the development of broadband access to the Internet in the Republic of Croatia until 2008. The Strategy aims to reduce the gap between Croatia and European Union member states concerning the density level (penetration) of broadband Internet connections. Therefore, an ambitious goal has been set to achieve the density level of at least 12 percent, i.e. to number at least 500,000 broadband connections until the end of 2008. In January 2009, the government declared success. However, accepting the fact that in the area of the development of broadband Internet, new challenges stand before the Republic of Croatia. The Ministry of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure and the Central State Administrative Office for e-Croatia have initiated the drafting of the new Strategy for the development of broadband access to the Internet which would define strategic goals for the forthcoming period.  Czech Republic  To speed up the broadband network development and stimulate its use mainly by households and individuals, the Government adopted the \\"National Broadband Access Policy\\" in January 2005. The Policy is based on the OECD Council recommendations on promoting broadband development. Its main goal for the CR is to achieve a level of about 50% of the population to use broadband by 2010 at the latest.http://web.mvcr.cz/archiv2008/micr/scripts/detail.php_id_2185.html  Denmark  The existing strategy for the rollout and use of broadband in Denmark is based on the 2001 broadband plan 'From hardware to content'. The Danish Government follows up this strategy annually. According to a hearing in 2005, Denmark will continue to follow the main principles of the strategy. The political objective of the Danish Government is high transmission capacity for all, and strategies such as a national infrastructure that is rapid, inexpensive and secure, are needed to achieve this objective. The rollout of the IT infrastructure shall be developed by the private market with the Danish public sector serving as the driving force. For example, own IT investments by the public sector are intended to boost the demand for a digital infrastructure.  Estonia  The Estonian Information Society Strategy 2013 and the Estonian Electronic Communications Act reflect the basic principles of encouraging infrastructure investment, practicing technologically neutral policy and regulation and the primary role of the private sector in the expansion of broadband.  Finland  On 8 May 2008, Ms Suvi Lind√©n, Minister of Communications, appointed Mr Harri Pursiainen, permanent secretary, to study the means of ensuring a comprehensive broadband supply throughout the country and of organising its funding especially in non- built-up areas. The first part of the study includes a proposal for a government resolution and the second part examines the reasoning behind the proposal topic by topic. The report proposes that the public sector introduce business subsidies to enterprises that upgrade the public telecommunications network into a condition that makes available to most all citizens by 2015 an optical fibre or cable network supporting 100 Mbit connections. Prior to this goal, the speed of the broadband connection included in the universal service obligation must be raised to an average of 1 Mbit/s by 31 December 2010 at the latest. In order to finance the State contribution required for the target for 2015, it is proposed that certain radio frequencies coming up for allocation be auctioned. In the event that auction revenues are insufficient to cover the State's public aid for telecommunications infrastructure construction, the shortfall would be made up with a telecommunications network compensatory payment to be collected from telecommunications operators. The auction revenues and the compensatory payments could be entered as income and decisions on their use made either through the Budget or by means of a fund outside the Budget. Finland has passed a law making access to broadband a legal right for Finnish citizens. When the law went into effect in July 2010, every person in Finland, which has a population of around 5.3 million, will have the guaranteed right to a one-megabit broadband connection, says the Ministry of Transport and Communications The project was on track thanks especially to a huge uptake of mobile broadband. The guarantee increases to 10, 100 and 1 gigabit connections on fixed dates, a unique guarantee in the world. Energy-efficient datacentres, accounting for \\"0.5 to 1.5 per cent of total electricity consumption in Finland\\", which capture \\"heat generated by datacentres [to feed] it into district heating networks, and \\"a research programme on environmental monitoring and services\\" to \\"create new tools, standards and methods for environmental measurement, monitoring and decision- making... based on environmental data to improve the energy and material efficiency of infrastructures and industrial processes\\" were major goals of public research projects related to the broadband initiatives.  France  On 20 October 2008 the French Government announced sweeping measures to make France a leading digital economy by 2012. The plan outlines a strategy that the government will follow in the coming years to make France a leading digital economy. While many of the measures are obviously aimed at helping French companies, foreign companies will be able to benefit from the plan simply by creating a French subsidiary or by entering into strategic agreements with French companies or universities. The new plan will create opportunities for telecommunications operators, equipment manufacturers, content providers, web-based delivery platforms, game and software publishers, and universities in France.  Germany  In February 2009, the second Merkel cabinet approved a \\"broadband strategy\\" with stated aims of accelerating telecommunication and internet connectivity, closing gaps in underserved areas by the end of 2010, and ensuring nationwide access to high speed internet by 2014. Policy actions include upgrades to existing broadband infrastructure over the short term by deploying the entire range of feasible technologies ‚Äì whether cable, fiber optics, satellite, or wireless ‚Äì and utilizing the digital dividend resulting from frequencies no longer needed for broadcasting following digitalization. Accordingly, the regulatory agency BNetzA held a digital dividend spectrum auction in April through May 2010. The auctioned spectrum in the 800 MHz frequency band was sold to three of the four national mobile operators (Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone Germany, and O2) and is used to provide LTE service. After the 2013 federal election, the coalition agreement which led to the third Merkel cabinet included a goal to provide \\"nationwide coverage\\" of at least 50 Mbit/s internet access by 2018 through means of encouraging investments, reducing investment barriers and setting appropriate regulatory frameworks.  Greece  The governmental FTTH plan of 2M homes passed absolutely reasonable despite what has been said so far by many about the necessity of such an investment in terms of scale and scope. English translation  Ireland  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) aims to encourage and secure the provision of broadband services to targeted areas in Ireland in which broadband services are not currently available and are unlikely to be available in the near future. Following a broadband coverage mapping exercise to identify underserved areas and a competitive tendering process, a contract was awarded to \\"3\\" (a Hutchison Whampoa company) in December 2008, to implement and operate the NBS. Under the contract, 3 will be required to provide services to all premises in the NBS area that want service. In order to facilitate competition, 3 also will be required to provide wholesale access to any other authorized operator who wishes to serve the NBS area.  Latvia  In 2006 and 2007, Latvia carried out several small projects to increase internet access in Latvian provinces and a single major-scale project to increase broadband access in rural areas. The projects were implemented and co-financed by local governments and the central government, with the majority of the funding provided by EU structural funds. Latvia has listed internet access and availability promotion as an activity eligible for EU structural funds for the 2007‚Äì2013 EU budgetary period, but this activity is not designed to target rural areas or specifically increase broadband deployment. However, given Latvia's severe economic decline and the associated budgetary issues, the outlook for additional projects in the future is grim. Falling budget revenues have significantly limited Latvia's ability to co-finance any EU projects. There are bureaucratic obstacles as well, since Latvia has not yet adopted guidelines and evaluation criteria necessary to launch this program. One reason behind this delay is the GOL plan to reprioritize the national list of activities eligible for EU money in response to the crisis, increasing funding to the export sector. Internet access is not viewed by Latvian authorities as a significant problem; therefore, an increase in funding to communication infrastructure projects is unlikely. Furthermore, Latvia has decided to divert the funds the European Commission allocated to expansion of broadband networks, as part of the European Economic Recovery Plan, to projects in the dairy sector.  Lithuania  ;Rural Area Information Technology (RAIN) project ;002 project The Development Strategy of the Broadband Infrastructure of Lithuania for 2005‚Äì2010 was published in the official gazette on 31 December 2002. The Strategy goals are as follows: to create conditions for public administration institutions, bodies and individuals to obtain broadband access; to promote competition in the field of the Internet access provision on the market using public and private capital investments; to seek that the national social and economic growth would be influenced; to reduce the exclusion of the population in the territory of the country. When connecting public administration institutions and bodies to the broadband networks and creating an opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises as well as the population to use the broadband infrastructure and e-services all over the country's territory (especially in peripheral/uncompetitive locations where the level of use and development of wideband connection services is low), the following assessment criteria are important: # By 1 January 2007 in 50% of the country's territory to create an opportunity to connect to the available broadband networks for all small and medium-sized enterprises willing to do so as well as the population and to connect at least 40% of public administration institutions and bodies (i.e. educational institutions, libraries, health care institutions and bodies, etc.) to the broadband networks. # By 1 January 2008 in 50% of the country's territory to create an opportunity to connect to the available broadband networks for all small and medium-sized enterprises willing to do so as well as the population and to connect at least 60% of public administration institutions and bodies to the wideband connection networks. # By 1 January 2009 to connect 100% of public administration institutions and bodies (except for some diplomatic representations of the RepublicofLithuania abroad) to the broadband networks. # By 1 January 2010 in 98% of the country's territory to create an opportunity to connect to the available broadband networks for all small and medium-sized enterprises willing to do so as well as the population.  Netherlands  Nederland BreedbandLand (NBL) is the independent national platform for the provision of aid and incentives to the social sectors for the 'better and smarter' use of broadband.  Poland  Newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza writes that the Polish government has drafted a new law regulating broadband network deployments and will put it to a parliamentary vote in late October or early November. The law would, for example, require every multiresidential house in the country from 2010 to be connected with fibre, define rules for local governments to invest in broadband in areas that are not viable for commercial roll-outs, as well as set a framework for using utility infrastructure to accommodate network equipment. If approved as planned, the legislation could become effective as of January 2010. ;Significance The new regulations are part of the government's broadband strategy, which aims at bringing 100% of Poland's households and businesses within the coverage of broadband infrastructure by 2013 or 2014, partially using European Union (EU) fundingSee Poland: 2 April 2009: Polish Government Plans to Direct 300 mil. Euro to Broadband Expansion. In the meantime, telecoms regulator UKE is also in discussions with the local incumbent, TP, over the company's mid-term capex strategy, trying to agree on an investment level that would contribute to the goals of the national broadband strategy. In order to boost the investment, the UKE has softened some of its policies upon the incumbent, most significantly in regard with vertical separation, which it has put on hold for the time being, and wholesale access fees, which it has reportedly offered to freeze for the next couple of years.  Portugal  In January 2009, Portugal's government announced an 800-million-euro credit line for the roll-out of next-generation broadband networks in the country. Prime Minister Jos√© S√≥crates announced the funding, saying he hoped the country's main telecoms operators would invest one billion euro to build NGNs during 2009. The credit line forms part of an agreement between the government and the operators Portugal Telecom, ZON Multim√©dia, Sonaecom, and ONI on the roll-out of fibre networks, and is the first step in a 2.18-billion-euro plan announced in December 2008 to boost the country's economy. Prime Minister Socrates said the credit line would pave the way for improvements in high-speed internet, television and voice services, adding: \\"This is the launch of the first measure of the stimulus plan to combat the economic crisis.\\" ;Development Through Fibre Portugal's PM said he hoped the investment would allow up to 1.5 million homes and businesses to be connected to the new fibre networks. He added that the government has no preference regarding how the networks are rolled out by the operators, leaving them to reach a decision among themselves on whether single or multiple networks are constructed. Although the terms of the credit line have not been disclosed, they are likely to be highly favourable to the operators, and may represent a timely cash injection‚Äîas the global economic crisis bites, operator spending in reined in and private investment sources dry up. Portugal's broadband market showed strong growth, not least due to widespread cable and DSL networks. ADSL2+ services are also available from alternative operators such as Vodafone and cable data speeds at up to 100 Mbit/s were trialled in 2007. The Portuguese government had set a goal of 50% home broadband penetration by 2010, and this latest investment should allow the operators to significantly surpass this target.  Romania  In May 2009, while broadband Internet access increased by 30 percent last year, Romania's penetration rate is still half that of the EU average. Both the newly reorganized National Authority for Administration and Regulations in Communications (ANCOM) and the renamed Ministry of Communication and Information Society (MCIS) have repeatedly expressed interest in further expanding broadband access. To this end, MCIS issued a new broadband strategy for 2009 to 2015, but has yet to identify how to implement or fund the strategy. This cable responds to Department's reftel request for information on country broadband deployment initiatives. In his first press conference on 9 April, new ANCOM President Catalin Marinescu stated his main goal would be to increase the number of broadband Internet connections. Due to the expansion of the 3G network, mobile access connections to the Internet reached 2.7 million users in 2008, which is almost double the number in 2007. Despite a 30 percent increase in access in 2008, Romania's broadband penetration is still only about 11.7 percent, which is less than half of the EU average of 22.9 percent. ANCOM suggestions for increasing broadband deployment in Romania include: # Review local loop access conditions that were unsuccessfully regulated in 2003; # stimulate operators with existing 3G licenses to expand services and/or reorganize the 3G band in order to grant one or two additional licenses to companies (there are currently four 3G licensed operators in Romania); # reissue a WiMax tender for the 3.5‚Äì3.7 GHz band. A 2008 attempt to grant WiMax licenses failed due to the high cost. ANCOM hopes the Government will lower the cost in order to increase commercial interest in the coming year. A precondition for accessing EU structural funds in this area is the adoption of a national broadband strategy. The MCIS's 2009‚Äì2015 strategy for broadband wireless access establishes an inter-ministerial working group responsible for implementation of infrastructure projects for broadband service expansion. Additionally, Minister of Communication Gabriel Sandu claims he will identify other financing sources, such as crisis funds, governmental funds and private funds to increase broadband deployment to rural areas.  Slovenia  In 2004, Slovenia issued the Strategy for Development of Broadband Networks, effective 2004‚Äì2006. The main principles included: # The primary role of the market and competition in broadband development; # formulating measures to activate the public sector, especially where private sector interest is lacking; # expanding broadband connections in public administration and stimulating e-government services; # stimulating competition between different types of infrastructure and services. Slovenia is preparing a new strategy for development of broadband networks, which will focus on simulating of private sector development of rural and scarcely populated areas.  Spain  Since 2005, the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade has granted financial aids to operators in order to encourage their investments in areas where there would unlikely have been any broadband deployment. Two main programmes compose the Spanish strategy to provide broadband Internet access to rural and isolated areas: * National Programme for Broadband roll-out in rural and remote areas: PEBA (2005‚Äì2008) * Avanza Infrastructures Programme (2008‚Äì2012) In order to ensure consecution of the programme objectives, not duplication of investments and not distortion of competition, specific service and operative requirements were required to both projects and beneficiary operators. Service requirements consisted on providing broadband access with a minimum download speed and a maximum monthly fee. Additionally, the program operative requirements consisted on: # Technological neutrality so that any type of broadband technology could be deployed and to avoid technology obsolescence; # the duty of the beneficiaries to open up the financed networks to competition; # infrastructure investments in well-defined and not serviced areas in order to avoid duplicative investments. Taking into account cabled technologies such as DSL are distance sensitive, and generally only feasible within a few miles of the nearest central office switch, PEBA projects were not limited to a single technology. At present, several technological solutions (ADSL, WiMAX, Satellite and HFC) are being used to provide broadband access to the PEBA population centres, depending on their geographic features, roll‚Äìout dates and available technology. Following Peba achievements and within the Avanza Infrastructures Program, the Ministry has continued working to increase broadband coverage in very small population centres. Additionally and taken into account advances in technology and the need not only to provide broadband access but also to improve the service quality and speed, the objective was also to improve bandwidth and network capacity provided by telcos at rural areas. Two action lines compose the broadband strategy under this funding program: :F1: Projects intended to deploy access infrastructures in order to satisfy the demand for broadband connection from population in isolated and rural areas. :F2: Projects intended to improve speed and capacity of rural backbone networks F1 action line projects will be based mainly on wireless broadband access technologies such as: HSDPA, WIMAX and Satellite although some of the beneficiary operators are already planning to provide ADSL connection at some population centres. F2 projects will mostly improve transport networks by means of fibre optics and WiMAX radio links. On 15 October 2009, Spain's Ministry of Industry has opened a public consultation on extending the concept of universal service to cover broadband access. The consultation concerns topics such as the minimum speed, the use of wireless technologies for broadband provision, related pricing models, and the schedule for service implementation. ;Significance At the moment, the mandate for universal service covers narrowband internet access, but as speeds of such services have become increasingly inadequate for responding to typical user needs, the government is now assessing whether connection over broadband should be defined as a legal right. As of end-June this year, according to regulator CMT, accesses defined as narrowband accounted for 2.4% of all 9.547 million internet subscriptions, against 5.2% a year earlier; in meanwhile, of the broadband accesses those at speeds below 1 Mbit/s accounted represented 0.4% of the total. IHS Global Insight's view is that the allocation of lower frequency bands such as 800 and 900 MHz for data services will be in the main role if the Spanish government wants to bring broadband to every citizen. Thus far, incumbent Telef√≥nica has used WiMAX and satellite connections to live up its universal service mandate in some of the more remote areas of the country, yet we believe that by expanding its mobile broadband network by using the lower frequencies it could achieve the same more cost-efficiently.  Sweden  The goal of Sweden's Information Technology Policy is that Sweden should be a sustainable information society for all. This implies an accessible information society with a modern infrastructure and IT services of public benefit, so as to simplify everyday life and give people in every part of the country a better quality of life. IT should contribute to a better quality of life and help improve and simplify everyday life for people and companies, but it should also be used to promote sustainable growth. An effective and secure physical infrastructure for IT, with high transmission capacity, should be available in all parts of the country so as to give people access to, among other things, interactive public e-services. For broadband, the Swedish and European IT policy aims to increase accessibility to an infrastructure with capacity for broadband transmission. Broadband among other things, promotes economic growth by creating new services and opening up new investment and employment opportunities. The objective is broadband for all households (permanent housing) and business and public operations. According to the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority, 'broadband' in this objective, refers to connections that can be upgraded to a transmission rate downstream of at least 2 Mb per second. Between 2001 and 2007, Sweden's broadband support program included: * Total state governmental funding 817 million $ (5.25 billion SEK) * Total investment: Government 51%; Municipalities 11%; Operators 30%; EU structural funds 7%; Regional policy funds 1% * Concentrating on rural and other areas where the market will not supply infrastructure * Open procurement process * Requirement that networks should be operator-neutral * 85% of investments used for new infrastructure  United Kingdom  The United Kingdom issued its \\"Digital Britain\\" report in June 2009. > The Universal Service Commitment.

Other European countries   Norway  According to the statement of the political platform for the parties in Government7 dated 13 October 2005, the level of ambition for broadband rollout is to rise. The rollout of broadband throughout the entire country offers great potential to the business sector in the form of development and the setting up of more businesses, while reducing the difficulties of great distances. The tangible objectives of Government policy include: * Broadband should be available throughout Norway by the end of 2007 * Unreasonable geographical price differences for broadband connection should not exist * Government funding will contribute to broadband rollout in those areas where rollout is not ensured by market players.  Russia  On 17 September 2009, Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Sobyanin has indicated that a special government commission will meet in October to discuss the development of broadband services in Russia, reports Prime-Tass. Issues to be considered will include the enhancement of broadband access quality and the increase of data-transfer speeds. Sobyanin also stated that the government would allocate 10 billion roubles (US$326.7 million) towards the development of various high- tech projects in 2010, aimed at carrying out technological upgrades in various sectors of the Russian economy. Earlier in the week Communications and Mass Media Minister Igor Shchyogolev stated that the government viewed the construction of main communications lines and the development of broadband and digital TV services as the top priorities of the telecoms industry. ;Significance The words of the deputy prime minister and communications minister highlight the importance with which the development of broadband services in the country is viewed. Broadband has taken over from mobile as the sector of highest growth potential in Russia, with the Communications Ministry reporting a fourfold increase in internet traffic in 2008. The market is heterogeneous, with no single dominant operator, but instead a number of players employing a variety of technologies. Although uptake has typically been centred on the economic hubs of the capital Moscow and St Petersburg, operators are increasingly expanding towards the regions for further opportunities. With operators continuing to invest in the broadband sector, subscriber uptake growing, and now increasing signals of interest from the government, IHS Global Insight expects the sector to continue to grow healthily in the short and medium terms.  Switzerland  On 7 October 2009, the Swiss Federal Office of Communications (ComCom) has revealed that round table discussions on the deployment of fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) networks are producing concrete results. According to the regulator the major players are now in agreement on uniform technical standards, meaning that there are no technical barriers to the rapid expansion of the fibre network. A consensus has also been reached on coordination, which will prevent the parallel construction of new networks by laying multiple fibres in every building (known as the multiple fibre model). At the same time the participants at the round table have agreed that all providers must have access to the fibre-optic network under the same conditions, so as to protect end-users' freedom of choice. The participants drew up further recommendations for standardised network access by services. Thanks to an open interface, service providers will enjoy network access to customers at all times via network operators. If, at a later date, the customer opts for a different service provider on the same fibre-optic network, the switch will be possible without any technical complications. The roundtable discussions involve cable network operators, telecoms companies and electricity utilities. Further roundtables and working groups will be held to clarify points. ComCom will also examine whether new regulatory measures are needed to govern FTTH deployment, with the aim of reporting to parliament by mid-2010 at the latest.  Africa   Botswana  Following the further liberalization of the Botswana telecommunications sector in 2004, the Government embarked on a new licensing structure in 2006. That action was designed to move the country from the pre-existing licensing framework, which made the distinction between the various telecoms services, to a service-neutral structure with the view of accommodating technological convergence. Currently, the only operator offering fixed-line broadband services is state-owned Botswana Telecommunications Corporation (BTC), which has launched ADSL services. However, the larger ISPs are also rolling out broadband wireless networks, mainly in Gaborone (the capital), to serve corporate customers in particular. Mobile operator Orange launched its broadband wireless service in June 2008 using a WiMAX network in Gaborone. The total number of broadband subscribers increased to an estimated 3,500 in 2007, up from 1,800 in 2006 and 1,600 in 2005, with broadband comprising a growing proportion of total internet accounts. BTC offers a range of data services including Frame Relay, ISDN, ADSL, MPLS and a broadband wireless service known as Wireless FastConnect. The data market has been liberalized, with ISPs now holding value-added network service (VANS) provider licenses. BTC enjoyed a monopoly over international bandwidth until February 2001 when the regulator began issuing international data gateway licenses. BTC's international bandwidth reached the 200-Mbit/s mark during 2008, some 90% of which (180 Mbit/s) was supplied via cross-border fiber networks to neighboring countries and 10% (20 Mbit/s) by satellite. During 2004, BTC began the deployment of ADSL and a domestic two-way VSAT network for areas beyond the reach of terrestrial infrastructure. During September 2008, BTC completed the roll-out of the Trans-Kalahari fiber-optic project, connecting Botswana to the neighboring countries of Namibia and Zambia. The 2,000-kilometre system was built in three parts: phase 1 runs from Jwaneng through Ghanzi to Mamuno (the border with Namibia); phase 2 runs from Ghanzi via Maun to Orapa; and the phase 3 runs from Sebina via Nata, Kasane to Ngoma (the border with Zambia). The network is designed to provide onward connectivity to submarine cables, removing the dependence on transiting through South Africa to reach the Sat-3/WASC and S.A.F.E (Southern Africa Far East) submarine cable systems. BTC is a signatory to three submarine cable projects (EASSy, WAFS and AWCC) and the government is in tripartite discussions with Angola and Namibia to assist each other in realizing the most effective means of achieving connectivity to these cable systems: * East Africa Submarine System (EASSy), which will run along the eastern coast of Africa from Port Sudan (Sudan) to Mtunzini (South Africa) via Mombasa (Kenya), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) and Maputo (Mozambique). * West Africa Festoon System (WAFS), the planned cable that will run along the western coast of Africa from Nigeria through Gabon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola and possibly Namibia. * Africa West Coast Cable (AWCC), planned to run along the western coast of Africa from South Africa and Namibia to the United Kingdom. The proposed AWCC was replaced by the West Africa Submarine Cable (WASC), which awarded a supply contract to Alcatel-Lucent in April 2009.  Egypt  Broadband access, mainly the DSL variety, is still in its infancy. Local loop unbundling for DSL access was introduced in April 2002 to kick-start broadband uptake, but real growth occurred only after a government initiative in May 2004 that mandated a 50% tariff cut for unbundling. As part of the government's e-Readiness initiative, a strategy of public-private partnership is being aggressively pursued in the Internet sector to accelerate Internet and broadband uptake.  Ghana  On 23 July 2009, the government of Ghana has signed a US$150 million contract with Chinese equipment manufacturer Huawei Technologies for the supply of advanced telecoms infrastructure to ensure broadband internet access countrywide within the next two years. The Minister of Communications, Haruna Iddrisu, told delegates at a conference on Business process outsourcing (BPO) that the infrastructure would link internet Point of Presence (POP) in all district capitals under the government's ICT Backbone Development Programme. The minister added that the government was committed to ensuring it developed the human resources needed to promote the country as a prospect for BPO companies, and said Ghana was working hard to ensure the legislative regime was right encourage inward investment under the e-legislation programme. 'During the year the Ministry of Communications will also facilitate the development of additional legislations in the area of data protection and intellectual property for investors in the area of data capturing and management to operate within the confines of international guidelines and rules,' he said. His words were echoed by Vice President John Dramani Mahama who stressed Ghana's commitment to developing the nation's ICT backbone capabilities. 'In addition to the SAT3 connectivity, GLO-1 and MaiOne will commence the construction of two additional landing stations by the end of this year to take care of the issues of bandwidth redundancy,' he said. In May 2007, the government of Ghana launched the \\"Wiring Ghana\\" project, a $250 million nationwide 4,000 kilometer fiber-optic backbone project that promises to dramatically increase Ghana's broadband bandwidth supply, reportedly to a capacity of STM-16 nationwide. The government's goal is to provide an open-access, nationwide broadband connectivity to boost economic development. As of May 2008, Phase I of the project that covers the south and mid-country had been completed. Rollout of the second and final phase is underway and is slated to be completed by December 2009. Ghana's project will also provide fiber-optic connections with the neighboring countries of Burkina Faso to the north and Togo to the east. Ghana's broadband market, divided between ADSL and wireless broadband services, was small at the end of 2008, a total of about 26,500 subscribers, ADSL 53% and wireless WiFi/WiMax 47%.  Kenya  In May 2009, Kenya will revolutionize its telecom industry when it initiates its first fiber optic internet connection on 27 June. This broadband connection will vastly improve the quality of internet access to Kenya and contiguous landlocked countries. With increased internet capacity, the fiber will improve local bandwidth quality and potentially decrease communication costs, as it complements the existing and widely used satellite communication networks. The increased bandwidth capabilities will improve the competitiveness of existing businesses, create growth in new industries such as knowledge-based businesses and business process outsourcing, and significantly increase access to information for end-users, schools, and universities. The Government of Kenya (GOK) expects foreign investment in the sector to hit $10 billion in 2009. Septel will report how this connection and other broadband initiatives will affect rural and underserved areas. From Patrick Boateng's June 2009 report: on broadband, the Kenyan government has recently taken several steps to boost the country's future international bandwidth by committing to several planned submarine cable projects. As an example, in September 2006, Kenya's cabinet decided, after further delays to the proposed East African Submarine Cable System (EASSy), to proceed with its plan to build its own submarine cable, the East Africa Marine System (TEAMS) Ltd. In November 2006, the government signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with UAE's fixed-line incumbent, Etisalat, to build a submarine cable from Mombasa to Al Fujairah in the UAE. In a February 2007 Kenyan government contract award to U.S. Company, Tyco Telecommunications, the company conducted an undersea survey for the project. In October 2007, after the completion of the marine survey, Alcatel-Lucent won the bid to build the cable, and service is expected to begin at the end of the third quarter 2009. In 2008, Kenya adopted a National ICT Policy and enacted the Kenya Communications Amendment Act. Backed by a new ICT Sector Master Plan (2008‚Äì2012) and a projected budget of $812.5 million, the main goals of this move are to develop regulations that will provide an enabling environment for leveraging the new broadband capacity, and to improve the ICT sector in general. Meanwhile, a third submarine cable funded by South African and other investors, Sea Cable System (SEACOM), landed in Mombasa in May 2009 and is expected to be operational by July 2009. EASSy is slowly in progress and is expected to land in Mombasa in 2010. Also on the horizon are two additional submarine cables, Orange's Lion which will run from Mombasa to Madagascar to Mauritius and Reunion; and FLAG Telecom NGN System II cable.  Nigeria  On 6 March 2009, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has partnered with Nigerian WiMAX operator ipNX to bring broadband access to all 36 states in the country through the 'State Accelerated Bandwidth Initiative' (SABI). Ifeanyi Amah, executive director of ipNX, commented: 'The move to empower Nigerians with broadband internet access started almost two years ago. Our intention is to take our products and services to other regions. Our commitment in that direction can be seen through our partnership with NCC on SABI'. The project has been long-delayed, having been postponed because of government red tape and a lack of budget. According to TeleGeography's GlobalComms database, at the start of 2009 three companies were given letters of intent from the NCC: ipNX, MTN and a Wi-Fi alliance of several ISPs. The first phase of the project will cover the 36 state capitals, before being extended to government buildings. Nigeria as a whole can be classified as unserved. The Project arm of SABI consisted of a reverse bid process where broadband providers were invited to state the minimum subsidy each provider required to deploy broadband coverage to all 37 state capital cities in the Country and the three lowest bidders would be appointed. The subsidies were limited to: # CPEs for the first 3,000 subscribers per city. (to enable a critical mass for each city sustainable network) # Bandwidth supply for the first one year. The process is complete and three providers have been selected and approved by the Federal Government and they are IPNX, MTN, and NAIJA-WIFI (The latter being a consortium of about 15‚Äì20 ISPs.) One of the providers has started deployment and completed Kano (capital of Kano State in Northern Nigeria) which was launched in May. They are scheduled to launch in Ibadan, capital of Oyo State next month. Currently, the broadband market in Nigeria is in its infancy and is predominantly wireless, rather than wireline, and is dominated by the fixed wireless access operators. Consequently, the market structure has been determined more by the licensing and regulation of the radio spectrum space rather than by unbundling of the local loop. VSAT remains the predominant form of broadband Internet access. It is estimated that 51.1% of Internet users are connected by VSAT, 24% by broadband wireless, 3.4% by DSL, 9.3% via dial-up, 8.7% by cable/satellite and the remainder by Wi-Fi and leased lines. The introduction of a unified licensing regime from February 2006 is having far-reaching consequences by increasing the scope of the operating licenses of different fixed-line and mobile operators. At least two Nigerian ISPs have expanded services into other countries in West Africa. Intercellular, one of the PTOs, has been granted a license to operate in Sierra Leone. It has also applied for licenses in Benin, Chad, Guinea, Liberia, and Mali. Meanwhile, Hyperia, a leading Nigerian ISP, has announced the launch of two new wireless broadband services: a new WiMAX service in Port Harcourt and a two-way broadband VSAT service. Hyperia awarded a contract to Navini Networks, and has now launched the 3.5 GHz WiMAX service in Port Harcourt. The ISP also awarded a contract to Gilat Satellite Networks, to provide a SkyEdge broadband satellite hub and several hundred VSAT terminals. The VSAT network uses both C band and , and its hub and will be deployed at Hyperia's network operations center in London (U.K.). The VSAT network will enable Hyperia to expand its services in West Africa and to provide multiple services including broadband IP, telephony, and videoconferencing. Transmission networks are the crux for the whole Nigerian telecommunications sector. New mobile operators, fixed-wireless access (FWA) operators, and ISPs require a robust national transmission backbone to link base stations, mobile switches, and POPs together with long-haul upstream bandwidth. In the absence of a reliable backbone, satellite has provided transmission and backhaul capacity, as well as international connectivity. NITEL has access to Sat-3/WASC and is gradually upgrading its national transmission capacity. Globacom launched its \\"Glo Xpress\\" long-distance transmission service in July 2005, and private operators continue to invest heavily in the roll-out of their own microwave and wireless networks. The regulator Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has liberalized the long-distance market, and in addition to the two national carriers, there are now seven national long- distance operator (NLDOs) that are investing in the roll-out of fiber backbones in different regions of the country. The mobile operators have also deployed their own independent national fiber and microwave backbones, and the unified access license granted to the mobile operators would allow them to commercialize these backbones. A key factor has been the entry of foreign operators into this market, through the acquisition of Nigerian operators. Nigeria has several Gbit/s of international bandwidth, of which NITEL was only serving some 310 Mbit/s using the Sat-3/WASC cable, even though this only represents a fraction of the capacity that it owns on the cable. The balance of Nigeria's international bandwidth is provided entirely by satellite. Of up to six new submarine cables that would land in Nigeria, contracts have been awarded for two: Glo-1, and Main-1 (the others include AWCC, WAFS, Infinity, and Uhurunet). Glo-1 is expected to enter into service in 2009 and Main-1 from May 2010. In the medium term, the introduction of new submarine cables and national backbones linking Lagos to inland cities and towns will squeeze satellite operators, which have met the demand for services and filled the vacuum for data infrastructure. Following is a list of key broadband networks underway: * National Carriers: Both national fixed-line operators NITEL and Globacom, and leading national mobile operators, MTN and Zain, are all rolling out their own fiber-optic network infrastructure. * Alheri Engineering Co Ltd: Alheri Engineering, which was awarded one of the 3G licenses, has a two- pronged strategy. First, it will provide a carriers' carrier service to other operators, and plans to roll out a fiber transmission network in three phases. The first phase runs from Benin to Warri, the second from Benin to Port Harcourt, and the third from Aba to Jos. The second prong is to offer 3G services, and in May 2007 the company submitted a bid for the fourth mobile operator M-Tel. * Backbone Connectivity Network Ltd (BCN): BCN began the roll- out of fiber backbone in the northern states of Nigeria in July 2006. The first phase involves the roll-out of 700 kilometers of fiber from Abuja (the federal capital) to Kano via Kaduna and Zaria. The second phase will form a ring running from Kano via Katsina, Malumfashi, Funtua, Zaria, Abuja, Akwanga, Jos, Bauchi, Gombe, Biu, Yola, Bamboa, Maiduguri, Damaturu, Potaskum, Azare, and Dutse back to Kano. The third phase will run from Sokoto to Abuja via Birnin Kebbi, Kamba, Yelwa Yauri, Kontagora, Bida, and Minna. * Multi-Links Telecommunications Co Ltd (MLTC): Multi-Links, which was acquired by South African incumbent Telkom SA in March 2007, is deploying a fiber network in the south-west of the country, and has a fiber backbone running from Lagos to Abuja. Multi-links had deployed some 2,500 kilometers of fiber-optic network by mid-2008, completed a metro Ethernet ring in Lagos, and will roll out Ethernet rings in Kano, Kaduna and the Niger Delta region. * Phase3 Telecom: Phase3 Telecom won a 15-year concession in March 2006 to operate the fiber- optic cables strung over the high-voltage electricity transmission network of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) in the west of the country. The current fiber network included in the concession is some 1,500 kilometers in length, including a 900-kilometre stretch from Lagos to the federal capital, Abuja (via Ibadan, Oshogbo, Jebba, Shiriro, and Minna), and the operator plans to expand this to 3,000 kilometers over an 18-month period. Phase3 Telecom plans to wholesale service and provide long-distance carrier services to other licensed operators, including mobile operators, private telecommunication operators, ISPs, and others. In December 2008, Phase 3 entered into a deal facilitated by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to extend its carrier network to Benin, Togo, Ghana, C√¥te d'Ivoire, and Senegal using the high-voltage power transmission lines in these ECOWAS states. According to the Phase 3 Telecom's CEO Stanley Jegede, the project is part of ECOWAS' Intelcom II program to interconnect West African countries by fiber- optic networks. * Suburban Telecoms: Suburban Telecoms has formed a joint venture with Ocean and Oil Holdings (OOH) Ltd to deploy a fiber MAN along a gas pipeline currently being deployed in Lagos by Gaslink. Suburban awarded a contract to Huawei and ATC that covers the deployment of 3,500 kilometers of fiber-optic cable. Suburban Telecoms has ambitions to become not just an MAN in Lagos, but also in other major Nigerian cities. The operator has a three- phased approach: in the first phase, it will connect major cities including Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja, Kano, Kaduna, Benin, Makurdi, Enugu, Onitsha, and Port Harcourt; in the second and third phases it will connect secondary population centers between these cities, and then extensions to other cities after that. * Victoria Garden City Communications Ltd (VGC Communications): VGC had a customer base of 20,000 in 2007, and operates a fiber MAN in Lagos, where it has laid some 120 kilometers of fiber-optic cables connecting the suburb of Victoria Garden City with Victoria Island, Ikoyi, Ikeja, Marina, Costain, and MayfairGardens. * Submarine Cables: In addition to the Sat-3/WASC submarine cable that lands at Lagos, contracts have been awarded for at least two more cables. NITEL retains exclusivity on access to Sat-3/WASC, and so the introduction of competition is expected to increase capacity dramatically and drive down prices. * Glo-1: Globacom, the SNO and mobile operator, announced in August 2008 that its Glo-1 submarine cable, which will run from the United Kingdom to Lagos and Port Harcourt (Nigeria), was \\"nearing completion\\" and would be finished by May 2009. Alcatel-Lucent began laying the Glo-1 cable from Bude in May 2007 and by October 2007 it had been deployed as far as Senegal. In August 2008, Globacom said that the final phase is due to begin shortly and will see the remaining section of cable laid from Lagos northwards to reach the other half of the cable in Senegal. The 9,330 km submarine cable will have a capacity of 32 STM-64 circuits (totaling 318.4 Gbit/s). A dedicated link will also be leased through the trans-Atlantic Apollo 2 cable from Cornwall (U.K.) to the United States. Globacom had initially secured access to Sat-3/WASC through a leasing agreement with NITEL, but abandoned this and in August 2004 unveiled a plan to build its own private submarine cable, called Glo-1, from Lagos to the United Kingdom. * Main-1: Main Street Technologies, a Nigerian company, announced in April 2008 that it had awarded a supply contract to Tyco Telecommunications to build its Main One submarine cable. The 14,000-kilometre cable has a capacity of 1.28 Tbit/s and will be built in two phases that are both scheduled to be completed in May 2010: phase 1 will connect Nigeria, Ghana, and Portugal, and phase 2 will connect to Angola and South Africa. The Main One Cable is a private system that will provide open access to regional telecom operators and ISPs. * Other submarine cables: At least five other cables are planned to land in Nigeria. The Africa West Coast Cable (AWCC) would run from South Africa to Europe via Nigeria, the West African Festoon System (WAFS) would run from Angola to Nigeria, connecting those countries that do not have Sat-3 landing points, the Infinity Worldwide Group of Companies plans a West African cable that would include Nigeria, NEPAD plans a cable, called Uhurunet, which would encircle the whole continent and have a landing point in Nigeria, and the proposed ACE (Africa Coast to Europe) cable would run from Gabon to France via Nigeria and 19 other African countries.  South Africa  The government passed the Electronic Communications Act in 2006 and is dramatically restructuring the sector towards a converged framework, converting vertically integrated licenses previously granted to PSTN, mobile, USAL, PTN and VANS operators into new Electronic Communications Network Services (ECNS), Electronic Communications Services (ECS), or broadcasting licenses. In January 2009, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) granted ECS and ECNS licenses to over 500 VANS operators. The South African market is in the process of being dramatically restructured, moving away from old-style, vertically integrated segments under the 1996 Telecommunications Act and 2001 Telecommunications Amendment Act towards horizontal service layers, and the new-style licensing regime is being converted to accommodate this. This process involves the conversion of pre-existing licenses into new Individual or Class Electronic Communications Network Services (ECNS), Electronic Communications Services (ECS), or broadcasting licenses. Licenses are also required for radio frequency spectrum, except for very low power devices. ICASA granted ECNS licenses during December 2007 to seven new under-serviced area licenses (USAL) operators. The new licensees include PlatiTel, Ilembe Communications, Metsweding Telex, Dinaka Telecoms, Mitjodi Telecoms, and Nyakatho Telecoms. South Africa had an estimated 6 million internet users in 2008 and the number of fixed (wireless and wireline) broadband subscribers is estimated at 750,000. Telkom reported 491,774 ADSL subscribers (Q3 2008), with the remainder using wireless broadband networks. South Africa's total international bandwidth reached the 10 Gbit/s mark during 2008, and its continued increase is being driven primarily by the uptake of broadband and lowering of tariffs. Three new submarine cable projects will soon bring more capacity to South Africa from 2009‚Äîthe SEACOM cable is expected to enter service in June 2009 and supply contracts have been awarded for both the EASSy and WACS cables. While the internet user base increased to an estimated 6 million in 2008, the growth curve of paying internet accounts is recognized to be flattening. Meanwhile, the number of broadband subscribers is estimated to have grown quickly to reach about 750,000, split between Telkom's ADSL service (491,774 subscribers by 30 September 2008), and broadband wireless services provided by WBS, Sentech and others. Dial-up subscribers are migrating to broadband, and then escalating to higher-bandwidth packages as they become available. The South African market is split into two main tiers: top-tier internet access providers; and downstream retail ISPs. ISPs are licensed as value-added network service (VANS) providers, although under the Electronic Communications Act of 2006, these licenses were converted in January 2009 to individual or class electronic communication service (ECS) licenses. All domestic ISPs gain international connectivity through one of the internet access providers: SAIX (Telkom), Neotel, Verizon Business, The Internet Solution, MTN Network Solutions, DataPro and Posix Systems. Following the deregulation of the VANS industry in South Africa, a number of leading operators have diversified from being a top-tier ISP to becoming a converged communications service provider offering a range of voice and data services, particularly voice over IP, through the conversion of VANS licenses into ECS licenses. The total number of wireless broadband subscribers overtook that of fixed broadband subscribers in South Africa during 2007. The total number of broadband subscribers is estimated at 750,000 by late 2007, of which Telkom reported 335,112 ADSL subscribers. Wireless Business Solutions (WBS) launched the iBurst system in South Africa in late 2004, and had a subscriber base of 45,000 by July 2007, up from 2,500 subscribers by February 2005. Sentech had about 4,000 MyWireless subscribers in 2007, up from 2,500 in 2006. With delays to local loop unbundling (LLU), which would give ISPs access to exchanges, operators are deploying a range of broadband wireless networks. While the mobile operators are deploying HSDPA, W-CDMA and EDGE networks and entering the broadband space, operators are also deploying WiMAX, iBurst, and CDMA systems. Telkom, Sentech, Neotel, WBS and the under-serviced areas licensees (USALs) have currently been given commercial WiMAX licenses. Telkom launched full commercial WiMAX services in June 2007, first at 14 sites in Pretoria, Cape Town and Durban, and a further 57 sites are planned for 2007/8. Another 10 operators, including M-Web and Vodacom, were granted temporary test licenses and are awaiting spectrum to be allocated by ICASA. In May 2008, WBS partnered with Vodacom and Intel Corporation to roll out an 802.16e WiMAX network. The key upcoming development is that supply contracts have been awarded for three submarine cables that will land in South Arica‚ÄîSEACOM, EASSy, and WACS. The data sector is a key area for growth in both the corporate data and residential data markets. South Africa is currently served by two submarine cables: SAT-2 and the SAT-3/WASC/SAFE system. Contracts have been awarded for the following three additional submarine cables that will land in South Africa from June 2009: * SEACOM: The SEACOM submarine cable landing at Mombasa is due to enter commercial service in June 2009. The cable runs from South Africa to Egypt via Mozambique, Madagascar, Tanzania, Kenya, Djibouti and Saudi Arabia, connecting eastwards through to India and westwards through the Mediterranean. * East African Submarine Cable System (EASSy): The planned EASSy will run from South Africa (Mtunzini) to Egypt via Mombasa (Kenya) and other East African countries. The cable will run as far north as Djibouti and Port Sudan, with onward connectivity to Europe provide by the Europe India Gateway (EIG) cable. In March 2007, a 23-member consortium behind EASSy signed a supply contract with Alcatel-Lucent. * West African Cable System (WACS). In April 2009, the WACS consortium signed a construction and maintenance agreement, and awarded a supply contract to Alcatel-Lucent for a 14,000-kilometre cable to provide connectivity between South Africa, Portugal and the United Kingdom via 11 other African countries. With a minimum design capacity of 3.84 Terabit/s, WACS will connect South Africa to the United Kingdom with landings in 12 countries: Namibia, Angola, DRC, Congo, Cameroon, Nigeria, Togo, Ghana, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Cape Verde, the Canary Islands, and Portugal. The WACS consortium comprises 11 parties: Angola Telecom, Broadband Infraco (see below), Cable & Wireless, MTN, Portugal Telecom, Sotelco, Tata Communications, Telecom Namibia, Telkom SA, Togo Telecom and Vodacom. The cable is expected to be ready for service during 2011.  Uganda  On 13 October 2009, Uganda's ICT Minister Aggrey Awori announces the establishment of the Uganda Broadband Infrastructure Strategy Team (UBIST). The team he said comprises representatives from Government, Regulator, Operators, Internet Service Providers, Other investors/consumers, Civil Society and academia. UBIST will provide government with a well informed position for enabling it to access International Broadband Infrastructure. The government is also studying a number of policies for the effective implementation of the National Broadband strategy.  Asia   Hong Kong, S.A.R. of China  The Digital 21 Strategy was first published in 1998 by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to set out the government's vision of developing Hong Kong into a leading digital city. As a living document, updated in 2001 and 2004, it has taken into account the evolving needs of the community and technological advancements. The 2008 edition notes that Hong Kong offers the world's most affordable Internet connection and mobile phone services with penetration rates among the highest in the world. Cyberport and Hong Kong Science Park have been developed as strategic hubs bringing together clusters of high-tech information and communications technology (ICT) companies and professional talent from all over the world. The Government is pursuing a vigorous e-government program that has achieved good progress over the years. The Digital 21 Strategy sets out a vision of building on Hong Kong's position as a world digital city through advancing our achievements and seizing new opportunities. The realization of the Digital 21 Strategy vision requires the participation of the entire community including the ICT industry, business sectors, academia and the general public. As an integral part of the Strategy, key indicators of Hong Kong's ICT development will be measured and tracked over time for public reference. The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) is the focal point in the Government for dialogue with the public on the Strategy, for coordinating with all parties within the Government on its implementation and for tracking progress on an annual basis.  India  The typical speeds for consumer broadband connections in India vary from 512 kbit/s to 12 Mbit/s, with speeds of up to 100 Mbit/s available in a few areas (mostly on university campuses), though plans of 8‚Äì16 Mbit/s and above are becoming more common from BSNL, Airtel, Beam Telecom, Reliance and MTNL, but they are very expensive & out of reach of most Indians. The demand in India is for affordable 1Mbit/s plans with no download limit. The price of Broadband in India is very high compared to Europe or other parts of Asia, with a 1 Mbit/s connection costing between US$20 and $30 per month.http://bsnl.co.in/service/new_BB/BB_home_only_unlim.htm Because of this, broadband is yet to filter down to the masses, with a penetration rate of 8.03 million (December 2009), or about 9.9% of the estimated 81 million total Internet subscribers. In addition to the high prices, many providers have introduced a Fair Usage Policy on \\"Unlimited\\" plans, while data plans still have very low data transfer limits (typically 100 GB) after which speed is reduced. For example, Airtel offers 100Mbit/s, 200Mbit/s plans, & 300Mbit/s plans, which fall to 512kbit/s due to FUP.http://www.airtelchennai.in ;Domestic Fiber The National Internet Backbone (NIB), owned and operated by the government, is the largest backbone in the country. Bharti (Airtel), GAILTel, Railtel, Reliance Communications and Tata Communications also own and operate large amounts of backbone fiber throughout the country. ;International Connectivity  Indonesia  In April 2009, Indonesian telecommunication officials announced the start of an auction process for 2.3 GHz radio frequency for broadband wireless access. Only companies or their subsidiaries that are majority Indonesian-owned are able to compete per the 2007 Investment Law and accompanying Negative List. The Department of Communications and Information (DEPKOMINFO)laid out the following process for interested bidders: * 29 April ‚Äì 5 May Pick-up bidding document; * 6 May Submit written questions; * 11‚Äì20 May Submit pre-qualification documents; * 29 May Announce prequalification results; * 1‚Äì5 June Prequalification appeal period; * 3‚Äì9 June Pre-auction clarifying * 10‚Äì12 June Implement three round auction; * 12 June Announce auction results; * 15‚Äì16 June Auction appeal period; * 17 June Confirmation of auction results. Indonesian officials plan to hold future auctions for the 3.3 and 3.5 GHz frequencies. No date is set for these future auctions. Earlier this year, DEPKOMINFO issued a Ministerial decree instructing operators using those frequencies to migrate to other frequencies. Because of the Indonesian Negative List on Foreign Investment, U.S. firms will not be able to participate in the auction unless they partner with local companies to create a subsidiary that is majority Indonesian-owned. DEPKOMINFO officials said Indosat may not be able to compete because they are majority owned by a Qatar firm. The official added that a majority Indonesian-owned subsidiary of Indosat could still participate in the auction.  Japan  In 2001, the Japanese Cabinet released the e-Japan Priority Policy Programme. It stated that the private sector is to play the leading role in information technology, and the government's role is to implement an environment in which markets function smoothly through the promotion of fair competition and removal of unnecessary regulations. It also stated that government must play an active role in areas in which the private sector's activities do not fulfill the goals of facilitating e-government, closing the digital divide and promoting research and development. The e-Japan program extended tax incentives and budgetary support for carriers building fiber optic networks. To implement this program, the Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications (MPHPT; it later changed its name to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, or MIC) pursued two policies: the National Broadband Initiative, which mandates that federal and local governments deploy fiber to underserved areas; and the e-Japan Strategy, which set forth the goal of providing access at affordable rates by 2005 to high speed Internet networks for at least 30 million households, and to ultra-high speed Internet networks for 10 million households. Japan reached this goal with a broadband household penetration rate of 41.7 percent in 2004. These policies provided $60 million to municipalities investing in local public broadband networks, as well as low-interest loans to carriers to encourage them to build other broadband networks, including DSL, wireless, and cable systems. The loans were made through the Development Bank of Japan and the Telecommunications Advancement Organisation, both of which were largely funded by the government of Japan. In 2004, MIC issued its \\"Ubiquitous Japan\\" (u-Japan) policy. Its goal is to achieve a ubiquitous network society in which anything and anyone can easily access networks and freely transmit information from anywhere at any time by 2010. MIC is reviewing its regulations regarding broadband as part of its work towards achieving that goal.  South Korea  In February 2009, the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) announced plans to upgrade the national network to offer 1 Gbit/s service by 2012., an upgrade from the prior 100 Mbit/s guarantee. The plan was intended to cost 34.1 trillion won (US$24.6 billion) over the next five years. The central government will put up 1.3 trillion won, with the remainder coming from private telecom operators. The project is also expected to create more than 120,000 jobs ‚Äì a win for the Korean economy. In November 2006, the government had announced it would invest 26.6 trillion won (US$28.3 billion) to upgrade networks‚Äîincluding fiber-to-the-home (FTTH), optical LAN and hyper fiber co- axial cable‚Äîin the country over the next four years. The government aims to upgrade a total of 20 million subscriber lines‚Äî10 million lines for fixed and wireless services each. The government is expecting industry to contribute funds toward the national upgrading project. The decision to focus on broadband began in the mid-1990s and intensified after South Korea's economy was crippled by the collapse of the Asian financial markets in 1997, when policy makers targeted technology as a key sector for restoring the country's economic health. Korean regulators set a path for the industry with well- publicized national goals. All big office and apartment buildings would be given a fiber connection by 1997. By 2000, 30 percent of households would have broadband access through DSL or cable lines. By 2005, more than 80 percent of households would have access to fast connections of 20 Mbit/s or more‚Äîabout the rate needed for high-definition television. Most of the country's consumers were already served by the dominant carrier Korea Telecom, but the government encouraged competitors with a low-interest loan program for companies that built their own broadband facilities. The program offered $77 million in two years alone, with a particular focus on rural areas. The government offered other incentives for Korea Telecom. Once a state-owned monopoly, the company began the transition to private hands in 1993. But the government, which retained some shares until 2002, allowed the process to become final only on the condition that Korea Telecom bring broadband to all the villages in the country. The government also offered Internet training for the portion of the population deemed likely to be left behind in the digital age. About 10 million people fell into this category in the first round of the government's initiative, including stay-at-home wives, military personnel, disabled citizens, and even prison inmates. That program was ultimately expanded to anyone who wanted it. In 2004 a consortium that included the now defunct Ministry of Information and Communication, and private sector telecommunication and cable firms including KT, Hanaro Telecommunications, and others started to build a major infrastructure project called the Broadband Convergence Network (BcN). This infrastructure has been launched as a three- phase project. The first phase of the BcN extended from 2004 through 2005, the second phase extended from 2006 through 2007, and the third phase extended from 2008 through 2010. The timeline for the project has since been extended. A major focus of the South Korean program is WiBro to offer seamless 100 Mbit/s hybrid networking. It's \\"Heterogeneous Network Integration Solution (HNIS) technology... weds 3G/4G service with any open Wi-Fi network to deliver speeds many times faster than North Americans can get from their wireless providers. The technology is designed to work without a lot of consumer intervention. For example, HNIS will automatically provision open Wi-Fi access wherever subscribers travel. The combination of mobile broadband with Wi-Fi works seamlessly as well. Currently, smartphones can use Wi-Fi or mobile data, but not both at the same time... While mobile operators cope with spectrum and capacity issues, HNIS can reduce the load on wireless networks, without creating a hassle for wireless customers who used to register with every Wi-Fi service they encountered. The theoretical speed of an HNIS-enhanced 3G and Wi- Fi connection in South Korea will be 60Mbps when SK Telecom fully deploys the technology this year. As SK expands the technology to its 4G networks, theoretical maximum speeds will increase to 100Mbps.\\". SK plans to equip all of its smartphones with the new technology starting in 2013. See heterogenous network for more on the technology.  Lebanon  The National Broadband Strategy is a project initiated by the Partnership for Lebanon. The Broadband plan would bring larger, high speed communication pipes that would allow Lebanese citizens to have faster access to information and change the way they live, work, play, and learn. Lebanon's outdated communications infrastructure puts Lebanese industry at a competitive disadvantage, costing jobs, decreasing revenue, and slowing economic growth. The Partnership for Lebanon is working with the Lebanese government and business leaders to modernize Lebanon's communications infrastructure through innovation and investment. In so doing, the Partnership is helping Lebanon update technology, reduce connectivity costs, and improve ICT quality across the board. The Partnership is working specifically with the Telecommunications Regulatory Agency (TRA) to develop a national broadband strategy designed to bring broadband to Lebanon's urban and rural communities. As part of this effort, the Partnership is conducting broadband business analysis, developing network architecture options, and crafting a regulatory framework to facilitate the successful implementation of a modern communications infrastructure. The Partnership is also working with the government owned telecom operator, Ogero, to increase Lebanon's international bandwidth capacity. The Partnership has provided Ogero with an Internet Exchange Point and is assembling the equipment needed to install two state of the art International Internet Gateways. To help educate local stakeholders about the benefits of a modern communications infrastructure, the Partnership and in coordination with the LBSG Committee which represents economic councils, private sector leaders and professional assiociations, launched a recent Advertising Campaign. The objective of this campaign is to raise awareness and educate the Lebanese public on the need of a True Broadband Infrastructure in Lebanon. The True Broadband Infrastructure will encourage economic growth and social development. The campaign second objective is to drive people to sign the manifesto.http://www.escwa.un.org/wsis/reports/docs/Lebanon-07-E.pdf  Malaysia  High Speed Broadband (HSBB) is a broadband service that offers bandwidth delivered at network speeds of 10 Mbit/s and above when compared to normal broadband (Broadband to the General Population (BBGP)) which delivers bandwidth through wired and wireless technologies at network speeds ranging between 256 kbit/s and 4 Mbit/s. Eventually Malaysia will see basic HSBB packages offering network speeds between 20‚Äì50 Mbit/s and up to 100 Mbit/s for consumers while businesses will have maximum network speeds available up to 1Gbit/s. To understand the deployment of HSBB, the role HSBB plays in the larger world of broadband deployment in Malaysia must first be understood. Broadband deployment in Malaysia is carried out using two approaches ‚Äì normal broadband, known as Broadband to the General Population (BBGP) delivered via wired (DSL) and wireless technologies (WiMax, WiFi, 3G/HSDPA) while the other will be through HSBB. BBGP (via both wired and wireless modes) is deployed nationwide while HSBB ( available only through the wired mode) will only initially be concentrated in the Klang Valley, Iskandar Malaysia and key industrial zones throughout the country. It is expected that 1.3 million premises will have the ability to access HSBB coverage by end 2012.  Singapore  The Singaporean government will provide up to S$750 million (US$520 million) in grants to build the Next Generation National Broadband Network. It will be wireline and wireless, and have speeds ranging from 100 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s. The network will be open to all service providers, threatening SingTel and StarHub's market dominance. The government will not prevent companies from building their own networks, however. Bidding is taking place in two stages ‚Äì first, for the passive infrastructure, and then for the active infrastructure. In September 2008, IDA selected OpenNet, in which SingTel has a 30 percent stake, to design, build, and operate the passive infrastructure. Wireless@SG, which is launched on 1 December 2006, is a wireless broadband programme developed by IDA Singapore as part of its Next Generation National Infocomm Infrastructure initiative. Wireless@SG is powered by the network of three wireless operators, iCell, M1 Limited and SingTel. It will be provided free for all Singapore residents and visitors till 31 March 2013. Users can enjoy free, both in-door and outdoor seamless wireless broadband access with speeds of up to 1 Mbit/s at most public areas.  Taiwan  Over the past ten years, the Taiwan authorities have pursued a series of ICT infrastructure development projects, beginning with the \\"E-Government\\" initiative in 2000 that aimed to create more efficient, networked public services. The authorities expanded E-Government to include \\"E-Society,\\" \\"E-Industry,\\" and \\"E-Opportunity\\" initiatives under 2002's \\"E-Taiwan\\" plan. According to James Lo, Section Chief in the National Communications Commission (NCC) Department of Planning, from 2003 to 2007, the Taiwan authorities and private sector partners spent over US$10 billion on the broadband development. By the end of 2007, there were six million broadband internet accounts in Taiwan.  Thailand  Some of the nation's most powerful telecommunications executives and the regulatory agency, Nation Telecommunications Union (NTC), met for the first time on 2 July 2009 to formulate a plan for Meaningful Broadband. The plan calls for interacting with prime minister, and a spectrum of Thai ministries to establish the role of broadband in achieving public-policy reforms in the Abhisit government. The event, held at the Oriental Hotel, was the first meeting of the Meaningful Broadband Working Group, led by Craig Warren Smith, a visiting professor of Chulalongkorn University's Center for Ethics of Science and Technology. Sponsored by NTC, the event released a white paper on Meaningful Broadband. The report rejects the path to broadband favored by Singapore and other advanced nations which serves affluent citizens who can afford high speed internet. Instead, it calls for a new \\"broadband ecosystem\\" for Thailand, that is focused primarily on the Middle of the Pyramid (MOP), a middle-income group of Thais who make from $2 to $7 per day. By bringing 28 million of these MOP Thais into subsidized meaningful mobile broadband applications, Smith predicts a \\"wealth effect\\" that could bring equity and sustainability to the Thai economy. Responding to the framework, Khun Supachai called was one of several members of the group that advocated a follow up study that would prepare for a meeting with Prime Minister Abhisit along with ministers of Finance, Education, ICT and other relevant parties. \\"We need to figure out the roles of government, the regulator and the telecommunications operators in establishing broadband that brings optimal benefits to Thailand.\\" Supachai, agreed to be host and sponsor of further research in preparation of the next meeting of the Working Group to be held in September. \\"Along with painting the big picture of how broadband could serve the nation, we should focus specifically how it can serve education and human resources development,\\" said Montchai Noosong, executive vice president of TOT. \\"Central to the 'meaningful' idea is a new approach to Ethics, said Chulalongkorn University Soraj Hongladarom. \\"We want Thailand to develop a way to help users choose broadband applications that will lead them to happiness not addiction,\\" he said.http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/19860/working-group-vows-broadband-net- for-all  Oceania   Australia  On 15 September 2009, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Stephen Conroy, announced fundamental reforms to Australian's telecommunications landscape. In April 2009, the Australian Government announced that it would establish a new company that will invest up to $43 billion over 8 years to build and operate a wholesale-only, open access National Broadband Network. The new network will provide fiber optic to the home and workplace, supplemented with next generation wireless and satellite technologies to deliver superfast broadband services. The Government plans to sell down its ownership of the company ‚Äì NBN Co. Ltd. ‚Äì 5 years after the network is built. Again in April 2009, the Government released a discussion paper entitled \\"National Broadband Network: Regulatory Reform for 21st Century Broadband\\". The paper is based on public comments on the NBN. The paper appears to be similar to an FCC NPRM or NOI. It outlines the method of establishing the NBN and also sketches general regulatory reforms to assist the market in the future. To facilitate fiber build-out, the government will simplify land right of way procedures. The Australian Government had previously (in 2007) planned to subsidize a privately operated fiber-to-the-node project. The collapse of capital markets altered that plan.For a full history of the decision process to arrive at the current strategy, see: PDF For an overview of the national plan and links to details see: dbcde.gov.au  New Zealand  The government has two plans to bring fast broadband to 97.8% of the population by 2019. The first is the NZ$1.35bn Ultra-Fast Broadband project where fibre to the home will be available to 75% of the population. The second is the NZ$300M Rural Broadband Initiative to upgrade rural telephone exchanges and to deploy fixed 3G networks.

The syndrome is related to cystic lesions and swelling of the third ventricle in the brain. Symptoms of bobble-head doll syndrome are diverse but can be grouped into two categories: physical and neurological.De Brito Henriques, J. G., Wandeck Henriques, K. S., Pianettj, G., Fonseca, L. F., Cardoso, F., & Da Silva, M. C. (2007). Bobble-head doll syndrome associated with Dandy-Walker syndrome. Journal of Neurosurgery, 107(3), 248-250. The most common form of treatment is surgical implanting of a shunt to relieve the swelling of the brain.Zamponi, N., Rychlicki, F., Trignani, R., Polonara, G., Ruggiero, M., & Cesaroni, E. (2005). Bobble head doll syndrome in a child with a third ventricular cyst and hydrocephalus. Childs Nervous System, 21(5), 350-354.  Signs and symptoms  Bobble-head doll syndrome is first reported as a movement disorder in patients. However, after performing several tests and scans of the brain, the characteristic movement is found to be neurological in origin.  Physical  The main physical symptom of bobble-head doll syndrome is the most obvious to diagnose and involves two to three bobs per second of the head, which can sometimes also include the shoulders and upper torso. The patient is unaware of the movements and unable to control them unless directed to stop or given simple mental tasks such as basic arithmetic or spelling words. However, once the task is completed by the patient, the bobbing tends to resume after about a minute. Thus, the bobbing is described by doctors as volitional, or able to be stopped by making a conscious decision.Nellhaus, G. (1967). BOBBLE-HEAD DOLL SYNDROME - A TIC WITH A NEUROPATHOLOGIC BASIS. Pediatrics, 40(2), 250-&. The bobbing also disappears while the patient is asleep, a common feature of most movement disorders. A supplemental symptom of the head bobbing is a presence of ataxia. Several patients were reported as having difficulty walking, running, and climbing steps because of the bobbing. It is likely that the constant bobbing has interrupted the patient‚Äôs ability to balance which requires input from several sources including the vestibular, ocular, somatosensory, and motor systems. Although the nature of these movements is physical, their source is neurological, generally stemming from a dysfunction of parts of the nervous system which control motor function.  Neurological  A typical symptom in patients diagnosed with bobble-head doll syndrome is an enlargement of the head due to accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the third ventricle. This dilatation impairs communication between ventricles as well as the function of other surrounding structures.Benton J.W., Nellhaus G, Huttenlocher P.R., Ojemann R.G., Dodge P.R. (1966). The bobble-head doll syndrome: report of unique truncal tremor associated with third ventricular cyst and hydrocephalus in children. Neurology, 16(8), 725‚Äì729. Quite often, the swelling is present along with cystic lesions in the third ventricle or surrounding periventricular structures. In reference to bobble-head doll syndrome, a third ventricular cystic lesion causes an obstruction in the foramina of Monro, which communicates with the lateral ventricles, and the proximal, cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius, which communicates with the fourth ventricle. It has also been reported to be caused by a cystic choroid plexus papilloma of the third ventricle and obstructive hydrocephalus. It is this blockage that is thought to produce the characteristic bobble-head movements.Pollack, I. F., Schor, N. F., Martinez, A. J., & Towbin, R. (1995). BOBBLE-HEAD DOLL SYNDROME AND DROP ATTACKS IN A CHILD WITH A CYSTIC CHOROID- PLEXUS PAPILLOMA OF THE 3RD-VENTRICLE - CASE-REPORT. [Note]. Journal of Neurosurgery, 83(4), 729-732. Other patients have seen the onset of bobble- head doll syndrome from the presence of a suprasellar cyst in the arachnoid mater of the meninges. It, too, obstructs the foramen of Monro.Hagebeuk, E. E. O., Kloet, A., Grotenhuis, J. A., & Peeters, E. A. J. (2005). Bobble-head doll syndrome successfully treated with an endoscopic ventriculocystocisternostomy - Case report and review of the literature. Journal of Neurosurgery, 103(3), 253-259.  Pathophysiology  Those susceptible to acquiring bobble-head doll syndrome range from newborns to adults‚Äîwith the oldest reported patient being 26 years old. However, the majority of cases involve children who have yet to reach puberty. Although the exact pathogenesis of bobble-head doll syndrome is still unknown, there are many theories as to how and why it does what it does. Most of these theories acknowledge the striking similarity of symptoms between bobble-head doll syndrome and other movement disorders. The presence of cystic lesions, causing swelling in the third ventricle, is a common feature in all patients. It is this dilatation that causes pressure to be applied to the surrounding structures of the third ventricle, such as the diencephalon. It is possible that the back and forth movement of fluid within the cyst causes rhythmic pressure on the diencephalic motor pathways. One of the key periventricular structures in that pathway is the thalamus which is responsible for relaying motor signals to the cerebral cortex as well as regulating consciousness, sleep, and alertness. The disappearance of the head movements while asleep implies that their origin may lie within the extrapyramidal system which is a part of the motor system that controls coordination of movement. The tracts associated with the extrapyramidal system are controlled by various structures of the central nervous system, such as the cerebellum and basal ganglia. The basal ganglia plays a large part in controlling motor function and thus, abnormalities to this system can result in movement disorders such as Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and dyskinesia, both of which share commonalities with bobble-head doll syndrome. The tic-like movements and swelling of the third ventricle associated with bobble-head doll syndrome are similar to that of other movement disorders caused by diseases of the corpus callosum and aforementioned basal ganglia. Because of the swelling, added pressure is applied to these formations causing their basic functions to be disturbed. Through pneumoencephalographic studies of patients with Parkinson‚Äôs, Huntington's, and dystonia musculorum deformans, it was discovered that, along with patients with bobble-head doll syndrome, a statistically significant swelling of the third ventricle existed. Thus, researchers believe that the connection between bobble-head doll syndrome and other movement disorders is that, in both, the movements are not caused by a particular lesion, but rather a hindrance of multiple neuronal structures or pathways. In the case of bobble-head doll syndrome, the disturbance is related to those structures proximal to the third ventricle. More research is being conducted in order to find the neurophysiologic basis for bobble-head doll syndrome and its connection with other movement disorders, but with the rare occurrence of the disorder, progress is slow.De Brito Henriques, Jose Gilberto. Electronic Interview. 15 October 2009. Another theory exists behind the cause of bobble-head doll syndrome. It states that the constant head movements create a temporary relief in intraventricular obstruction by both shifting the cyst to the posterior‚Äîaway from the foramina of Monro‚Äîand a reduction in cyst size. This points to the fact that the bobbing may be a ‚Äúlearned behavior‚Äù and a way to relieve the symptoms of hydrocephalus.Wiese, J. A., Gentry, L. R., & Menezes, A. H. (1985). Bobble-head doll syndrome: review of the pathophysiology and CSF dynamics. [Case Reports;; Review]. Pediatr Neurol, 1(6), 361-366.  Diagnosis  Several methods exist for diagnosing a patient as having bobble-head doll syndrome. Most involve brain scans to look for swelling while some use cisternography to observe obstruction in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow among ventricles. In order to try to investigate the flow dynamics of the cerebrospinal fluid, doctors utilize cisternography, which injects a radiolabeled substance into the CSF via lumbar puncture. The CSF flow is then tracked by taking pictures at incremental times. However, cisternography is declining in use with physicians who are opting to use MRI instead, to assess CSF flow.Parkinson, D. (1996). Bobble-head doll syndrome. Journal of Neurosurgery, 84(3), 538-538. Cerebrospinal fluid flow is important in diagnosing bobble-head doll syndrome because disturbances in CSF dynamics can be contributed to blockages in the connections between ventricles such as foramen and aqueducts. Such blockages are tell-tale signs that a cyst is present. Also, if CSF cannot flow freely, it will begin to accumulate leading to hydrocephalus. CSF is secreted by choroid plexuses located on the roofs of the ventricles. After travelling through each ventricle, the CSF leaves the fourth ventricle and flows around the brain stem, cerebellum, hemispheres, and finally, down into the subarachnoid space. To complete the cycle, the CSF then moves back up to the basal cisternae to start over. In patients with bobble-head doll syndrome, an impairment exists in the ability to reabsorb CSF by the arachnoid granulations leading to an accumulation. Presently, doctors will utilize magnetic resonance imaging to get an image of the afflicted area. If swelling exists in the third ventricle along with cystic lesions, both of which are accompanied by the characteristic head bobbing, a diagnosis of bobble-head doll syndrome is likely. From here, the doctor will propose the available treatment options listed below.  Classification  Bobble-head doll syndrome does not have a precise classification in the major medical catalogs because of its rarity and complexity. Although it is a movement disorder, it is caused by neuronal obstruction of ventricle communication. Thus, it is grouped with hydrocephalus under the World Health Organization‚Äôs International Classification of Diseases (ICD) as G93.0, under ICD-10, and 348, under ICD-9.  Treatment  No single cure exists because bobble-head doll syndrome can be caused by several compounding disorders. However, most times surgery will fully resolve the movement disorder. Successful surgical procedures include surgical removal of the lesion, insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and ventriculocisternostomy.  Removal of lesion  In the case of choroid plexus papilloma, surgical removal of the cyst-containing lesion from within the third ventricle caused a full recovery. The mobile nature of the cystic lesion led to its intermittent obstruction of the foramen of Monro and proximal aqueduct, producing the bobble-head symptoms. Once removed, all symptoms disappeared.  Ventriculoperitoneal shunt  Often, doctors will implant a shunt to reduce the intracranial pressure caused by the accumulation of CSF in the third ventricle. Typically, this will succeed in restricting the swelling and allowing proper flow of CSF. With this relief, the head bobbing will disappear and bobble-head doll syndrome will no longer be present. However, in one case, after a year of shunt placement, the patient switched from forward-back bobbing to side-to-side swaying. There was no discernible reasoning for the switch found. A hypothesis emerged from this case that cerebellar malformations themselves can cause bobble-head doll syndrome.  Endoscopic ventriculocystocisternostomy  For those with suprasellar arachnoid cysts, it has been discovered that endoscopic ventriculocystocisternostomy is the optimal treatment option. By fenestrating, or opening, the cystic membrane and removing the fluid, all obstructions of the aqueduct were resolved. In patients receiving this treatment, a full recovery is the most common result.  Prognosis  Although surgery is agreed upon as the primary treatment option for patients suffering from bobble-head doll syndrome, surgical treatment has been reported to completely remove all symptoms in only half of the cases. Reason for this stems from late diagnoses which can significantly decrease the hope for a full recovery and lead to permanent profound obstructive hydrocephalus.Goikhman, I., Zelnik, N., & Peled, N. (1998). Bobble-head doll syndrome: A surgically treatable condition manifested as a rare movement disorder. Movement Disorders, 13(1), 192-194. Thus, prognosis depends upon the time elapsed between the first signs of the disorder and the time of surgical treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment is highly important in successful treatment of bobble-head doll syndrome.  Epidemiology  The rarity of the syndrome is such that, since 1966, only 34 cases have been reported. Of those cases, the average onset of head bobbing is 3 years and 3 months old while surgical intervention occurred on average, at age 6 years and 11 months.Mussell, H. G., Dure, L. S., Percy, A. K., & Grabb, P. S. (1997). Bobble-head doll syndrome: Report of a case and review of the literature. Movement Disorders, 12(5), 810-814.

History In 1998, Italian company Media Partners seriously investigated the idea. The plan died after UEFA moved to expand the Champions League competition and abolish the Cup Winners' Cup in order to better accommodate clubs that were considering defecting in order to join the proposed Super League. In July 2009, Real Madrid's Florentino P√©rez championed the idea. In August 2009, Former Arsenal manager Ars√®ne Wenger predicted a super league would become reality within 10 years time due to revenue pressure on the continent's elite teams. In February 2012, Clarence Seedorf also predicted the inception of the competition, and gave it his backing. In April 2013 Scotland manager Gordon Strachan said that he believes the Old Firm clubs of Celtic and Rangers would join a future new 38-club two-division European Super League. Florentino P√©rez's 2009 proposal On 4 July 2009, Florentino P√©rez criticized the current Champions League, saying \\"we have to agree a new European Super League which guarantees that the best always play the best - something that does not happen in the Champions League.\\" Perez stated that he would push for a break-away competition featuring Europe's traditional powerhouses if UEFA didn't do more to ensure these teams played each other annually. Under Perez's plan, the continent's best teams would remain part of their respective national systems, but would be guaranteed the opportunity to play each other at the conclusion of the regular league season. Stephen M. Ross's proposal In 2016, representatives from Premier League clubs Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, and Manchester United, were seen leaving a meeting with Stephen M. Ross' representatives that discussed the proposition of a European Super League. 2016 UEFA changes In 2016, UEFA again discussed the possibility of creating a closed league containing the 16 best teams in European football from the highest ranked national leagues. These 16 teams would have been divided into 2 groups, with 8 teams in each group. After 56 games in each group under the round-robin system, the teams that finished in places 1-4 would qualify for the quarter-finals. That plan was finally rejected and UEFA, in order to avoid the creation of a super league, made changes to the structure of the UEFA Champions League. UEFA announced that, for the trade cycle 2018‚Äì21, England, Italy, Spain and Germany would have 4 teams in the UEFA Champions League group stage without having to compete in play-offs. This means that the number of direct places will be increased from 22 to 26. The 6 remaining places will come from the champions' path (down from 5 teams to 4 teams) and the non-champions' path (down from 5 teams to 2 teams). If the title holder of this competition qualifies for the Champions League from its domestic league, the champion of the country with the 11th placed UEFA Coefficient will go through into the UEFA Champions League group stage; if not, the title holder has the right to defend the trophy. UEL defending champions also acquire the right to compete in the UEFA Champions League group stage, without the opportunity of directly securing a play-off berth as in the 2015‚Äì18 trade cycle agreements. If the UEL champion automatically qualifies for the UEFA Champions League group stage via its domestic league, the third ranked team of the country with the 5th placed UEFA coefficient will replace the UEL winner. 2018 leaks In November 2018, Football Leaks claimed that there had been undercover talks about the creation of a new continental club competition, the European Super League, from 2021. In the same month, the website claimed that both Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain have been violating UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules. 2020 FIFA-backed European Premier League In October 2020, Sky Sports claimed that FIFA was proposing a replacement for the UEFA Champions League called the European Premier League involving up to 18 teams in a round-robin system and post league playoff style knockout tournament similar to major league sports competitions in the United States such as the NFL, NBA and MLS.

The American Metropolis from Knickerbocker Days to the Present Time. London: The Authors' Syndicate, 1897. (pg. 19) and subsequent trial, in 1865 was one of the most notorious crimes in the city's history prior to the end of the American Civil War.\\"The Last of a Famous Prizefighter's Sons\\". _New York Sun._ 18 Jun 1884. Biography Lazarus came to the US with his father and two brothers when Izzy Lazarus, Sr. fought Owen Swift in 1850. He would briefly follow in his father's footsteps, fighting a prizefight in Canada during 1857, but instead left that career to go into business in New York City. It was alleged that around this time that he had killed a man in California, arrested then fled the state while on bail. Lazarus was enlisted in Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth's Fire Zouaves for a time during the American Civil War, but returned to New York where he opened a saloon, the \\"X 10 U. 8\\" (phonetically spelled \\"extenuate\\"), on East Houston Street. Traditional accounts, such as those of Herbert Asbury in Gangs of New York (1928), claimed Lazarus became involved with thieves and confidence men soon after his arrival in New York. One of these acquaintances, Barney Friery, stabbed and killed him during an argument at Lazarus' saloon in the early morning hours of January 6, 1865. According to Asbury, the incident had originated from \\"a dispute over a plug hat full of jewelry, which London Izzy had stolen from a jewelry store after smashing the store window with a brick\\".Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 174) The trial was held the following month, lasting three-days, and involved Assistant District Attorney Gunning J. Bedford, Jr. and Judge John T. Hoffman, as well as Lazarus' father Israel who testified for the prosecution. Harry Lazarus' bartender, Henry Connell served as one of the prosecution's star witnesses. Connell testified that on the night of the murder, while tending bar, Lazarus entered the saloon with five or six other men from his place of business next door. One of Friery's companions, California Jack, offered a challenge to the room betting $100 \\"that I've got a man here that will lick any man in the room\\". When no one responded, Jack turned to the owner and said \\"I'll bet $10 that I've got a man that will take that pistol away from you, Harry.\\" Lazarus answered \\"No you haven't, because I have no pistol\\" and opened both his coats to show he was indeed unarmed. A customer then ordered some cigars and Connell left to fetch them. As the bartender turned around however, he heard Friery say \\"You are a good little man, Harry\\" and saw him \\"drawing a knife out of Harry's neck\\". Connell rushed over and put a towel around his neck to stop the bleeding, but Lazarus died almost immediately. He later identified Friery, California Jack and two other men, James McDonald and James Clark, but recognized none of the others. Connell elaborated that Friery had threatened Lazarus several days earlier. On one of these occasions, Friery had attacked one of his dogs, a black Newfoundland, and used an ice pick to break out some of its teeth. The previous morning of the murder, Friery entered had taken a knife and stuck it into the counter of Lazarus' bar and said \\"that knife would be the death of someone around here\\". This would be substantiated by an additional witnesses. Connell, who had fallen ill, was taken to New York Hospital following his testimony and did not participate further in the trial. Assistant District Attorney Bedford called additional witnesses however, Christopher Richards who also saw the murder and went for a police officer with John Riley. Richard Birmingham, a local coach driver, testified that he had driven the sleigh which took two of the men involved, McDonald and Clark, to Lazarus' place and then took all three away from the saloon after the murder. He also testified that these men were very intoxicated, especially McDonald and Clark, and that he overheard one of the men say \\"He is dead now, the son of a bitch!\\". Lazarus' other bartenders, Dennis Kerwan and Thomas R. Walton, both stated that Friery had been to the saloon on previous occasions. Walton recalled an incident when Friery, admittedly drunk, broke a mustard pot after throwing it against the wall. The arresting officer, Patrolman John Dwyer, testified that he pursued the sleigh driven by Richard Birmingham and followed Friery into a saloon on 118th Street. Upon confronting the suspect inside, Dwyer claimed, Friery admitted to the killing telling him \\"Yes, I have killed him and I will dance at his wake\\". This and other evidence would result in Friery's conviction of first-degree manslaughter on February 18, 1865. He was sentenced to death on March 31, but a writ of error delayed his execution pending his appeal in June, and Friery was hanged in a public execution at The Tombs on the morning of August 17, 1866.Kernan, J.

In 1826, it was designated as the 26th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry. In 1856, it was dispatched to Persia, where it took part in the Battle of Kooshab during the Anglo-Persian War of 1856-57. In 1891, the regiment was localized to the Province of Baluchistan and reconstituted with Balochis, Brahuis, Pathans and Punjabi Muslims. It adopted uniforms of drab colour with red trousers and its designation was changed to 26th (Baluchistan) Regiment of Bombay Infantry. In 1900 it was sent to China to suppress the Boxer Rebellion. In 1901, the regiment's designation was changed to 26th Baluchistan Infantry.Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin. (1998). History of the Baloch Regiment 1820-1939.

London: Longmans & Green. 126th Baluchistan Infantry Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, all former Bombay Army units had 100 added to their numbers. Consequently, the regiment's designation was changed to 126th Baluchistan Infantry and it was delocalized from Baluchistan. On the outbreak of the First World War, the regiment was sent to Aden, where it remained during the war except for brief stays in Egypt in 1915 and Mesopotamia in 1917.320px Subsequent History In 1922, the regiment was grouped with five other Baluch battalions: 1st & 2nd Battalions of 124th Duchess of Connaught's Own Baluchistan Infantry, 127th Queen Mary's Own Baluch Light Infantry, 129th Duke of Connaught's Own Baluchis and the 130th King George's Own Baluchis (Jacob's Rifles), to form the 10th Baluch Regiment. The 126th Baluchistan Infantry was redesignated as the 2nd Battalion of the new regiment. During the Second World War, 2/10th Baluch fought with great gallantry in the Malayan Campaign. The battalion was taken prisoner by the Japanese on Singapore Island after the surrender of British forces on 15 February 1942. It suffered a total of 1596 casualties in the war and during the Japanese captivity. The battalion won distinction for resisting intense enemy pressure to join the Japanese- sponsored Indian National Army. Prominent among them was Lieutenant Abrar Hussain, who was awarded the MBE for his heroic conduct whilst a Prisoner of War. On its return from captivity, the battalion was reformed in 1946. On the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the Baluch Regiment was allocated to Pakistan Army.Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin. (2000). History of the Baloch Regiment 1939-1956.

The site presented images of stories from Google's news partners, which could be clicked on to navigate to the story on the news provider's own website. Stories could be scrolled between using the mouse or cursor keys. The presentation of stories used a similar algorithm to Google News, but stories could be ordered by publication as well as by subject. Krishna Bharat of Google News has said that \\"Fast Flip is mostly for longer shelf-life content, the kind of content you want to recommend to other people.\\" Fast Flip was created after Larry Page \\"asked why the web was not more like a magazine, allowing users to flip from screen to screen seamlessly.\\" Fast Flip was available as well on iPhone and Android mobile devices. Users of Fast Flip were able to follow friends and topics, find new content, and to create their own customized magazines around their searches.\\"Google's Fast Flip Is Pretty Slick\\" (25 September 2009). PCMike.com. At launch, there were 39 mainly US- based news partners. Google said that it would share the majority of revenue from contextual adverts with its news partners. Fast Flip was praised for allowing visual, fast and serendipitous browsing of news stories, but it has been criticized as being a novelty, anachronistic, as it emulates print media, limits navigation and presents few news sources, and as being more focused on the needs of publishers than of readers. Its visual search has been compared to the beta visual search of Microsoft Bing and to The Onion's microfiche iPhone app. Fast Flip has also been cited as a demonstration of Google's power in the news marketplace; by setting up another news interface that uses publishers' content without returning much value.

They could trace their origins to 1777, when the 20th Carnatic Battalion was raised from sub-units of the 1st, 3rd, 8th and 16th Carnatic Battalions. History As part of the Madras Army, the regiment took part in the Battle of Carnatic, the Battle of Sholinghur, the Battle of Seringapatam during the Second Anglo-Mysore War and the Indian Mutiny. In 1903, under a general policy to move the focus for recruitment from Madras to the \\"martial races\\" of North- West India, the establishment of the 79th Carnatic Infantry was reduced to 600 officers and men. The intention was to convert this and other Carnatic units which still retained their traditional recruiting basis, to garrison troops. However the influx of recruits from southern India on the outbreak of World War I enabled the 79th Carnatic Infantry not only to be brought up to full strength, but to provide a complete company for the newly raised 1/156th Infantry.John Gaylor, page 38 \\"Sons of John Company\\", By 1914 the regiment was linked (\\"grouped\\") with the 75th Carnatic Infantry and the 86th Carnatic Infantry, with a shared recruitment and training centre at Secunderabad.John Gaylor, page 8 \\"Sons of John Company\\", During World War I the 79th Carnatic Infantry was assigned to Mesopotamia for service against the Ottoman Turks. Initially the regiment performed lines of communication and garrison functions but it saw active service in Kurdistan after November 1918.John Gaylor, page 138 \\"Sons of John Company\\", After World War I the Indian government restructured the army, moving from single battalion infantry regiments to multi-battalion regiments.Sumner p.15 The 79th Carnatic Infantry now became the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Madras Regiment. At Independence this regiment became part of the new Indian Army. In May 1950 the 3rd Battalion was disbanded but in March 1962 it was re-raised, still with its old connection to the 79th Carnatic Infantry. Victoria Cross Captain Herbert Mackworth Clogstoun 19th Madras Native Infantry, Madras Army was awarded the Victoria Cross during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 15 January 1859: Previous names *20th Carnatic Battalion - 1777 *20th Madras Battalion - 1784 *2nd Battalion, 7th Madras Native Infantry - 1796 *19th Madras Native Infantry - 1824 *19th Madras Infantry - 1885 *79th Carnatic Infantry - 1903 Uniform and insignia As the 19th Madras Native Infantry under the East India Company, the regiment wore red coats with French grey facings. Similar sky blue facings were replaced by yellow in 1882. Prior to 1914 the full dress of the 73rd Carnatic Infantry included a khaki turban and the scarlet \\"zouave\\" jacket peculiar to Madras infantry regiments, with white facings. No regimental badge is recorded as being worn by the regiment before World War I but as part of the 3rd Madras Regiment it wore a star surmounted by a crown. This was replaced by a shield with crossed swords and scroll in 1946.

The show aired 75 episodes from 2005 to 2008. The series was produced by Tiger Aspect Productions, and has won multiple BAFTA awards. The animation uses a collage style that emulates the style of the original books.  Synopsis  Charlie has a little sister named Lola; she is 'small, and very funny'. Lola often gets caught up in situations that she (inadvertently) causes, whether it's running out of money at the zoo and having to borrow Charlie's, to forgetting her entire suitcase when having a sleepover at a friend's house. These situations are sometimes comedic (for example, in the episode 'Help! I Really Mean It!') but often reflect real world problems that younger children may face, for example losing a best friend, not getting the preferred part in a school play, or becoming too excited about an upcoming event and accidentally ruining it. When these situations happen, Charlie usually ends up having to solve her problems through imaginative or creative methods, or by explaining to Lola where she went wrong. This is particularly demonstrated in the episode 'I Will Never Not Ever Eat A Tomato', when Charlie plays a trick on Lola to rename her least favourite food (carrots, mashed potatoes, fish fingers, and tomatoes) to more fantastical names so that she'll eat them, such as 'orange twiglets from Jupiter' and 'ocean nibblers from the supermarket under the sea'. In this same episode Lola imagines that the bowl of tomatoes in front of her are actually a bowl of \\"moonsquirters\\" making it the only time in history Lola actually EATS a tomato. So it might turn out she likes tomatoes. But in later episodes, it was proven otherwise. So it was back to the tomato-hating Lola we all know and love. This can teach little children to try different foods they never had (even tomatoes). In many episodes, Lola's best friend Lotta, Lola's imaginary friend Soren Lorenson, and Charlie's best friend Marv become involved in some way or another. Although adults are mentioned through dialogue, none of them are ever shown or heard on-screen.  Episodes  Characters * Charlie Sonner (voiced by Jethro Lundie-Brown) * Lola Sonner (voiced by Maisie Cowell) * Lotta (voiced by Morgan Gayle) * Marv (voiced by Ryan Harris)  Animation style  The television series uses a collage style of animation which captures the style of the original books. 2D Flash animation, paper cutout, fabric design, real textures, photomontage, and archive footage are all employed and subsequently animated in a software application called CelAction2D.Tiger Aspect Productions The cartoons are also notable for their use of children rather than adult voice actors, a technique pioneered by the Peanuts television specials. Both the books and the cartoon also follow a technique of never showing adults.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 28, 2010 (Palm Sunday and the eve of Passover). In this episode, the Simpsons vacation in Jerusalem with Ned Flanders, but Homer does not appreciate the city's religious importance‚Äîuntil he gets lost in the desert, and in a severe state of dehydration, believes himself to be the Messiah. The episode was written by Kevin Curran and directed by Michael Polcino and guest stars Sacha Baron Cohen as the Israeli tour guide Jakob and Yael Naim as his niece Dorit. ‚ÄúThe Greatest Story Ever D'ohed\\" received a 2.7/8 Nielsen Rating in the 18-49 demographic and mixed reviews from critics.  Plot  Ned Flanders becomes frustrated when Homer disrupts his Bible study group, and Reverend Lovejoy recommends that Ned invites the Simpson family to join the group on their tour of Jerusalem. Homer is skeptical, but Marge accepts and soon the family is on their way to the Holy Land. Upon arrival in Jerusalem, they are joined by Krusty the Clown, who is making a Jewish pilgrimage. Passing the Western Wall, they meet a talkative, pushy tour guide named Jakob and his niece Dorit, who doubles as his security guard and pummels Bart into submission using her knowledge of Krav Maga. At first, Homer and the other tourists show more interest in the hotel's buffet than they do in seeing the city, much to Ned's dismay. When they arrive at King David's tomb, Ned implores Homer to show some respect. Homer, however, continues to goof off and Ned becomes increasingly impatient with him. Their next stop is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Ned prays that Homer will find some meaning in the tour but soon finds him taking a nap on Jesus' tomb. Ned loses his temper and yells at Homer, an outburst that prompts security personnel to remove him from the church and permanently ban him from returning. He storms off, exasperated with Homer's crass behavior and lack of reverence. Homer loses sight of Ned and believes that he is lost in the desert; in reality, Ned has calmed himself by getting a cup of tea and going to see a movie. Homer rides into the desert on a camel in search of Ned, but becomes lost in a sandstorm and begins to succumb to dehydration. He drinks some of the brackish water from the Dead Sea, worsening his condition, and hallucinates that several of the characters from VeggieTales are naming him as a new Messiah. Marge and a security guard rescue Homer, and Dr. Hibbert diagnoses him with Jerusalem syndrome, whose sufferers possess religiously- themed obsessive ideas. Homer escapes from the hotel and ends up at the Dome of the Rock. Marge, the Simpson children, and Dr. Hibbert chase after him, only to hear him preach that the similarities of different religions outweigh their differences, and that all should search for a common ground for a joint new religion, the so-called \\"Chrismujews\\". Ned witnesses Homer's speech and is profoundly moved, but the effect is lost on the crowd as nearly all of the other tour group members have developed Jerusalem syndrome as well. On the flight back to Springfield, Ned and Homer reconcile.  Reception  A reviewer from IGN found Sacha Baron Cohen's voiceover of the tour guide difficult to understand In its original airing, \\"The Greatest Story Ever D'ohed\\" was viewed by 5.698 million viewers and got a Nielsen Rating of 2.7, with an 8 share of the audience. It came second in its timeslot and second in the \\"Animation Domination\\" lineup. The episode received mixed and positive reviews. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.3, calling it was \\"Decent\\" and adding, \\"I was underwhelmed with Sacha Baron Cohen's voice work as the group's tour guide. He was like a sped up Borat and was actually a bit difficult to understand at times. The few jokes that did get through were only okay.\\" Canning also stated that \\"It's difficult to keep your expectations in check when you hear about an upcoming guest star, and that likely affected my perception of this episode. But that it is what it is. Perhaps subsequent viewings will find me enjoying this more, but for now, \\"Greatest Story Ever D'ohed\\" was just this side of good.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ and said \\"there were jokes here that went on way too long, like that whole krav maga thing. But, for the most part, this was a funny vacation episode, and the show hasn't done one of those in a while.\\" Jason Hughes of TV Squad gave the episode a negative review saying \\"I don't expect 'The Simpsons' to have that sharp edge of wit it used to in its earlier, more subversive days, but I do expect it to be able to create situations for humor from time to time; even if it's gentle humor.\\" The TV Fanatic gave the episode a 3/5 saying \\"It manages to combine jokes, while still showing positive messages such as Homer showing genuine care after Flanders, his supposed enemy, takes off into the desert . Or even Homer's positive message of re- uniting all faiths.\\" Writer Kevin Curran was nominated for a Humanitas Award for his script. Legacy The episode was used on a report on Jerusalem syndrome by CNN. While searching for Ned in the desert, Homer complains of his hunger, thirst, and libido to the tune of the theme from Lawrence of Arabia.

A small number are also found in the Terai region of Nepal. Darzi means tailor in Hindustani. They are also known as Idrisi or Idrisi Shaikh.People of India: Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One, edited by Amir Hasan & J.C. Das, , pages 412‚Äì415 History and origin The Darzi claim descent from Idris (Enoch), one of the biblical and Islamic prophets. According to their traditions, Idris was the first person to learn the art of sewing. The word Darzi literally means business of tailor in Hindustani. It is said to be derived from the Persian word , which means to sew. This is also the commonly accepted derivation of the name of the non- related religion Druze. The Darzi are said to have settled in South Asia during the early period of the Sultanate of Delhi. They are also divided on a linguistic basis, with those of North India speaking various dialects of Urdu,People of India: Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Two, edited by Amir Hasan & J.C. Das, , page 413 while those of Punjab speaking Punjabi. The Punjabi Darzi are said to be converts from the Hindu Chhimba caste, and have several territorial divisions. These include the Sirhindi, Deswal and Multani. The Punjabi Darzi (Chhimba Darzi) are almost entirely Sunni.H.A. Rose, A Glossary of the Tribes & Castes of Punjab, Low Price Publications, page 228 Darzi consider themselves equivalent to vaishya. Present circumstances Gujarati Darjis are branched out into Vanza and Sai Suthar majogothia. In India The Shaikh Idrisi, or Darzi, as they prefer to be known, are still essentially involved with their traditional occupation of tailoring and garment-related work. Many urban Idrisi have now opened big shops and showrooms, or are employed in the textile industry, while the new generation of Idrishi caste are largely educated and many are employed doing government jobs or settled in Gulf countries. They have a traditional community council which still exercises some control over matters of social behavior.People of India: Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One, edited by Amir Hasan & J.C. Das, , page 415 In western Uttar Pradesh, Osmania Turks or Osmania Turk sheikhs are also engaged in this profession. They are of Central Asian Turkmen (Uighur) origin and are actually descendants of the Turkish sultanate in India. They are mainly settled in the western Uttar Pradesh districts of Bijnor, Moradabad, Shajahanpur, Amroha, Etah, Aligarh, Bulandshahr, Meerut and Muzzafarnagar. Most Darzi who migrated to Karachi are Turki sheikhs who had taken up the profession out of poverty and lack of better professions. They are still called Turki in local areas. Turki or Turki Darzi are very fair and have Uighur genetic makeup. Their women and men still look like Central Asians, with little beards, sharp features, and deep low eyes. There are also mixes of Moghuls and Turks in India. Most Turki have now left this profession in order to become highly-paid professionals like doctors, engineers, and professors. They also run large garments businesses in Noida, India. Normally, they use \\"Osmani\\" or \\"Uddin\\" as their surname, but recently, due to the benefits in India quota system, they have also started using \\"Idrisi\\". In Bihar, the Darzi are known as Idrisi, and claim descent from the prophet Idris (Enoch). They are found mainly in the districts of Bhagalpur, Chhapra, Sitamarhi, Purvi Champaran, Siwan, Gopalganj, Muzaffarpur, Madhubani, Darbhanga, Munger, and Patna. The Idrisi of Jharkhand have a common origin with those of Bihar, and intermarry. The community speak the Angika dialect of Hindi. Most Idrisis are still engaged in tailoring, but many Idrisis, particularly in Jharkhand are now farmers. Their customs are similar to other Bihari Muslims.People of India: Bihar Volume XVI Part One, edited by S. Gopal & Hetukar Jha, Seagull Books, pages 392‚Äì394 In Pakistan In Pakistan, the Darzi are, in fact, two distinct communities, the Delhiwal Idrissis, who are found among the Muhajir ethnic group, and the Chhimba Darzi, who are ethnically Punjabi. The former are immigrants from Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in India. They are concentrated in the port city of Karachi. Like their North Indian kinsmen, many have now opened small shops and businesses, although many other members of the community work for other Idrissis. They remain divided by sectarian divisions, the Sunni Idrisi not marrying into Shia Idrisi families. The community claims itself to be of Shaikh status. In Punjab, the Chhimba Darzi are immigrants from East Punjab. Many in rural areas of Punjab have taken to cultivation, while those in urban areas have opened up small businesses. The Chhimba Darzi claim to belong to the Muslim Rajput community. They are entirely Sunni, and many belong to the orthodox Deobandi sect.Pnina Werbner, The Migration Process: Capital, Gifts and Offerings among British Pakistanis, Berg publications See also * Druze heterodox Muslim community of Syria, also derived their name from the word Darzi References Category:Muhajir communities Category:Muslim communities of Bihar Category:Muslim communities of India Category:Muslim communities of Uttar Pradesh Category:Punjabi tribes Category:Social groups of Pakistan Category:Social groups of Uttar Pradesh Category:Social groups of Bihar ","title":"Darzi"},{"id":"24424150","text":"Thomas Virgil Stallcup (January 3, 1922 ‚Äì May 2, 1989) was an American professional baseball shortstop who played in seven Major League seasons from 1947 through 1953.

He was originally signed by the Boston Red Sox before World War II, and was selected by the Cincinnati Reds in the Rule 5 draft after the season, when Stallcup batted .304 in the Class B Piedmont League. After his debut with the Reds on April 18, 1947, he was sent to the Jersey City Giants for seasoning, and he responded by hitting .338 with 15 home runs in 76 games. From 1948 to 1951, Stallcup was Cincinnati's starting shortstop, but he never batted higher than .254; he twice hit eight home runs in a season. During the 1951 season, he was platooned with 21-year-old Roy McMillan, though he still saw the majority of the action at shortstop. However, the following season, McMillan became the everyday shortstop, and in May, Stallcup was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals, where he ended his MLB career as a utility infielder. Overall, Stallcup batted .241 with 22 home runs in 587 games. After briefly managing in minor league baseball, Stallcup left the game.

Name  The name Teurisci is considered a variant of Taurisci or Tauristae.  Distribution   Taurisci  Celtic Taurisci located in Noricum while Teurisci are in Dacia The Celtic Taurisci were settled in the south-eastern Alps and were known from the name of Mount Taurus. Due to iron mining, their centers (i.e. Noreia - now Newmarkt and Virunum now Magdalensburg) enjoyed great success in trade and commerce with the Balkans. The lowland Taurisci gradually grew in power and became largely separate from their mountain relatives. Therefore, the inhabitants of this eastern area became known collectively ‚Äì from the place name Noreia ‚Äì as Norici and the territory under their control as Noricum.Hogain Daithi O.

It is found in large parts of Brazil. At times it migrates north into the United States. The wingspan is about 45 mm. Classification Some older authors have considered Eudocima apta as a synonym of E. materna but more recent workers consider apta as a New World species that is very similar in appearance to materna (Eudocima apta (Walker, [1858]) = Eudocima materna of authors, not Linnaeus, 1767). Eudocima materna is therefore the Old World counterpart of apta, and a simple visual comparison of materna and apta reveals obvious differences of the two species in both sexes. Zilli and Hogenes (2002) also report genitalic differences between the two species, most notably in the bursa.

Early life He was born in Jerusalem, Israel in 1930 to a Hasidic family named Hacohen. At age 16, he started publishing poetry in the Israeli newspaper Davar. He used the pen name \\"Peli\\" (\\"wonder\\") because he was afraid to use his real name, given that his family was a distinguished rabbinical family living in Jerusalem's ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim. He subsequently adopted it as his actual name. Peli received a B.A in Jewish History and Talmud at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and became a strong supporter of Religious Zionism. Academic career Pinchas and Penina Peli, with author Shai Agnon, at their home He was Professor of Jewish Thought and Literature at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, and a visiting professor at Yeshiva University, Cornell University, Notre Dame University, the Seminario Rabbinico in Argentina, and the Makuya Bible Seminary in Japan. He was also the editor of the Encyclopaedia Judaica Year Book, the Jerusalem Quarterly for Literature, and Panim-el-Panim (\\"Face to Face\\"), and served as the Torah Commentator for the Jerusalem Post. His writings include studies of the thought of rabbis Abraham Joshua Heschel and Joseph B. Soloveitchik, discussions concerning Shabbat, the Land of Israel, anti-Semitism, the problem of evil, and commentary on the weekly Torah portion (parsha). Interfaith activity Frequently lecturing to both Jews and Christians, he participated in the Israel Interfaith Committee and discussed Jewish-Catholic relations at the Vatican. Friendship with Joseph B. Soloveitchik While a professor at Yeshiva University between 1967 and 1971, he became a friend and important disciple of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, publishing a volume based on his oral discourses entitled On Repentance (Hebrew \\"Al haTeshuva\\", Jerusalem 1979), redacting the major points of Soloveitchik's teachings. See Joseph B. Soloveitchik #Works by Joseph Soloveitchik. Views Peli opposed efforts to impose greater religious control over life in Israel. He told an interviewer in 1986, \\"I think for the sake of religion and for the sake of Israel there must be a separation between state and religion.\\" Family Peli married his cousin Penina Cohen, whom he met in 1951 when he went to the United States as emissary of the Jewish Agency, lecturing on behalf of the Synagogue Council of America and the Israel Bonds organization. They raised four children: * Dr. Bitkha Har-Shefi, lecturer of Talmud at Hebrew Union College * Emuna Elon, Israeli author and journalist, who is married to Rabbi Binyamin Elon * Bat- Sheva Peli-Seri, active in the Kolech, the Israeli Religious Women's Forum * Deuell Peli, a lawyer Peli died in Jerusalem on 3 April 1989, and is buried in Jerusalem's Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery.

The commercial, called \\"Strong Feels Good,\\" was music supervised by Billig Rich. She worked on Broadway in 2016 providing music clearance services for Disaster! The Musical. Furthermore, Billig Rich does all music services and consultation for the for the Record live shows including BAZ Star Crossed Love at The Palazzo and For the Record Brat Pack currently available on Norwegian Cruise Lines. Billig Rich was nominated as one of the top 40 \\"Women in Music\\" by Billboard Magazine in December 2011. Rock of Ages Around 2003, Matt Weaver asked Billig Rich and a number of collaborators to help him develop and pitch the concept of a musical based on 1980s rock hits. Bands were to include Journey, Styx, REO Speedwagon, Foreigner, Pat Benatar, and Whitesnake. She became one of multiple producers for the show and took the role of talking to bands and securing song rights, a process which she has said took several years. Rock of Ages premiered in 2005. After playing off-Broadway in New York in fall 2008, it opened on Broadway on 7 April 2009. In 2009, the play received five Tony Award nominations, including Best Musical.

He was George Delacorte Professor Emeritus in the Humanities at Columbia University. Biography Early life Steven Marcus was born in New York City, the son of Nathan and Adeline Muriel (n√©e Gordon) Marcus. His grandparents were emigrants from the countryside near Vilnius. Adeline and Nathan, both nominally observant Jews, were raised, met, and married in the Bronx, and Nathan attended business school for two years to become an accountant. Only ten months after Steven was born in 1928, the stock market crashed, leaving his father unemployed for six years and causing the family to slide into poverty. Steven‚Äôs sister, Debora, was born in 1936, and the family moved to a lower-class neighborhood in the Bronx called Highbridge, near Yankee Stadium, which was populated by Irish, Italian, and Jewish families.Susanne Klingenstein. Enlarging America: The Cultural Work of Jewish Literary Scholars, 1930-1990. Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1998. As a child, Marcus befriended Stanley Kubrick, and the two remained close until Kubrick's death in 1999.\\"Steven Marcus Obituary: Academic Once Dismissed as a 'Student of Smut' who Wrote an Influential Study of Pornography in 19th-Century England\\". The Times, May 14, 2018. Marcus attended William Howard Taft and De Witt Clinton High School and graduated at the age of fifteen in 1944, against the backdrop of World War II. He was admitted with full scholarships to both Columbia University and Harvard, but because his family could not afford to pay for room and board at Harvard, he attended Columbia, where he studied under Lionel Trilling. Because of his family‚Äôs economic precariousness, Marcus continued to live at home and carry his lunch to school in a paper bag. Upon graduation, Marcus immediately enrolled in graduate school at Columbia, writing his master‚Äôs thesis on Henry James under the guidance of F. W. Dupee. After taking his master's degree in 1949, he took an instructorship at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he lived on a pig farm. Marcus was then appointed to a two-year lectureship at Baruch College, and became married to his first wife. Marcus also had brief stints at the University of North Carolina and the University of Southern California.Ruth Halikman. \\"Introducing the 'Troika': Columbia's New Leaders\\". Columbia Daily Spectator, July 7, 1993, p. 3. In 1952, he earned a fellowship to Cambridge University, where he was pulled into the orbit of F. R. Leavis, even as he rejected Leavis‚Äôs belittling of Dickens. While still at Cambridge, Marcus‚Äôs first pieces appeared in the Partisan Review and Commentary in December 1952 and March 1953. He would later recall that the Partisan Review \\"provided a singular experience of intellectual awakening and intensity. I did not read each issue so much as I gulped it down.\\"Steven Marcus, \\"Tribute to William Phillips\\". Partisan Review 70.2 (2003): 205. When he returned to America in 1954, he was drafted into the army, reported for basic training at Fort Dix, and was deployed to northern Greenland, far from any combat zones. Discharged in 1956, Marcus returned to Columbia, where he defended his dissertation in 1961. Because the committee was stacked with Trilling‚Äôs academic antagonists, it was a contentious defense, but Marcus passed, in part because of his already significant publication record. Career Immediately after earning his doctorate, Marcus was appointed to an assistant professorship at Columbia as a faculty colleague of Lionel Trilling. The two collaborated to co-edit an abridgment of Ernest Jones's The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud in 1961, and upon Trilling's death Marcus penned a long-form essay on Trilling's legacy as a cultural critic and public intellectual.Steven Marcus, \\"Lionel Trilling\\", New York Times, February 8, 1976. Carolyn Heilbrun, the first woman to earn tenure in the Columbia English Department, later described Marcus as among Trilling's male acolytes who sought to protect the department's entrenched male dominance.Carolyn Heilbrun. When Men were the Only Models we Had. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2002, p. 54. Nevertheless, feminist Kate Millett wrote her dissertation under Marcus's guidance, and when it was published as Sexual Politics shortly thereafter to wide acclaim, Millett singled out Marcus for gratitude in the preface, citing his \\"intellectual courage\\".Kate Millett, Sexual Politics. New York: Doubleday, 1970, xxvii. Marcus finalized his divorce from his first wife, Algene Ballif Marcus, in 1965.\\"Obituary: Algene Ballif Marcus\\", Salt Lake Tribune, April 26, 2014.

Marcus was one of six faculty signatories at Columbia in 1967 that pledged to make churches and synagogues refuges for conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War.Jeffrey Arsham. \\"Six Professors Sign Petition Supporting War Resistors\\". Columbia Daily Spectator, October 4, 1967, p. 1. In the wake of the Columbia University protests of 1968, Marcus was a member and organizer of the Columbia Faculty Peace Action Committee, which endorsed academic strikes as a tactic to bring an end to the war in Indochina and to pressure the university into withdrawing its support for war research.F. W. Dupee and Steven Marcus, \\"Peace Action at Columbia\\", The New York Review of Books, June 4, 1970. In 1969, for reprinting the anonymous memoir My Secret Life, Arthur Dobson became the first publisher to be charged under the Obscene Publications Act 1959, which would also be used to prosecute Penguin Books for publishing Lady Chatterley‚Äôs Lover. Marcus was flown in from New York to offer testimony as an expert defense witness. Pressed by the prosecutor to answer whether Walter‚Äôs account of sex with a ten-year-old girl at Vauxhall Gardens was not the most evil passage he had ever read, Marcus replied that accounts of Nazi concentration camps in the twentieth century, or of thirteen-year-old Victorian chimney sweeps dying of cancer of the scrotum in the nineteenth century, were more evil, but no one advocated suppressing this knowledge. The prosecution also accused Marcus of harboring prurient motives for analyzing pornography in The Other Victorians.Donald Thomas. ‚ÄúMy Secret Life: The Trial at Leeds‚Äù.

After three years of intensive study, Marcus released the so-called \\"Marcus Report\\" as head of the Presidential Commission on Academic Priorities in the Arts and Sciences. The 264-page report was unusually blunt in analyzing the decline in the quality of education offered by Columbia. Its core recommendation was new hiring in the hard sciences and elimination of twelve humanities faculty positions through attrition.David Rosenberg, \\"A&S; Panel Charts Slow Decline\\".

Price heard Marcus give a lecture on one of Wordsworth's ‚ÄúLucy‚Äù poems that addressed the perils of solitude and isolation, and became convinced that Marcus and Joyce Carol Oates were trying to find him a girlfriend. Price inundated Marcus with messages on his answering machine and mailed Marcus a suicide note. In response, Marcus, along with Edward Said, helped to persuade Price to take psychiatric medication by assuring him he was not under surveillance. Price later sent death threats to Marcus and Said, accusing them of ‚Äúsoul murder‚Äù, and by 1994, Marcus reported that Price had on two occasions used a baseball bat to shatter windows at the English Department before being arrested.William H.

In a special issue of the Partisan Review in 1993, Marcus characterized political correctness as a new incarnation of the ‚Äúsoft totalitarianism‚Äù described by George Orwell, whereby orthodoxies ‚Äúmuzzle, stifle, or suppress dissent, and create fear and anxiety in those whose thinking deviates from their prescriptions‚Äù. In Marcus‚Äôs account, adherents of political correctness share a number of common features, including a shared sense of victimhood, resentment towards humor, jokes, and comedy, and malice couched in euphemisms. Marcus cited the example of a professor of anthropology denouncing the candy Mars Bars as a confectionery embodiment of America‚Äôs indefensible impulse to colonize everything, including extraterrestrial planetary space.Steven Marcus, ‚ÄúSoft Totalitarianism‚Äù. The Partisan Review, 60.4 (1993): 630‚Äì38. Marcus died at the age of 89 as a result of cardiac arrest.Sam Roberts, \\"Steven Marcus, Columbia Scholar and Literary Critics, Dies at 89\\". New York Times, April 30, 2018. Major works Dickens: From Pickwick to Dombey Marcus's first scholarly monograph, From Pickwick to Dombey, used psychoanalytic and mythological frameworks to analyze seven of Dickens's then neglected early novels. Marcus's arguments would prove exceptionally influential, including claims that the master-concept of Nicholas Nickleby was a hostility to \\"prudence\\"; that the abstract principle governing Dombey and Son was resistance to change and temporal decay; that Sam Weller cagily subverts the idealizing morality of Mr. Pickwick; and that Oliver Twist makes its most incisive political indictments through \\"satiric innocence\\", or a position of non-partisan humanity. Though immediately recognized as an eminent work of Dickens criticism, From Pickwick to Dombey was widely criticized for an over-reliance on Freudian concepts, a tendency that academic reviewers called \\"facile\\",Edgar Johnson, Nineteenth-Century Fiction 20.4 (1966): 399. \\"deeply flawed\\",Harry Stone, \\"Critic of the Hour\\", Kenyon Review 27.3 (1965): 518. and, according to Barbara Hardy, \\"rigidly orthodox\\" and \\"tactless\\".Barbara Hardy, Victorian Studies 9.3 (1966): 207. The New York Times review praised Marcus for connecting the ‚Äúglaring faults of staginess and sentimentality‚Äù in Dickens‚Äôs fiction to the ‚Äúdeep wounds in his personal life‚Äù,G. S. Fraser. ‚ÄúBolts and Flashes of Genius‚Äù. New York Times, May 16, 1965, BR5. though The Times mocked Marcus for using abstruse and stilted diction such as \\"hypnagogic phenomenon\\".‚ÄúLetters by Boz‚Äù. The Times, February 4, 1965. The Other Victorians Using a psychoanalytic lexicon developed by Sigmund Freud, The Other VictoriansSteven Marcus. The Other Victorians: A Study of Sexuality and Pornography in Mid-Nineteenth-Century England. New York: Basic Books, 1966. draws on archival materials from the Kinsey Institute to analyze sexual subcultures in nineteenth-century Britain. Marcus culls the official views of Victorian society from physician William Acton, whose writings anxiously deny the existence of childhood sexuality even as they make elaborate recommendations to suppress it. Acton‚Äôs later writings about prostitution reveal a more humanizing approach designed to alleviate stigma and reintegrate women into other professions. Marcus also documents the widespread legal and medical panic over masturbation, which was strongly correlated with mental alienation and insanity. Semen was regarded as a finite commodity whose depletion through onanism or wet dreams, known as ‚Äúspermatorrhoea‚Äù, was believed to lead to enervation, disease, and eventually death. Marcus contrasts these official views with the clandestine circulation of pornography, records of which were meticulously preserved by Henry Spencer Ashbee‚Äôs elaborately annotated indices. The Other Victorians also provided the first extensive study of the anonymous eleven-volume pornographic memoir My Secret Life, which Marcus took to be an authentic sexual biography inflected with fantasy. Marcus draws out revealing episodes of Walter‚Äôs sexual life, including the rape of his wife, coerced sex from domestic servants and starving laborers, the insertion of shilling pieces into vaginas to gauge their capacity, and persistent fears of genital inadequacy, castration, and impotence. Through readings of works of obscene literature, including The Lustful Turk and The Victim of Lust, Marcus concludes that the organizing purpose of pornographic fantasy is to reassure the man of the presence and persistence of his genitals. Marcus concludes that pornography is distinct from literature in its singular goal of arousal, its repetitions without fulfillment, and its effort to move beyond language and reality. Marcus‚Äôs most famous conceptual contribution is his coinage of the term pornotopia to describe a utopian fantasy of abundance where ‚Äúall men . . . are always and infinitely potent; all women fecundate with lust and flow inexhaustibly with sap or juice or both. Everyone is always ready for everything.‚Äù Within weeks of appearing in Britain in 1966, The Other Victorians sailed past Mary Nancy Mitford's biography of Louis XIV to top the national bestseller list.\\"Professor Steven Marcus, Professor of Victorian Pornography, Obituary\\". Daily Telegraph, May 1, 2018. The initial reception of The Other Victorians was mixed. Diane Darrow found fault with Marcus‚Äôs assumption that My Secret Life was an authentic biography,Diane Darrow. The Kenyon Review 28.5 (1966): 708. and in the same vein William Shaefer noted that Marcus ‚Äútreats the book as if it were a verified case history, and thus his sober Freudian analysis at times becomes almost ludicrous‚Äù.William D. Shaefer. Nineteenth-Century Fiction 21.4 (1967): 385. Mike Spilka cautioned that Marcus‚Äôs conclusions are drawn from a very small sampling of texts, which leads him overestimate the anxiety around depletion of the seminal economy.Mike Stilka. Victorian Studies 10.3 (1967): 294. Robert Philmus similarly expressed regret at Marcus‚Äôs ‚Äúdisinclination to assimilate a wider range of literary evidence and historical particulars\\".Robert M. Philmus. Criticism 10.1 (1968): 92. In a lengthy review essay, historian Brian Harrison charged that Marcus‚Äôs unitary ideal of ‚Äúpornotopia‚Äù was based on too few texts; that he omitted a bibliography and references to My Secret Life; that his ‚Äúresearch is not sufficiently extensive to bear the weight of his relatively ambitious conclusions‚Äù; and that his analysis contains ‚Äúmoralising passages which might well have been uttered by a nineteenth-century clergyman‚Äù.Brian Harrison. ‚ÄúUnderneath the Victorians‚Äù. Victorian Studies 10.3 (1967): 248, 249, 252, 249. Meanwhile, in the popular press, a review in The Times described the subject matter as ‚Äúghastly stuff‚Äù and derided Marcus as ‚Äúa student of smut who deserves to be admired as much for stamina as for integrity of purpose.Pierce Hannah, ‚ÄúPornotopia‚Äù. The Times, January 19, 1967. A more laudatory assessment The New York Times described the work as a \\"rigidly Freudian\\" but nonetheless \\"valuable and perceptive mining operation in Victoriana\\".Elizabeth Janeyway, \\"Two Faces of an Era\\", New York Times, August 4, 1966. In his 2009 preface to the reissue of The Other Victorians, Marcus returned to a Freudian framework to analyze \\"residues of infantile and childhood sexuality\\" in contemporary sexual behavior and observed that women's erotic lives continue to be understudied in the twenty-first century.Steven Marcus. The Other Victorians: A Study of Sexuality and Pornography in Mid-Nineteenth-Century England. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction, 2009. Marcus‚Äôs work set off a flurry of scholarship in nineteenth-century cultural studies, producing book-length works on sexuality, prostitution, masturbation, flagellation, sodomy, and masochism. Andrew H. Miller, surveying the critical terrain of sexuality studies three decades later, described The Other Victorians as ‚Äúthe single most influential account of sexuality in Victorian Britain before the work of Foucault\\".Andrew H. Miller. ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù, in Sexualities in Victorian Britain, ed. Andrew H. Miller and James Eli-Adams. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1996, p. 2. Michel Foucault developed the most comprehensive challenge to the \\"repressive hypothesis\\" that pervades Marcus's account of Victorian sexuality, signaling his challenge to Marcus by entitling Part 1 of his study, \\"We 'Other' Victorians\\".Michel Foucault, The History of Sexuality, Volume 1: An Introduction. New York: Pantheon, 1979. Marcus had earlier characterized Foucault's scholarship as \\"impenetrable\\" on account of \\"the author‚Äôs arrogance, carelessness, and imprecision‚Äù.Steven Marcus, ‚ÄúIn Praise of Folly‚Äù. New York Review of Books, November 17, 1966. More recently, Thomas Joudrey has challenged Marcus's concept of pornotopia, explaining, \\"Far from envisaging a world of endless potency and pleasure, Victorian pornography grapples with the terrifying prospects of bodily decay, suffering, and mortality, placing potency on a razor's edge.\\" Joudrey cites examples of \\"impotence, syphilitic outbreaks, torn foreskins, severed rods, soiled cocks, and slack vaginas\\" to illustrate a pervasive pattern of failure and conflict fundamentally at odds with \\"utopian fantasies of purity and immortality\\".Thomas J. Joudrey. \\"Penetrating Boundaries: An Ethics of Anti- Perfectionism in Victorian Pornography\\". Victorian Studies 57.3 (2015): 423-32. Similarly, though Marcus characterized pornography as apolitical and ahistorical fantasy, Joudrey has cited evidence from the underground Victorian magazine The Pearl of extensive political commentary, including references to the Reform Bills and Contagious Diseases Acts and allusions to many controversial public figures, such as Annie Besant, Charles Spurgeon, Wilfrid Lawson, Newman Hall, Edmund Burke, William Gladstone, and Robert Peel.Thomas J. Joudrey, \\"Against Communal Nostalgia: Reconstructing Sociality in the Pornographic Ballad\\", Victorian Poetry 54.4 (2017): 516. Engels, Manchester, and the Working Class Marcus takes the inadequacy of previous critical approaches as the impetus for his project about the life of Friedrich Engels in Manchester. Pigenholed as a monument to socialism, an interpretation of industrial revolution, or a historical document of urban life, Engels's The Condition of the Working Class in England has been widely misunderstood, Marcus argues, because the brutal demoralization and dehumanization that it documented begarred description, and therefore a literary approach that takes into account the inadequacies and displacements of language is crucial to understanding it. Engels accomplishment was not so much explaining the material forces that built Manchester into a landscape of industrial squalor, but in reckoning with a spectacle of such enormity that words themselves failed as a means of representation. The first section pursues the question of why the bourgeois German son of a factory master would forsake his own class. Taking Eric Hobsbawm to task for ignoring psychoanalytic questions altogether, Marcus rejects the simplistic formula of an Oedipal turn on his father, but argues for a more subtle understanding of Engels as envisioning a proletarian fury transformed into consciousness, thereby synthesizing and resolving his admiration and resentment of his own father. Nonetheless, Marcus argues that Engels never could overcome his middle-class feelings of superiority over his romantic partner, Mary Burns, despite his enduring love for her. Marcus then turns to comparing Engels's analysis of Manchester to those of major literary observers, including Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle, Benjamin Disraeli, Alexis de Tocqueville, Edwin Chadwick, and French economist L√©on Faucher. Marcus argues that Engels succeeds along with Dickens not because they get their data right or wrong, but because they echo the deepest unconscious contradictions of men. The academic reaction to Marcus's work on Engels generally faulted his biographical Freudian approach to material and historical processes. Myrna Chase judged that Marcus's \\"psychological analysis of Engels must be judged more humorous than profound.Myrna Chase. Newsletter: European Labor and Working Class History 7 (1975): 36-38. Echoing Chase, John Lucas argues that Marcus's \\"psychoanalytic speculations\\" are entirely unhelpful and in some cases \\"plain silly\\", noting that whether Engels saw Thomas Carlyle as a father-figure is \\"not of the slightest importance\\". Lucas adds that Marcus's failure to take Elizabeth Gaskell's novels seriously prevents Marcus from seeing the limitations of Engels's perception of the working class. By using the worst examples of filth and poverty as archetypal, Marcus colludes with Engels in erasing the gradations of the working class and their efforts at cultural production.John Lucas. Victorian Studies 18.4 (1975): 461-72. Alfred Jenkin wondered whether the frequent errors of fact about Manchester implied that Marcus had never set foot in the city.Alfred Jenkin. Science and Society 40.1 (1976): 108-111. E. V. Walter faulted Marcus's wandering and elliptical style of analysis, characterizing his work as \\"excruciatingly mannered\\" and \\"inconclusive\\".E. V. Walter. American Political Science Review 70.4 (1976): 1283. Nevertheless, The Times praised it as a ‚Äúbrilliant, if sometimes bejargoned, new book‚Äù that would reinvigorate interest in the work of Friedrich Engels.Michael Ratcliffe, ‚ÄúNews from Nowhere‚Äù, The Times, October 3, 1974. Representations Representations collects a broad range of reviews and essays written between 1956 and 1974, organized around what Marcus terms \\"the imagination of society\\". Marcus uses this phrase to collapse the distinction between material actuality and formal representation: \\"The structures of literature refer to this real world, comment upon it, represent it by means of a written language that is part of it, and are hence themselves part of the same world that they refract and reconstitute imaginatively.\\" Revisiting his interpretation of Pickwick Papers from his first book, Marcus argues that Dickens's style begins in a mode of \\"free, wild, inventive doodling\\" but gathers design and purpose as Pickwick encounters the hard structures of law, property, and money. On representation in George Eliot's fiction, Marcus argues that her narrative histories mimic nineteenth-century abstract systems of explanation while militating against acknowledgment of their artificial constructedness, thereby creating a stable history that seems to rest on nature, rather than linguistic invention. Marcus then takes up Freudian concepts to suggest that Eliot's early fiction is a complex system of psychic defense mechanisms constructed to control three principle subjects: sexual passion, class conflict, and the unintelligibility of the world. He illustrates this process by showing that in Scenes of Clerical Life, Milly Barton suffers from a miscarriage, which Eliot obliquely represents, then dies from experiencing premature labor. Marcus takes this to imply that Milly died of her own sexual satisfaction in her marriage, engendering a profound and compelling mystery as to why a less than ordinary man could gratify an extraordinary woman. Scholarly reviews of Representations praised Marcus's relentless interdisciplinary synthesis of literary, anthropological, and philosophical methods,Asa Briggs, Nineteenth-Century Fiction 32.1 (1977): 118-21. and commended Marcus's style for its \\"playfulness, wit, zest, and readability\\", in contrast to the \\"high seriousness and arch academicism of most criticism today\\".George Core, \\"Arnold, Eliot, and the Critical Performance Today\\". The Sewanee Review 85.4 (1977): 682-86. A review in the New York Times praised the collection as ‚Äústrong, deeply felt, and humane‚Äù, but lamented that Marcus ‚Äúalways seems to doubt himself or to suspect himself of triviality when he allows his mind to run loose from the mind of society‚Äù.Denis Donoghue. ‚ÄúRepresentation‚Äù.

Early life and World War I Amedeo Mecozzi was born on 17 January 1892 in Rome.Franks et al 1997, pp. 145-146. Mecozzi was orphaned when young, and consequently raised by his grandparents.Varriale 2009, pp. 62-63. He joined the Italian Army as an engineer, and spent a year as a volunteer in Somalia before applying for pilot's training in 1915. In June 1915, he was accepted, and began training at Malpensa on 2 September. January 1916 saw him qualifying on Maurice Farman 12 and Maurice Farman 14 machines. On 1 February 1916 he received his pilot's certificate. In March 1916 he began flying reconnaissance missions for 45a Squadriglia, at some personal hazard; he often brought home an airplane damaged by enemy fire. On 1 January 1917, he was commissioned as a sottotenente and reassigned to 50a Squadriglia. His determination to continue fighting despite battle damaged aircraft won him renown; on both 8 January and 19 February, he was granted a Bronze Medal for Military Valor. On 19 June 1917, he was shot down by bullets through his Farman's radiator. That same day, he was awarded the Croce di Guerra. In September 1917, he was forwarded to fighter pilot's training in Malpensa. On 4 October, he was promoted to tenente. He was then assigned back to the front with 76a Squadriglia on 12 October. The next month, he was assigned to 78a Squadriglia for his final wartime posting. He scored his first victory the day after Christmas, 1917, teaming with his wingman to send an enemy reconnaissance plane down in flames. Mecozzi eagerly rushed off to the wreckage of his victim, only to find outraged farmers whose barn was burning along the wrecked plane. On 26 May 1918, he used his Hanriot HD.1 to pick off a second recce machine with a hundred round burst, then ran his guns dry to down an Austro-Hungarian Albatros D.III from Fliegerkompanie 42j. On 15 June 1918, he teamed with Antonio Riva to down a Hansa-Brandenburg C.I. Also in June, Mecozzi was noted as changing his aircraft's insignia from a question mark on a black ball to two blue bands around the fuselage. On 27 July, in conjunction with another pilot, he shot down Hansa-Brandenburg C.I No. 169.14 for his fifth victory. Mecozzi would go on to claim an observation balloon in June and three more planes in October 1918, but these four wins went unconfirmed. Mecozzi served with 78a Squadriglia past war's end, until February 1919. Having scored all of his victories in the Hanriot HD.1 he was one of the most successful pilots in the type, along with Willy Coppens. Post World War I Mecozzi was awarded the Silver Medal for Military Merit in the postwar honors list. The committee evaluating aerial victories confirmed five of his victories. He stayed in the military postwar and ascended through the ranks. Mecozzi was accepted for permanent service on 31 October 1919. He was a member of the Italian Aviation Mission to Paris. He also served with the Technical Directorate of the Italian Air Force at Montecelio; there he had opportunity to fly confiscated airplanes, such as German Fokker D.VIIs, Albitri, Pfalzes, and Fokker D.VIIIs, as well as Ph√∂nixs. In 1916, he began a stint at public relations for the Italian Air Ministry. On 29 July 1927, he was promoted to maggiore. On 10 October 1929, he was given command of 7 Gruppo. Mecozzi developed his own theory of military aviation usage which was dubbed the \\"Attack air force\\" or \\"Assault aviation\\" doctrine. Its emphasis was on attacking military targets rather than civilians and civil industry. This put him in frequent opposition to Douhet and his theory of strategic bombing. Mecozzi nevertheless continued to be promoted, becoming a generale di Brigata on 8 April 1937. However, Mecozzi was invalided from duty and became president of the national aviation club. He also published the Editoriale Aeronautica of the Air Ministry. After World War II, he retired at the rank of Generale. For some years after that, he edited Rivista Aeronautica, a supposedly independently magazine covertly supported by the air force. Mecozzi also campaigned for a national air museum for Italy. Mecozzi became eccentric; he wore his flying suit to the magazine's offices. Towards the end of his life, he escaped talking about his early combat experiences by becoming mute. He died on 2 November 1971 in his native Rome. Notes References * Franks, Norman; Guest, Russell; Alegi, Gregory.

Born in Toronto, Ryall was sent to England to be educated in 1900. In England, he began working as a general reporter for the newspaper London Exchange-Telegraph and began writing racing reports from England for New York World. Ryall afterwards went to New York City, and his first column for The New Yorker was published on July 10, 1926. The New Yorker had been launched on February 21, 1925. Ryall chose a pen name because at the time he was still writing for New York World; he used this name in honor of Audax, the nom de plume of British racing journalist Arthur Fitzhardinge Berkeley Portman. (Ryall's full name was George Francis Trafford Ryall. His son, a horse-racing photographer, and grandson, an art photographer, both received the same name, designated as generations II and III.) He was the writer of longest record in the history of the magazine, and his column, \\"The Race Track,\\" ran from 1926 to 1978. He wrote on various aspects of horse racing, from starting barriers to horse training, from the Saratoga Special Stakes to the names given horses. \\"Being one of those peevish fellows who believe that every horse deserves a good name (and you'll find that, on the whole, the better racers are well named),\\" Ryall wrote in 1960, \\"I'm sorry to say this year's crop of two-year-olds has fared pretty badly...

He gained his engineering skills working for his father building Newcomen steam engines in Cornwall. He later worked for Boulton and Watt building the new Watt steam engines designed and patented by James Watt. By 1790, he had set up a business in London with financial backing from well-to-do currier John Maberly, where he designed a new steam engine based on the patented designs of Isaac Mainwaring.

The most severely affected areas were parts of Palestine and western Transjordan. The cities of Tiberias, Beit She'an Pella, Gadara, and Hippos were largely destroyed while many other cities across the Levant were heavily damaged. The casualties numbered in the tens of thousands. In Jewish sources this earthquake is known, in Hebrew, as ◊®◊¢◊© ◊©◊ë◊ô◊¢◊ô◊™, Ra'ash Shevi'it, lit. \\"seventh noise\\", interpreted by scholars to mean The Earthquake of the Sabbatical Year, because the earthquake fell on a sabbatical year, literally \\"the seventh year\\" in the Jewish calendar. Damage and casualties According to historical sources, supported by archaeological findings, Scythopolis (Beit She'an), Tiberias, Capernaum, Hippos (Sussita), Jerash and Pella, suffered widespread damage. A Coptic priest from Alexandria reported that support beams had shifted in houses in Egypt and a Syrian priest wrote that a village near Mount Tabor had \\"moved a distance of four miles.\\" Other sources reported tsunami in the Mediterranean Sea, several days of aftershocks in Damascus, and towns swallowed up in the earth. The town of Umm el Kanatir and its ancient synagogue were destroyed. Historical sources describe how the death toll in Jerusalem numbered in the thousands. Many buildings, among them the Al-Aqsa Mosque, were severely damaged. However, some caveats are required. The view of the severity of the damage provoked by the 749 quake is contested by new research. Earlier claims that the large Umayyad administrative buildings south of the Al-Aqsa Mosque were so badly damaged that they were abandoned and used as stone quarries and sources of lime, lime kilns being found at the site, is reportedly wrong, the buildings staying in use until the 1033 earthquake. Similarly, the new Arab capital city at Ramla only shows minimal signs of damage. Religious significance Ruins of Hippos/Sussita \\"Ra'ash shvi'it\\" is mentioned in piyyutim (Jewish liturgical poems). Some rabbis believe the earthquake struck in a Sabbatical year, in which case, the translation of the term would be \\"earthquake of the seventh year.\\" Dating issues and primary sources All local and regional earthquake catalogues list one or more earthquakes that affected the Middle East in the mid-8th century, with reported damages in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Palestine, and Syria. The primary sources offer multiple year dates for the seismic events, but seismic catalogues of the 1980s and 1990s agreed in attributing all descriptions to an earthquake occurring on 18 January, 749. This reduction was based on two Hebrew texts concerning an earthquake on this date and a commemorative fast.Karcz, 2004, p. 778-787 A different view is that the primary sources describe at least two different seismic events, set apart by up to three years in time and hundreds of kilometers in distance. This is based on comparison of available primary sources on this period. The first earthquake may have weakened a number of structures, while the second earthquake completed the process and was the immediate cause of their collapse.  Byzantine sources  The historian Theophanes the Confessor (9th century) is one of the major sources for the 8th century. He lists two earthquakes that affected Palestine and the Levant in the mid-8th century. The first earthquake is dated to 18 January of the year 6238 of the Byzantine calendar (the year 747 in Anno Domini era). Theophanes reports that the earthquake affected Palestine by the Jordan River, and all of Syria. Churches and monasteries reportedly collapsed in the desert of the Holy City (Jerusalem). Theophanes reports that a second earthquake took place in the year 6241 (749/750 in the Anno Domini system). He does not give an exact date for the event, but the earthquake narrative immediately follows Theophanes' entry on the birth of Leo IV the Khazar. Leo IV was a son of Constantine V and his birth is safely dated to 25 January, 750. This second earthquake destroyed some cities in Syria, and damaged others. A number of cities reportedly slid down from mountainous positions to \\"low laying plains\\". The moving cities reportedly stopped at a distance of about from their original positions. Eyewitness accounts from Mesopotamia reported that the ground was split at a distance of . From this new chasm emerged a different type of soil, \\"very white and sandy\\". The reports also spoke of a mule-like animal emerging from the chasm and speaking in a human voice. The distances in Theophanes' account are scaled up. Otherwise this is a credible account of the earthquake causing landslides, surface rupture, and sand boils in a semi-arid area. Such events would be more common during the year's wet season. The only clearly fantastical element of the narrative is the talking animal. Theophanes is thought to have used as his source a Melkite chronicle written c. 780 in Palestine, and later transported by monks who fled religious persecution in Palestine. Theophanes' information on Iraq and North Syria may have been based on local sources using the Seleucid era, but which had started their counting from the Spring of 311 BC, rather than the Fall of 312 BC. A resulting transcription error may explain why Theophanes dates his second earthquake to 750 rather than 749. Nikephoros I of Constantinople (9th century) gives a nearly identical description of the 750 earthquake. The 747 earthquake is not described in the currently extant text of Theophanes, though this may be due to a lacuna in the relevant section of the manuscript. The 747 earthquake is described in the Great Chronographer and the Minor Chronicles, while events connected to the 750 earthquake are depicted there among a series of \\"wondrous events\\" which followed the birth of Leo IV. Accounts of both earthquakes appear in other chronicles, such as those written by Paul the Deacon (8th century), Anastasius Bibliothecarius (9th century), and George Kedrenos (12th century). Both earthquakes are absent in the chronicles of Eutychius of Alexandria (10th century), Michael Glykas (12th century), and Leo Grammaticus (13th century). George Hamartolos (9th century) repeated verbatim Theophanes' account of the 749/750 earthquake, and only commented on the oracle-like mule. Joannes Zonaras (14th century) dates the earthquake as having followed the fall of Germanikeia (modern Kahramanmara≈ü) at the hands of Constantine V. This siege event is dated to 745/746 by Theophanes.  Muslim sources  Al-Suyuti reports on two distinct earthquakes events which damaged Jerusalem and Damascus. The first event can be dated to Hijri year 130 (747/748 Anno Domini), and the second to Hijri year 141 (748/749). Al-Suyuti uses as a primary source the narrative of historian Abdalla al-Katir (8th-9th century), as transmitted by al-Wadai (14th century). This narrative reports that Damascus was affected by an earthquake in Hijri year 130, which led the inhabitants of the city to abandon it. The poultry market of Damascus collapsed under fallen rocks. In Hijri year 131, a second earthquake split the roof of the mosque. The open sky was visible from the interior of the mosque. A subsequent earthquake closed the crack in the roof of the mosque. The historian Sibt ibn al-Jawzi (13th century) gives a hesitant and possibly confused account of this earthquake. Ibn Taghribirdi (15th century) reports that multiple strong earthquakes affected Syria in Hijri year 130. Jerusalem was reportedly heavily damaged, while Damascus was abandoned for a period of 40 days. The population of Damascus fled to desolate areas. Mukadassi (10th century) reported than an earthquake in the days of the Abbasid Caliphate (750-1258) threw down the sanctuary, with the exception of the part surrounding the mihrab. His narrative has been connected to the 750 earthquake event. In 750, Marwan II of the Umayyad Caliphate died and the Abbasid dynasty succeeded him. The Commemoratium de Casis Dei (808) mentions that the Church of Maria Nea was still in ruins following its destruction in an earthquake. This may be the 750 earthquake or a subsequent earthquake of the early Abbassid era. Arab reports of one or two earthquakes appear in two 11th- century compilations of traditional accounts of the Abd el Rahman family of Jerusalem. The compilers were the cousins al-Wasiti and Ibn al-Murajja. Based on their accounts, the earthquakes damaged the eastern and western parts of the Al-Aqsa Compound in Jerusalem. Repairs were ordered by Al-Mansur (reigned 754-775) when he visited Jerusalem in Hijri year 141 (757/758 Anno Domini). The Al-Aqsa Mosque was repaired by 757, but then damaged by a new earthquake. It was repaired again by order of Al-Mahdi (reigned 775-785), following his visit in Jerusalem at Hijri year 163. One of the traditions preserved by Ibn al-Murajja reports that the first earthquake took place during the Ramadan of Hijri year 130 (in May), during a cold and rainy night. A crack appeared in the mosque, but supposedly closed immediately by order of Heaven. Muslim literature often associated earthquake narratives with the holy month of Ramadan, so the offered date may have been chosen to make the story seem more reliable. Another traditional account from Jerusalem appeared in several later chronicles. It reported that there was earthquake damage across Syria (Bilad al-Sham), but places its emphasis on destruction in Jerusalem itself. It also reported injuries to the descendants of Shadad ibn Aus, one of the Companions of the Prophet.  Eastern Christian sources  There are four major Syriac chronicles which mention damages from earthquakes, though may not all be describing the same events. The first chronicle was the Zuqnin Chronicle, mistakenly attributed to Dionysius I Telmaharoyo (9th century), but currently thought to have been written by an anonymous 9th-century monk of the Zuqnin Monastery. The second was the chronicle of Elijah of Nisibis (11th century), the third was the chronicle of Michael the Syrian (12th century), and the fourth and last was the Chronicle of 1234 (13th century). There is some dating confusion. The chronicles all follow the Seleucid era calendar, but use two different reckonings of the era (the Babylonian and Macedonian versions). They all cover the second earthquake described by Theophanes. The only one who provides a specific chronology for the event was Elijah of Nisibis, who reports that the earthquake actually started in year 1059 of the Seleucid era and ended in year 1060 of the same era (Spring 748 and Spring 749). He counted spring as the start of the year. The Chronicle of 1234 dates the earthquake to year 1060 of the Seleucid era. Michael the Syrian offers no clear date, though a 19th-century translator noted in a footnote that the event could be dated to 6241 Anno Mundi, year 1060 of the Seleucid era, and year 749/750 Anno Domini. The dating was reportedly off by a year, since Michael's chronicle includes many chronological errors. It is unclear whether Michael himself was responsible for the errors, or whether they were introduced by copyists of the chronicle. The Zuqnin Chronicle dated the earthquake to year 1059 of the Seleucid era. None of the four Chronicles dates the even to 18 January. The date would nearly coincide with the Feast of Mary for the Seeds (blessing of the crops), one of the principal feasts of Mary, mother of Jesus in the Syrian tradition. It was celebrated on 15 January. In 749, the feast occurred on a Sunday, and so it would be celebrated a day or two following the actual date. The Zuqnin Chronicle mentions only one locality damaged by the earthquake, Maboug (modern Manbij). It also mentions vaguely damages in the Western region. In the Syriac Orthodox Church, the western region referred to the ecclesiastic province centered in Antioch, as opposed to the eastern region which was the ecclesiastic province centered in Tikrit. There was no strictly geographic definition of the ecclesiastic provinces. The other three chronicles list many localities in Syria which suffered from the earthquake. In the Palestine region, these chronicles mention that the earthquake damaged Tiberias, Mount Tabor, and Jericho. In contrast to the Arab chronicles, they do not mention earthquake damage in Jerusalem. Elijah mentions that a village near Mount Tabor was displaced by the earthquake, but does not mention either damages to the area or human casualties. He also mentions damage in the church of Maboug (Manbij), which was located about away from Mount Tabor. Michael the Syrian and the Chronicle of 1234 describe earthquake damage in Northern Syria and the Moab. They list among other damaged localities Ghautah, Dareiya (Darayya), Bosra, Nawa, Derat, Baalbek, Damascus , and Beit Qoubaye. Beit Qoubaye has been identified with Koubaiyat (or Al-Qoubaiyat), which was located at the foot of Jebel Akkar, about southwest of Homs and south of the Krak des Chevaliers. Their narratives mention no earthquake damage to the coastal cities of the Mediterranean Sea, though they do mention stormy seas and the submersion of a Yemenite coastal fortress. They mention destruction in Tiberias and \\"lateral displacement of springs\\" near Jericho. Based on their descriptions, it is likely that there was a localized tsunami-like storm wave in the Dead Sea. It was caused either by a nearby fault, a massive local slide, or by a temporary halt in the flow of the Jordan River. A change in the flow of the Jordan River may have caused a dam-breaking wave at the inflow of the River to the Dead Sea. Beyond these chronicles Agapius of Mendidj (10th century), mentioned both earthquake-induced flooding and inundation along the Syrian coast and destruction in Tiberias. He dates the event to the month of January, but offers no year date for this earthquake. He dates the event to having followed Constantine V incursion into Syria and the conquest of Germanikeia (modern Kahramanmara≈ü) and to have preceded Abu Muslim's leadership in the Abbasid Revolution (in May 747, or the Ramadan of Hijri year 129). The dating indicates that Agapius was describing the earliest of Theophanes' two earthquakes. Severus ibn al-Muqaffa (10th century) reports earthquake damage along the Mediterranean coast. The earthquake was felt strongly in Egypt, but reportedly the only Egyptian city which was damaged was Damietta. He otherwise reports the destruction of 600 towns and villages between Gaza City and the farthest extremity of Persia (Iran). He names none of the damaged localities, He claims that the earthquake harmed no Orthodox churches or monasteries. Severus also reports that many ships were lost at sea due to the earthquake. Severus gives the date of the earthquake as 21 Tuba (17 January), on the day of the Dormition of the Mother of God. In the tradition of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Dormition was celebrated between 16 and 18 January, unlike the tradition of the Byzantine church which celebrated the Dormition on 15 August. Severus gives no exact year for the earthquake, but in his narrative the earthquake is connected to the imprisonment and release of Pope Michael I of Alexandria, and a Nubian incursion into Egypt. These events were dated by Severus to Hijri year 130 (747/748 in Anno Domini). The date may be off by a year, as his description of events before and after the earthquake contains chronological errors. George Elmacin (13th century) and the Chronicon orientale attributed to Ibn al-RƒÅhib (13th century) both report widespread destruction of cities by the earthquake, and loss of life either in the ruins or due to flooding in the coasts. But they do not mention specific localities. They date the event to Hijri year 120 or to the year 460 of the Diocletian era. The dates are incompatible as the Hijri year corresponds to year 737/738 Anno Domini and the Diocletian year corresponds to year 744/745 Anno Domini. They both connect the earthquake's dates to the year of ascension of Pope Michael I. They give the year of Michael's ascent in the throne as 737 Anno Domini, while it has been dated to 743 Anno Domini by other sources. Both texts contain other errors in the chronology of the Patriarchs of Alexandria. The chronicle of Mekhitar of Ayrivank (13th century) mentions an earthquake taking place in 751 Anno Domini, during the reign of Constantine V. He does not connect this earthquake to 18 January, the date in which the Armenians of the Holy Land celebrate Christmas.  Samaritan sources  There are earthquake reports in two sources from a community of Samaritans, located near Nablus. They do not mention any earthquake damage in Jerusalem, which was located about from Nablus. Samaritans reject the sanctity of Jerusalem, and their holy place is Mount Gerizim, located near Nablus. The lack of information on Jerusalem in Samaritan sources may reflect the community's lack of interest in the city or even their disdain for it. An earthquake narrative appears in the Chronicle Adler, which is a compilation of older reports. The earthquake narrative also appears in some expanded versions of the chronicle of Abu'l-Fath (14th centurty). The original version of the chronicle ended with the rise in power of Muhammad, but was then expanded to bring it up to date. Abu'l-Fath wrote his chronicle in 1355, following a discussion he had with a High Priest over the absence of texts on the history of the Samaritans. He used as sources currently extinct Samaritan texts, and also historical materials he gathered from Damascus and Gaza City. His chronicle places a great earthquake during the reign of Marwan II (reigned 744-750), which was supposedly felt everywhere. Houses collapsed and buried their inhabitants in ruins. Numerous people perished due to the earthquake. It was reportedly unpreceded in scale. The earth continued to shake for many days, and the survivors of the earthquake stayed out in the open until the tremors stopped. Abu'l-Fath dated this earthquake in Hijri year 131 (748/749 in Anno Domini). The chronicle however contains a chronological error in placing the revolt of Abu Muslim as an event immediately following the earthquake. The revolt is known from other sources to have started in the Ramadan of 747.  Jewish sources  An account of the earthquake appeared in \\"Seventh earthquake\\", a piyyut (liturgical poem) used in synagogues. Liturgical poems such as this were used in place of fixed prayers on special religious occasions. The piyyut literary form was widespread in Palestine since the time of Talmud. The literary structure and style of a piyyut did not change much over the centuries. The date of composition of \\"Seventh earthquake\\" can not be deduced by use of either its literary form or its language. A second Jewish narrative of the earthquake appears in a book of prayers compiled in the 10th or 11th century. It was found in the Cairo depository (Genizza). The piyyut poem in question is a lament for an earthquake which caused widespread destruction and extensive casualties in Tiberias. It speaks of \\"fear\\" and \\"dark chaos\\" in Tiberias. The poem also reports that the Sharon plain was flooded due to the same earthquake. In modern history, the Sharon plain is the name exclusively used for the central section of the Israeli coastal plain. An older geographic sense is reported by Eusebius (4th century), who used the term for a section of the Jordan Valley and the Yizrael Valley. This section covered the area between Mount Tabor and Tiberias. The narrative poem reports that disaster befell \\"the city\\", with both the old and the young perishing. From the context it is unclear whether the poem is still speaking of Tiberias, or whether it instead reported earthquake damages in Jerusalem as well. In language, the poem evokes a section of the Book of Habakkuk. The section in the ancient book describes an earthquake as \\"wrath\\" which marches through the land in indignation. The poem repeatedly mentions a commemorative fast about the earthquake. It dates the fast to the 23rd day of the month Shevat. It is unclear whether the \\"sevent\\" in the title refers to the seventh shock of a singular earthquake or the seventh earthquake in a wider series of events. If may reflect a traditional narrative with no other surviving texts. The poem has been tentatively dated as composed between the 10th and the 12th century. In this period Tiberias was damaged by two other earthquakes, one taking place in 1033/1034 and the other in 1202. By the end of the 11th century, Tiberias' Jewish population was very small. Damage to the city at that time is considered unlikely to have triggered a nationwide day of fasting. It has been suggested that the poem depicts the 1933/1034 earthquake. However the fast was supposedly mentioned in passing by Pinneas the Poet, who was considered an \\"ancient\\" writer in a text dating to the 10th century. This led to a theory that the earthquake of the poem took place between the 7th and the 9th century, following the Muslim conquest of the Levant. Due to an assumption that the narrative poem alludes to a sabbatical year (the seventh year), the earthquake must have taken place in a sabbatical year. The only known earthquakes to fit this theory are the earthquakes of 712/713 and 747/748. There are little surviving details about the earlier of the two earthquakes, leading theorists to reject it as unimportant. The theory suggested that the earthquake of the poem took place on 23 Shevat (28 January) of 748 AD. This seems to be identical to the earthquake dated to Hijri year 130 (747/748 Anno Domini) in other sources. The Cairo depository source reports that the earthquake affected the Land of Israel, with many cities falling into ruins. Among the dead people in the ruins were reportedly sages, and the pious, and the just. The Cairo source specifically claims that Jerusalem was damaged by this earthquake. The Jewish text is thought to include an alphanumeric code in the style of gematria. An early attempt to decode it resulted in an implied date for the earthquake suggested in the text. It supposedly took place in the 679th year following the Siege of Jerusalem (70 Anno Domini) and the destruction of the Second Temple. This translates to year 749 Anno Domini, with the 23 Shevat taking place on 17 January. This can be identified with the first of the two earthquakes mentioned by Theophanes. However 749 was not a sabbatical year. A mint condition coin dated to 748 Anno Domini was found underneath seismic ruins in Beit She'an. This archaeological find was used to estimate that an earthquake took place at about that year. The last hoard of coins found in Capernaum dates to 744 and was found underneath collapse rubble. Lending further support to the idea of an earthquake. Alternatively however, the cities may have been damaged by order of Marwan II who is thought to have demolished fortifications in Jerusalem, Damascus, and Baalbek in a punitive campaign. These cities were supportive of his enemies. The demolition of the fortications could have weakened nearby buildings. It is unclear whether the piyyut was actually referring to a specific historical earthquake. There are other liturgical poems which use earthquakes as part of allegorical narratives. The poem could actually predate the 7th century and speak of a different earthquake. The decoding of the gematria is also questionable, since there are actually several different conversion codes. The figure of 679 years only reflects the method originally used, and can be altered if using a different conversion method.

Green drove the car to a world record speed on October 2, 1964. Green's world record is often forgotten, as the mark was eclipsed three times in less than two weeks, including the first to break the threshold.http://www.landracing.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=6&Itemid;=20 Green was chief engineer for a torque wrench manufacturer. Although Green's only racing experience had been a year of stock car racing in New Mexico ten years previously, he was greatly interested in aerodynamics. This dovetailed perfectly with Arfons' interest in racing mechanics. The two met at a trade fair in Gary, Indiana in 1962, and Green recalls that \\"Within ten minutes we were planning our assault on the world's land speed record\\". Green shortly provided plans for a three-wheeled land speed record car, which had to be changed to four wheels to meet FIA rules; from there on there was little change until the car was finished. Green's emphasis was on reducing aerodynamic drag by lowering the drag coefficient and, especially, reducing frontal area by narrowing the track and using smaller wheels. His calculations indicated that the readily available surplus Westinghouse J46 jet engines would have more than enough power to drive the vehicle to over . In order to find funding, Arfons and Green approached Goodyear. Green's mastery of aerodynamics was evident enough that Goodyear decided to fund his project; thus the name, Wingfoot Express, from Goodyear's trademark winged foot. Wingfoot Express' cockpit was located centrally, just behind the front axle, covered with an acrylic glass canopy from in front of the driver's feet to behind his head. The front wheels were mounted within the bodywork barely further apart than the width of the engine, while the rear wheels were on outriggers and exposed to the air. Green estimated that the aerodynamic drag of the exposed rear wheels cost the car , but since his calculations indicated that they already had much greater speed available than they needed, this was not viewed as a problem. A small fin rose vertically at the tip of the car's nose. Veteran drag racer Arfons was to drive the car for the record attempt, but a month before the scheduled run he damaged the ligaments in one hand, eliminating his chance of driving the car for the record. At this point there was no time to find another driver, and Green, who had never driven over in his life, was the logical choice because of his familiarity with the mechanics of the vehicle. At Bonneville, Green began his Land Speed Record career by easing the car around \\"the parking area\\" like any student driver. He followed with runs of , and . Green‚Äôs first run using the afterburner sent the car to before salt crystals drawn into the engine threw it off balance. At this point, the team had exhausted the three days it had booked at Bonneville In 1964, Wingfoot Express returned to Bonneville for a week. On the last day they had available, October 2, 1964, Green and the car accelerated like a rocket, averaging in both directions and setting a new record. Within 3 days, however, the record had been reset by Art Arfons. Although the final record run had demonstrated that Wingfoot Express clearly had much more speed available, Green decided to not push his luck and retired from competition, returning to his regular job. He is today a vice president of the company which produces wrenches for Snap-On. He continues to maintain contact with Arfons and they meet periodically. \\"I did offer to help Walt with his rocket car but the design was his own\\".

It is a French Creole cottage, circa 1830. The house was built with a brick core, wood frame post rooms, a cabinet/loggia, and front gallery. The entire structure, including the front gallery, is approximately 1,692 square feet. The house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 24, 2006. It is one of only fourteen examples of the period French Creole architecture in the parish. The National Register of Historic Places listings in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana lists 38 historic places in St. Tammany Parish. The exact year of the house's construction is under research, with 1750 being the earliest given date and 1830 the latest. Data shows that the Francois Cousin House, located across Bayou Liberty in the area of the Salmen House, was built between 1787 and 1790 indicating settlement in the area at that time. While the style of house construction favors that of a family home, many believe that the building served as a trading post. The Salmen House is located in the Camp Salmen Nature Park, scheduled to open in 2010. The house became the main lodge for the New Orleans area Boy Scouts, giving it the name of Camp Salmen Lodge. The restoration of Camp Salmen House (or Camp Salmen Lodge) will begin after the opening of the nature park.

Haase played college basketball at the University of California, Berkeley from 1992 to 1993, and then transferred to the University of Kansas to play under Roy Williams from 1994 to 1997. Haase was a Naismith and Wooden Award candidate while at Kansas. At Kansas he only missed two games out of 101 and averaged 12.5 points per game, scoring 1,246 points over the span of his career. He was a member of the Big Eight all defensive team as a junior, and played at the World University Games in 1995. He then spent 13 years as an assistant under Williams at both Kansas and North Carolina before starting his own head coaching career. Early life Born and raised in South Lake Tahoe, California, Haase is one of five siblings, all of whom have played an intercollegiate sport. Haase played high school basketball with long time NBA executive Chris Grant, former general manager of the Cleveland Cavaliers, at South Tahoe High School. Haase and his South Tahoe High School team faced off against their larger rival Western High for the state title in consecutive years, with South Tahoe winning in Haase's senior year in one of the most notable contests in state basketball history. In Haase's junior year recruiters started to notice his ability, and he was invited to many college showcase camps. Haase attended the Stanford High Potential Camp where he spent time with Stanford guard Kenny Ammon honing his skills and was named the camp MVP. Stanford was one of the first schools to show interest in Haase when he won the Nevada AAA Player of the Year, but during Haase's senior year the University of California, Berkeley expressed major interest in Haase along with former NBA player and current NBA coach Jason Kidd. Haase signed a letter of intent to play for California before his senior season of high school because of the proximity to his home, and he wanted to play in a major conference. College career California Haase attended the University of California, Berkeley to play during the 1993 season. Haase moved into the starting lineup and averaged 12 points and three assists through the first ten games for the California Golden Bears. During his freshman season at Cal, after a game against USC, Haase got a phone call from his mother saying that she took his father, to the hospital because of an infection near his ankle. Gary Haase went into shock while in the hospital and died right before Haase played a game against UCLA. Later in his freshman season at Cal, his coach Lou Campanelli was fired and interim (and later permanent) coach Todd Bozeman was brought in. Haase was benched and the Bears finished the regular season winning 9 of their last 10 games to reach the NCAA Tournament. Haase scored thirteen points in California's upset of powerhouse Duke in the second round. After the season ended, Haase transferred from California to the University of Kansas. Kansas Haase arrived at Kansas and contributed immediately. During his sophomore season he was named the Big Eight newcomer of the year and a second team all-conference selection. He also led the Jayhawks in scoring with 15.0 points per game. In Haase's junior year he scored his career best 30 points against the Temple Owls. He was also named to the Big Eight all defensive team that year. The Jayhawks went 34‚Äì2 in the 1996‚Äì97 season, Haase's final year. He was named a co-captain and was in the starting lineup with Jacque Vaughn, Scot Pollard, Raef LaFrentz and Paul Pierce. Haase averaged 12.0 points per game his senior year and was named a Wooden and Naismith award finalist despite playing several games with a broken wrist. Haase's Kansas career came to an end on March 21, 1997, when Kansas lost to the Arizona Wildcats in the NCAA tournament. He started 99 of 101 games with the Jayhawks and his record in three years with the Jayhawks was 89‚Äì13. The Jayhawks also won three consecutive conference titles with Haase. The Jayhawks were ranked anywhere from fifth to first in the rankings during Haase's three years, and were named one of the favorites to win the 1996‚Äì97 national championship. After college career After Haase's senior season he co-wrote a book entitled Floor Burns with author Mark Horvath. The book describes the 1996‚Äì1997 season when the Jayhawks were ranked number one for 15 consecutive weeks but lost to Arizona in the NCAA Tournament. Haase then had a brief career playing professional basketball in Macedonia. When his short career in Macedonia ended he decided to self-publish his book Floor Burns and revisit towns around Kansas giving instructional basketball camps. Haase visited around 40 towns and conducted over 100 basketball camps. He then decided to turn his focus to coaching. Coaching career Kansas Haase broke into coaching with his former coach Roy Williams at his former school, Kansas. Haase along with his roommate at Kansas, C.B. McGrath, split time working on the sidelines with Coach Williams or working behind the scenes. Haase spent four years as an assistant to Roy Williams at Kansas before Williams decided to leave Lawrence, Kansas for Chapel Hill, North Carolina and take the North Carolina coaching job. North Carolina Haase followed Williams to North Carolina where he coached under Roy Williams for eight years. Haase had many responsibilities in Chapel Hill including coaching the North Carolina Tar Heels junior varsity basketball team. The Junior Varsity team plays a 14-game schedule against local competition as well as outside programs wanting to give their kids a chance to play in the Dean Smith Center. Haase had to pick 14 students out of a 70-student try-out camp to complete the junior varsity squad. Haase coached the JV team for three years to help prepare him for a head coaching job. Haase won 255 out of 317 games in nine seasons as an assistant coach for Roy Williams, with both Kansas and North Carolina. UAB On March 26, 2012, Haase was named head coach at UAB. Haase managed to get UAB back to the big dance in his third year in Birmingham. The Blazers, a 14 seed, upset third-seeded Iowa State in the 2015 NCAA Tournament before losing to UCLA in the round of 32. His final season saw the Blazers win a conference title, but a loss in the conference tournament relegated them to the NIT. Stanford On March 25, 2016, Haase was named head coach at Stanford University, replacing Johnny Dawkins. In the 2017-18 season, Haase's second as head coach, he led Stanford to 11 conference wins, the most by the Cardinal since 2008. Personal life Haase married Mindy Meidinger in 1999. In 2006 they had a son, Gavin; in 2009 another son, Garrett; and in 2012 a daughter, Gabrielle.

The film was produced by Brigham Young University to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the drafting of the United States Constitution, and many professors from BYU's School of Fine Arts and Communications were involved in its production either as actors or in other capacities. After its release, the film was officially recognized by the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution as \\"of exceptional merit\\". Plot summary The film depicts events surrounding creation of the United States Constitution, and is focused mainly on James Madison, who wrote most of that document and took extensive notes during the convention's discussions and proceedings. The period immediately following the American Revolutionary War was marked by intense political unrest, owing to huge debts, the interruption of trade and business, shortages of labor, and personal turmoils, all created by the War. It soon became evident that the Articles of Confederation were insufficient to address the country's needs. A movement soon emerged to upgrade or replace the Articles, and Madison was foremost in the movement. However, he needed the support of George Washington, and needed to show that a new government would be sufficient to address such challenges as Shays' Rebellion and the growing trade problems between the independent States. Madison was strongly opposed by those who feared a strong central government, people known either as States Rights Advocates or as Anti-Federalists, such as Roger Sherman and John Dickinson. Madison was in favor of a bicameral congress, but envisioned both houses being elected according to proportional representation. In this he was opposed by the States Rights Advocates, and he eventually accepted the compromises necessary to address their concerns. The film highlights the basis for these compromises. The film also depicts the convention delegates' debate about the slave trade. Cast *Craig Wasson ... James Madison *Michael McGuire ... George Washington *Fredd Wayne ...

These include the copious minutes he took during the Constitutional Convention, which were published as Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787.

Today it is attributed to Carel Fabritius, but was previously considered a work by Rembrandt. The work was sold in 1845 as part of the auction of the collection of Joseph Cardinal Fesch. It was later in the collection of Sir George Holford of Dorchester House, London. It was sold alongside the rest of the collection at Christie's in 1928. While still attributed to Rembrandt it was bought at auction by the Eaton's corporation for 30,000 Guineas. The company displayed the portrait at their College Park store and later at stores in Montreal and Winnipeg; at the time the only Rembrandt on public display in Canada. It was later moved to one of the private rooms of the College Street building and was then given as a retirement present to R.Y. Eaton. He loaned the painting to the Art Gallery of Toronto and his widow donated it in 1966. In 1959 it was one of six works stolen from the gallery. The thieves targeted the most valuable works also taking the Portrait of Isaak Abrahamsz. Massa and Rembrandt's Portrait of a Lady with a Lap Dog. Then still believed to be a Rembrandt, Woman with a Handkerchief had the highest value of those stolen according to the gallery's insurance. The painting is signed \\"Rembrandt f. 1644\\" and this signature was long accepted as valid. It is today known that there are many works with Rembrandt signatures that were not done by him. Some of these are works produced in Rembrandt's workshop, often following an initial sketch of Rembrandt's. Others are pure forgeries with the signature added at a later date to increase its value. The painting does date from the era of Rembrandt, and the date could be accurate. It is rejected as the hand of Rembrandt as the hands and face of the portrait are painted in a distinctive style, and a style very different from Rembrandt's. The style is similar to the surviving works of Carel Fabritius, one of Rembrandt's most skilled workers. There is still considerably scholarly debate over if the painting is truly one by Fabritius. There has also long been debate over the identity of the sitter. The most popular theory is that it is Aaltje van Uylenburgh, a cousin of Rembrandt's wife Saskia. The pose of the painting makes clear that it was once part of a set. Likely paired with a portrait of the woman's husband. A painting known as Portrait of a Scholar is of the same size and general style. It today hangs in Cologne and is believed to depict J.C. Sylvius, van Uylenburgh's husband. The two paintings are also recorded as having been sold together in a sale in 1811. References *A Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings - Volume II: 1631-1634. Bruyn, J., Haak, B.

The magazine is a quarterly periodical while the television and radio programs are a 30-minute broadcast, all of which is devoted to the fish and wildlife resources of Kentucky and covers a broad range of outdoor topics, including angling, hunting, conservation and land management. The television show is the longest continuously-running outdoors television show in the United States and the fourth oldest in the nation for all television shows.  Television  Kentucky Afield Television is the longest continuously-running outdoors television show in the nation. First airing in 1953, it is one of the very oldest television shows still airing on any subject. Our research tells us it ranks 3rd. Holding the record for longevity is Meet the Press (November 6, 1946), followed by the Today Show (January 14, 1952). The show highlights hunting, fishing, trapping, boating, and other outdoor recreational activities and opportunities in the bluegrass state. It teaches new techniques, unveils new locations to viewers, and keeps viewers informed on current issues related to wildlife, conservation, hunting, fishing, trapping, and boating within the state. The television show debuted in 1953 on WAVE TV. Ron Rhody delivered a weekly fishing report on Saturday mornings. In 1957, Hope Carleton, who was a Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources conservation officer, was named host and remained so until his retirement in 1980. He was replaced with Jeremy Dreier. In 1985, Dreier forged a deal with Kentucky Educational Television to air the show statewide. Dreier was replaced as host by Tim Michaels in 1988 and then Dave Shuffett from 1989 until 1995. Under Dave, the format of the show changed into a magazine-styled format. Tim Farmer took over from Dave from 1995 until December 2015. Current host Chad Miles took over the show in 2016. The show currently airs on over 30 affiliates. It can be viewed on TV as far south as Atlanta, and as far north as Chicago. Kentucky Afield is also available in its entirety on YouTube and Roku. It's segments can also be found on social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.  Magazine  Kentucky Afield magazine began as Kentucky Happy Hunting Ground under the leadership of Editor Harry Towles in December 1945 as a bi-monthly publication.Happy Hunting Grounds, 1945 The initial press run was 15,000 copies, with the subscription price set at 50 cents a year. The first issue featured a hunting dog on the cover and a drawing of pioneer Daniel Boone in the upper left hand corner. The League of Kentucky Sportsmen (Kentucky's oldest conservation group) took over the magazine from May 1947 to June 1948, before giving it back to the Department. In 1992, the magazine's name changed to Kentucky Afield. The name change not only mirrored the names of the department's television and radio shows, but it emphasized all the outdoors, not just hunting Since 2000, staff artist Rick Hill has painted the covers of the magazine. The exception was 2004, when the magazine switched to photo covers while Hill painted \\"Kentucky Fish\\", a department poster featuring 27 of the state's most recognized fish. Podcast The Kentucky Afield Podcast was established in 2018, and replaced the long-running Kentucky Afield Radio Show. The podcast is hosted by Chase Wininger, and co-hosted by Lee McClellan. It features a variety of guest that range from outdoors enthusiast, to biologist, and outdoors media personalities. The podcast, like the other platforms, highlights outdoors opportunities and techniques within the state of Kentucky, and strives to keep listeners updated on important changes and news related to wildlife, conservation, hunting, fishing, trapping, boating, and other outdoors activities.

Organizational overview  NPT was founded out of a family office in 1996 in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. In 2000, they began partnering with financial institutions to provide donor-advised funds to institutional clients. Contributions from donors broke the $1 billion mark in 2005. In 2011, NPT began accepting contributions of illiquid assets like closely held stock, real estate, hedge fund interest, and more. NPT launched their first global affiliate in 2013. In 2016, NPT launched ‚ÄúA History of Modern Philanthropy,‚Äù a digital resource dedicated to charting the different forms philanthropy has taken over the past five hundred years. The site explores charitable giving through an interactive timeline that shows how philanthropy has evolved globally. It highlights two hundred key moments in the history of charitable giving. Since its founding in 1996, NPT has raised nearly $13 billion in charitable contributions. It currently manages $7.4 billion in charitable assets. NPT has made more than 250,000 grants totaling nearly $6 billion to charities all over the world. In 2018, NPT‚Äôs donors recommended 40,690 grants in 32 countries across the globe totaling $1.01 billion (up 27% from 2017). 2018 was the first time that NPT‚Äôs grantmaking exceeded $1 billion in a single year.  Philanthropic services  NPT offers a broad suite of charitable vehicle offerings and philanthropic support services.  Donor-advised funds  A donor-advised fund (DAF) is a giving vehicle administered by a public charity. Donor-advised funds allow donors to make charitable contributions and receive the maximum tax deduction available. NPT‚Äôs DAFs can accept a wide range of assets including but not limited to cash, publicly traded securities, tangible personal property, closely held stock, and cryptocurrency. NPT offers donors a menu of best-in-class investment options in which they can allocate their DAF investments. NPT‚Äôs impact investment offerings include six exchange- traded funds (ETFs) focused on generating positive environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) returns, in areas such as low carbon emissions and global education. Donors can make international grants and other specialized grants through their NPT DAFs. A donor can set up a legacy plan by appointing joint advisors, naming charitable beneficiaries, or funding an endowment. NPT also offers foundation-advised funds and corporate-advised funds to support collaborative funding projects championed by institutional donors.  Fiscal sponsorships  A fiscal sponsorship is a collaborative relationship in which a charitable project partners with a public charity to receive tax-deductible donations and access to a network of support. NPT‚Äôs fiscal sponsorship offering is designed to provide legal and fiduciary oversight and mitigate the risk involved in launching a new charitable project.  Supporting organizations  Type 1 supporting organizations offer similar tax advantages to donor-advised funds. Supporting organizations are a popular choice for philanthropists who want more control over grantmaking and investments than a donor-advised fund, but less expense and administrative burden than a private foundation. NPT currently facilitates several supporting organizations, including the Saint Agatha Foundation.  Designated funds  Designated funds are established to support specific charities. NPT offers designated funds for individual, corporate or foundation donors who wish to make a single charitable gift or recurring gifts to one specific charity.  Philanthropic Services Team  NPT maintains an in-house philanthropic services team who can offer donors guidance for their philanthropic goals. This team may conduct research on geographic areas and specific issues in which donors are interested, or may assist donors with organizing site visits to grantee organizations. The Philanthropic Services team may partner with NPT‚Äôs in-house legal team to establish grantmaking agreements so donors can stipulate naming rights or grantmaking provisions. For donor requests outside the scope of this team‚Äôs expertise, the Philanthropic Services team may reach out to the Philanthropic Advisory Network, a national partner network of vetted philanthropic advisors trained to assist donors in conducting effective grantmaking.  International grantmaking   NPT  For donors who wish to make grants to charities based abroad, NPT offers several options for international philanthropy. Donors may recommend grants to U.S. based charities with a global mission, or U.S.-based intermediary charities that fund overseas charities. Donors may also recommend grants directly to a charitable organization outside the United States through an NPT donor-advised fund. NPT assesses the tax-deductibility of these charities in its due diligence by using Equivalency Determination or Expenditure Responsibility.  NPT Transatlantic  NPT Transatlantic is an international affiliate of NPT based in the UK that offers donor-advised funds and several other philanthropic services. NPT Transatlantic is a UK/US dual qualified charitable structure and offers dual US/UK taxpayers the ability to claim Gift Aid in the UK, claim UK tax relief and receive a US tax deduction. They also offer advanced grantmaking services, legacy gifts/bequests, and single gifts.  NPT UK  NPT UK is an independent UK registered charity providing donor- advised funds and other philanthropic vehicles to donors who wish to base their grantmaking in the UK. NPT UK offers global grantmaking services to qualified charities outside the UK.  Donor-advised fund report  NPT publishes the Donor-Advised Fund Report (DAF Report), an annual industry report consisting of comprehensive data on donor-advised funds in the United States. NPT began tracking data on donor-advised funds in 2007, using filings from all charities that complete the IRS 990. The report is an analysis of trends in the data. Key metrics include the number of individual donor-advised funds in the U.S., total dollars granted from them, total contributions to them and total charitable assets in them. As of 2018, NPT‚Äôs annual DAF Report also includes a brief analysis of the types of assets being contributed to donor-advised funds. In addition, the DAF Report also includes data on the total amount of grants recommended by philanthropists from donor-advised funds each year. The annual report includes projections in trends for the future, making the DAF Report a useful tool for donors, analysts and more.  Senior management  Eileen R.

It supports general aviation with no commercial airline service scheduled. History The airport was built in August 1944 as a United States Army Air Force Ninth Air Force Advanced Landing Ground. It was constructed by the IX Engineering Command, 830th Engineer Aviation Battalion. The original construction was of Pierced Steel Planking for two intersecting runways, a main of 6000' x 120' (06/24) and a secondary of 5000' x 120' (12/30). In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting.IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout When completed it was known as ALG \\"A-20\\". Built for bomber use with all-weather facilities, it was the home of the 323d Bombardment Group which moved in from RAF Beaulieu, England on 26 August, remaining until 21 September 1944. The 323d flew B-26 Marauders. The bombers flew support missions during the Allied invasion of Normandy, dropping bombs on German gun emplacements, anti-aircraft artillery and concentrations of troops. They also attacked bridges and German-controlled airfields in occupied areas. After the bombers moved east to Chartres in Central France, the airfield was closed and turned over to local French authorities.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . After the war, it was developed into the current airport. The runways have had their metal runways removed and are now turf. The main is still in use, however the secondary is very evident in aerial photography.

It is the dramatisation of Lawrence's short story \\"Odour of Chrysanthemums\\".Marlan, Michael. D.H. Lawrence - The Widowing of Mrs Holoyd and the Daughter in Law. Heinemann: London Plot introduction Mrs. Holroyd is married to a loutish miner, who drinks, apparently patronizes prostitutes, and apparently brutalizes her. When a gentlemanly neighbor makes romantic advances to her, she wishes her husband dead. Sooner than she hoped, her wish comes true‚Äîwhen her husband dies in a mining accident. When Charles Holroyd's body is brought home from the mine, and his wife and mother must wash him and lay him out for his funeral, we see for the first time the other side of the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Holroyd‚Äînow, when it's too late. Real life connection As in many of Lawrence's works there is a real life connection to The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd. Even though his uncle had been killed in a pit accident before Lawrence was born, the story would be told often in the family. The real life 'Mrs. Holroyd' was in fact his aunt Polly, who \\"lived in a tiny cottage just up the line from the railway crossing at Brinsley, near Eastwood.\\"Boulton, James.

Differentiation and Hybridisation in a Polytypic Snail. PhD Thesis, Leiden University.  Ecology and Life Cycle  The snails live on limestone rocks, where they feed on algae and lichen. They are active only during the wet season, that is, in Mediterranean lowlands, from November through April. Eggs are laid shortly after the beginning of the wet season. The development from a juvenile to a fully grown shell takes two to three wet seasons. During the intermittent dry seasons, the snails, young and adults alike, aestivate (\\"the warm weather equivalent of hibernation\\"Gould, S.J., 1985. The Flamingo's Smile; Reflections in Natural History. Norton, New York) on the rocks or in crevices inside the rocks. For aestivation, aggregates are often formed, sometimes reaching sizes of many hundreds of individuals. During the last dry season prior to sexual maturation, the subadult snail (the shell of which is already fully developed, albeit thinner than that of an adult) increases the size of its genital organs. Copulation then takes place during the first weeks of autumn rains. Population densities can sometimes be very high, in spite of heavy predation by beetle larvae of the genus Drilus. These insects attack the snails during their aestivation, by perforating the shell and eating the snail inside.Baalbergen, E., R. Helwerda, R. Schelfhorst, R.F.Castillo Cajas, C.H.M. van Moorsel, R.

It was reissued by OUP in 2010 under the title The Funfair of Fear! Ian Ogilvy at Fantastic Fiction The author describes the setting as \\"a deserted theme park at night in the pouring rain. It‚Äôs very spooky and creepy and Measle‚Äôs running around in the dark in this enormous great theme park dodging these seven Wrathmonks.\\"The Scotsman, 10 June 2004 Plot summary The novel is about a boy called Measle who has been recently reunited with his parents, Sam and Lee Stubbs. On a day out they visit the Isle of Smiles, a theme park, and from then on things take a turn for the worse. Lee is captured by wrathmonks (warlocks that have gone mad) and taken to the Isle of Smiles. Sam has his memory wiped, and Measle and his dog, Tinker, are left to their own devices to find and rescue their parents. Once Measle reaches the Isle of Smiles, the wrathmonks cast a spell that causes all the creatures in the theme park to come alive and attempt to kill him. After he has successfully run away from the creatures, the wrathmonks catch him and want to kill him, but their leader, a dragodon, orders them to take him to a ride which leads into the dragon's lair. After a fight with the dragon and the dragodon, Measle and his mother escape and get back to their house where after a short fight the wrathmonks are defeated. Characters *Measle Stubbs/Sam Lee Stubbs - The main character in the book. A thin 10-year-old boy with a funny haircut. His nickname 'Measle' is an anagram of his actual name Sam Lee, invented by his former guardian, Basil Tramplebone. *Tinker - Measle's dog, who has helped him on a number of occasions. *The Dragodon - Ancient rider of the dragons, the last one left. *Arcturion - A dragon who was trapped in the Isle of Smiles for many years after being injured in a battle. *Sam Stubbs - Measle's dad. He is also a wizard, although not an incredibly powerful one. *Lee Stubbs - Measle's mom. She is a manafount, which means that she, although unable to do spells herself, has an unlimited supply of mana which is what magicians use to cast spells. This mana can be tapped into either by her husband holding hands with her or by her being eaten. *Griswold Gristle - In the first book he was Basil's bank manager, a short wrathmonk.

It is interdisciplinary and policy-oriented and was founded in 1970 by a group of Stanford faculty (Professors Dornbusch, Ehrlich, Hamburg, Hastorf, Kennedy, Kretchmer, Lederberg, and Pittendrigh). It is a very popular major and alumni have gone to post-graduate education, medical school, law, business and government. Human and Social Biology (Caribbean) Human and Social Biology is a Level 4 & 5 subject in the secondary and post-secondary schools in the Caribbean and is optional for the Caribbean Secondary Education Certification (CSEC) which is equivalent to Ordinary Level (O-Level) under the British school system. The syllabus centers on structure and functioning (anatomy, physiology, biochemistry) of human body and the relevance to human health with Caribbean-specific experience. The syllabus is organized under five main sections: Living organisms and the environment, life processes, heredity and variation, disease and its impact on humans, the impact of human activities on the environment.  Human Biology Program at University of Toronto  The University of Toronto offers an undergraduate program in Human Biology that is jointly offered by the Faculty of Arts & Science and the Faculty of Medicine.

Asia BSc (Honours) Human Biology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi (1980‚Äì2002) BSc (honours) Human Biology at AIIMS (New Delhi, India) was started in 1980 with a goal to bridge the gap between research performed at molecular/cellular level in vitro or in lower animal models and clinical research, creating a pool of scientists with a greater understanding of human physiology and tools to incorporate the big picture while still taking a reductionist approach to scientific research. As such, it provided a stepping stone for advanced career in research and allied fields. Candidates for the maximum of 25 open seats were selected via a nationwide entrance exam. Origin Prof. Prakash Chandra (b. 1952 - d.2006), who was Dean at AIIMS from 1979 to 1984, undertook the task of revising the undergraduate curriculum and initiated the BSc (Hons.) courses in Nursing and in Human Biology. Among the founders of Human Biology program was Dr. B. S. Narang, a well-renowned educator at that time, whose contributions are now recognized as Dr. B.S. Narang Memorial Prize awarded to the Best Undergraduate in Biochemistry at AIIMS. Coursework FIRST PHASE: During the first phase, students were exposed to the basic medical sciences: Human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry. This phase was run together with first year M.B.B.S. medical students who also followed the same curriculum. * Human Anatomy: Gross cadaver (cadaver dissections, osteology and kinesiology), microanatomy of all systems of the body, neuroanatomy (of brain and spinal cord, its connections and function with demonstration of cut brain sections), embryology (development of human embryo normal and abnormal, study of various stages of microscopic and gross level) and genetics. * Physiology: A complete review of the functional aspects of human physiology, neurophysiology, respiratory physiology, GIT, the special senses, skeletal and smooth muscles, cardiovascular system, excretory and reproductive systems. * Biochemistry: An introduction to biochemistry and allied fields at the molecular, cellular and system level. Biomolecules, enzymology, metabolism and specialization in the tissues, immunology, biochemical genetics. SECOND PHASE: The Phase II was designed to provide as broad an exposure scientific fundamentals and to various facets of research areas and basic concepts as possible. Each chosen subject matter was spread over three-to-five weeks and included lectures, tutorials (discussion sessions) and labs. * Biomathematics: Differentiation and integration, partial differentiation equations, special functions, integral transforms. * Biostatistics: measures of location and dispersion, sampling, probability, statistical distribution, tests of significance, correlation and regression, analysis of variance. * Chemical basis of biology: Concept in organic and physical chemistry, nature of bonds, non-bonded interactions, quantum chemistry. * Physical basis of biology: laws of inertia, gravitation, relativity, electrodynamics, quantum physics. * Biochemical basis of biology: Organization of genes, viruses and plasmids, biochemical evolution, the organization of DNA, replication, the code, molecular basis of differentiation and morphogenesis, molecular basis of cancer. * Biophysical basis of biology: Principles of structure and function of macromolecules, nucleic acids and proteins, small molecules, organization of macromolecular assemblies, lipids and membranes, phase diagrams, structure activity relationships in drugs, computer modeling. * Principles of genetics and evolution: Heredity and variation, multifactorial inheritance, molecular genetics, chromosomal disorders. * Pharmacology, Microbiology, and Pathology (concepts) * Instrumentation and techniques in experimental biology: Principles of animal care, anesthetic agents, surgical skills, perfusion techniques, experimental design, bioassay techniques. * Ecology and environmental biology: types of ecosystem adaptation to the environment, physiological changes in response to hypo/hyperthermia in humans. * Reproductive biology and experimental endocrinology: the endocrinology of reproduction, human contraceptives, the animal models for studying hormonal control of reproduction. * Bioenergetics and Biocybernetics: Basic thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, far from equilibrium thermodynamics, introduction to biocybernetics. * Techniques in experimental biochemistry: Colorimetry, spectrophotometry, spectrofluorometry, pH determination, gel electrophoresis, chromatography. THIRD PHASE: The third year was devoted to specialization in a chosen field of anatomy, biochemistry, biophysics, physiology or pharmacology. It involved in-depth instruction in the chosen fields, reviews of relevant research literature, seminars and term papers. Since the first phase of the coursework was executed together with the incoming class of medical students, this program was unique in its similarity to the present day MD/PhD programs in US universities. The experience of this unique program format has inspired similar programs at Jayewerdenepura and Singapore. History The first class graduated in 1983. However, with the establishment of new Master's level programs, such as, MSc Biotechnology in 1986, and the shifting focus of the institute in late 80s and early 90s, the undergraduate \\"Human Biology\\" program lost its core support. The last batch of students was accepted for this course in 2002. Several components of the second phase are now incorporated into the MSc or M.Biotech curriculum at AIIMS. BSc (Honours) Human Biology at University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka (since 1994) BSc Human Biology degree program was initiated in 1994 at the Faulty of Medical Sciences with the intention of fulfilling the need to provide human resources for Medical and Health sciences faculties; to those departments finding it difficult to recruit MBBS graduates with practical skills; specially intended for Pharmacy, Medical Laboratory Technology and Medical Laboratory Sciences courses. Also to provide research institutes, private sector institutions involved in food and nutrition, public and private sector diagnostic institutions and health policy making institutions with individuals with necessary knowledge and skills. The Human Biology special degree course involves 3.5 (9¬Ω terms) years of study in the Faculty of Medical Sciences and comprises three Parts. Similar to the program at AIIMS, Human Biology students follow the Part I & Part II of their degree course with the medical undergraduates. Part I and Part II comprise 12 units from Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry and four units from General Pathology, Parasitology, Microbiology and Pharmacology respectively. Part III of the course is the specialization year in a chosen field (Biochemistry, Food & Nutrition, Microbiology, Genetics, Pharmacology or Microbiology); the curriculum is designed so that the students are exposed to gain advanced knowledge in the selected specialization. B.S. Human Biology at Kathmandu University, Nepal(since 2006) Kathmandu University initiated Human Biology Course since 2006. B.S. Life Sciences at National University of Singapore * B.S. Life Sciences at National University of Singapore Australia and New Zealand BBiomedSc (Bachelor of Biomedical Sciences) at University of Otago, Christchurch (since 2002) A degree in Biomedical Sciences (BBiomedSc) at Otago is complementary to traditional discipline-based majors (e.g. Anatomy, Biochemistry, Genetics, Human Nutrition, Microbiology, Pharmacology, Physiology) currently offered within the Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree, but allows a wider diversity of health related papers to be taken. YouTube It provides a suitable qualification for graduate entry into medicine and other professional health science programmes, as well as increasing the range of career opportunities accessible to graduates. This degree aims at producing graduates with a sound and comprehensive grounding in the key principles underpinning modern biological and medical research and their potential applications in biotechnology. Students completing the First Year Health Sciences course will have met the requirements to advance to 200-level in the Biomedical Sciences degree. The degree structure is of a standard three-year bachelor's degree programme enabling students to graduate with a Bachelor of Biomedical Science degree. Biomedical Sciences is a combination of subject areas that promotes understanding of the scientific basis of health and disease in humans. Students have the opportunity of majoring in one of six subject areas offered: Drugs and Human Health, Functional Human Biology, Infection and Immunity, Molecular Basis of Health & Disease, Nutrition and Metabolism in Human Health, Reproduction, Genetics and Development. A postgraduate Honours degree in Biomedical Sciences is also available to students who have completed the requirements for the BBiomedSc degree with an average grade of at least B+ for the appropriate 300-level papers.

An interesting structure that has been on two art tours is the \\"Bottle House\\", a quirky, eclectic cottage built out of thousands of wine bottles on the old Dunaway store site on Farm to Market Road 1363 near the Community Center. Although on private property, it is easily visible and a fun photo stop from across the fence. The Bottle House Chriesman is now a virtual ghost town with only one original commercial building still standing ‚Äì the old post office. It was originally an old school building and was long ago moved to its present site, and the upstairs was the Justice of the Peace court. Later the second story was removed and the post office was moved from inside the Speckman-Matejosky General Store next door. Next door on the other side was the Chriesman State Bank that closed in 1929, still solvent. This building burned not long after it closed. The old United Methodist Church stood until the Spring of 2018, when it was razed and the new church building was built in its place. The congregation still meets each Sunday morning for services. The Presbyterian Church was next door, but was razed in the 1960s. The John and Elsie (Baumann) Speckman country Victorian home is also still standing a few blocks from where his store was located (razed in 1974). In 2017, The Yellow Prairie Emporium re-opened in the remodeled hardware store once owned by Frank Marek until a fire destroyed it in 1942. With its opening, there are hopes to stimulate the local economy and create a revival of the old ghost town. They serve as a local hangout and honor the old ways with their offerings and theme.

He directs the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy and is the author of the Federation publication Secrecy News. Life and career Aftergood has a BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles and has published research in solid-state physics. In 1991, Aftergood exposed the classified Project Timberwind, an unacknowledged U.S. Department of Defense special access program to develop a nuclear thermal rocket. That episode led the Federation of American Scientists to initiate an ongoing research project on government secrecy, led by Aftergood. Controversies Intelligence budget disclosure Aftergood was the plaintiff in a 1997 Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Central Intelligence Agency which led to the declassification and publication of the U.S. government's total intelligence budget ($26.6 billion in 1997) for the first time in fifty years.FAS Wins Lawsuit Against CIA on Intelligence Budget Disclosure, CIA Statement, 15 Oct. 1997. In 2006, Aftergood won a FOIA lawsuit against the National Reconnaissance Office to release unclassified budget records.National Reconnaissance Office Yields to FAS Lawsuit, by Steven Aftergood, 21 Dec. 2006. Preserving CIA email A Central Intelligence Agency proposal in 2014 to eliminate the email records of all but 22 senior Agency officials was derailed after a reference to the move was spotted by Aftergood, triggering a critical reaction in Congress and elsewhere. The proposal was formally withdrawn by the Agency in 2016. Reducing nuclear weapons secrecy As part of an effort by the Federation of American Scientists to reduce secrecy surrounding nuclear weapons, Aftergood acquired and posted a 2019 Joint Chiefs of Staff publication on Nuclear Operations. The document describes a potential role for such weapons in U.S. warfighting plans., Promoting access to government documents Aftergood curates several online Federation of American Scientists collections of government documents that are widely used. These include Congressional Research Service reports, US military doctrinal publications, and reports of the JASON science advisory panel. Awards Aftergood‚Äôs work on government secrecy policy has been recognized with the Pioneer Award from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the James Madison Award from the American Library Association, the Public Access to Government Information Award from the American Association of Law Libraries, and the Hugh M.

Early life and service Giorgio Michetti was born in Francavilla al Mare, Kingdom of Italy on 29 May 1888.Franks et al 1997, p. 146. He was the son of famous painter Francesco Paolo Michetti. The younger Michetti was raised in a bohemian household on the Adriatic seafront; he grew up in a progressive atmosphere, knowing Gabriele d'Annunzio. Giorgio Michetti served his conscription duty in 1905. Ten years later, he was recalled to military service when Italy entered World War I.Varriale 2009, pp. 63-64. World War I Michetti originally served with the 27th Field Artillery Regiment, but volunteered for aviation. On 1 August 1915, he was forwarded for aviation training at Cameri as an aspirant. Beginning 26 March 1916, he was posted to a reconnaissance unit, rank sergente. By January 1917, he was serving with 43a Squadriglia, where he first met Silvio Scaroni. On 20 June 1917, he went off to fighter training on Nieuports at Malpensa, and was commissioned. He moved to Pisa for a quick gunnery course on 25 July. On 29 July 1917, he was posted to 76a Squadriglia and reunited with Scaroni. During the next few months, he clocked up flying time for experience, but had few brushes with the enemy. It was probably during this era that Michetti played one of the practical jokes for which he was noted; he bombed the Austro- Hungarians with a bag full of rats. On the day after Christmas, he scored his first victory, being one of several winners over a German DFW C.I. His old friend Scaroni shared in the victory, as did Antonio Riva and three British fliers. The victory, shared or not, won Michetti a Silver Medal for Military Valor. On 12 March 1918, while landing at Casoni, Michetti rammed a plane from 22a Squadriglia. Although the airmen escaped with minor injuries, both planes were totally destroyed. On the 21st, he unsuccessfully claimed to share a victory with Scaroni; the victory was awarded solely to the latter. On 3 May 1918, he shared his second confirmed aerial victory with Flavio Baracchini. Michetti then downed three more enemy planes during May and June. He ended this string on 24 June 1918, when his fifth confirmed win made him an ace. June would also see him awarded a second Silver Medal for Military Valor. He would stake one more unsuccessful claim in August. In September 1918, he was assigned to Aerial Gunnery School; the war ended while he was still in this slot. Post World War I On 1 February 1919, an Italian military intelligence committee released its evaluation of World War I aerial victory claims. Michetti was deemed to have downed five enemy planes in combination with other pilots; however, other claims he had filed were awarded as sole victories to Romolo Ticconi and Silvio Scaroni.Franks et al 1997, p. 116. At about the same time in 1919, Michetti and Scaroni promoted Italian aircraft sales in a visit to Argentina. The 350a Squadriglia was formed just for this purpose. On 20 June 1919, Michetti flew an attention-grabbing round trip flight between Buenos Aires and Montevideo in 3 hours 5 minutes. Nothing more is known of Michetti until he was divorced in Austria in May 1935. The following year, he moved to Rome. He was promoted to Tenente Colonnello in the Italian Air Force reserves in 1938. Giorgio Michetti died in Rome on 4 February 1966. Notes References * Franks, Norman; Guest, Russell; Alegi, Gregory.

It is more than thick, covers an area of some 200,000 km2 (77,220 sq. mi), and is considered to be one of the world's best-exposed and most accessible sequences of Mesoproterozoic rocks. It was named after the Big Belt Mountains in west-central Montana. It is present in western Montana and northern Idaho, with minor occurrences in northeastern Washington and western Wyoming. It extends into Canada where the equivalent rocks, which are called the Purcell Supergroup, are exposed in southeastern British Columbia and southwestern Alberta. The rocks of the Belt Supergroup contain economically significant deposits of lead, zinc, silver, copper, gold, and other metals in a number of areas, and some of the Belt rocks contain fossil stromatolites. Spectacular outcrops of Belt rocks can be seen in Glacier National Park in northwestern MontanaAlt, D.D. and Hyndman, D.W. 1986. Roadside geology of Montana. Mountain Press Publishing Co., Missoula, Montana, 427 p. . and in Waterton Lakes National Park in southwestern Alberta.Gordy, P.L., Frey, F.R. and Norris, D.K. 1977. Geological guide for the CSPG 1977 Waterton-Glacier Park Field Conference. Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists, Calgary, Alberta, 93 p. Lithology and sedimentology The Belt Supergroup is dominated by fine-grained sedimentary rocks, primarily mudstones, siltstones, fine-grained quartzose sandstones and limestones. Most have undergone weak metamorphism to greenschist facies, and as a result the mudrocks are commonly classified as argillites and the sandstones as quartzites.Schieber, J. 1990. Significance of styles of epicontinental shale sedimentation in the Belt basin, Mid-Proterozoic of Montana, U.S.A. Sedimentary Geology, v. 69, p. 297-312. The Belt Supergroup also includes lesser amounts of coarser grained sandstones and conglomerates.McMannis, W.J., 1963. LaHood Formation‚Äîa coarse facies of the Belt Series in southwestern Montana. Geological Society of America Bulletin, v. 74, p.407-436. Mafic intrusive rocks are present locally in the lower portion. Much of the sedimentation probably occurred between about 1450 and 1400 Ma (million years) ago. Sedimentary structures are well preserved in most of the Belt rocks despite their great age. The sedimentation is unusual in that 1) there is an abundance of fine-grained sediment and very little coarser sediment, 2) there is a lack of sequence boundaries that are common in Phanerozoic sediments, and 3) cyclic and rhythmic deposition occurred over long periods of time. The Belt Supergroup is also noted for \\"Molar Tooth\\" structures in carbonates (a bacterial degassing structure) and various types of stromatolites.O'Connor, M.P. 1972. Classification and environmental interpretation of the cryptalgal organosedimentary \\"Molar-Tooth\\" structure from the Late Precambrian Belt-Purcell Supergroup. Journal of Geology, vol. 80, no. 5, p. 592-610. Paleogeography and environment of deposition Paleogeographic reconstructions indicate that the Belt Supergroup accumulated in a fault-bounded rift basin that existed where the North American craton and another landmass were joined in a supercontinent called Columbia/Nuna.Schieber, J., 1989. The origin of the Neihart Quartzite, a basal deposit of the mid-Proterozoic Belt Supergroup, Montana, USA. Geological Magazine, v. 126, p. 271-281. The basin appears to have been a closed \\"lacustrine\\" environment, or at least not completely open marine. Depositional environments are thought to have ranged from ancient floodplains and exposed mudflats to deep water. Evidence of the basin-bounding faults exists on all sides of the Belt basin except the west, which rifted away during subsequent continental breakup. The identity of the joined landmass remains controversial. The Siberian craton, Australia and eastern Antarctica have all been suggested based rock ages and paleomagnetic information.Evans, K.V., Aleinikoff, J.N., Obradovich, J.D. and Fanning, C.M. 2000. SHRIMP U-Pb geochronology of volcanic rocks, Belt Supergroup, western Montana: evidence for rapid deposition of sedimentary strata. Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, v. 37, p.1287-1300. Stratigraphy and distribution The Belt Supergroup was deposited unconformably on Archean and Paleoproterozoic rocks. It reaches thicknesses of more than and is present in western Montana and northern Idaho, with minor occurrences in northwestern Washington and western Wyoming. Because of this widespread extent, the rock types and formation names of the Belt Supergroup vary depending upon location. In western Montana and northern Idaho the Belt is divided into the following four groups (youngest to oldest): *Missoula Group - Fluvial sands and muds derived from the south. *Piegan Group (Middle Belt Carbonate) - Carbonate muds alternating with laminae of clastic muds. *Ravalli Group - Subaerially deposited sands and muds, mostly fluvial, derived from the southwest. *Lower Belt - Heterogeneous coarse- to fine-grained clastic and carbonate rocks, mostly deep-water deposition with sediments derived from the southwest, and mafic sills. The Belt Supergroup extends into Canada where the equivalent rocks are called the Purcell Supergroup, and are exposed in southeastern British Columbia and southwestern Alberta.Glass, D.J. (editor) 1997. Lexicon of Canadian Stratigraphy, vol. 4, Western Canada including eastern British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba. Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists, Calgary, 1423 p. on CD-ROM. . Economic resources The Belt Supergroup rocks host a variety of economically significant deposits of lead, zinc, silver, copper, gold, and other metals. These include the Coeur d'Alene lead-zinc-silver mining district in Idaho, which has produced about 7,400,000 tonnes of lead, 2,900,000 tonnes of zinc, and 35,600 tonnes of silver. The equivalent rocks of the Purcell Supergroup in British Columbia include the Sullivan ore body, which has also been a major producer of lead, zinc, and silver.

Jan Boerman (born 30 June 1923) has been a composer working in electronic music studios since 1959. He was born in The Hague. The Delft Polytechnic in Utrecht, from which the Institute of Sonology was developed, housed the first electronic music studio in the Netherlands after the Philips laboratory in Eindhoven, which was not generally open to composers. A select few composers were invited to work at Eindhoven, including Edgard Var√®se (who created his Po√®me √©lectronique there in 1958) but, by 1960, Philips decided to close the facilities. It passed its equipment on to the Delft Polytechnic, which became the primary site for electronic music in the Netherlands. Administrative problems, however, caused both Boerman and Dick Raaijmakers to leave Utrecht in 1963, whereupon they began setting up a private studio in the Hague. Their facility eventually became incorporated into the Royal Conservatory of The Hague, and both men became members of the faculty. Years later, in 1986, the Institute of Sonology echoed their move by transferring from Utrecht to the Royal Conservatory in the Hague. Boerman was trained in the traditional manner as a pianist and composer, and his initial exposure to the electronic music studio was both a shock and a revelation. There was relatively little \\"repertoire\\" in this new domain, so, while he had been struggling with serialism and \\"finding his voice\\", Boerman intuited that here was a vast new terrain to explore, free from the stylistic pressures (i.e., the triumvirate of Paris, Darmstadt, and Cologne) that were so powerfully felt at that time in Europe. Raaijmakers, on the other hand, had been studying broadcasting, recording, and applied electronics at Philips, so was more drawn into the world of studio composition. Life and career Boerman studied at the Royal Conservatory of Music in his home town, with L√©on Orthel (piano) and, from 1945, with Hendrik Andriessen (composition). From 1956 onwards, Boerman worked in the electronic studios of Delft Polytechnic, Utrecht State University and of The Hague Royal Conservatory of Music, where he has also taught electronic composition (after 1974) and piano. Since the 1970s, he has integrated live electronic music with instrumental and vocal music. Boerman has also composed theatre and ballet music, \\"music for the listening museum\\" and, in collaboration with architect Jan Hoogstad, \\"music as architectonic space\\". Since 1974, as Professor of Electronic Composition at the Royal Conservatory in the Hague, he has assisted many young composers in finding their way forward. Notable students include Sinta Wullur. Prizes Boerman received the Matthijs Vermeulen Award Prize for his entire body of work in 1981 and the Willem Pijper Prize for his composition Vocalise 1994 in 1997. The Complete Tape Music of Jan Boerman appeared in 1998 on CD (CV-NEAR 04/05/06/07/08), and won the Edison award for Dutch recorded music. Compositions Boerman has composed a number of orchestral and chamber music works; the main part of his oeuvre, however, consists of electronic music. He is one of the few composers who persisted in composing for tape. It was not until 1976, that Boerman ventured to include \\"live\\" sounds in his work: the result was Vocalise - Voorstudie (Preparatory study for a Vocalise). It was followed by an \\"orthodox\\" tape: Kompositie 1979. For the ensemble Het Nieuwe Leven, he composed \\"Weerstand\\" (\\"Resistance\\", 1982) for tape and percussion, and later \\"Ontketening\\" (\\"Unchainment\\", 1983), for tape and metal instruments. Boerman has also written electronic ballet music, including \\"De touwen van de tijd\\" (\\"The ropes of time\\") and \\"Monument voor een gestorven jongen\\" (\\"Monument for a dead boy\\"). \\"Muziek voor slagwerk en orkest\\" (\\"Music for percussion and orchestra\\", 1991) was performed during the Holland Festival of 1991. * no date Adagio, for orchestra no date Scherzo, for orchestra * no date Symfonisch rondo, for orchestra * no date Muziek tegen 2 dansers, balletmusic for piano * 1950 4 Stukken voor piano (Four Pieces for Piano) 30' * 1955 Kleine toccate, for piano (published by Alsbach, Amsterdam) * 1956 Prelude, Rondo, Fantasia, Finale, for 2 piano's* 30' * 1959 Musique concr√®te, electronic music * 1960 Alliage, electronic music 10' * 1960 Rhinoceros (text: Ionesco), electronic theatermusic * 1961 Etude sonore, electronic music * 1961 Alchemie 1961, electronic music 13' * 1963 Illusie, balletmusic * 1964 Een groot dood dier (text: B.

According to the way it moves, there are three main types: #The LCD moves around one axis, so that it only tilts. It is called tilting screen or tiltable screen. #The LCD moves around two axes which are at a right angle to each other, so that the screen both tilts and swivels. This type is called swivel screen. Other names for this type are vari-angle screen, fully articulated screen, fully articulating screen, rotating screen, multi-angle screen, variable angle screen, flip-out-and-twist screen, twist- and-tilt screen and swing-and-tilt screen. #The LCD moves into a variety of angles; it tilts horizontally and vertically and also rotates to a certain extent while staying aligned with the lens axis. It still can not be turned all the way up, down or to the side to be seen from the front of the camera for self-portraits. This type of articulating screen is called cross-tilt screen, flexible-tilt screen or flex-tilt screen. Articulating screens are used in a variety of electronic devices such as laptops, camcorders, digital cameras, desk phones, mobile phones, DVD players and others; also TV screens and computer monitors can be articulating screens. This article focuses on digital photography, where an articulating screen allows convenient or unobtrusive shooting from various perspectives. Digital cameras with a tilting screen The tilting screens of camera models marked with an asterisk (*) here below can be tilted by 180 degrees or close to it so that they may be used to take self portraits more easily.

The company presented their first line of ready-to-eat cereals in 1965. Marshmallow Mateys includes marshmallow shapes in various colors. The oat morsels are formed in the shape of boat anchors; the marshmallow bits may be variously: dolphins (aqua blue & white), dubloons (orange & yellow), gems (red & orange), jewels (purple & white), parrots (yellow), pirate heads in three-cornered hats (yellow & red), shovels (orange), starfish (pink & white), tropical fish (green striped). History Malt-O-Meal dates back to 1919 when John S. Campbell developed a hot wheat breakfast cereal he called Malt-O-Meal. The company officially adopted the name The Malt-O-Meal Company in 1953 (renamed MOM Brands in February 2012). By 1965, the company had entered the ready-to-eat non-hot breakfast sector with the introduction of Puffed Rice and Puffed Wheat cereals. While the company is best known for its line of hot cereals, it derives a large percentage of its sales from its 20-plus discount-priced bagged cold cereals, many of which are imitations of better-known national brands.

For 50 years, Weisenfeld was a one-woman campaign to increase funding for eye research, despite losing her own vision and having no scientific training. Background At age 15, Weisenfeld began to lose her vision to degenerative eye disease retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Although she completed high school and went on to Brooklyn College, her eyesight worsened and her treatment options were few despite visiting more than 100 specialists in the U.S. and Europe. Weisenfeld was surprised to find that most eye and vision funding went into care for the blind rather than treatments or research. As she continued to search for treatment, she was urged by many of the eye specialists to encourage funding of research for eye disease, which totaled just a few thousand annually around World War II. By age 23, her sight was completely lost. In 1946, 10 years after she was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, Weisenfeld founded the National Council to Combat Blindness (NCCB), New York, at age 25 with $8 and no office. Addressing how other nonprofits focused on adjusting people to their condition of vision problems, Weisenfeld was quoted May 23, 1948, in the New York Mirror as saying \\"something must be done beyond giving them a dog, a cane, or a Braille book. We must give those who need it the hope that science is actively probing the affliction robbing them of their sight.\\" Weisenfeld herself never learned Braille or used a cane or a guide dog. Known for her audacity (friends would call it chutzpah), Weisenfeld helped put vision research on the national agenda when she coordinated testimony on eye research before the House in 1949, which led Congress to recognize eye disease and create the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Blindness, and the 1968 establishment of the National Eye Institute in the National Institutes of Health. Over the decades as Fight for Sight's executive director, Weisenfeld paid herself no salary (she lived on family money) and tirelessly worked six- or seven-day weeks to raise millions of dollars for research and launch the careers of many prominent vision researchers through Fight for Sight and its local women's leagues in New York (Manhattan; Brooklyn: Park Circle, Bensonhurst, Shorefront; Queens: North Shore, Seaside; Bronx, Long Island), Northern NJ, Pennsylvania (Philadelphia: Greater, Main Line, Cheltenham, and Northeast) and Florida (South Palm Beach, Hollywood, Delray, Deerfield Beach, Miami). Fight for Sight celebrates its 65th anniversary in 2011. 1950s Weisenfeld was well connected with numerous celebrities and politicians to draw attention to her organization and its annual fundraiser the \\"Lights On\\" variety show from 1949 into the early 1990s, first led by Milton Berle, and later included Bob Hope, Barbra Streisand,Fight for Sight Benefit, January 1963 on \\"Barbra Streisand Archives\\" Sammy Davis Junior, Stevie Wonder, Liza Minnelli, Earl Wilson (columnist), Harry Belafonte, Ed Sullivan, Fannie Hurst, Pearl Bailey, Mel Allen, Peter Falk, Yul Brynner, Paul Anka, Eartha Kitt, Jackie Mason, Tommy Smothers, Joe Frazier, Jerry Stiller, Carol Channing, Tony Randall, Peggy Lee, and many others. Along with blind Attorney General William E. Powers, Weisenfeld presented an original Norman Rockwell painting to President Harry Truman on Sept. 19, 1950, as an honor for his signing of legislation aiding the blind.Harry Truman Calendar - The President's Day, September 19, 1950 on \\"Harry S. Truman Library & Museum\\" Also in 1950, working with wealthy New York entrepreneur Mary Lasker, Weisenfeld encouraged the addition of the word \\"blindness\\" to the founding title of The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Blindness (NINDB), now the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. According to the New York World-Telegram & Sun in a 1954 interview with Weisenfeld, $150 million was spent in the U.S. annually by private and public funds to support the blind, but just $1.35 million on eye research. Albert G. Mosler, a Philadelphia businessman, contacted Fight for Sight after discovering that he was losing his sight to retinitis pigmentosa and read about the organization in a newspaper. He soon met and married Weisenfeld in 1956, but they didn't have children. Mosler died 11 years later. 1960s Bob Hope, who became honorary chairman of her organization, helped attract many notable celebrities for the annual \\"Lights On\\" fundraiser and donated $100,000 in 1960 to establish the Bob Hope Fight for Sight Fund. Focusing partly on children, up to eight clinics carried the name of Weisenfeld's organization from combined donations exceeding $13 million. They were the Fight for Sight Children's Eye Centers in New York (the first in 1960 at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, then another with funding from billionaire Harry B. and Leona Helmsley at Mount Sinai Hospital in the mid-1990s), Miami (Bascom Palmer Eye Institute), two in Pittsburgh (Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and St. Christopher's Hospital for Children), Philadelphia (Wills Eye Hospital), and Newark, NJ (Eye Institute of New Jersey, UMDNJ-University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey). Honors Many honors were bestowed upon Weisenfeld in tribute to her lifelong work. In 1951, Weisenfeld was presented with the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for community service. On the 25th anniversary of Fight for Sight in 1971, President Richard Nixon and New York City Mayor John Lindsay recognized Weisenfeld's work with congratulatory letters. In 1975, the Academy of Ophthalmology awarded Weisenfeld its first award given to a lay person, for her contributions to the field. The industry group ARVO (Association of Research in Vision and Ophthalmology) established the Weisenfeld Award for Excellence in Ophthalmology in 1986, to recognize individuals for scholarly contributions to clinical ophthalmology. On Fight for Sight's 50th anniversary, Weisenfeld received the Lighthouse Pisart Vision Award in 1996 for her leadership and accomplishments. In 2000, Columbia University's Harkness Eye Institute Children's Diagnostic Clinic was renamed the Fight for Sight/Mildred Weisenfeld Children's Diagnostic Clinic.Viewpoint newsletter, Department of Ophthalmology Columbia University at the Edward S. Harkness Eye Institute, Spring 2000 Fight for Sight was led by Weisenfeld for 50 years, until she fell into ill health in 1996. An avid smoker, Weisenfeld died a year later at age 76 from complications of lung cancer.

He served as Bishop of Wilmington (1886‚Äì1896) and Auxiliary Bishop of Baltimore (1897‚Äì1908). He had previously served as a member of the Episcopal clergy before converting to Catholicism. Biography Alfred Curtis was born near Rehobeth in Somerset County, Maryland, to Episcopalian parents. He attended the country school his father had founded, but taught himself Latin, Greek, and Shakespeare. Following his father's death in 1849, he became an assistant teacher at an academy in Princess Anne to support his mother and siblings. He began studying for the ministry in 1855, and was ordained a deacon in 1856 and afterwards a priest in 1859. He then worked as an assistant at St. Luke's Church in Baltimore, from where he was transferred to Frederick County and then to Chestertown, Kent County. In 1862 he was elected rector of Mount Calvary Church in Baltimore. During the American Civil War, Curtis seemed to favor the Confederacy. He wrote that the Union victories were ‚Äústeps and stages towards eventual ruin‚Äù and that they were ‚Äúmatters of humiliation and not of thanksgiving.‚Äù Episcopalian Bishop William Rollinson Whittingham reacted by ceasing to be a pew holder at Mount Calvary, saying that he did not wish to be ‚Äúassociated with a body so treasonably ungrateful for Divine Mercy shown in the deliverance of the State from armed rebels and thieves.‚ÄùLetter of Bishop Whittingham to Rev. Curtis, July 18, 1863, Whittingham Papers, Peabody Institute, Baltimore. Curtis gradually became more Catholic in his beliefs and practices, to the dismay of Bishop Whittingham. He eventually resigned as rector in 1871 and then went to England, where he was received into the Catholic Church by Fr. John Henry Newman on May 18, 1872. Curtis returned to Baltimore later that year, entering St. Mary's Seminary. He was ordained a Catholic priest by Archbishop James Roosevelt Bayley on December 19, 1874. He then served as Archbishop Bayley's private secretary and an assistant at the Cathedral of Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. On August 3, 1886, Curtis was appointed the second Bishop of Wilmington, Delaware, by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration at the Baltimore Cathedral on the following November 14 from Cardinal James Gibbons, with Bishops John Moore and John Joseph Kain serving as co-consecrators, in Baltimore. He was installed at St. Peter's Cathedral in Wilmington on November 21, 1886. During his tenure, he introduced the Josephite Fathers into the diocese to minister to African American Catholics, for whom he also built St. Joseph Church, an orphanage, and a parochial school. He also erected a cloistered convent for the Visitation Nuns. After ten years as bishop, Curtis resigned due to poor health on May 23, 1896; he was appointed Titular Bishop of Echinus on the same date. He left the diocese with 25,000 Catholics, thirty priests, twenty-two churches and eighteen missions, twelve seminarians, eight religious communities, three academies, nine parochial schools, and three orphanages. He became an auxiliary bishop of Baltimore in 1897, and assisted Cardinal Gibbons with performing ordinations and confirmations. He later died from cancer at St. Agnes Hospital, aged 77. At his own request, his remains were buried at Visitation Monastery in Wilmington. (In 1993, because of the Visitation community's relocation to Massachusetts, the Wilmington facility was closed and Bishop Curtis' grave was moved to Cathedral Cemetery.)

It is based on the legend of Madoc, a supposed Welsh prince who fled internecine conflict and sailed to America in the 12th century. The origins of the poem can be traced to Southey's schoolboy days when he completed a prose version of Madoc's story. By the time Southey was in his twenties, he began to devote himself to working on the poem in hopes that he could sell it to raise money to fulfill his ambitions to start a new life in America, where he hoped to found Utopian commune or \\"Pantisocracy\\". Southey finally completed the poem as a whole in 1799, at the age of 25. However, he began to devote his efforts into extensively editing the work, and Madoc was not ready for publication until 1805. It was finally published in two volumes by the London publisher Longman with extensive footnotes. The first half of the poem, Madoc in Wales, describes Madoc, a young Welsh nobleman, whose family breaks down into a series of bloody disputes over royal succession. Madoc, unwilling to participate in the struggle, decides to journey to America to start a new life. When he reaches America, he is witness to the bloody human sacrifices that the Aztec nation demands of the surrounding tribes in Aztlan. Madoc, believing it is a defiance against God, leads the Hoamen, a local tribe, into warfare against the Aztecs. Eventually, Madoc conquers them and he is able to convert the Americans to Christianity before returning to Wales to find more recruits for his colony. In the second part, Madoc in Aztlan, Madoc returns to find that the Aztecs have returned to their human sacrifices. After long and bloody warfare, Madoc is able to defeat the Aztecs and force them out of their homeland and into exile. The poem contains Southey's bias against superstition, whether Catholic, Protestant, or pagan. He believed that the work itself was more historical than epic, and it contained many of Southey's political views. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with many saying that there were beautiful scenes, but many feeling that the language fell short of being adequate for the subject matter. One review went so far to mock Southey's reliance on Welsh and Aztec names. Background The basis for Southey wishing to write an epic poem came from his private reading of literature while attending Westminster School as a boy.Spech 2006 p. 17 In particular, the subject was suggested by a school friend that claimed to be a descendant of Madoc's brother, Rhodri, and Southey began to write a prose version of the story in 1789.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 p. 109 In 1794, the 20-year-old Southey was attempting to publish works to raise money to support himself and Samuel Taylor Coleridge in an expedition to America to establish a Pantisocracy, a democratic form of government that the two invented. One of the poems he sought to publish was Madoc, which was an epic that he started working on while at school but he never finished. Southey and Coleridge were able to complete the poem Joan of Arc by summer 1795 while Southey worked on Madoc.Spech 2006 pp. 53, 57 However, in his notebook he claimed on 22 February 1797. \\"This morning I began the study of law, this evening I began Madoc.\\"Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 qtd. p. 52 During 1797, Southey had given up his ideas of Pantisocracy and was studying to become a lawyer. He spent the rest of his time working on other publications, such as a translating part of Jacques Necker's On the French Revolution. Southey continued to work on Madoc through 1798, and started his mornings by working on the poem.Spech 2006 pp. 66, 74 It was not until mid-1799 that Southey was able to finish composing Madoc, and soon after began to work on Thalaba. Afterwards he travelled to Portugal, where he continued to work on Madoc for two more years to polish up the language. After Portugal went to war with France and Spain, Southey returned to England. While there, he travelled to Wales to get more information for his epic. He continued to travel in 1801, and worked on the epic during this time. In May 1804, Southey took the beginning of the poem to the publisher Longman, and he began to finish the second section in October. It was finished and published in two parts early in 1805, with footnotes and a preface explaining Southey's purpose.Spech 2006 pp. 79, 84, 87‚Äì88, 107‚Äì108, 111 The work cost a lot of money to publish, which prompted Southey to write \\"By its high price, one half the edition is condemned to be furniture in expensive libraries, and the other to collect cobwebs in the publisher's warehouses. I foresee that I shall get no solid pudding by it\\".Madden 1972 qtd p. 99 Poem Part one: Madoc in Wales Southey intended Madoc to be a combination of the Bible, the works of Homer, and James Macpherson's Ossian poems. The story deals with Madoc, a legendary Welsh prince who supposedly colonised the Americas in the 12th century. The book is divided into two parts, which represent a reversed division between the Iliad and the Odyssey. The work focuses on colonisation, but starts in Wales during King Henry II's reign of England. This section is loosely based on the historical events following the death of Owain Gwynedd, supposedly Madoc's father, in the late 12th century. The work begins as \\"Owen Gwynned\\" is crowned king of North Wales after removing his nephew Cynetha from power. After Gwynned dies, one of his sons, David, takes the throne after killing or exiling his siblings. The youngest sibling, Madoc, leaves Britain to settle in a new land. He joins with Cadwallon, the son of Cynetha, and other Welshmen to start their journey. After discovering America, they return to recruit people to help form a new colony. Madoc stays long enough to witness fighting between his living siblings and determines that he must leave immediately.Bernhardt- Kabisch 1977 pp. 109‚Äì112 The story follows Madoc's journey as they travel West again, contending with problems such as storms and dissent among the crew. Eventually, they reach America and are received by the natives. Madoc takes on one of the natives, Lincoya, as his guide when they begin to explore the area of the Mississippi River. As they continue to travel, they soon come to Aztlan, the original homeland of the Aztec nation, and Madoc discovers that the Aztecs require human sacrifices for their gods. Madoc decides to interfere with tribal affairs and stop two children from being taken by the Aztecs to be sacrificed. Following this, he encourages a peaceful tribe, the Hoamen, to take up arms against the Aztecs. To further protect the Hoamen, Madoc goes to the Aztec capital to deal with their king. While there, he is shown by the king how great the Aztecs are and how no one could stand against them. Madoc witnesses among the buildings and monuments piles of skulls and corpses along with other horrific scenes.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 112‚Äì113 Unwilling to allow the Aztecs to continue their practices, Madoc instigates war between the Aztecs and the much smaller Hoamen nation. While the Aztecs bring a large army, Madoc is able to use Welsh technology and superior tactics to overcome them. The Hoamen are able to take many prisoners while the Aztec king contracts a mortal illness. Following the battle Madoc shocks the Aztecs by releasing the prisoners instead of sacrificing them, and provides leeches to help the Aztec king recover from his disease. This leads to a treaty between the Aztecs and the Hoamen which abolishes human sacrifice. The Aztec priests fear to stop the practice, so the Aztec king decides that his people will abandon their religion and take up a monotheistic religion based on a God of love.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 p. 113 The rest of the story involves Madoc returning to Wales to recruit more settlers for his colony. During this time, he meets with Owen Cyveilioc, a poet who tells Madoc to discuss the matter with the Congress of Bards. During the meeting, a young bard prophesies that Madoc would be like Merlin in America and that he is trying to recreate an Arthurian greatness. Afterward, he meets with Llewelyn, an individual trying to reclaim his title as Prince of Wales. Madoc tries and fails to convince him to come to America. Madoc returns to his original home, and there he stops an attempt to remove the body of Gwynned from a grave on holy ground. Instead, Madoc offers to take the corpse back with him to America where it could be buried without any worry. The rest of Madoc's time back in Wales is spent trying to get his brother David, the king, to free another brother, Rodri, whom he has imprisoned. However, Rodri escapes after his release was promised. As Madoc sets out to return to the colony, they are met by Rodri's boat. Rodri informs Madoc that he is working with Llewelyn to overthrow David and restore the rightful king. Although Madoc is upset by the potential warfare, he leaves with the promise by Llewlyn that Britain will be fine.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 114‚Äì116 Part two: Madoc in Aztlan The second part of the poem parallels the Iliad and follows the events in America after the first part. Madoc returns to America from Wales and finds that Caermadoc, the colony, is doing well. However, there are struggles with his people and the Aztecs because the Aztecs have turned back to their pagan gods. As such, the peace between the two groups ends while a shaman of the Hoamen people starts to convince the people to also worship pagan gods. The Hoamen begin to sacrifice children for their god by feeding them to a large snake. Madoc, angry, accuses a priest leading the sacrifices of being a traitor before killing both the priest and the snake. This feat brings the Hoamen back to Christianity.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 117‚Äì120 The Aztec high priest, Tezozomoc, tells the people that they will not have the favour of their gods unless they kill the foreigners. Two warriors volunteer to capture a child to please their gods, and they return with Madoc and the child Hoel. Madoc is forced to fight other condemned men, until Madoc's Welsh allies attack the city, allowing a woman, Coatel, to free Madoc and Hoel. At the same time the Aztec warrior Amalahta attacks Caermadoc, but is defeated by the Welsh women. When Madoc returns, he joins the Welsh and Hoamen forces, and the battle continues until Madoc kills the Aztec king, Coanocotzin.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 102‚Äì121 The battle is followed by the Welshmen destroying the pagan temples while the Aztecs gather to appoint a new king. Games and events are established and follow after the battle. During the various events, a temple becomes covered in flames and idols to the pagan gods appear once again. This is followed by the Aztecs telling the Welsh to leave before attacking them. A battle takes place in the water surrounding the Aztec city on boats, and the superior Welsh ships are able to win. The Aztecs, unwilling to stop, turn to superstitious rituals and priests travel to a sacred mountain to make sacrifices. However, a sudden lava eruption kills the priests. This causes the Aztecs to believe that they do not have the support of their gods and they cease their fighting. Admitting defeat, the Aztecs leave the area and head south for Mexico.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 121‚Äì123 Themes During his time in Portugal, Southey cultivated a strong anti-Catholic bias, and saw Catholic rituals as superstitious and pagan-like. However, he did not limit his feelings to only Catholics, and he believed that Methodists and Calvinists were also superstitious and a political threat. He distrusted religious enthusiasm and any alteration of the mind away from reason. Southey wrote that Madoc, in following these beliefs, was about a \\"gentle tribe of savages delivered from priestcraft.\\"Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 qtd. p. 58 With such an intent, Southey also believed that he was dealing closely with history and scholarship. The footnotes within Madoc reinforce such an intent. He did not call it an epic like some of his other works. Instead, he argued that there was evidence that the story had a historical basis. The story, according to Southey, was that Madoc came from Britain to America to replace paganism with Christianity.Spech 2006 p. 111 In terms of politics, Southey believed that war with the post-revolution France was inappropriate when he first started composing Madoc. By the time the poem was finished, Southey was an advocate for a war against Napoleon's government. Instead of supporting his own government in return, he was opposed to the government of Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger.Spech 2006 pp. 111‚Äì112 The poem is also heavily grounded in Southey's ideas on Pantisocracy, and it includes an earlier version of his democratic ideal within a mythic form. The connection between Wales and America within the poem alludes to Southey's own plans to travel from Wales to settle in America to start a new societal system.Bernhardt- Kabisch 1977 pp. 110‚Äì111 The endings of the two poems are the same but have opposite results: they both have a sunset and an exodus from the country, but the first deals with Wales and the second with the Aztec lands. The first is messianic and heralds a return of Wales's greatness, and the second deals with a new country being created.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 p. 123 Reception Southey intended Madoc to rival the works of Homer, and Coleridge believed that the poem would be better than the Aeneid. However, Madoc received mixed reviews from critics; while one critic believed it was comparable to John Milton's Paradise Lost, another felt that it was unreadable.Spech 2006 p. 112 In letter written by William Wordsworth on 3 June 1805, he claimed that he was \\"highly pleased with it; it abounds in beautiful pictures and descriptions happily introduced, and there is an animation diffused through the whole story though it cannot perhaps be said that any of the characters interest you much, except perhaps young Llewllyn whose situation is highly interesting, and he appears to me the best conceived and sustained character in the piece [...] The Poem fails in the highest gifts of the poet's mind Imagination in the true sense of the word, and knowledge of human Nature and the human heart. There is nothing that shows the hand of the great Master\\".Madden 1972 qtd p. 100 He followed this with a letter on 29 July 1805 saying \\"Southey's mind does not seem strong enough to draw the picture of a Hero. The character of Madoc is often very insipid and contemptible [...] In short, according to my notion, the character is throughout languidly conceived\\".Madden 1972 qtd pp. 100‚Äì101 Dorothy Wordsworth, William's sister, wrote on 11 June 1805 to claim that \\"We have read Madoc with great delight [...] I had one painful feeling throughout, that I did not care as much about Madoc as the Author wished me to do, and that the characters in general are not sufficiently distinct to make them have a separate after-existence in my affections.\\"Madden 1972 qtd p. 101 A review by John Ferriar in the October 1805 Monthly Review argued, \\"It has fallen to the lot of this writer to puzzle our critical discernment more than once [...] He has now contrived to manufacture a large quarto, which he has styled a poem, but of what description it is no easy matter to decide [...] The poem of Madoc is not didactic, nor elegiac, nor classical, in any respect [...] Respecting the manners, Mr. Southey appears to have been more successful than in his choice of the story. He has adhered to history where he could discover any facts adapted to his purpose; and when history failed him, he has had recourse to probability.\\"Madden 1972 qtd pp. 102‚Äì103 Ferriar continued with an attack on the Welsh names that appear within the poem: \\"we own that the nomenclature of his heroes has shocked what Mr. S. would call our prejudices. Goervyl and Ririd and Rodri and Llaian may have charms for Cambrian ears, but who can feel an interest in Tezozomoc, Tlalala, or Ocelopan [...] how could we swallow Yuhidthiton, Coanocotzin, and, above all, the yawning jaw-dislocating Ayayaca?‚ÄîThese torturing words, particularly the latter, remind us so strongly of the odious cacophony of the Nurse and Child, that they really are not to be tolerated.\\"Madden 1972 qtd p. 103 An anonymous review in the Imperial Review in November 1805 stated, \\"something should be said of the language. This undoubtedly is not its chief excellence. The style, in many places, is trailing, flat, and uninteresting,‚Äîdeficient both in strength and animation. The author seldom avails himself of any artificial ornaments [...] Though we feel ourselves compelled to make these observations, it is hardly necessary to add, that upon the whole we think very highly of this performance.\\"Madden 1972 qtd pp. 104‚Äì105 The review continues by comparing Madoc to Paradise Lost: \\"were the style adorned by a little artificial colouring, and enriched with all the allowable decorations of poetry, Madoc would hardly yield to Paradise Lost. As it stands, it is certainly the second heroic production in the English language. Its leading characteristics are not fire and sublimity, but tenderness and humanity. Milton astonishes the head‚ÄîSouthey touches the heart. The first we may admire‚Äîthe last we can love.\\"Madden 1972 qtd p. 105 Jack Simmons, in his 1945 biography, believed that the poem was \\"the longest, the least successful, the most tedious\\" of Southey's poems.Simmons 1948 p. 209 In 1972, Ernest Bernhardt-Kabisch argued \\"Southey would perhaps have done well to have ended the poem here [at the end of part one]. In its larger framework of Welsh history, the American adventure and its clash of culture is interesting and is comparable in purpose and proportion, if not in power and dramatic nuance, to Odysses' exotic flashback narrative at the court of Phaeacia. The Welsh narrative [...] appeals to a variety of Romantic interests ‚Äì patriotic and picturesque, sentimental and libertarian. And though, as always, thought tends to be commonplace and pathos shortwinded, the quality of the writing is almost uniformly high, and there are memorable and moving passages of description and rhetoric, as well as suggestive images\\".Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 p. 117 He continued adding that \\"Southey's epic thereby becomes, in fact, the crowning effort of eighteenth-century English literature to deal poetically with the American Indian\\".Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 117‚Äì118 In 1990 Northern Irish poet Paul Muldoon published his long poem Madoc: a Mystery, inspired by Southey's work and the events surrounding it. Muldoon's work takes as its premise the idea that Southey and Coleridge actually came to America to found their ideal state, and offers a multi-layered poetic exploration of what might have happened.O'Neill, pp. 145‚Äì164.

This type of takeover guarantees, to a certain extent, an uninterrupted supply of raw materials and components at fair prices. ;Bear hug: It is used in takeover situations. It is an indication to the board of a target company that an offer of takeover is under consideration. A strong bear hug is a formal notice to the target company of an intended takeover. A teddy bear hug is an indication from a target company that it will favorably consider a takeover, but at a higher price than offered. ;Black knight: An unwelcome takeover bidder. ;Bootstrap acquisition: This term is used in connection with a friendly takeover. When threatened with a hostile takeover, the target company exchanges some of its assets for shares held by dissident shareholders. Later on, the target company sells itself to a friendly acquirer who gets 100% of the target company for less than what it would have paid otherwise. The target company has virtually helped finance part of the takeover.http://financial- dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Bootstrap+Acquisitionhttp://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/business- english/bootstrap-acquisition ;Creeping takeover: It is a slow interceptive acquisition of the controlling interest in a company by buying its shares in the stock market over a period of time. ;Dawn raid: A takeover attempt by an individual or a company in which instructions are given to buy all available shares of the target company at current market price as soon as stock exchange is opened for business on a particular date. With this base the bidder makes an attractive offer to the other sharesholders in order to make a full takeover bid. ;Forward integration: It is a process by which a company acquires another company that make use of its products to manufacture finished goods. This type of acquisition can go up to the point of retail outlets. ;Godfather offer: A takeover offer so attractive that the target company can not refuse. Usually this type of takeovers result in a change of the management team. Shareholders too, sometimes have reasons to assume that the takeover will serve some ulterior motive of the predator (such as asset stripping, transfer of reserves) rather than uphold their interest. A godfather offer has none of these nasty implication. ;Golden parachute: An employment contract offered to company directors and senior management which guarantees to pay extensive benefits if the executives is made to leave the company. Such contacts are offered to make unfriendly takeovers expensive. ;Greenmail: To buy a large number of shares of a company with either of the two motives; to sell them at a higher rate to a corporate raider, or to offer them to the company for a similar profit. An offer which the management will find hard to refuse as its sale to the raider will threaten its existence. ;Grey knight: A takeover bidder whose intentions are unclear. He is neither a welcome bidder known as the white knight nor clearly an unwelcome bidder, known as the black knight. ;Hired gun: An expert who is hired by a takeover target company to fight off a predator. ;Hostile takeover: Takeover of a company by an individual, a group or another company which is not welcomed or approved by the management of the target company or its corporate philosophy. Such a takeover is resisted by the target company, using many ploys like the golden parachute, poison pill, or shark repellent. ;Killer bees: Law firms, public relations firms, and investment bankers employed by a target company to fend off unfriendly takeover. ;Lobster trap: The anti-takeover strategy that involves restrictions in the charter on the acquisition of voting stock by individuals with a large percentage of the convertible securities, named for the trap that is designed to hold large lobster, while permitting small ones to escape. In particular, stipulating that a convertible debenture holder can not convert his debentures into equity shares if he already holds, or going to hold as a result of the conversion, 10% or more of the company's equity shares. ;Megabid: A very large takeover bid. ;Merger: An amicable involvement of two or more companies to form one unit, and to increase overall efficiency. The shareholders of merged companies are offered equivalent holdings in the new company, and old employees are generally retained. Takeovers, which are quite another matter, generate a lot more heat. A horizontal merger combines direct competitors in the same products and markets, while a vertical merger combines suppliers and the company or customers and the company. ;Pac-Man defence: A strategy of survival in the takeover game, named after a popular game in the US in the early 1980s, in which a character which does not swallow its opponents is itself consumed. In a typical Pac-man defence a target company in the takeover bid will threaten to take over the acquirer and start buying its shares. ;Parent company: A company which owns or controls subsidiary companies by means of owning a majority of voting shares. A parent company usually has a business of its own. ;Poison pill: Defence strategy adopted by the target company. The company makes the takeover less attractive by such means as issuing fresh preference shares with the provision that in the event of a takeover the preference shareholders can redeem their shares at a high premium, making the cost of takeover quite unattractive. ;Predator :A person, a group, or a company seeking to take over another company, known as the target company. ;Radar alert: Close monitoring of the stock market activity in a company's shares by a shark watcher appointed by the company for that purpose. The watcher will keep stock of the buying/selling of the company's shares and determine if an accumulation is taking place. If such a thing begins to happen the company is immediately alerted so that it can take suitable defensive measures. ;Raider: A takeover artist, who may be an individual or corporate body by buying a controlling interest of shares in a target company, runs it his way, by appointing a new management team, and formulates a new set of policies. ;Reverse takeover: In which, a small company takes over a large company or a private company takes over a public company. ;Safe harbour: A ploy to foil a takeover bid in which the target company goes out and buys a heavily regulated business so that acquisition of such a company becomes unattractive to the sharks. ;Sandbagging: A defensive move in a takeover bid, in which the target company plays for time being, in the hope that a white knight will come to the rescue. ;Scorched earth policy: A defensive move in a takeover bid, adopted by the target company. In order to make itself unattractive as a takeover target, the company borrows money at exorbitant rates of interest. This unwise act may prevent the takeover, but often ruins the company. ;Sharks: Corporate raiders. ;Shark repellent :Any of the many measures taken by the target company to hold off hostile takeover bids: :*A provision that the bidder must offer the same price of shares to all shareholders, and not to just a group of those who support the takeover; :*A Golden Parachute contact with top executives which will make it expensive indeed to get rid of them; :*A provision that a more than simple majority of shareholders, say two-thirds of three-fourths, would be required to ratify a takeover vote; :*Merger with another company, which will make the original takeover proposal difficult. ;Shark watcher: A specialist firm which keeps a watch on takeover activities on behalf of its client. It does so by monitoring trading patterns of its client's shares and by trying to determine the identity of parties who are buying up its client's share. A shark watcher also solicits proxies from the shareholders on behalf of its clients. ;Shell company: A registered company which has no significant assets or activities, often floated to collect finances for future operations, or set up as a front to evade taxes. ;Show-stopper: To start a litigation to thwart an attempt at takeover. ;Sleeping beauty: A company which has some very attractive features, such as huge cash reserves, undervalued assets and real estate; it can be a potential target for a takeover which has not yet been propositioned by a bidder. ;Summer soldiers: Directors and management staff or a company threatened with a hostile takeover who only put up a token fight before giving up. ;Supermajority amendment: A provision in the corporate charter to fend off hostile takeovers which requires a very large number of shareholders, between 67% and 90%, to approve major decisions of the company. ;Takeover: A change in the control of a company, accompanied usually by a changed in the board of directors and senior management if the takeover is hostile. In a friendly takeover, the management doesn't usually change, and the takeover works to the benefit of the target company. In a hostile takeover there may be an attractive public offer for the shares, or unsolicited merger proposals for the management, accumulation of controlling shares through buying in the open market, or proxy fights. There are various methods of fighting off hostile takeover bids, with colourful names. ;Tender offer: In case of a clean takeover bid there may be a public offer to the stockholders of the target company to sell their shares at an attractive price to the company which intends to take over. ;Toehold purchase: To purchase just less than 5% shares of a company to get a toehold, so that one can buy more later and notify the authorities that one now holds more than 5% shares of the company. ;White knight: A term used in a hostile takeover context, when a company, which can not prevent a takeover looks for a friendly rescuer who might outbid the Black Knight and acquire the company on amicable terms. ;White squire: Not quite a white knight, but one who buys less than a controlling interest in the company, but enough shares to prevent a hostile takeover.

Although formally presented as an amendment of the Defence of the Realm Act 1803, it was actually a major piece of new legislation as it required counties in Great Britain to draw up lists of men for military training and detailed how compulsory training would take place. However, the Act included clauses that military training could be suspended if sufficient numbers of men joined volunteer corps, and the huge increase in their number in response to the Act meant that compulsory military training was never used. The Legislation The Act revived the idea of posse comitatus and detailed mechanisms for military training in each parish in Britain. It stated that Lords Lieutenant and their deputies should list all men between seventeen and fifty-five except clergymen, Quakers, school masters, and the infirm. The list would be classified into four classes: unmarried men under thirty with no living children under ten years of age; unmarried men aged between thirty and fifty, with no living children under ten; married men between seventeen and thirty with no more than two living children under ten; and those not included in the previous classifications. They would then be trained, armed and eligible in case of invasion to be called out anywhere in the British Isles. Passage through Parliament Charles Philip Yorke (then Secretary at War) introduced the legislation as a 'Military Service Bill' on 18 July 1803 and it was passed quickly through Parliament, receiving Royal assent on the 27 July.Cobbett's Parliamentary history of England (London, Published by R.

Amendments The Act was amended by the Levy en Masse Amendment Act 1803 (43 Geo. 3 c. 120), which stated, among other things, that if the number of volunteers in any county was satisfactory to the King he could suspend the operation of the Levy en Masse Act even if they did not amount to the three-fourths of the first classification.

The group formed after the longtime friends who were originally from Kenya met in Pomona, California at a prayer breakfast in 1998. Milele, which means \\"forever\\" in Swahili has performed alongside gospel artists like Andrae Crouch and Helen Baylor and recorded four albums, Forever, Level up, Afrique and their most recent recording, Monday. Apart from the music, Milele has also launched many campaigns in Africa with the purpose of providing means for impoverished African communities to gather strength to make steps towards better living standards. History Formation and early years The members of Milele were childhood friends in Kenya up until high school when they separated to follow the path of their individual lives. Each of them pursued school and work in different arenas, however, one day, 10 years later and 10,000 miles away from home in California, all four of them found themselves in the same room at a prayer breakfast. They had all come to the US separately to pursue further education. They started singing together as a pastime but it slowly not only evolved into a successful musical ensemble, but also a unity of friends committed to remedying social injustices, poverty and resulting oppression. Milele has travelled extensively and succeeded in becoming well known musical ambassadors in Kenya as well as Christian circles in the US. What began as a celebration of God through music became using music as a vehicle to carry out work that would move and spread their ministry and outreach. In the past few years, Milele averaged about 150 concerts and performances annually, mainly at churches and schools. Some of these include Lake Avenue Church, Faith Community Church, Mariners Church, Bel'Air Presbyterian Church, La Canada Presbyterian Church, Cottonwood Christian Center, First Church of the Nazarene, Pasadena, Azusa Pacific University, Claremont School of Theology, Fuller Theological Seminary, and Biola University. They have also shared the same stage with such Gospel legends as Andrae Crouch and Helen Baylor. Concerts and tours In 2001, Milele held a special concert in the slums and also performed to over 30,000 young people at a stadium concert. In early 2002, they had a special concert dubbed 'True Love Waits,' which was geared towards promoting abstinence in a society that is being crippled by AIDS. Kanjii of Milele was quoted saying,\\"We saw the success of our efforts when many young people committed their lives to waiting for the partner that God has set aside for them.\\" In summer 2003, Milele toured forty states across the US to promote their second album. Since their successful Level Up tour, they were the featured band at the \\"Blessings of the Shoes\\" interfaith service at the Orange County AIDS Walk, which drew over 10,000 people. Shortly after, they were nominated to be one of the top ten finalists of the 95.9FM Fish Festival award. These successes culminated in their first live recording concert at Mariners Church in Irvine, California which was also their kickoff for their 2004 summer tour. Members Kanjii Mbugua, Harry Kiiru, Christian Mungai and Kaima Mwiti. Additional members include African Guitarist Henry \\"Karis\\" Mburu, Nimo Mathenge, and Carol Ongera. Charity works Family Homes Project Milele as a musical group and humanitarian organisation embarked upon the Milele Family Homes Project in light of the vast number of children who have been and continue to become deserted by the loss of their parents in Africa. The project gave them an avenue to resource all the influential people they have interacted with over the years through their music and travel. In collaboration with Infeneon Holdings, they used new technology that enabled the building of an average family home within 15 days. The panel technology involved panelling with pre- set plumbing and electricity being filled with a quick drying building material known as Moladi Chem. The panels are then removed within 10 hours to reveal the structure of a home. This enabled them to provide homes with the requirement of less time and less money. Change Africa Campaign Milele are now better known for their humanitarian involvement rather than their music. While their music remains popular and enjoyable to many, their presence and contribution through the Change Africa Campaign and Milele Homes Project acts to propagate hope to those who are the benefactors of the efforts of the organisation. In 2000 Milele Ministries Incorporated as a non-profit organisation under the 501(c) 3 American tax code to better accomplish this purpose and launched the Change Africa campaign to drive the vision of being able to see Africans embracing the idea that the change they wish to see in their individual lives and societies can be created through empowerment, knowledge, unity and hope. Crisis in Kenya With the Kenya Red Cross and other volunteer organisations appealing for more aid to help displaced people in Kenya, Milele's Christian Mungai teamed up with Atlanta-based Partners for Care, Glory Outreach Assembly in Kenya where they visited 11 camps in Maai Mahiu, Naivasha and Burnt Forest PCEA Church Nakuru. \\"I was totally heart broken and devastated,\\" he says. \\"For once I felt so bad helping as I thought to myself that we would be there for a while, give food, medical assistance etc then leave and come back to America and now I'm here in my warm bed while so many faces and names I now know are still in Maai Mahiu, Naivasha, Burnt Forest PCEA Church Nakuru and they will be there for a long time. I feel so helpless that I can't resettle these people and while many are working so hard to help others are working day and night to capitulate violence. I'm so beat and worn out, I even feel bad about taking pictures like these seems like we are there for a photo opp and thats it. My heart breaks and for once im in a state of despair at least for now. God help us and save us now\\". A Georgia group managed to raise US$42,000 to help the affected areas and had several volunteers who provided food and medical assistance.

Philip was the son of Ludwig Kasimir von Hohenlohe-Waldenburg and Anna zu Solms-Lich. On 7 February 1595 he married Maria of Nassau at Buren. The marriage was childless, but shortly before his death Philip adopted the nine-year-old Margrita Maria, countess of Falckenstein. Life Philip of Hohenlohe, also called Hollock, had been in service of William I of Orange since 1575, and he was William's Lieutenant-general in Holland. Hohenlohe conquered Geertruidenberg in 1576, Steenbergen in 1577, Tholen and Breda and later amongst others Mengen and Gennep (1599). In 1590 he constructed a fort at 's-Hertogenbosch. Because of his experience he remained lieutenant-general on the request of the States of Holland after William of Orange was assassinated in 1584. Maurice of Orange, William's son, was still too young to rule. Hohenlohe was a courageous, but reckless commander. He also had a drinking problem. After Maurice became captain-general of the Republic, relations between him and Hohenlohe gradually became worse. Maurice thought Hohenlohe was unreliable and was bad at keeping secrets. The bad relations also had a private cause: In 1582 Hohenlohe had asked William of Orange for permission to marry his eldest daughter, Maria of Nassau. The marriage had not taken place yet because of financial problems. After William's assassination there was a quarrel over his inheritance. The rightful heir of William of Orange was Philip William of Orange, but he was imprisoned in Spain. Maria had maintained control over William's possessions since 1584, and after the siege of Breda Maria apparently had managed to collect enough money to proceed with the marriage. After the marriage Hohenlohe was supposed to take control of an important share of the inheritance of William of Orange. Maurice opposed this, and in 1591 the States-General split the possessions. Maria of Nassau was given the county of Buren, Maurice was given the rest. Years of legal battle produced no results. In 1595 Hohenlohe married with Maria of Nassau. Hohenlohe served under Maurice during Maurice's campaign of 1597, and during the Siege of Groenlo. But after his marriage Hohenlohe became more and more isolated. Maurice hardly gave him any command in his army anymore. He reached a low- point in 1600, when Maurice dismissed him as lieutenant-general of Holland and Zeeland. In 1604 Hohenlohe became ill and started getting paralysis-symptoms. He died on 6 March 1606 at IJsselstein. After his death his body was taken to √ñhringen (Baden-W√ºrttemberg) by his wife, and he was interred in the family- tomb in the collegiate church of St. Peter and St. Paul on 5 November 1606.

It was the residence of the Rear County of Sponheim and today is a ruin following its destruction by the French in 1734.  History  The castle was built in 1350 by the Count Johann III of Sponheim-Starkenburg and replaced Castle Starkenburg as the residence of the Rear County of Sponheim. With the extinction of the ruling male line of the Rhenish branch of the House of Sponheim in 1437 the castle became seat of the bailiff of the new Counts to Sponheim (Baden and Palatinate-Simmern or Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken or Palatinate-Birkenfeld). In 1680 it was conquered by Louis XIV of France and was extended, together with the fort of Mont Royal in the horshoe bend of the Mosel north of the town of Traben-Trarbach as a part of the fortifications. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì1714), in 1702 it was taken by the French under Taillardin and in 1704 on the express orders of the commanding officer John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough it was overpowered by Friedrich das Wehrschloss. The badly damaged castle was then occupied by the Dutch. In 1730 it was repaired by the Electorate of Trier for the defence of Koblenz and the Rhine river. In the War of the Polish Succession it was taken after three weeks' siege for the fourth and last time by the French who destroyed it in July 1734.Ruine Grevenburg der Sponheimer Grafschaft brochure published by Tourist information Traben-Trarbach (German) The castle was blown up, huge chunks of it have plunged into the valley beneath.

Project In July 2009, Benjamin Moody, a United-TI forum user, published the factors of a 512-bit RSA key used to sign the TI-83+ series graphing calculator. The discovery of the private key would allow end users to flash their own operating systems onto the device without having to use any special software. Moody used two free implementations of the general number field sieve, msieve and ggnfs; the computation took 73 days on a 1.9 GHz dual-core processor. This demonstrates the progress of hardware development: the factorization of the similar 512-bit RSA-155 in 1999 using the same algorithm required a large dedicated research group, 8000 MIPS-years of computing time, and a Cray C916 supercomputer.Herman te Riele (1999-08-26), New factorization record (announcement of factorization of RSA-155). Retrieved on 2008-03-10. In response, members of the wider TI graphing calculators community (at yAronet) set up a BOINC-based distributed computing project, RSA Lattice Siever (RSALS for short), that quickly factored the other keys. RSA Lattice Siever remained active for nearly three years after outliving its initial purpose, by factoring other integers for the mathematical community. After factoring over 400 integers,http://boinc.unsads.com/rsals/crunching.php RSALS moved to RSALS- inspired NFS@homehttp://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=306539&postcount;=434 at the end of August 2012. Legal response Texas Instruments began by sending out two initial DMCA take-down requests to the hackers, referring to sites or forum posts that they controlled. The hackers responded by removing the keys, without consulting an attorney. TI then sent further DMCA notices to a variety of websites displaying the keys, including United-TI, reddit, and Wikipedia. Texas Instruments' efforts then became subject to the Streisand effect, and the keys were mirrored on a number of sites, including WikiLeaksSuppressed Texas Instruments cryptographic signing keys, 28 Aug 2009 at WikiLeaks. Archived on 10 April 2012. and WordPress. In September 2009, Dan Goodin from The Register alerted the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to TI's actions, and the EFF agreed to take on the case pro bono, representing three people who had received DMCA notices. On October 13, 2009, the EFF sent a letter to TI warning them that the posting of the keys did not violate the DMCA, and that it might be liable for misrepresentation. Despite the letter by the EFF, TI continued to send DMCA notices to websites that posted the keys, but stopped doing so after late 2009. The EFF filed a DMCA Section 512 counter-notice on behalf of three of the bloggers who received DMCA notices. When the EFF did not receive a response by the deadline, the bloggers reposted the content that had been taken down. Cryptographic keys The public RSA parameters of the original TI-83+ / TI-83+ Silver Edition OS signing key factored by Benjamin Moody are the following 512-bit modulus n and public (or encryption) exponent e (specified in hexadecimal): n = 82EF4009ED7CAC2A5EE12B5F8E8AD9A0AB9CC9F4F3E44B7E8BF2D57A2F2BEACE 83424E1CFF0D2A5A7E2E53CB926D61F347DFAA4B35B205B5881CEB40B328E58F e = 11 By factoring n, Moody obtained the factors p (252 bits) and q (260 bits), which can be used in turn to quickly compute the 512-bit private (or decryption) exponent : p = B709D3A0CD2FEC08EAFCCF540D8A100BB38E5E091D646ADB7B14D021096FFCD q = B7207BD184E0B5A0B89832AA68849B29EDFB03FBA2E8917B176504F08A96246CB d = 4D0534BA8BB2BFA0740BFB6562E843C7EC7A58AE351CE11D43438CA239DD9927 6CD125FEBAEE5D2696579FA3A3958FF4FC54C685EAA91723BC8888F292947BA1 The value d can then be used to sign arbitrary OS software. The keys factored by RSA Lattice Siever (the TI-92+, TI-73, TI-89, Voyage 200, TI-89 Titanium, TI-84+ / TI-84 Silver Edition OS signing and date-stamp signing keys) are similar but with different values of n, p, q, and d.

He grew up in Ume√• in the northern part of Sweden, but spent most of his time in Chamonix, in the French Alps. History During the summer of 2003, Ericsson climbed and skied the 7495 meters high Ismoil Somoni Peak (Peak Communism) in Tajikistan. In 2004 he became the first Swede to ski descend an 8000-meters peak when he skied from the central summit of Shisha Pangma (8027 m) in Tibet. In 2005 Ericsson and his Norwegian friend J√∂rgen Aamot made an attempt to ski the coveted Laila Peak (6069 m) in Pakistan, but bad conditions forced them to turn around at 5950 m. They were the first people who ever skied down the mountain. That same year they also skied from the summit of Gasherbrum II (8035 m), Ericsson's second 8000-meters peak. Ericsson returned to the Himalayas in 2007 to attempt his third 8000er, Dhaulagiri (8167 m) in Nepal. Massive amounts of snow and dangerous conditions forced him to turn around at 8000 meters, from where he skied 3000 vertical meters down to base camp. Ericsson also skied in Turkey, Iceland, Sicily and Svalbard. He was featured in documentary films such as Skiing Everest and ski movies including Free Radicals 618 and Kong Vinter 3.  Death  On 6 August 2010, Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner joined Ericsson and his partner Trey Cook on the way to the summit of K2, leaving Camp 4 (8000 m) at 1:30 a.m. Weather conditions included light snow, 100-metres visibility, 40-km/h wind, around ‚àí15ÀöC with a forecast for conditions to improve throughout the day. Between 6:30 and 7:00, just below the Bottleneck, Cook turned back due to cold hands that had been frostbitten weeks earlier while establishing the team's Camp 3. Ericsson and Kaltenbrunner continued up the Bottleneck and, while Ericsson placed a piton, a rock dislodged, knocking him from his stance. He fell and was killed. Kaltenbrunner aborted the summit attempt. Ski descents *In 2003, Ericsson climbed Peak Somoni (Peak Communism) and skied from the summit at 7495 m to 4500 meters. *In 2004 he climbed the central summit of Shisha Pangma and skied down to 5600 meters. *In 2005 he climbed Gasherbrum II (8035 m) together with Norwegian J√∂rgen Aamot and they skied from the summit to 5500 meters.

Career Footballer S√ºmer was born in Trabzon and started to play football in his home town's club of Trabzonspor. After some time at Karab√ºkspor and Sebat Gen√ßlik, S√ºmer re-joined Trabzonspor. He was a successful defender of his team. During this time, he earned the nickname \\"Deve\\" (literally: \\"Camel\\") due to his tallness and stubborn rough playing temperament. Manager After having ended his active sports life, S√ºmer served as an instructor for a while at the Turkish Football Federation (TFF). He coached later the youth and amateur squads of Trabzonspor before he was appointed manager of the main team in 1978. Trabzonspor became league champion with S√ºmer as manager in the seasons 1978‚Äì79 and 1980‚Äì81. In 1981, he was appointed manager of the Turkey national football team. The national team played two matches under his managership losing both. He then transferred to coach Galatasaray SK in the 1982‚Äì83 season.

Life at the airfield had its problems, mainly caused by dust during summer. The dust was everywhere, in tents, clothes, equipment and laundry. After the Americans and British moved east into Central France with the advancing Allied Armies, the airfield was left un-garrisoned and used for resupply and casualty evacuation. It was closed on 11 September 1944 and the land returned to agricultural use.Johnson, David C.

Alongside the P values of association, WGAViewer allows a researcher to visualize and consider other supporting evidence, such as the genomic context of the SNP, linkage disequilibrium (LD) with ungenotyped SNPs, gene expression database, and the evidence from other GWAS projects, when determining the potential importance of an individual SNP. Introduction Functions WGAViewer currently offers several classes of annotation of the GWAS results: (1) Overview of WGA results allowing *zooming in/out *searching for gene/SNP *top hits sorting with individual SNP annotation (2) Genic annotation of WGA results with explicit reference to: *align results with the latest genome build *gene/transcripts context *linkage disequilibrium context (3) Annotation for SNPs : *LD score for all HapMap SNPs in specified region *association with specified gene expression *SNP function information (4) Gene/SNP finding : locating and annotating specific genes, SNPs, or LD proxies for SNPs, and aligning the results with the latest genome build. (5) Evidence from multiple scans. (6) Supporting/QC databases: displaying supporting information, for example, HWE P values, effect size, effect direction, QC scores, or other user-customized data. Language WGAViewer is developed on the Java platform. Authors WGAViewer is developed and maintained by Dr. Dongliang Ge and Dr. David B. Goldstein at Duke University, Institute for Genome Sciences & Policy, Center for Human Genome Variation. Applications A number of GWAS projects used the WGAViewer software tool. One of these projects leads to the identification of the genetic variant predicting the hepatitis C treatment-induced viral clearance. The finding from that project, originally reported in Nature, showed that genotype 1 hepatitis C patients carrying certain genetic variant alleles near the IL28B gene are more possibly to achieve sustained virological response after the treatment of Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b (brand names Pegasys or PEG-Intron) combined with ribavirin. A later report from Nature demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus.

He was trained formally in mathematics, but worked for much of his career in aeronautical applications. He was known for work in applying the method of asymptotic expansion to fluid mechanics problems.Narasimha, R. (2004) Divide, conquer and unify, Nature 432(7019), 807. Several of his works have become classics, including \\"Matched Asymptotic Expansions: Ideas And Techniques\\".Lagerstrom, P. A. (1988) Matched Asymptotic Expansions: Ideas And Techniques, Springer. Biography He was born on February 24, 1914 in Oskarshamn, Sweden. Lagerstrom earned bachelor's and master's degrees, in 1935 and 1939 respectively, at the University of Stockholm. He then came to America as a graduate student at Princeton University, earning a PhD in 1942 in mathematics under Salomon Bochner with a dissertation entitled \\"Measure and Integral in Partially Ordered Spaces\\". During this time, Lagerstrom was also a mathematics instructor. He left Princeton in 1944 to work briefly at Bell Aircraft in Niagara Falls, New York until 1945, after which he worked for a similarly brief period at Douglas Aircraft in Santa Monica.GALCIT: The First 75 Years. While he had already published significant results in pure mathematics,McMillan, B. and Lagerstrom, P. (1945) Extension of a theorem of Bochner on expressing functionals as Riemann integrals, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 51, 251-258.Lagerstrom, P. (1945) A proof of a theorem on commutative matrices, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 51, 535-536. he was, by this time, firmly interested in its applications to fluid dynamic and aerodynamic problems. In 1946, Lagerstrom was recruited by Hans Liepmann to the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at Caltech. He was later promoted to Professor of Aeronautics in 1952 and Professor of Applied Mathematics in 1967, having departed only briefly to the University of Paris in 1960-1961 as visiting professor on a Guggenheim Fellowship. He died on February 16, 1989.http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/609/2/Obituaries.pdf Publications His book \\"Laminar flow theory\\", initially published in 1964 in the Theory of Laminar flows, edited by F.K.Moore, is still considered as the standard textbook for fluid mechanics.

Lignerolles Airfield is an abandoned World War II military airfield near the commune of Lignerolles in the Normandy region of northern France. Located to the south and east of Lignerolles, the United States Army Air Force established a temporary airfield on 6 July 1944, shortly after the Allied landings in France The airfield was constructed by the IX Engineering Command, 820th Engineer Aviation Battalion. History Known as Advanced Landing Ground \\"A-12\\", the airfield consisted of a single Prefabricated Hessian Surfacing runway. In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting.IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout The fighter planes from Lignerolles flew support missions during the Allied invasion of Normandy, patrolling roads in front of the beachhead; strafing German military vehicles and dropping bombs on gun emplacements, anti-aircraft artillery and concentrations of German troops in Normandy and Brittany when spotted. In the beginning of September 1944, 34 Wing (RAF) was moved from RAF Northolt to Lignerolles. The wing operated two photographic reconnaissance squadrons from the airfield in support of the Canadian Army. After the Americans and British moved east into Central France with the advancing Allied Armies, the airfield was left un-garrisoned and used for resupply and casualty evacuation. It was closed on 4 November 1944 and the land returned to agricultural use.Johnson, David C.

Its species are widely distributed throughout eastern Africa and especially southern Africa, but also in Lake Tana in Ethiopia. A common name, in particular for the southern species, is yellowfish. The scientific name refers to the fact that these large barbs remind of the fairly closely related \\"carps\\" in the genus Labeo in size and shape. As far as can be told, all Labeobarbus species are hexaploid.de Graaf et al. (2007), IUCN (2009)  Systematics  Like many other \\"barbs\\", it was long included in Barbus. It appears to be a fairly close relative of the typical barbels and relatives - the genus Barbus proper -, but closer still to the large Near Eastern species nowadays separated in Carasobarbus. Barbus has been split to account for the improved phylogenetic knowledge which indicated it was highly paraphyletic in its wide circumscription -, it may be that Carasobarbus and some other closely related \\"barbs\\" (e.g. Labeobarbus reinii) are now included in Labeobarbus to avoid a profusion of very small genera.de Graaf et al. (2007) The taxonomy of many species in the \\"wastebin genus\\" Barbus has recently been re-evaluated. Though hybrid introgression may confound studies based in mtDNA data alone, a number of these species appear to be so closely related to Labeobarbus to warrant inclusion in the present genus outright, irrespective if Carasobarbus is considered distinct or not. These include L. ethiopicus.

Goldman first broadcast nationally as a fill-in host for The Ed Schultz Show in 2006, as well as creating colorful segments as the show's Senior Legal Analyst. He began hosting his own radio show in 2009, syndicated by Compass Media Networks. Goldman ended the show in 2019. Early years Born in New York City, Goldman was orphaned at age eleven, and he spent the rest of his childhood in New York orphanages. He graduated from high school in 1976 at age seventeen. Higher education Goldman graduated from Hunter College of CUNY with a B.A. degree in political science. He then attended and graduated from law school on a full scholarship at Loyola Law School of Los Angeles. He passed the California Bar Exam at age 26. Legal career Goldman was the plaintiff's attorney in Krumme vs. Mercury, a 2002 lawsuit in California. Both the trial court and the California Court of Appeal found for the plaintiffs that the insurance companies were mislabelling agents as independent brokers. The court upheld damages and attorney's fees.Robert Krumme, v. Mercury Insurance Company et al.Findlaw.com, p. 25, California Court of Appeal, 2004 An insurance industry journal has described the case as \\"infamous\\". Goldman also represented plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court against Auto Insurance Specialists accusing the company of paying sales money to an insurer in exchange for commissions. The Norman Goldman Show He hosted his own Saturday morning talk show, The Norman Invasion, on KLSX (97.1) in Los Angeles in 2004. That show ran from July 17 to October 30, 2004. Goldman then became a legal commentator on The Ed Schultz Show. In the late summer of 2009, Goldman began broadcasting his own weekday program via internet broadcasting and podcast. The Norman Goldman Show broadcast live from 3-6 p.m. Pacific time. Goldman picked up several stations after Air America's 2010 demise, as Ron Reagan opted not to continue his 3-6 p.m. PT show after the network's closing. Based in Los Angeles, Goldman's national radio program was distributed by Compass Media Networks. The program's motto was \\"Where justice is served\\", but on-air Norman also used the motto \\"The place where fierce independence is the norm\\", a pun on his first name. The show used the opening riff to Canadian rock band Rush's \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" as its intro. Goldman created the \\"four point plan to save America\\", after chastising politicians such as President Barack Obama for betraying their campaign promises. It includes power- transparency; \\"a WikiLeaks for radio\\", and a grassroots quarterback for the coordinating/funding of the progressive message and viewpoint. On February 5, 2019, Goldman announced his show was ending in a few weeks, claiming he \\"went broke\\". He admitted to spending $2 million dollars of his own money over 9 years propping up the show.

It was nominated for a Primetime Emmy.  Development  The film was developed in response to the positive reviews of the 1995 film Apollo 13. Executive producer James Manos Jr. thinks the reason no movie was made previously was that, \\"at first glance it didn't seem as if anything dramatic happened\\". They received NASA's permission to record portions of the film in the original Apollo Mission Control Center. Engineers at the complex volunteered to make some of the equipment work like it did in 1969, to add authenticity. Buzz Aldrin, one of the three Apollo 11 astronauts, contributed to this movie as technical consultant. He was not always on the film set, but he made an effort to keep up with the film's production. He was filmed for a cameo, but the scene was cut. During the scene, he played a clergyman that interacted with Xander Berkeley, who portrayed Aldrin in the film. Neil Armstrong was asked by Aldrin if he was interested in participating in the film's creation, but Armstrong never got back to him. Plot Fearful that the Soviets would continue their lead in the Space Race and be the first to put a man on the Moon, NASA felt an enormous pressure to push the Apollo Program forward as quickly as possible, though they knew that pushing too hard could lead to disaster. This film recreates the tensions that were felt not only by the three astronauts, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, but also by their families and by the teams of technicians training to deal with anything that could go wrong. Cast *Jeffrey Nordling as commander Neil Armstrong *Xander Berkeley as Apollo Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin.

Following the movie on the premiere night, Aldrin and others answered questions about spaceflight live in a feature titled From the Moon to Mars.

It was founded in 1961 by Rolim Amaro and it is still entirely owned by the Amaro family and thus not a subsidiary of TAM Airlines, though part of the TAM Group. In 1976 TAM Executiva provided support for the start-up of TAM Airlines. History TAM ‚Äì T√°xi A√©reo Mar√≠lia and TAM - Transportes A√©reos Regionais were two different judicial entities, though belonging to the same TAM Group. TAM - Mar√≠lia provided the experience needed for the start-up of TAM - Regionais. TAM can trace its origins to TAM - T√°xi A√©reo Mar√≠lia an air- taxi company founded on January 7, 1961, by five pilots. The company was named 'after the pilots' hometown of Mar√≠lia, in the state of S√£o Paulo. It began operations with 4 Cessna 180 and a single Cessna 170, ferrying cargo and passengers across Paran√°, S√£o Paulo and Mato Grosso states. In 1964 Orlando Ometto, owner of agricultural ventures in the region, purchased a 50% stake in the company, with the intent of using its aircraft and pilots to support his agricultural projects central Brazil. With the capital, TAM purchased aircraft. Later, the original owners left the company and Ometto purchased their share of the company, eventually reaching full-ownership. In 1966, the company bought twin-engined aircraft models, including the Piper Aztec, Piper Navajo and the Rockwell Grand Commander and relocated its offices from Mar√≠lia to the state's capital, S√£o Paulo. In 1971 the company was losing money and in order to re-organize the air-taxi company, Ometto called Rolim Amaro, a former pilot of TAM, who had left the company to form his own air-taxi company. Amaro proposed to liquidate his company and purchase a portion of TAM. While this did not constitute 50% of TAM's capital, he proposed to Ometto that if he was able to make TAM profitable within one year, he would be given the remaining portion of the 50%. In case he failed, he would receive nothing. In April, 1972, the contract between Amaro and Ometto was signed, giving Amaro operational control over the company. At the end of 1972 Amaro sold the entire fleet of TAM - Mar√≠lia and bought 10 Cessna 402 aircraft directly from the manufacturer. Within one year, Amaro fulfilled his promise and was given 50% of the capital of TAM - Mar√≠lia. In 1974, TAM added two Learjets to its fleet. In exchange for one of these jets, 33% of the company's stock was given to the jet's owner, Ti√£o Maia. The three-way split between Maia, Ometto and Amaro would remain until 1975, when Maia sold his share to Ometto. This deteriorated the atmosphere between Amaro and Ometto. In 1976, after 9 months of negotiations, Amaro bought Ometto's 50% of the shares for $2 million, with a promise to pay for it over a period of time. Despite selling one of the jets and other assets, he was still unable to make the payments. For a period of time, Amaro went as far as cancelling insurance for his planes, in an attempt to reduce costs. The morning after insurance was reinstated, on September 24, 1977, one of TAM's Learjets crashed on approach to Santos Dumont Airport. Despite no injuries, the aircraft was a total loss. However, with the cash from the Lear's insurance and the proceeds of the sale of a farm, Amaro concluded his purchase of TAM - Mar√≠lia. TAM Avia√ß√£o Executiva claims to be the leader in the sale of executive jets in Brazil and vice-leader in private air services. The company has been the exclusive representative in Brazil of Cessna airplanes since 1982 and of helicopter manufacturer Bell Helicopter since 2004. Today, TAM Avia√ß√£o Executiva is the executive aircraft service arm of TAM Group. TAM Executiva however is not a subsidiary of TAM Airlines, being entirely owned by family Amaro. For this reason, TAM Executiva is not part of the agreement between TAM Airlines and LAN Airlines to form the LATAM Airlines Group.

It premiered on 14 December 1929, in the Amsterdam Filmliga's theater, De Uitkijk. Historical significance and context  Regen has four key elements that have cemented its place in documentary history: its place in the long career of director Joris Ivens, the Dutch Film Canon, the City Symphony film movement, and the history of avant-garde documentaries. Joris Ivens lived from 1898 to 1989 and in that time created thirteen noteworthy documentaries, whose interrelation and evolution loosely model the trajectory of documentary film as a whole. Over his career, he made art films, commercial films, political documentaries, war (and indeed anti-war) documentaries. His final film, A Tale of the Wind, was an autobiographical piece contemplating the divide between realism and fantasy. Additionally, Ivens was one of the inaugural voices of Dutch Film, establishing traditions in the form of content and formal effects that have continued to define films from the Netherlands. First among these is the painterly heritage of the Dutch. From the intimate realism of the Dutch Masters to Impressionism, Pointillism, and De Stijl, the Netherlands have a rich history of skilled and pioneering artists, including such household names as Rembrandt, Van Gogh and M. C. Escher. Ivens's attention to composition is demonstrative not only of his three-generation family history of photography, but of his national heritage as well. Dutch films are inward-looking, that is, they feature Dutch subjects, Dutch settings, and Dutch conflicts, to include a love-hate struggle with the elements that has been a part of Dutch culture as long as the canals and windmills on which the Netherlands depends. Ivens also established a tradition of craftsmanship in the form of a rigorous organization of shots that likely owes its effectiveness and visibility to Ivens's belief in the conclusions of the Kuleshov-Pudovkin experiment. The Pudovkin experiment led to one of the key tenets of Soviet Montage‚Äîthat when cutting shots together, 2+2=5, which is to say a synthesis of two shots may incite a response independent of the response to either shot alone. Regen was one of the founding voices of avant-garde documentary, and perhaps the fullest realization of the filmic tradition of City Symphony. While often noted for their politics, the aesthetics of City Symphonies such as Alberto Cavalcanti's Rien que les heures (1926), Walter Ruttmann's Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis (1927), and Dziga Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera (1929) also attempt to arrest the viewer's perception and create a highly formalistic visual poetry. While striving for what amounts to peak formalism, Regen differs from other city films in that its focus is subtly shifted from city life to the rainstorm itself, and how it transforms the city. Its subjects are numerous and anonymous, and few shots identify the setting of the film as Amsterdam, focusing instead on raindrops, clouds, and other small details of the rain's interaction with the city. Production conditions Though Ivens mostly produced Regen by his own means, his involvement with the Amsterdam Filmliga was key to his studies of good practice and interest in formal experiments. In 1927, Henrik Scholte proposed the foundation of the Filmliga in the interest of showing highly avant-garde films and Soviet films which were banned in the West. The Filmliga's manifesto, written by Scholte himself, suggested first and foremost that a filmmaker is an artist above all things. As one of the founding board members of the Film League, Ivens traveled around European capitals and met many filmmakers whose enthusiasm, along with that of the Dutch members of the Filmliga, encouraged him to further involve himself in producing films. Ivens hosted the library of the Film League in his attic and was able to read film theory and, at his editing bench, study filmmaking practically. Ivens's practical knowledge came not only from these home editing experiments, but also from his inheritance of his family's photography business, which had allowed him to study under several celebrated manufacturers of photographic equipment. One such manufacturer was Emanuel Goldberg, inventor of the Kinamo camera, which derived its name from Greek and Latin: \\"kine\\" and \\"amo\\", meaning \\"I love movies\\". Ivens worked on the assembly line for the camera and acknowledged Goldberg's influence on his entire career. Of the camera, he wrote: \\"with my camera held in my hand, the marvelous Kinamo of Professor Goldberg, I was, naturally, freed from the rigidity of a tripod, and I had given movement to what, normally, would have had to be a succession of fixed shots. Without knowing it, filming flexibly and without stopping, I had achieved a continuity. That day I realized that the camera was an eye and I said to myself, 'If it is a gaze, it ought to be a living one.'‚ÄùQuoted in Ivens completed many of his manufacturing apprenticeships in Berlin, involving himself not only with the photography industry, but with the creative and political scene of Weimar Germany. By the time Ivens arrived in Berlin, it was 1921. The 1918 revolution of workers and soldiers had failed and the Weimar Republic was already perceived as a sham. Trust in the divided government only worsened as the Deutschmark's value dropped drastically against the dollar and Ivens' Dutch Guilders, the increasing value of which helped him to enthusiastically subscribe to the darkly carnivalesque sociocultural atmosphere of the Weimar era. After a day of classes (in which he recalls a professor openly snorting cocaine before beginning a lecture), Ivens and friends‚Äîartists, publishers, poets, anarchists, Marxists, radical Communists‚Äîmight see a revue at the Apollo Theater or go to the cinema to see an expressionist film by Wiene or Murnau. Though the Weimar lifestyle did not suit Ivens for very long, features of expressionism and its parent and predecessor, the avant-garde, are clearly visible in Rain. At this time, the avant-garde movement was just being taken up by filmmakers, who were making new discoveries daily about the artistic potential of filmmaking. These filmmakers no longer wanted to produce vapid pieces created simply to entertain the masses. Instead, they sought expression through a film's rhythm and movement‚Äîthe characteristics which, according to these artists, made film a unique medium. They believed a film could create its own world, whether through thought‚Äìprovoking Absurdism in a piece like Bu√±uel and Dali's Un Chien Andalou or purely through form, as in Dziga Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera. Rain closely adheres to this prioritization of a film's formalistic qualities. The short film focuses primarily on composition and rhythm, visually following the patterns of raindrops and people as they try to negotiate with each other in their movements through the city. Ivens's efforts to create what amounts to a visual poem, or perhaps a moving painting, led to his being termed a poet-engineer by fellow Filmliga members. Ivens created the film with the help of two other men not often credited for their assistance with the production: Cheng Fai, Ivens's housekeeper, and a young John Ferno, known then as Fernhout. Cheng Fai often ventured out with Ivens‚Äîhe outfitted in an oilskin and boots, Cheng Fai equipped with an umbrella‚Äîto assist with gathering footage in the rain, protecting the camera and film from water damage. Ferno was sent to Ivens by Ferno's mother, who was worried about her son after he performed poorly in school. She was hoping Ivens would help the boy use his time more productively and teach him a new skill. Ivens put him to work riding a bike through rainy Amsterdam while Ivens shot. Ferno went on to do more professional work with Ivens, including some work on The Spanish Earth. Aesthetic context Regen is an example of the popular City Symphony film. City Symphonies like those created by Ruttman, Cavalcanti, and Vertov vary, evidently, in the cities featured, but also in their treatment of their subjects and the prominence of the director's voice in the piece: Ruttman's film made Berlin itself the main character, while Vertov's film is highly reflexive, often featuring the director and his brother working the camera through stunts and trick shots. These films were created in conjunction with the avant-garde movement and emergence of formalism, and accordingly focus on aesthetic properties more than content. For Regen, these aesthetic properties are reflected in the construction and the creativity of the film. It has a loosely narrative structure: it first presents the viewer with a situation: Amsterdam, its rooftops, its canals, and fleetingly, its residents going about their business. Next, the viewer is presented with an incident: slowly, raindrops begin to send minuscule ripples through a canal, a breeze picks up, birds take flight. Rain falls harder and we begin to take closer, longer looks at individuals adapting to their changed environment. The shots are mostly anonymous‚Äîfaces passing quickly and blending into crowds as umbrellas are raised. As the streets clear (the film was shot over months but we are made to feel this is all happening over the course of an afternoon), focus shifts to rain's interaction with nature and architecture‚Äîfilling the dams, flowing through gutter pipes, obscuring the view of Amsterdam's rooftops. And finally, we return to the status quo: though evidence of the storm remains‚Äîthe streets are still silvered and all the guardrails hold drops of water‚Äîthe canals have returned to a glassy calm and everywhere people are emerging from indoors. Amsterdam is vibrant and lively once again. Ivens meticulously composes the shots that make up all of Regen's fourteen minutes. Much attention is paid, for example, to reflections. Silhouettes pass upside down across the top of the screen, women with shopping carts are seen through the puddles they step over, a man stretches and slides across the sidewalk through his circus-mirror reflection in a chrome wheel well. Paradoxically, the craftsmanship of Ivens's work shifts attention away from the director and his efforts and towards the \\"story\\" of the film and its main conflict‚Äîman's interaction with nature, and indeed Amsterdam's interaction with water, which holds the power to help and hurt the city. Much emphasis is also placed on rhythmic movement. At times black umbrellas fill the scene which seem to ebb and flow like water themselves as the people beneath them move about a city square. Similarly, we are able to follow the timing of the storm by paying attention to shots where rain is falling into a canal‚Äîit is light, then heavy, then light once again. Part of what makes the timing of the film feel so true to the timing of a rainstorm actually experienced are the synergistic cuts tested and proved by the Soviet Montage movement. Kuleshov and Pudovkin proved that if an audience watches two shots in succession, they will automatically assume that those shots are related‚Äîso we imagine that as we watch a shot of rain steadily falling in the canal, then another of a man rushing to get his groceries indoors, he has picked up speed because he too has sensed that it has started to rain. In another scene, a woman steps on a trolley and the next shot is of the rain-slicked street passing below; we assume we are seeing the street from the woman's seat on the trolley. Historical context As noted above, Regen can be placed in the context of the Weimar Era and its art, which are tied into the culture and subsequently the socioeconomic conditions of the time. Informing Ivens's piece primarily is the cultural revolution of Modernism, which exploded into and informed artistic movements such as German Expressionism, Dada, the avant-garde, and later, Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity), the German movement that strove to portray the harsh realities of modern city life as they were. In spite of the influence of Modernism, Ivens leaves worship of the machine to Vertov and steers his film in the direction of a more romantic subject: nature. Though Regen can hardly be called pastoral, its artistic expression evokes a less frantic poetry than that of the city symphonies it is often compared with. It manages nonetheless to achieve the same defamiliarization‚Äîa revitalizing rendering of something that is familiar into something that is abstract or strange‚Äîas its Russian counterpart. Reactions to Ivens's film vary over time, as scholars come to compare this work to the rest of Ivens's work very differently from the fellow Filmliga members who reacted to this singular art piece in the 1920s. Pudovkin may have started the trend of calling the film uncharacteristic for Ivens, as it lacked any of his spirituality. Films like Rain and The Bridge were beautiful, but they were only formal experiments, not reflective of Ivens's search for certainty in a chaotic world. One unlikely critic of the film is its co-director, who was displeased not by the content or aesthetics of the film, but by the fact that from its premiere he received very little credit for it. Though in his autobiography, Ivens claims to have conceived of Regen on his own while filming Breakers, in reality Mannus Franken wrote to Ivens with the idea in the fall of 1927. Franken wrote to another Filmliga member about not wishing to take credit from Ivens for making the film, but being annoyed all the same that he received very little credit for the work.

This non-profit organization presently owns eight reserves spanning . Seven of these reserves: Caywood (43 acres), King (96), McGinnis (52), Potter (3), Tomer (18), Walter (29), Morosini (183) are crossed by miles of hiking trails and are home to a variety of wildlife, including: deer, skunks, foxes and coyotes. They are available for year-round individual hiking. The Flinn Reserve currently has no hiking trails and is used for nature study. The 183-acre Morosini Reserve is the most recent property to come under our protection.  Activities  Throughout the year, the Westmoreland Conservancy sponsors free nature hikes through the reserves. These hikes will often have a special focus of interest such as wildflowers, birds, butterflies, nature photography, or local history. Caching with the Conservancy (CWTC) is a popular geocaching event held annually in June and occasionally in the Fall as well.  Projects  The Westmoreland Conservancy has partnered with the Municipality of Murrysville to establish an east-west community trail. That trail, known as the Don Harrison Community Trail, makes use of both Conservancy and Municipal properties and utilizes two private Right-of-Way links to create a passage more than 5 miles long. Beginning at the Walter Reserve on Weistertown Road at the western edge of Murrysville, the trail passes through the Murrysville Community Park, the Caywood Reserve, two ROW passages and the King and Potter Reserves the trail crosses both Hills Church and Crowfoot Roads. Once the Sloan School segment of trail is completed it will then cross Sardis Road and pass along a municipal connector to reach Townsend Park at the eastern side of the community.

The American edition was published under the name \\"Iain M. Banks\\", which is the name Banks used for his science fiction work. Background In an interview with The Guardian Banks explained what he was aiming for, \\"With Transition, I wanted to prove something. I wanted to show I could do something like The Bridge again because until now, that has been my favourite.\\" While he has insisted it wasn't a commentary on American imperialism (\\"I don't think it's about America per se; it's more about power and the way that it is wielded in general\\") he does admit that the character The Philosopher is a way of addressing the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal. Plot summary Set between the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and the 2008 financial crisis, Transition centres on a shadowy organisation called \\"The Concern\\" (also known as \\"L'Exp√©dience\\"), and how the workings of this organisation affect the lives of the novel's multiple narrators and characters. Banks uses the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics theory to imagine \\"infinitudes\\" of parallel realities, between which The Concern's agents‚Äîknown as Transitionaries‚Äîcan \\"flit\\", intervening in events to produce what The Concern sees as beneficial outcomes for that world. Transitioning, or flitting, is only possible for people with a predisposed talent for such movement, who may only flit after ingesting a mysterious drug called \\"septus\\". When a Transitionary flits into another world, he or she temporarily takes control of the body of an existing inhabitant of that world, along with some of that body's residual idiosyncrasies (such as personality disorders and sexual preferences). Main characters The Transitionary Referred to in section headings as \\"The Transitionary\\", the character's name is Temudjin Oh. Like the majority of The Concern's operatives, he naturally inhabits a version of Earth called Calbefraques, which is an \\"Open\\" world - one in which the presence of the many worlds is commonly known about and accepted. Temudjin, or Tem, is one of The Concern's most skilled and prized Transitionaries, although much mistrusted by the organisation's de facto head, Madame d'Ortolan, owing to his formerly close relationship with a renegade Concern operative, Mrs Mulverhill. Patient 8262 A former Transitionary, now in hiding in a far-flung reality, posing as a patient in a hospital. Madame d'Ortolan The ruthless, sexually predatory and ancient de facto head of The Concern's Central Council. More than two hundred years old, Madame d'Ortolan has been accorded the honour of being allowed to transition permanently into a younger body when her older one is near death. An unstable genius, she is deeply worried about the influence of Mrs Mulverhill on the Concern's activities. Adrian Cubbish A City trader in the reality of our own Earth, Adrian is, at first, apparently not connected to the other characters or The Concern. He is a former drug dealer and arch-capitalist, who becomes extremely wealthy from his work as a trader, before setting up his own hedge fund. Mrs Mulverhill A former member of The Concern, a highly talented Transitionary and erstwhile teacher at The Concern's University of Practical Talents. She believes that the ruling elite of the Concern has ulterior motives and a hidden agenda for the actions they perform. After forming a close relationship with Temudjin Oh, she disappears, causing Madame d'Ortolan to become deeply paranoid about her motives and intentions. Mrs Mulverhill theorises that Madame d'Ortolan is motivated, along with a need to control the Council (and therefore humanity), to ensure that none of the many Earth worlds are contaminated by alien contact. Her instructions to the transitionaries to kill, supposedly to eliminate evil workers, are suspected by Mrs Mulverhill as being the means of eliminating the possibility of alien contact for Earth in all its realities (or otherwise of covering up this motive). In a final scene, Mme 'O' appears to accept this accusation. The Philosopher A torturer and former employee of the police and army. The Philosopher likes to imagine himself as an ethical and thoughtful man - hence his sobriquet - and claims to take no pleasure in his work, seeing it only as a necessary evil. Bisquitine A young and apparently mad woman kept under close watch by the Concern. Through various extreme and unethical measures, the Concern has developed Bisquitine's transition powers to a very high degree. Thus crazy and possessed of superpowers, she is the Concern's secret weapon; a real loose cannon. In the end she is revealed to be an abused character we have briefly met in previous chapters, named \\"Subject 7\\". Reception Doug Johnstone for The Independent concluded: \\"Transition is a book that makes you think, one that makes you look at the world around you in a different light, and it's also a properly thrilling read. If only more contemporary fiction was like it.\\" Patrick Ness for The Guardian suggested the book has a \\"weird half-heartedness\\". He concluded \\"this is an airport novel, something for the flight from JFK to Eafrow _[sic]_. You're welcome to take that for as much of a recommendation as you choose.\\"  Unused material  In 2010, an unused section of the first draft was published by the Birmingham Science Fiction group as the short story \\"The Spheres\\" in a booklet of the same name. The publication was a limited edition of 500 to mark Novacon 40.

Life expectancy  In 2015, CIA estimated the average life expectancy in South Africa to be 62.34 years. The life expectancy for males is 60.83 years and for females 63.87 years.  HIV/AIDS  Estimated HIV infection in Africa in 2007 shows high rates of infection in Southern Africa. HIV and AIDS in South Africa are major health concerns, and more than 5.3 million people are thought to be living with the virus in South Africa.UNAIDS South Africa HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is the retrovirus that causes the disease known as AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). South Africa has more people with HIV/AIDS than any other country.radiodiaries entry on \\"Just Another Day at the Biggest Hospital in the World\\" The South African National HIV Survey estimated that more than 15% of all South Africans over 2 years old were living with HIV in 2007. There is an average of almost 1,000 deaths of AIDS a day in South Africa. Other infectious diseases Other infectious diseases prevalent in South Africa include bacterial diarrhea, typhoid fever, and hepatitis A. These infectious diseases are generally caused when the food or water consumed by an individual has been exposed to fecal material.\\"CIA - The World Factbook.\\" Central Intelligence Agency, 4 Apr. 2007 South Africa is an underdeveloped nation and because of this the sanitation facility access in urban areas is 16% unimproved while in rural areas the sanitation facility access is 35% unimproved.\\"CIA - The World Factbook.\\" Central Intelligence Agency, 4 Apr. 2007 Vaccination The South African Vaccination and Immunisation Centre began in 2003 as an alliance between the South African Department of Health, vaccine industry, academic institutions, and other stakeholders. It works with WHO and the South African National Department of Health to educate, do research, provide technical support, and advocate. They work to increase rates of vaccination in order to improve the nation's health.  Malnutrition  15% of South African infants are born with a low birth weight. 5% of South African children are so underweight they are considered to be wasted. Since the 1990s South Africa's malnutrition problem has remained fairly stable. But as malnutrition in terms of hunger is getting better, the number of obesity is rising and this is becoming a problem. The prevalence of malnutrition in South Africa varies across different geographical areas and socio-economic groups. Many infants in Africa suffer from malnutrition because their mothers do not breastfeed them. The reason mothers in South Africa avoid breastfeeding is to prevent passing on AIDS to their children. The 2010 South Africa Department of Health Study found that 30.2% of pregnant women in South Africa have AIDS. Instead, mothers give milk substitutes to their children and do so in unclean environments. Sometimes they go directly to giving food which are not adapted to infants. These things cause many cases of malnutrition in children under five years of age.  Undernourishment  South Africa has less than 5% of the population facing undernourishment. In 2015, South Africa achieved one of the targets of the millennium development goal 1 which was to halve the number of people facing undernourishment between 1990 and 2015.  Mental health  In a study conducted by the Mental Health and Poverty Research Program, it was found that approximately 16.5% of the adult population in South Africa suffers from mental illness, with 1% suffering from a severe life-debilitating mental disease.Inge, P., Arvin, B., Victoria, C., Sithembile, M., Crick, L., Sharon, K., & ... the Mental Health and Poverty Research Programme, C. (2009). Planning for district mental health services in South Africa: a situational analysis of a rural district site. Health Policy & Planning, 24(2), 140. Retrieved from EBSCOhost. p. 141Okasha, A. (2002). Mental health in Africa: the role of the WPA. World Psychiatry 1(1), 32‚Äì35. Web. Retrieved from PubMed. 30% of South Africans are likely to suffer a mental illness in their lifetimes, depression being the most common ailment. A recent study found that 44.1% and 40.2% of youth (ages 14-24 years) experienced depression and anxiety, respectively. Furthermore, 1 in 4 of these youth reported current suicidal thoughts. Bloomberg has ranked South Africa as the second \\"most stressed out\\" country in the world, due in large part to South Africans' work ethic. 53% of the South African work force does not take annual leave. Another large contributor to the high frequency of mental disorders is violence. Of the adult population ages 16 to 64, it was found that 23% were exposed to a traumatic event of violence in the past year. These traumatic events include acts such as fighting a war, being tortured, or participating in violence. Among this population, it was determined that mental illness including symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was 8.5 times more prevalent than among the general population.Hirschowitz, R., & Orkin, M. (1997). Trauma and mental health in South Africa. Social Indicators Research, 41(1‚Äì3), 169. Retrieved from EBSCOhost. p. 169 Another factor contributing to mental illness in South Africa is substance abuse. Many provinces are used as drug trafficking routes, and as the South African government lacks the necessary resources to control this problem, many of these illicit drugs find their way into local populations as a drug. In addition, the availability of the wild growing Cannabis plant allows for its rampant abuse among all age categories. It was found that 52% of street children smoke the Cannabis plant and 22% on a daily basis.Kilonzo, G. P., & Simmons, N. N. (1998). Development of Mental Health Services in Tanzania: A Reappraisal for the Future. Social Science & Medicine, 47(4), 419. Retrieved from EBSCOhost. p. 422 Educational campaigns are limited, and as a result, many do not realize the impinging health effects that will result from substance abuse. Diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, and HIV provide a significant contribution to the prevalence of mental illness. Some of these diseases such as cerebral malaria can bear a direct physiological effect on the mental functionality of the patient. However, even more poignant is the ability of the disease to strike a radiating blow to the patient's emotional psyche. For instance, the prevalence of mental illness among those suffering from HIV is 43.7% compared to the 16.5% observed among the general population.Freeman, M., Nkomo, N., Kafaar, Z., & Kelly, K., 2008. Mental disorder in people living with HIV/AIDS in South Africa. South African Journal of Psychology, 38, pp.489‚Äì500.  Maternal and child healthcare  The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for South Africa is 410. This is compared with 236.8 in 2008 and 120.7 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 65 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 30. In South Africa the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is unavailable and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 100.

Designed and built at the Royal Aircraft Factory in 1912‚Äì13 as the B.S.1, the prototype was rebuilt several times before serving with the Royal Flying Corps over the Western Front in the early months of the First World War. Development and design In 1912, a team at the Royal Aircraft Factory, led by Geoffrey de Havilland, started design of a single seat scout, or fast reconnaissance aircraft, the first aircraft in the world specifically designed for this role.Jackson 1987, p. 42. The design was a small tractor biplane, and was named the B.S.1 (standing for Bl√©riot Scout) after Louis Bl√©riot, a pioneer of tractor configuration aircraft. It had a wooden monocoque circular section fuselage, and single-bay wings. Lateral control was by wing warping, while the aircraft was initially fitted with a small rudder without a fixed fin (a scaled down version of that fitted to the B.E.3), and a one-piece elevator. It was powered by a two-row, 14-cylinder Gnome rotary engine rated at 100 hp (75 kW).Bruce 1982, p. 464.Mason 1992, p. 14. The Royal Aircraft B.S.1 in its original form The B.S.1 was first flown by Geoffrey de Havilland early in 1913, demonstrating excellent performance, with a maximum speed of 91.7 mph (147.6 km/h), a stalling speed of 51 mph (82 km/h) and a rate of climb of 900 ft/min (4.6 m/s), despite the engine only delivering about 82 hp (61 kW) instead of the promised 100 hp. De Havilland was not satisfied with the control afforded by the small rudder and designed a larger replacement, but on 27 March 1913, before the new rudder could be installed, he crashed the B.S.1, breaking his jaw and badly damaging the aircraft.Bruce 1982, p. 465. Following this accident, it was rebuilt, with an 80 hp single-row Gnome and new tail surfaces, with triangular fins above and below the fuselage, a larger rudder and conventional divided elevators.Bruce 1982, p. 466. While the rebuilt aircraft was initially designated B.S.2, it was soon redesignated S.E.2 (for Scout Experimental). It was flown in this form by de Havilland in October 1913. In April 1914, the S.E.2 was again rebuilt, this time under the supervision of Henry Folland, as de Havilland had left the Royal Aircraft Factory to become chief designer of Airco (the B.S.1/S.E.2 was the last design de Havilland produced for the Factory). The tail surfaces were again revised, with a larger fin and rudder, with new tailplane and elevators. The monocoque rear fuselage, which had been criticised as too expensive for mass production, was replaced by a conventional wood and fabric structure. Better streamlined struts were fitted, as well as streamline sectioned bracing wires (Raf-wires). It was first flown in this form on 3 October 1914. This modified version is often referred to as the \\"S.E.2a\\" - this designation was not used at the time, and was probably not official.Hare 1990, p. 274. Operational history The Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.2 in about October 1913 - after its reconstruction from the B.S.1 and before its final rebuild The S.E.2 was handed over the Royal Flying Corps on 17 February 1914, with the serial number 609 being issued to No. 5 Squadron, where it made a good impression, and then to No. 3 Squadron before being returned to the Royal Aircraft Factory in April. By the time the rebuilt \\"S.E.2a\\" version was completed, the First World War had broken out, and the modified S.E.2 was sent across the English Channel to join No. 3 Squadron on 27 October.Bruce 1982, p. 467. It was fitted with an improvised armament of a pair of rifles mounted on the side of the fuselage, angled outwards to avoid the propeller, together with the pilot's revolver.Mason 1992, p. 21. It was one of the fastest aircraft available in the early months of the war, with it being said that: \\"Its speed enabled it to circle around the enemy machines and gave it a decided ascendancy.\\"Bruce 1957, p. 441. It remained in use with 3 Squadron until March 1915, when it was damaged by an exploding bomb and was sent back to England.

It lies entirely within the d√©partement of Puy de D√¥me. The term is sometimes used to include this, and three other less extensive plains, that lie along the valley of the Allier, in which case the first is known as Grande Limagne to distinguish it from the others. The name is derived from the Latin Lacus Magnus, or large lake. Geology The Limagne plain is a graben, downthrown from the Massif Central by a series of normal faults that border the western edge of the plain.

It was launched on the March 13, 2009, episode of Glenn Beck, the eponymous talk show on Fox News Channel. A website was launched to promote the group, and several local 9-12 groups formed soon after in cities throughout the United States. According to Beck, the purpose of the project was \\"to bring us all back to the place we were on September 12, 2001 ... we were not obsessed with red states, blue states or political parties. We were united as Americans, standing together to protect the values and principles of the greatest nation ever created.\\"[citation 3, Standard Journal] 9-12 represents the date following the September 11 attacks in 2001, and \\"9 Principles\\" and \\"12 Values\\" that Beck believes represent the principles and values shared by the Founding Fathers of the United States.http://www.the912project.com/the-912-2/mission-statement/ Some of the Tea Party movement was part of the 9-12 Project serving as a sponsor for the Taxpayer March on Washington on September 12, 2009. The 9-12 Project activists claim not to identify with any major political party.  9 Principles and 12 Values  The name \\"9-12\\" symbolized both the day after the September 11, 2001 (written as September 12, or 9-12), and the project's \\"nine principles and twelve values.\\" According to the website, the 9 Principles and 12 Values were derived from the principles of the Founding Fathers: ::At the origin of America, our Founding Fathers built this country on 28 powerful principles. These principles were culled from all over the world and from centuries of great thinkers. We have distilled the original 28 down to the 9 basic principles., The 9-12 Project: Mission Statement The website listed the 9 Principles, accompanied by quotations from George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. The 9 Principles were: #America is good. #I believe in God and He is the center of my life. #I must always try to be a more honest person than I was yesterday. #The family is sacred. My spouse and I are the ultimate authority, not the government. #If you break the law you pay the penalty. Justice is blind and no one is above it. #I have a right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, but there is no guarantee of equal results. #I work hard for what I have and I will share it with who I want to. Government cannot force me to be charitable. #It is not un-American for me to disagree with authority or to share my personal opinion. #The government works for me. I do not answer to them, they answer to me. The 12 Values were: #Honesty #Reverence #Hope #Thrift #Humility #Charity #Sincerity #Moderation #Hard work #Courage #Personal Responsibility #Gratitude (originally Friendship) History U.S. Capitol during the Taxpayer March on Washington. A group of protesters hold signs praising Beck at the Taxpayer March on Washington. The 9-12 Project was created as the result of Beck's \\"We Surround Them\\" campaign, a series of segments and specials on Beck's television program in early 2009 which purported to bring back government accountability. Viewers were asked to incorporate these values first in their personal lives, then expect them of those they elected to office and holding the elected accountable. At one point during the campaign, viewers were asked to submit pictures if they believed at least seven of the nine founding principles and felt they were alone in believing these principles. Many of the pictures were used to form a collage that once lined one of the walls in Glenn Beck's Fox News Channel studio. The 9-12 Project grew out of that campaign, as a result of the original call Beck took on his nationally syndicated talk radio show, from \\"Ed\\" of New Haven, Connecticut. During that phone call in late January, 2009, \\"Ed\\" said that he felt \\"outnumbered\\" (as a true conservative in today's political battles). Beck told him that he would figure out a way to prove to him that he isn't alone, and that \\"they,\\" the powers that be, don't surround \\"us\\", the American people, but rather, \\"We Surround Them!\\" Following the Taxpayer March on Washington on September 12, 2009, Beck introduced a campaign for the 9-12 project called \\"Re-found America\\". The campaign aims to find 56 Re-Founders, who are Congressional politicians who agree to stand against corruption and abuses of power, and become whistle blowers, exposing the evidence of corruption. As of 2017, the News section on the 9-12 Project website had not been updated since February 2014, and by June 2017 the 9-12 Project Website itself was no longer extant. In an interview before the 2016 US presidential election, Beck stated that while the 9-12 Project had often been conflated with the Tea Party movement, it had actually been set up in opposition to it. Local organizations Individuals in a number of locations in the United States formed organizations and chapters based with the 9-12 Project. The aim of such groups was to get the public active in keeping elected officials accountable to voters and taxpayers. For instance, in Murphy, North Carolina, a meeting of self-proclaimed 9-12 Project members was held on August 29, 2009 \\"to plan how to elect their own representatives to the U.S. House and decrease the size and control of the federal government over the lives of American people\\". The event was attended by \\"more than 325 people\\". Another event, in Salt Lake City, Utah, on September 12, 2009 (9-12-09), featured several speakers, from activists to conservative public officials. Over 2,000 activists were reportedly in attendance National events \\"9/12ers\\", as members of the 9/12 movement were sometimes called, also attended various Tea Party protests; among those are the Tax Day protests on April 15, 2009, the July 4, 2009 Independence Day Tea Party protests, and the September 12, 2009 Taxpayer March on Washington. The project also had a presence at other September 12, 2009 Tea Party protests in cities all across America, from Tampa to Salt Lake City to Fort Worth. Members of certain 9-12 Project chapters held a nationwide protest in front of various news media buildings on October 17, 2009.

The D. H. Lawrence Birthplace Museum is a writer's home museum dedicated to the writer D. H. Lawrence situated in Eastwood, near Nottingham. It is the house in which he was born in 1885, and one of the four houses the family occupied in Eastwood. Now a museum, visitors can visit the building via guided or self-guided tour. The exhibition Visitors enter the Museum through the house next door, through the Museum shop. The house has been laid out in the style of a late 19th-century working-class miner‚Äôs house, with the furniture being mostly from the family of the women who founded it. There are a few original items from Lawrence‚Äôs family; the artefacts are as close to the 1880s as possible and from Nottinghamshire to make the contents as authentic for the period. The house is set out as it was thought to have been when the Lawrences lived there. The significance of each room (parlour, kitchen, communal yard, washhouse, parents‚Äô bedroom, children's bedroom and attic) is highlighted, either by the interpretation boards on display, or via a staff member on a guided tour. There is a small exhibition of Lawrence‚Äôs early original watercolour paintings and a DVD room that starts the tour providing an introduction to his life in Eastwood and thereafter. Photocopies of his later paintings are also displayed. A recent addition to the collection was Lawrence‚Äôs original gravestone, which has been on display since 11 September 2009‚Äîthe anniversary of his birthday.

He has written articles on the redefinition of art, printmaking, and education and has taught and lectured on printmaking at over 75 universities, colleges, and schools worldwide.  Biography  Born in 1949, Hugh Merrill was raised in Washington, D.C. and Alabama. His grandfather, Hugh Davis Merrill, was a state judge and Lieutenant Governor of Alabama. His father worked with the Democratic Party, advising Kennedy, Humphrey and Johnson on agricultural issues. Merrill began his artistic career in 1969 at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). Within his first year, Merrill flunked out and ended up in Washington D.C., working in the offices of Alabama senator John Sparkman. The following year he returned to MICA, where he discovered printmaking, specifically etching, a medium that would become his primary means of expression for the next four decades. Despite continued academic difficulties, Merrill completed his undergraduate work and was accepted to Yale School of Art. There, he studied with John Cage, Gabor Pederti, William Bailey, Alex Katz, Robert Motherwell, Al Held and others, all of whom would have a profound impact on his thinking and work. After receiving his MFA from Yale in 1975, Merrill taught at Wheaton College (Massachusetts) before being hired to teach printmaking at the Kansas City Art Institute (KCAI) in 1976, where he has been teaching since. In the 1970s, Hugh Merrill began working on etchings of the urban environment, which he termed ‚Äúreal-estatescapes,‚Äù a phrase meant to represent the dominance of society over nature. In the 1980s Merrill focused on sequential etching suites, such as Lucky Dragon, exhibited at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in 1985, and Rosa Luxemburg, exhibited at Printworks Gallery in Chicago. As noted by Nelson-Atkins print curator George L. McKenna, these prints \\"[dealt] imaginatively with the confrontation between man-made construction and natural landscape,\\" through drawing, etching, printing, and reworking of the etching plates.McKenna, George L. Introduction, Prints by Hugh Merrill, exhibition catalog, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, MO and Springfield Museum of Art, Springfield, MO, 1984-1985. During the 1990s, Hugh Merrill became concerned that his prints and studio work were not having the direct impact on society that he had been striving for and began to look at the writings of Lucy Lippard, Suzanne Lacy, Suzi Gablic and the work of Tim Rollins and K.O.S.. He returned from a trip to Poland, photographing and doing drawings in Krak√≥w and Auschwitz, determined to balance his studio vision with community arts actions. In 1996, Merrill worked with the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art as a visiting artist for the Christian Boltanski exhibition, So Far. He and Boltanski collaborated on the citywide community artwork Our City Ourselves. With the help of designer Bruce McIntosh, Merrill created a tabloid publication insert in the Sunday Kansas City Star inviting the public to bring their family photographs and personal archives to the museum where they could pin them to the walls. In conjunction with the exhibit, Merrill also created Portrait of Self, an arts and educational archive of drawing, writing, photography, and other art forms to help young people discuss the many influences on their sense of sense. Since its creation, Merrill has gone on to use Portrait of Self in community arts projects in Dana Beach, Florida; Sydney, Australia; Dublin, Ireland, as well as Colorado Springs, CO; Pittsburgh, PA; Portland, OR; and a number of other cities nationwide. Building on these experiences, Merrill helped transform Chameleon Theatre, a small not-for-profit whose mission was to create dramatic plays about youth experience, into the broader Chameleon Arts and Youth Development agency that utilizes theater, Hip Hop, visual arts, and dance to transform the lives of homeless and at-risk youth. In 2005, he was invited to produce a community arts action for the Impact ConferenceUTK.edu in Berlin, Germany and Poznan, Poland. The project, Pools of Belief, consisted of graphics of children's swimming pools laid out in a public square and filled with images of mousetraps shaped like boats. Trailing from the traps were narrow sheets of paper with the text ‚ÄúI believe in the New York Stock Exchange‚Äù and other statements. The public was asked to participate by writing their own answers to the phrase ‚ÄúI believe in ‚Äù on a narrow sheet of paper, which they then attached to the work.Skorwider, Max. Interview, Pools of Belief, exhibition catalog, 2007. Pools of Belief has gone on to be exhibited at the Dalarnas Museum for the Falun Print Triennial in Falun, SwedenFalun Triennial2007, exhibition catalog, Dalarnas Museum, Falun, Sweden, 2007: p138-143. and other museums around the world. Most recently Merrill has worked with Staci Pratt, director of the Office of Homeless Liaison, Kansas City, KS Public Schools to facilitate a number of community arts projects, including Faces of the Homeless. Faces was a collaboration with Patrick Moonasar and Matt Hilger which produced a series of posters of homeless children showing not their need but their value. The posters have been exhibited nationally including the 2008 conference for the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and YouthNAEHCY.org in Washington, D.C. In addition, Hugh Merrill has been invited on Kansas City Medical Missions trips to the Philippines, Guatemala and Cuba, and has worked with Soulfari to build an orphanage in Kenya. He serves on the board of United Inner City Service and is on the steering committee of Inkubator Press at the Arts Incubator.Review- magazine.org Hugh Merrill has been a speaker at numerous conferences, including the College Art Association and The Southern Graphics Council,Southerngraphics.org of which he was president in the early 1990s.

Nelson is a professor of English at Vanderbilt University and a prominent progressive advocate for citizenship and democracy. She is notable for her criticism‚Äîin her books such as Bad for Democracy‚Äîof excessive presidential power and for exposing a tendency by Americans towards presidentialism, which she defines as the people's neglect of basic citizenship duties while hoping the president will solve most problems. Her scholarship focuses on early American literature relating to citizenship and democratic government. Academic career Nelson earned a bachelor's degree from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1984 and master's (1986) and doctoral degrees (1989) from Michigan State University. She was associate professor of English at the University of Kentucky in 1998. Nelson's The Word in Black and White: Reading \\"Race\\" in American Literature, 1638‚Äì1867 was named the \\"an Outstanding Academic Book of 1992‚Äì1993 by Choice.\\" The book explored how eleven \\"Anglo-American authors constructed 'race'\\" including a study of The Last of the Mohicans and Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, and earned positive reviews. She taught at the University of Kentucky, Duke University, the University of Washington, and Louisiana State University. In 2006, she co- edited with Russ Castronovo a collection of essays entitled Materializing Democracy: Toward a Revitalized Cultural Politics. One reviewer described the effort as an \\"ambitious, multi-disciplinary effort to make the subjective turn by warning against the danger of reducing democracy to 'an exclusively moral category that is no longer connected with political, economic, or social categories.'\\" In 2007, she wrote an essay entitled \\"Democracy in Theory\\" in the journal of American Literary History. She edited 19th century abolitionist Lydia Marie Child's A Romance of the Republic in 2003. In 2009, Dana D. Nelson is the Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt professor of English and American studies at Vanderbilt University. She teaches U.S. literature, history, and culture and courses that connect activism, volunteering, and citizenship. She has lectured at colleges such as Purdue University and the University of Kentucky. She has published numerous books, essay collections, and articles on U.S. literature and the history of citizenship and democratic culture. Nelson lives in Nashville where she is involved in a program that helps incarcerated women develop better decision-making skills and works with an innovative activist group fighting homelessness in the area. Nelson is co-editor of the academic journal J19: The Journal of Nineteenth-Century Americanists.J19 website Books, scholarship, activism In her 2008 book Bad for Democracy, Nelson criticizes presidentialism which she sees as worship of the presidency and federal politics to the exclusion of all else. She believes the presidency has become too powerful. She thinks the presidency has become a cult and is harmful for democracy. One reviewer wrote that Nelson's conception was that presidentialism was a \\"result of the American citizenry's tendency to look to the sitting president as simultaneously a unifier of the citizenry and a protector from political threats.\\" Another reviewer wrote: \\"Bad for Democracy surveys the evolving role of the president in the national psyche, and examines how presidential powers have expanded far beyond the intentions of the Constitution's framers ... Nelson combines her analysis with a plea for a return to grassroots democracy and activism.\\" Nelson explained in an interview: \\"My book argues that our habit of putting the president at the center of democracy and asking him to be its superhero works to deskill us for the work of democracy. And, it argues that the presidency itself has actually come to work against democracy.\\" She argues Americans tend to \\"super-size the presidency\\" and this is at odds with what the founding fathers might have wanted. Newspaper columnist David Sirota wrote \\"this culture of 'presidentialism,' as Vanderbilt Professor Dana Nelson calls it, has justified the Patriot Act, warrantless wiretaps and a radical theory of the unitary executive that aims to provide a jurisprudential rationale for total White House supremacy over all government.\\" Nelson advocates a grassroots effort to restore democracy. She explained in 2009: \\"We stop waiting for someone else to do it for us. We organize together, using public spaces and the internet. We form blogs, we write letters to the editor, we show up at Congress, we protest, we call, we lobby, we boycott, we buycott, we email our representatives, we find supporters, we get them moving, we grow the movement. We ignore the idea that the right president will do it for us and find every way we can to do it ourselves. Great if the president will help but totally unnecessary.\\" Nelson has spoken on National Public Radio. She wrote an opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times about the theory of the unitary executive.

Early life and education Galea was introduced to the art of magic at the age of 14. He spent most of his youth studying sleight of hand magic, practicing for eight hours a day. He also attended Marcellin College Randwick, graduating in 1998.  Career  In 1999, at age 18, Galea performed at James Packer's first wedding. That same year also saw him open his own stage show in Japan. In 2002, Galea became the Australian Close-Up Magic Champion. In 2005 and 2006, Galea headlined venues, including the famed Magic Castle in Hollywood and the Flamingo Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. On returning from the United States, Galea filmed a six-part series for the Nine Network titled Urban Magic. After a chance meeting in 2007, Galea teamed up with writer, actor, and director Nicholas Hammond to co-write the play Lying Cheating Bastard. The plot follows the story of infamous Australian con-man Jimmy Garcia (aka \\"Cricket\\"), a young man drawn into the seedy underbelly of Sydney, and how he became the most successful con-man in Australia by the age of 27. The play toured around Australia to rave reviews. In 2008, Galea premiered his one-man show I Hate Rabbits at Sydney's Enmore Theatre to a sell-out audience. The show featured in the 2009 Adelaide Fringe before heading to the Forum Theatre in Melbourne as part of the 2009 Melbourne International Comedy Festival. During the Melbourne season, Galea appeared in the nationwide broadcast of the Melbourne International Comedy Festival Gala Show and performed his award winning routine 673 King Street. The routine went viral on YouTube, receiving over 3.4 million views. He was then asked to appear on The Ellen DeGeneres Show where his performance of 673 King Street again went viral, receiving an additional 3.4 million views on YouTube. That same year, Rose Tinted Enterprises was founded by James Galea and producer Jo Dyer, who together brought their specific expertise in producing magic and comedy across all platforms. Galea and Dyer have since successfully produced magic-based television and theatre together, including Band of Magicians, I Hate Rabbits, Lying Cheating Bastard and James Galea's Best Trick Ever In 2012, Galea co- hosted the Discovery Channel series Breaking Magic (also known as Magic of Science), which \\"fused the showmanship and mystery of magic with the raw power of science\\", and was filmed on location in London, New York, and Warsaw. The series also featured Wayne Houchin, Billy Kidd, and Ben Hanlin. During a dangerous stunt gone wrong, Galea fell 50 feet onto scaffolding and the accident proved nearly fatal. In 2013, Galea teamed up with director Adam Franklin, in a partnership that would continue on future projects, to write the lyrics and music, produce, and star in the musical short film The Magician. The film, which was shortlisted for Tropfest, also features Brett Loudermilk, Peter Stickles, Bonnie Morgan, Gabe Grifoni and Beejan Land. In 2014, Galea created the magic supergroup Band of Magicians which had its world premiere at Sydney Festival. The band joined forces and performed a string of sold-out performances in Australia. The band then toured New Zealand in 2015 before heading to the Las Vegas Strip and setting up residency at Tropicana Las Vegas in 2016. Band of Magicians has featured Justin Flom, Justin Willman, Nate Staniforth, Ben Hanlin, Brett Loudermilk, Adam Mada, Joel Ward, and Stuart McLeod. In 2015, Galea began developing an animated children‚Äôs magic musical, I Wish I Was a Wizard. He wrote the music and lyrics and worked on the show with his musical collaborator Ben Palacios. In 2016, Galea filmed James Galea's Best Trick Ever for ABC which premiered in Australia in 2017 and was released internationally in 2018. The show features incredible tricks and illusions from Galea, in addition to astounding magic from those he interviews. The show pulled back the curtain on one of the world's greatest card sharks who revealed some of his most closely guarded secrets. Guests from season one included Blake Vogt, Todd Robbins, Anastasia Synn, Brett Loudermilk, Barry & Stuart, Chris Kenner, Dan & Dave Buck, Lawrence Leung, Adam Mada, Meir Yedid, DOC, and Rove McManus. In 2018, POOF - Secrets of a Magician!, for which Galea wrote the music and lyrics in 2012, is set to premiere at Melbourne Comedy Festival. The outrageous show ponders magic's big questions, including, \\"What If I Could Really Do Magic?\\", \\"Are All Magicians Gay?\\", and \\"Why All Psychics Are C&*ts\\" through magic, story, and songs by the piano.

Parish church Burdrop was part of the parish of Swalcliffe until 1841, when a new ecclesiastical parish of Sibford Gower, with Sibford Ferris and Burdrop was created. The Church of England parish church of the Holy Trinity was built in 1840 to plans by the architect H.J. Underwood. It is a cruciform Gothic Revival building that emulates an Early English Gothic style. The porch was designed by W.E. Mills and added in 1897. Public houses In 1782 Burdrop was recorded as having two pubs: the Old Inn and the Wykeham Arms. (In fact the latter is in Sibford Gower.) The earliest known record of the Bishop Blaize Inn dates from 1816. Its namesake is Saint Blaise, an early 4th-century Armenian bishop who is the patron saint of wool-combers. By the 21st century the Bishop Blaize Inn was the only pub in Burdrop still trading as such. It changed hands in 2006 and has been closed since 2007. Its owners then applied seven times for planning permission to convert the pub into a house, but Cherwell District Council declined all the applications.

Hiro talks with him, learning that he wants to kill himself because he was fired from his job due to an embarrassing incident while intoxicated at a party. Hiro decides to travel back in time to prevent Tadashi from doing so, and afterward, returns to the moment right before the phone call. However, he receives the call from Tadashi, learning that Tadashi had a similar incident at another party. Hiro travels back in time again to correct Tadashi's mistake, but upon returning, Hiro still receives the call from Tadashi. Hiro again talks with Tadashi, telling him they must each accept their fates, and that Tadashi should find another job and has so much to live for, revealing his terminal illness to him. Tadashi finally seems convinced and climbs down. Hiro decides to tell Kimiko he is dying, but during their conversation, he begins to have a headache and seems to be frozen in time. He reverts to normal, assuring Kimiko he is fine, but then vanishes right in front of her. Peter Petrelli meets with Noah, and attempts to show him the compass tattoo from the previous episode, but finds it gone. Noah tells him he doesn't want to have anything to do with it anymore. Peter understands, and leaves, and Noah is immediately after visited by Claire Bennet. Claire is concerned her father doesn't have a job, suggesting he take a position in sales, though Noah is unsure. Meanwhile, Edgar begins to doubt Samuel's plan in finding other people with abilities. Samuel then uses Lydia to find another person, though she shows him an image of Noah. Samuel asks why she's showing him as he is retired, but Lydia says that he may have changed his mind. Noah is then shown beginning to investigate the compass and his encounter with Edgar. Nathan Petrelli begins having disjointed visions of his past after Angela Petrelli gives him a box of items from his childhood in an effort to rekindle his memories and prevent Sylar's personality from emerging. One troubling memory is that of a former girlfriend, Kelly, Nathan once had, where he remembers her dead, floating in a pool with blood coming from her head. It was believed that Kelly had run away from her family, but Nathan believes otherwise and visits her mother, Millie; she happens to be the same woman Angela met with in \\"Cold Snap.\\" Millie affirms she has never heard from Kelly since, and Nathan decides to investigate the pool area. By touching the poolside bench, Nathan recalls that Kelly had slipped off the diving board and died by hitting her head against the bench. Nathan confronts Angela about this, who confirms she had died; she then says she took care of the body and made it look like she had left home, and had Nathan's mind erased by the Haitian. Angry at this, Nathan attempts to tell Millie the truth, though she doesn't appear to believe him and tells him to leave. Nathan thinks of reporting the death to the police, but is soon after knocked unconscious by a man. Millie meets with Angela and tells her about Nathan's meeting, though Angela dismisses it as Nathan being overly dramatic. Nathan is then shown being dragged to a pit, where he is shot several times, then buried. It is then revealed the man was hired by Millie, who calls her to tell her the job is done. Millie acknowledges it, smiling back at the unknowing Angela. As the man drives away, Sylar erupts from the ground, having survived by use of his healing ability. He is no longer in the form of Nathan Petrelli. Critical Reception Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club rated this episode a D-. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode 6.5 out of 10.

The episode aired on October 12, 2009. Plot Sylar crawls from his shallow grave and is picked up by the Baltimore Police after being found wandering. Police psychologist Dr. Madelyn Gibson diagnoses him with amnesia and possible aphasia. She begins working with him on his memory but the police soon identify him as murder suspect Gabriel Gray. Samuel declares to the family that a new member will be joining that day. Lydia cautions him against making promises he may not be able to keep, but Samuel trusts that the feeling in his bones will prove to be correct. Claire and Gretchen are invited by Psi Alpha Chi rush chair Becky Taylor to rush the sorority. They make a good impression and are invited back for the mixer that evening. Just before they leave for the dance, Claire discovers information about her, her past, Annie's death and the concept of murder-suicide on Gretchen's computer. At the party, Claire and another girl are almost impaled on a falling flagstaff; only Gretchen appears near enough to have dropped it. Peter tries to reconnect with Angela but is unsuccessful. On his way to work he saves Emma, disoriented by her newly manifesting abilities, from being hit by a bus and inadvertently mimics her ability. He finds her later at the hospital and explains about her ability and the two play a piano duet. He asks her to lunch the next day but she is put off when he jokes about getting her out of the file room. After the mixer Gretchen returns to her dorm room and assures Claire that she did not drop the flagstaff. Claire confronts her about the information on her computer and Gretchen kisses her, confessing that she has a crush on Claire. Moments later, the sorority sisters arrive and offer them each a bid to join the sorority. Sylar escapes from custody through an instinctive use of telekinesis and carjacks the psychiatrist. He releases her but the police are on his trail. They shoot him but he heals and flees. At the carnival Samuel and Lydia try to form a tattoo of the new member but are unsuccessful. Samuel flings a rag which stops in mid-air, leading Samuel to realize that another family member has arrived invisibly. It is Becky Taylor, who has been acting under Samuel's orders to isolate Claire. It was Becky who dropped the flagstaff and she who pushed Annie out of the dorm window. He sends her back to the college as Lydia is now able to reveal the new family member. At her apartment, Emma plays the cello. As her playing intensifies, the generated light damages the walls. At Peter's apartment, Hiro teleports in and collapses. As he runs through the woods, Sylar encounters Samuel and the carnival. With the entire carnival cloaked in the illusion of invisibility, Samuel informs Sylar that he has come home. Production \\"Hysterical Blindness\\" includes a kiss between Claire Bennett (Hayden Panettiere) and new character Gretchen Berg (Madeline Zima). Panettiere, who has acknowledged \\"experimenting\\" with female friends as a teenager, persuaded the creators to include the storyline: \\"I kinda threw it out there. The writers put you in relationships and I was like, 'Can I just be with a girl or something? Let's do that.' So they took it and ran with it.\\" Heroes had previously planned a lesbian cheerleader character in 2007, April, but the actress playing April, Lyndsy Fonseca, took a job on the ABC series Desperate Housewives after just one Heroes appearance and the part was not re- cast. NBC premiered two short films during the episode. The first, a 60-second film starring Masi Oka and directed by Milo Ventimiglia, was made in conjunction with the \\"Responsibility Project\\", an initiative of the Liberty Mutual Group to promote personal responsibility. The second advanced an interactive storyline and featured a girl with pyrokinesis. Critical reception \\"Hysterical Blindness\\" was watched by 5.6 million viewers. This represented no increase from its previous week's ratings. The episode finished fourth in its time slot, behind Dancing With the Stars on ABC, House on Fox and the sitcoms How I Met Your Mother and Accidentally On Purpose on CBS. The episode itself, however, received several positive reviews. IGN's Robert Canning gave the episode an 8.5, saying that it was reminiscent of Season 1.http://tv.ign.com/articles/103/1034471p1.html Entertainment Weekly's Marc Bernardin praised Deanne Bray as Emma and said that the episode \\"had moments of grace that gave [him] hope for Heroes' future\\".http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/10/13/heroes-recap-claire-gets-her-girl- on-and-peter-trips-the-light-fantastic/ Steve Heisler of The A.V.

Plot The blind masseur Zatoichi is hired by yakuza gang-leader Sukegoro (Eijiro Yanagi) as he thinks that war is inevitable with the rival yakuza Shigezo (Ryuzo Shimada). Zatoichi has a distinguished reputation as a swordsman and Sukegoro thinks he is money well spent. Shigezo responds by hiring a ronin of similar repute, Miki Hirate (Shigeru Amachi). Ichi is a meek and humble man who is commonly underestimated by most men, and looked upon suspiciously. His being a masseur, which was a position of low regard in feudal Japan, merely increases the hostility that is shown towards him. They even try to take advantage of his blindness in a gambling den, but from early on it is clear that Zatoichi draws strength from his disability. The only person who respects him is Hirate, who has a similar code of practice. Though Hirate and Ichi know they must fight when the war begins, they develop a kind of friendship. Hirate is eager to fight Zatoichi, as he is terminally ill with tuberculosis and considers death at the hands of a master swordsman preferable. As Hirate becomes increasingly sick, Sukegoro decides to attack Shigezo. He also tells Ichi that he is no longer needed. However, as the war begins, Shigezo informs Hirate of his fallback plan since Hirate is ill, that he intends to shoot Ichi with his rifle. Hirate drags himself from his bed to fight Zatoichi on the condition that the rifle is left behind. Ichi learns from a boy at the temple where Hirate was staying that Hirate will be fighting after all, and also learns the reason. Zatoichi travels to the battle to duel with the dying samurai. After the tense final fight, in which Zatoichi prevails, Zatoichi leaves Iioka and rejects the advances of Otane (Masayo Banri), who has become disillusioned with the yakuza lifestyle, to continue as a solitary wanderer.

It was developed and published by Konami, and released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It was released in the United States in November 1987, and was subsequently released in Europe. The game is an adaptation of Vs. Top Gun, a 1987 Nintendo VS. System arcade game also by Konami. Gameplay Top Gun is a shoot 'em up combat flight simulation game, viewed from a first-person perspective inside the cockpit of an F-14 fighter plane. The game is based on the film of the same name, and is played across four levels, each one involving the player fighting off enemy MiGs. In the second level, the player must also destroy an enemy aircraft carrier. For the final two levels respectively, the player's target is an enemy fortress and a satellite base in outer space. The player has three lives in the form of F-14 planes. The game does not include a \\"continue\\" option in the event that all three planes have been destroyed. The player has unlimited machine gun ammunition and three different types of missile, each one with their own advantages. MiGs also have their own missiles, which the player must avoid or destroy. The player is presented with onscreen information such as altitude, air speed, a radar, and a fuel gauge. Once during each level, the player can call in a tanker plane to refuel the F-14 if necessary. Refueling is done in mid-air, and the player must align the F-14 with the fuel pump. After each level, the player must successfully land the F-14 on a U.S. aircraft carrier. If the landing fails, then a plane is lost and the player must try again. Reception Top Gun sold two million copies. Eugene Lacey of Computer and Video Games praised the graphics and sound, and was surprised by \\"the level of sophistication that the designers have achieved\\" with the gameplay considering the limited number of buttons on the NES controller. Lacey called it an \\"excellent\\" flight game addition to the NES library of games. The Games Machine stated that like most NES games, Top Gun had an emphasis on playability rather than graphical presentation. The magazine described the graphics as \\"little more than a detailed cockpit and fast moving enemies,\\" but stated that the game succeeded in playability with its levels. The Games Machine added that the landing and refueling segments, as well as the necessary missile strategy, help to \\"spruce up the action.\\" Steve Jarratt of ACE praised the sound effects and wrote that Top Gun \\"is visually sparse but the sprites are extremely effective ‚Äì especially in the air-to-air combat.\\" Jarratt praised the large amount of \\"varied and entertaining\\" action, and stated that the game would appeal to fans of shoot 'em up games. German magazine Power Play criticized the gameplay, believing there was a lack of playful variety. Ulrich M√ºhl of Aktueller Software Markt praised the graphics and sound. French magazine Player One praised the graphics, stating that they were good for an NES game. Total! reviewed the game in 1993, and considered the gameplay too simplistic. The magazine stated that the levels played similarly to each other, but wrote that the landing and refueling segments added variety to the game. The magazine noted the limited number of levels and concluded, \\"While Top Gun's a fun blast, it hasn't got any lasting pull.\\" In a later review for the website AllGame, Christopher Michael Baker praised the graphics and realistic sound effects, and stated that Top Gun was arguably the best air warfare game ever released for the NES. However, Baker stated that despite the game's realism, it also offered much frustration with its difficulty. Baker cited three primary reasons for the difficulty, including the split-second decisions required in determining whether to avoid or destroy missiles, and the lack of continues. Baker also cited the landing and refueling segments, writing that they require \\"a soft touch and total concentration,\\" and that they are \\"difficult, if not impossible, to master.\\" References External links * Top Gun at MobyGames Category:Arcade games Category:Top Gun Category:Video games based on films Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Nintendo Vs.

He was born in Moscow on 13 April 1948. He was once a citizen of the United States from 1990 to 2003, but now lives in Russia. He is currently the pre-eminent singer of Russian chanson music. He was awarded the title of Meritorious Artist of Russia in 2013.  Biography  Shufutinsky was born on 13 April 1948 in Moscow. His father was Zakhar Davidovich Shufutinski, a Jewish Second World War doctor and veteran. When he was five years old, his mother died and he was then raised by his grandmother, Berta Davidovna, and his grandfather, David Yakovlevich.

He is considered to be an accomplished guitarist and has taken special interest in advancing Lester Flatt's guitar style. Among other accomplishments, Chris has been nominated twice for a Grammy Award as a guitarist and producer and has won once. Bob Piekiel's seminal banjo instruction book describes Chris as \\"the finest bluegrass rhythm guitar player in existence today.\\" Willie Nelson also considers Chris to be among \\"the cream of the crop.\\"  Early life  Around age 11, Sharp took up the fiddle and banjo. As a teenager he met George Buckner and joined his band, The Tarheel Bluegrass Boys, and in 1995 moved to Nashville with Buckner and Kevin Sluder. After two years, Sharp returned to North Carolina where he started a band called the Tipton Hill Boys.  With John Hartford  In 1997, Sharp landed a job touring with John Hartford and played guitar in the style of Lester Flatt in the John Hartford Stringband. This gig enabled Chris to play the Grand Ole Opry at the Ryman Auditorium numerous times. Chris played guitar and sang on John's 1999 album Good Old Boys and John's final album Hamilton Ironworks which was released in 2001. Chris also produced his first solo record Good Fa‚Äôair Side which featured musicians such as Earl Scruggs, Kenny Baker, Josh Graves, and John Hartford. During his time with John, Chris participated on the O Brother Where Art Thou? and Down from the Mountain projects; the soundtrack to O Brother Where Art Thou helped Chris to win a Grammy Award. The Down from the Mountain documentary, which was filmed at the Ryman Auditorium, featured Chris playing guitar and singing.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0284067/fullcredits Chris was also part of the subsequent Down from the Mountain tour which played such venues as Radio City Music Hall, Constitution Hall, Universal Amphitheatre, and Carnegie Hall.  Solo career  In 2001, after Hartford died, Sharp moved back to North Carolina. Chris joined Bobby Hicks, J.D. Crowe, and others to record on Josh Graves's album Memories of Foggy Mountain. He would later form the Chris Sharp and David Long Band. This group released an album entitled One Hand on the Radio which was described as \\"something timeless‚Äîa record that sounds 50 years old and brand-new at the same time.\\" 2003 saw the release of the Tipton Hill Boys‚Äô album Lucky whose ensemble (featuring drums, pedal steel guitar, and piano in addition to acoustic string instruments) was characterized in No Depression as reminiscent of \\"1960s Nashville bluegrass.\\" Chris played guitar and sang on Willie Nelson‚Äôs 2010 album Country Music and was featured on an episode of Soundstage as part of Willie's band. The ensuing tour allowed Chris to make a return performance at the Ryman Auditorium. Also in 2010, Chris produced and performed on the Grammy-nominated recording Memories of John which reunited the John Hartford Stringband after nearly a decade. This album featured such artists as Tim O‚ÄôBrien, Bela Fleck, George Buckner, and Alan O‚ÄôBryant as well as John Hartford himself (who was present in the form of previously-unreleased recordings).

Sapienic acid has been implicated in the development of acne, and it may have potent antibacterial activity. Delta-6-desaturation of palmitic acid leads to the biosynthesis of sapienic acid. In other tissues linoleic acid is the target for delta 6 desaturase, but linoleic acid is degraded in sebaceous cells, allowing the enzyme to desaturate palmitic to sapienic acid.

It includes a seat (often equipped with an occupant seat switch activating movement of the motorized shopping cart from the occupant's weight) thereby also making it a motorized wheelchair, and it has a rechargeable battery that can be charged by plugging in the device when not in use in order to maximize usage. Motorized shopping carts are provided by supermarkets and other large retail stores for those with permanent or temporary physical disabilities who may have difficulty walking through a large store or pushing a regular cart.Mart Carts help benefit disabled persons, The Victoria Advocate - August 8, 1993Electric shopping carts serve growing number of consumers.Electric shopping carts add convenience, Rome News-Tribune - April 15, 2002 Issues Theft While shopping cart theft has also been a costly matter for retailers, the higher cost of the motorized carts makes their theft a greater issue to the store, and thereby leads stores to establish policies prohibiting the carts from exiting stores, even though a disabled person may have the need to bring the cart all the way to their vehicle. In May 2009, a Florida man was charged with felony theft of a motorized cart due to its $2,500 value. He was caught not far from the store, riding the cart.Late-Night Joyride On Motorized Shopping Cart Lands Man In Jail , May 1, 2009 Had a non-electric cart been stolen, the theft would have been a misdemeanor. In the same month, two South Carolina men were charged with the theft of a cart, and likewise faced felony charges due to it being valued at over $2,000.2 Arrested In Shopping Cart Theft , May 12, 2009 Such thefts are rare and difficult to sustain as the carts are obviously grocery store carts, which are designed with a maximum speed of two miles per hour. Most power-operated mobility devices, such as powerchairs and scooters, have an average maximum speed of 5 miles per hour, though many are faster. The baskets and seats are of commercial strength and the wheels are much smaller than those of consumer mobility devices. Injuries There has been concern over the carts leading to injuries when used by those who do not know how to control them well. The injuries can occur to the user if they crash into an object with the cart, or to a person the user crashes into. To reduce the risk of injury, most carts have a back-up warning system similar to those found on trucks. They also are programmed with a low maximum speed of up to two miles per hour. In Louisiana in 2011, a lawsuit was filed by a woman who claimed injury while using a motorized shopping cart. The case was dismissed as the defendant filed a motion asserting that the accident and injuries were caused by the woman's own actions and she could not meet the burden of proof. The store manager immediately tested the cart after the claimed injury and further testing was done by the store mechanic and an engineer. Permission to use While motorized shopping carts are generally reserved for the disabled, most stores will take one's word for being disabled and will not challenge one's need for a cart. However, there have been cases reported in which a person with a non-visible disability has requested the use of a motorized cart, but has been denied the use by store employees who did not believe the customer had a disability. There has also been concern over minors using the carts. In January 2009, a Wal-Mart store in Tennessee did not allow an 11-year-old girl with a broken leg to use a motorized cart, despite the fact that she had been allowed by other stores to use them.

William Leidesdorff (1810‚Äì1848).Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco The grant takes its name from R√≠o de los Americanos, the name of the American River during the Mexican-rule era. The grant originally consisted of 8 square leagues and extended from the eastern border of John Sutter's New Helvetia (east of Sacramento) 4 leagues along the south bank of the American River, to the eastern end of present-day Folsom, and included present-day cities of Rancho Cordova and Folsom. Dise√±o del Rancho Rio de los Americanos History William Alexander Leidesdorff, U.S. Vice Consul at the Port of San Francisco, hired a farm manager and financed construction of four adobe dwellings on the site of today's River Bend Park, near Bradshaw Road and Folsom Blvd, in the city of Rancho Cordova. Leidesdorff died suddenly three years later, on May 18, 1848, at the age of 38. He was not married and had no family in California. He died intestate, leaving a large estate of property at the dawn of the California Gold Rush. His death came twelve days before the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War. Leidesdorff's vast estate passed to his mother, Anna Marie Spark,Also referred to as Anna Maria Spark. and surviving siblings, who resided in and were citizens of St. Croix, Danish West Indies, today's U.S. Virgin Islands.Gary Palgon, 2005, William Alexander Leidesdorff: First Black Millionaire, American Consul and California Pioneer, Lulu.com, Captain Joseph Libbey Folsom (1817‚Äì1855), a graduate of West Point had come to California in 1847 as Captain and Assistant Quartermaster of Jonathan D. Stevenson's 1st Regiment of New York Volunteers. He became the first Collector of the Port of San Francisco under American rule in 1848. Folsom was familiar with Leidesdorff's vast holdings and knew of his family in St. Croix.Tohler vs Folsom, Reports of cases determined in the Supreme Court of the State of California, 1850, Volume 1, pp 207-213, Bancroft-Whitney Company In 1849, Folsom took leave from the U.S. Army, and after stopping in New York to arrange financing, went to St. Croix, where he located some of Leidesdorff's relatives, including his mother. Anna Spark signed a note authorizing Folsom to purchase the title to her son's estate, including Leidesdorff's extensive real estate holdings in San Francisco as well as Rancho Rio de los Americanos, for $75,000, with a $5,000 down payment and the remainder to be paid in two installments.Debi Drake-Maurer, Captain Folsom: Soldier of Misfortune When Spark realized the true value of the estate, she refused to accept further payments or to give title to Folsom. Folsom hired the law firm of Halleck, Peachy & Billings to force Spark to accept the final payments. The State of California Senate in 1854 made an attempt to control the estate, contending that, because Spark was not an American citizen, among other legal questions, she could not inherit property in California, and hence could not transfer it to Folsom. In 1855, the California Supreme Court ruledPeople ex rel. Attorney- General vs. Joseph L. Folsom, Reports of cases determined in the Supreme Court of the State of California, 1855, Volume 5, pp 373-380, Bancroft-Whitney Company that Spark could inherit the properties; and therefore, the title legally passed to Folsom.Robert Ernest Cowan, 1928, The Leidesdorff-Folsom Estate: A Forgotten Chapter in the Romantic History of Early San Francisco, San Francisco:California Historical Society, 1928, 11; Meredith Eliassen,A Colored Mosaic:The Vibrant African American Community in Antebellum San Francisco, California State Library Foundation, Bulletin Number 84, pp 11-12 The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, Folsom filed a claim for the grant with the Public Land Commission in 1852. The claim was confirmed by the Commission in 1855 and the District Court in 1857.United States. District Court (California : Northern District) Land Case 359 ND Although clear title was tied up in court, Folsom continued to develop the grant. In 1854, Folsom began to sell parcels of the Rancho. He renamed the former Negro Bar townsite near the river Granite City, and had lots surveyed and sold. When Folsom died suddenly at the age of 38, in 1855, one month after the Commission confirmed his title to the grant, the town was renamed Folsom. Folsom's estate was handled by his executors, Halleck, Peachy & Billings. A survey of the grant, known as the Hays survey, was completed and approved by the Surveyor General of California. Folsom had been dead three years, when, in 1858, the Department of Interior disapproved the survey. Jacob Thompson, the Secretary of the Interior, determined that the survey did not conform to either the description of the land granted by the Mexican government, the land as shown on the Dise√±o, or to the decree of the Court. The District Court ordered a new survey, known as the Mandeville survey; but in 1852, it reversed itself and approved the original Hays survey. However, the United States appealed this ruling to the United States Supreme Court. United States v. Halleck et al, 1864, US Supreme Court, 68 US 439 In 1857 the Natoma Water and Mining Company, founded in 1851 and engaged in granite quarrying, agriculture, gold mining and hydro-electric power, purchased from the Folsom estate. Amos Parmalee Catlin appeared as counsel for the Natoma Water and Mining Company.Oscar Tully Shuck, 1888, Bench and bar in California: History, anecdotes, reminscences, The U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Hays survey valid, and the grant was patented to Joseph L. Folsom in 1864. Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 In 1862, Horatio G. Livermore acquired the Natoma Water and Mining Company and of Rancho Rio de los Americanos.
