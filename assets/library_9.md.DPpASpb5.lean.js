Background De Loughry married Winifred (Winnie) Murphy in 1911. Winifred would share her husband's political agenda, and would become President of Cumann na mBan in County Kilkenny during the Irish Revolutionary period. Leading the IRB in Kilkenny De Loughry was a committed Irish Nationalist long even before the events of the Easter Rising of 1916, which would spark a surge of support in Ireland for Nationalism in its wake. In 1912 the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), the Irish Nationalist secret society, decided to try and re-establish a chapter of its organisation in Kilkenny City, and it was de Loughry who became the primary organiser of the chapter. Irish Volunteers On 5 March 1914, a company of Irish Volunteers was established in Kilkenny City. The Irish Volunteers were a paramilitary force created in response to the creation of the Ulster Volunteers. The Ulster Volunteers were a force created to violently resist the creation of an All-Ireland Parliament in the event of Home Rule being granted to Ireland by the British Government. The Irish Volunteers, in the event the Ulster Volunteers moved to do this, would have attempted to counteract them. However, in mid-1914 there was a split in the Irish Volunteers when John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, called upon the Irish Volunteers to join the British Army and serve in World War I. This move was strongly and vocally opposed by the most radical nationalists among the Volunteers, among them the IRB. Those volunteers who followed Redmond's call took on the name National Volunteers while those who refused to join the British Army retained the name Irish Volunteers. In Kilkenny in September 1914, de Loughly approached an assembly of Volunteers and asked those who rejected Redmond to leave their ranks and join him. Thomas Treacy, who witnessed this, described the event: As demonstrated by the small numbers who switched over to de Loughry, previous to 1916 the Irish Parliamentary Party remained extremely strong in County Kilkenny, partially because the Redmond family who led the IPP were based in County Waterford, which directly borders County Kilkenny. Nonetheless, de Loughry pressed on with his radical Nationalist agenda. By 1916 those Volunteers in Kilkenny who had taken the anti-Redmond stance consolidated around de Loughry. De Loughry who ran a garage in Kilkenny city, converted part of it into a foundry and arsenal and began producing homemade grenades. The garage also meant De Loughry had easy access to vehicles, meaning he was able to provide transport and quick communication for his organisations. Easter Rising In the spring of 1916, Irish Nationalists conspired to launch a rebellion against British rule in Ireland, a plan which would eventually ferment as the Easter Rising. In the weeks directly before the rising, agents were sent to Kilkenny to make this plan known. Cathal Brugha, himself an IRB member, arrived in Kilkenny and told local Nationalists to gather arms and prepare for the arrival of J. J. \\"Ginger\\" O'Connell, who was to act as their commander. When the Easter Rising started the Kilkenny company gathered each day and was ready to act. However, in the chaos surround Easter Rising, with different counties being sent conflicting information about whether the Rising was \\"on\\" or \\"called off\\", the Kilkenny company was unsure how to proceed. Ultimately they did not attack any Royal Irish Constabulary units. Nonetheless, in the aftermath of the rising Ginger O'Connell was arrested and so was De Loughry, and over 1,000 British Army soldiers were stationed in Kilkenny. War of Independence and freeing de Valera De Loughry in the formal garb of Mayor of Kilkenny In 1919, while still in prison, de Loughry was elected Mayor of Kilkenny, an office he would retain until 1925. He was also briefly Brigade Commandant of the Irish Republican Army army units in Kilkenny until he was once again arrested by British authorities. By the start of 1919, the British had several important nationalist figures arrested and imprisoned in Lincoln Gaol, England. Among them were Se√°n Milroy, Se√°n McGarry and most prominently of all, √âamon de Valera, the emerging leader of Sinn F√©in and the nationalist movement overall. De Loughry joined them when he too was sent to the prison. A number of attempts were made to break these men out of the prison using forged keys, but all of these failed until de Loughry was asked for help. De Loughry was able to use his metalworking skills to forge a master key that was subsequently used in the successful escape of the other three from the prison, an event considered a major political and military coup for the nationalists against the British. De Loughry remained behind as his release date was just a few weeks away regardless. During the Irish Civil War, de Loughry was in favour of the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, leading him subsequently to joining Cumann na nGaedheal. Post-War Period He was elected to the Irish Free State Seanad in 1922, but lost his seat at the 1925 election. He was elected to D√°il √âireann as a Cumann na nGaedheal Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Carlow‚ÄìKilkenny constituency at the September 1927 general election. He did not contest the 1932 general election. A book about him called Peter's Key was published in 2012. The book recounts the story his involvement in the plot to free √âamon de Valera from Lincoln Gaol during the Irish War of Independence. During and after the escape from prison de Loughry remained the Mayor of Kilkenny, a position he held for six consecutive years.

A Girling hydro-mechanical braking system was fitted, with the front drums hydraulically operated while those at the rear used rod and cable. Early models of the Hurricane were fitted with a 70 bhp 1991 cc six cylinder, overhead valve engine, carried over from the pre-war 16 hp model but from 1949 this was enlarged to a 75 bhp 2309 cc by increasing the cylinder bore from 65 to 70 mm. There was a choice of four speed synchromesh or pre- selector gearbox. The four seat, two door body was made of steel and aluminium panel fitted over a wood and aluminium frame. The doors were rear hinged, an arrangement that got the name of suicide doors. Changes during the model life were minimal: however, the bonnet line was slightly lowered for 1948 when the car also acquired stoneguards on the leading edges of its rear wings.

He is the younger brother of rock star Luca Prodan, notorious for his musical career in Argentina, leading the rock band Sumo.  Biography  The Prodan family, after suffering internment in a Japanese concentration camp during World War II, was expelled from China due to Mao. Andrea's Italian father was an author and talented sportsman, and had run a prosperous business, with expertise in ancient Chinese pottery. His mother is Scottish. The family moved to Rome and Tuscany in 1948, where Andrea spent his early years. He was educated in England, and aged 12, became head chorister at The King's School, Canterbury. As solo voice he recorded \\"A Song for All Seasons\\". He started in films as a sound assistant on Krull and also on The Vatican Story, with Gregory Peck. In 1983, he dropped out of Exeter University to join his elder sister Michela on the set of Italian International Films production in Monastir, Tunisia, producing with NBC a sequel to Franco Zeffirelli's Jesus of Nazareth. A.D., an NBC miniseries, the story of the Acts of the Apostles was directed by Stuart Cooper. Andrea Prodan became (for two years), the assistant operator and interpreter for the Italian director of photography, Ennio Guarnieri. A.D. stars included Ava Gardner, James Mason, Denis Quilley and Fernando Rey. He played alongside Ava Gardner as \\"Britannicus\\". During that time he filmed a short film, in the Sahara, which won an ICA prize in 1984. He went on to work with Federico Fellini on a series of rare commercials directed by the film giant, and lit by Guarnieri. Fluent in English and Italian, Andrea Prodan pursued a career mainly in Italian films. In 1985, he appeared in Giochi d'Estate and as a co-protagonist in the film The Berlin Affair (Interno Berlinese) by Liliana Cavani. Following this he appeared in films with the Taviani brothers (Good Morning, Babylon) and Peter Greenaway (Il ventre dell'Architetto - The Belly of an Architect). In 1987, he played the role of Ettore Majorana in the film I ragazzi di via Panisperna by Gianni Amelio. There followed work with various directors such as Giuseppe Bertolucci, Guido Chiesa, and Alex and Fiorella Infascelli. In 1999 he played Karl in Ricky Tognazzi's Canone inverso. In 1991, he played the mentally disabled but handsome \\"Marco\\", who breaks up a romance between characters played by Bruno Ganz and teaming up, once again, with Ornella Muti in the third mysterious short story of La Domenica Specialmente. Muti and Prodan had become friends on the set of 'A Season of Giants', a U.S. mini-series in which he portrayed renaissance painter Raphael, and Muti his muse, Onoria. In 1995, he travelled to Argentina and with the Argentinian post-punk experimental group Las Pelotas supported The Rolling Stones in his first visit to this country in River Plate Stadium, and with Felix Valls at the console, recorded \\"Viva Voce\\", a record in which he impersonates all the instruments, using nothing but his voice. The disc received warm reviews and the musician Peter Gabriel called it his favourite record of the year. In 2001, Andrea decided to settle in Argentina. In 2005, he worked with Emmanuele Crialese in the film Nuovomondo, winner of the Leone d'Argento at the Venice Film Festival (2006). He composed the film score for two Argentinian films (El jard√≠n primitivo and Caballos en la ciudad) and for innumerable advertising spots. A series of TV commercials in which he depicts the fictitious, toothy, comic character 'Al Dentice' was aired nationwide in Italy. He lives in Buenos Aires and in C√≥rdoba, Argentina and has three children. He heads the rock band Romapagana and hosts the radio shows Metiendo P√∫a, and \\"Parcialmente Nublado\\". He is also a point of reference regarding his brother, Luca, who died in 1987. On December 31, 2009, Romapagana released their first album, which was recorded by Mariano Iezzi in CCCI Studios, Buenos Aires, Argentina. The band's second album, \\"V√≠vido\\", was released in November 2016. He directed the play 'Imarca' the same year. In 2019 he edited the record 'Freshness of Surprise' under the alter-ego of Dre Dre Bondang. 2019 also saw the birth of a musical group dedicated to the enthusiastic evocation of David Bowie's tremendously varied musical legacy, it is called 'Bowie ReMembered' and operates from Buenos Aires. Despite 2020's global 'Lockdown' Prodan enters a period of great activity, releasing his second album as Dre Dre Bondang: 'TWO', as well as recording a spate of new songs with Celina Varela and with his Supergroup: 'Bowie ReMembered'.

A dance party (also referred to as a dance) is a social gathering where dancing is the primary activity. Some dance parties are held in a casual setting and open to the public, such as a rave, or those held in nightclubs discoth√®ques. Other types of dance parties may be a formal or semi-formal private event which often require guests to don formal wear and have an invitation or membership within the community hosting the event, such as school dances and cotillions. Guests of formal dances often attend in pairs, as consorts or \\"dates\\" for one another. The term \\"stag\\" refers to going without a consort to a dance organized for couples. Dances commonly take place during the evening, although some are held earlier during the daytime; such events are known as tea dances. Dances are a way of expressing emotions, etc. Casual dances Casual dances are dances that do not have a formal dress requirement; these may include school and community events, raves, evening entertainments provided for guests aboard a cruise ship, and events organized for certain holidays, such as Halloween and Mardis Gras. Young couples at a school dance in 1950s Sweden. School dances A school dance is a dance sponsored by a school, and may be casual or formal. Casual school dances were originally limited to Western countries, although schools in other countries are beginning to adopt such events. There are some schools, such as Arlington High School in Arlington, Massachusetts, that prohibit school-hosted dances, citing sex and alcohol problems. =In the United States= One of the most significant school dances is prom, a relatively formal event normally reserved for Junior grade and Senior grade students. Some schools host a winter formal, a similar event, for the lower grades. In the 1950s, informal school dances in the United States were often called sock hops. The traditional Sadie Hawkins dance may be formal or semi-formal. Formal dances Vienna Ball in Moscow, Russia Albert Hall Canberra (circa 2016) (sepia) One type of formal dance, known as a ball, is a dance event where guests dress formally. In Western culture, a male may don white tie and a female may don a ball gown. Dinner dances are formal dances where dinner is served. Often, the style of music played at a ball is most suited to ballroom dancing. Popularity In Australia, dance parties are popular amongst teenagers, to the point that many dance parties are held specifically for teenagers in nightclubs or other locations which allow underage guests, who are usually unable to attend such places due to local laws. Ambience A rave held in a warehouse-sized venue, with elaborate lighting and powerful sound system. Dance parties are usually held at night, and may be hosted in private homes, bars, gymnasiums, nightclubs, community centers, ballrooms, or other large open spaces suitable for use as a dance floor by many people simultaneously. The music at dance parties is usually played through a PA system or a more powerful sound system, and is often supplied by a DJ who selects and plays pre-recorded songs from vinyl records, compact discs or with a laptop; however, some dance parties feature live instrumentalists or musicians playing their music live on an instrument, or with a laptop. Raves and other large, modern dance parties use visual and lighting effects, such as strobe lighting and smoke machines. Cultural milestones In the Jewish community, Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations often involve dances. Dances are common for Quincea√±eras, sweet sixteen parties and d√©butante celebrations. Some of these coming of age events involve a father-daughter dance. At wedding receptions, the newlywed couple may opt to have a first dance (before all guests are invited to participate on the dance floor). A dance party that is gaining popularity is the Bollywood dance party, featuring music from Hindi cinema from India. A popular dance party that demonstrates this style of music and dance combination is produced by Wicked Karma that is produced by Christie Sanam and DJ RDX Nurai, a nightclub in Beirut hosted a party event on the 28th August 2017 and by August 30, 2017 it broke the Guinness World Record for hosting a 56-hour long party to show that \\"it is the best party city in the world!\\" Specialized events Some dance events may put an emphasis on certain genres of dance. For example, an event may feature swing or square dancing rather than dancing in general. A masked ball is a type of costume party that features dancing. Dance parties at which people mainly dance Tango are called Milongas.

Ellwood Oil Fields, sources of the seeps Tar balls at the beach, Coal Oil Point, looking WNW. This was an unusually heavy accumulation, in June 2003. Inset shows oily sheen from fresh tar balls. The Coal Oil Point seep field (COP) in the Santa Barbara Channel offshore from Goleta, California, is a marine petroleum seep area of about three square kilometres, within the Offshore South Ellwood Oil Field and stretching from the coastline southward more than . Major seeps are located in water depths from 20 to 80 meters. The seep field is among the largest and best studied areas of active marine seepage in the world. These perennial and continuous oil and gas seeps have been active on the northern edge of the Santa Barbara Channel for at least 500,000 years. The combined seeps in the field release about 40 tons of methane per day and about 19 tons of reactive organic gas (ethane, propane, butane and higher hydrocarbons); about twice the hydrocarbon air pollution released by all the cars and trucks in Santa Barbara County in 1990.J. Scott Hornafius, D. Quigley and B, P, Luyendyk, \\"The world's most spectacular marine hydrocarbon seeps (Coal Oil Point, California): quantification of emissions,\\" Journal of Geophysical Research, v.104, n.C9, 15 September 1999, p.20,709 The liquid petroleum produces a slick that is many kilometres long and when degraded by evaporation and weathering, produces tar balls which wash up on the beaches for miles around.UCSB Hydrocarbon Seeps project This seep also releases on the order of of liquid petroleum per day. The field produces about 9 cubic meters of natural gas per barrel of petroleum. Leakage from the natural seeps near Platform Holly, the production platform for the South Ellwood Offshore oilfield, has decreased substantially, probably from the decrease in reservoir pressure due to the oil and gas produced at the platform. History Written records, dating from as early as 1792, describe effects of offshore seeps in the Santa Barbara Channel. Oil and tar \\"slicks\\" have long been a trademark of the area. In 1792, Captain Cook's navigator George Vancouver recorded on passing through the channel: :The surface of the sea, which was perfectly smooth and tranquil, was covered with a thick, slimy substance, which when separated or disturbed by a little agitation, became very luminous, whilst the light breeze, which came principally from the shore, brought with it a strong smell of tar, or some such resinous substance.US Geological Survey Professional Paper 679, 1969, Geology, Petroleum Development, and Seismicity of the Santa Barbara Channel Region, California. Full text and maps online It had been commonly assumed that the local Chumash Native Americans used COP seep oil washed up on the beaches to seal their plank canoes and baskets. However, archaeologists assert that the mainland Chumash in fact used asphalt from nearby onshore seeps in beach cliffs. These seeps must be sourced from a similar subsurface reservoir system, but exposure to oxidation is required to make the material hard and useful. In February 2019, a rare hoodwinker sunfish (Mola tecta) washed ashore on Sands Beach in the Coal Oil Point Reserve.  Scientific Investigations  The location of the COP seep field offshore from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) has situated it as a natural laboratory for study of the phenomena of oil and gas introduced into the ocean from the sea bed, along with the role of geologic methane from seeps worldwide in the global methane budget. Since the 1990s almost a dozen UCSB researchers along with their graduate students have studied the geology, chemistry, oceanography and ecology of the marine seep system at COP. Many of these studies were in partnership with oil companies including Mobil and Venoco, which produced oil from reservoirs below the seeps, and the U.S. Geological Survey and California State Lands Commission. = Mapping and quantification of discharge = The marine hydrocarbon seep system comprises a seabed source (vent) of oil and gas bubbles coated with oil, that transit the shallow water column while partially dissolving into the ocean. At the surface, various gases are discharged to the atmosphere and the oil volatilizes as it is transported by currents, leaving a tarry residue at the sea surface. At the sea surface the seeps are marked by oil slicks, and in places, bubble froth. Since the 1970s and later, oil slicks from COP and others in the Santa Barbara Channel have been successfully mapped by remote sensing. Because the COP seeps are characterized by large visible gas bubble plumes they can be detected and mapped by sonar backscatter. The first attempts at this were made by Peter Fischer and colleagues of California State University, Northridge in the early 1970s. They produced reconnaissance level maps of bubble plumes at COP and at other locations in the Santa Barbara Channel. They noted that because the COP seeps were associated with a producing oil platform then operated by ARCO, continued oil production might result in a decrease in volume of seep discharge. Scott Hornafius and Bruce Luyendyk, along with graduate student Derek Quigley made sonar surveys of the COP field two decades later using 50 kHz sonar and 3.5 kHz sonar equipment that matched that used by Fischer and colleagues. They calibrated the sonar data with seafloor artificial sources to estimate the volume of gas discharge cited above. Using an estimate of the gas/oil ratio along with capture of oil with a floating boom, they also estimated the volume of oil discharge (above). Comparing the surveys made in the mid 1990s with the early 1970s data of Fischer and colleagues they determined that seepage near the producing platform Holly had decreased by half. This observation was supported by gas capture data recorded by two sea floor tent structures that covered one large seepage area. Surveys continued over the 1990s and 2000s using more sophisticated sonars including chirp and multibeam sonars. These repeat sonar surveys did not detect further decrease in seepage, while during the same period oil production continued.

Clan Walkinshaw is a Scottish clan. It does not have a chief recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms therefore the clan has no standing under Scots Law. Clan Walkinshaw is considered an armigerous clan, meaning that it is considered to have had at one time a chief who possessed the chiefly arms, however no one at present is in possession of such arms. The surname Walkinshaw is a habitational name derived from Walkinshaw in Renfrewshire. The name probably originates from the Old English elements wealcere \\"fuller\\" and sceaga \\"copse\\". Clan Walkinshaw descends from a Douglas who was a judge in the earldom of Lennox. In 1235 he made over his lands of Knock, and the Abbey of Paisley, for the lands of Walkinshaw. Members of the clan became hereditary foresters to the High Stewards of Scotland in the barony of Renfrew. The arms of Walkinshaw allude to this office of hereditary forester. The clan's lands were in possession of the principal family until they passed through an heiress to the Walkinshaws of Little Fulwood, and then later to the Walkinshaws of Garturk who subsequently styled themselves as \\"of that Ilk\\". Other cadet branches of Clan Walkinshaw were the Walkinshaws of Burrowfield and of Scotston. Today members of Clan Walkinshaw may wear a crest badge based upon the heraldry in the arms of Walkinshaw of that Ilk. The crest within the crest badge is a martlet, and the motto is IN SEASON.

The US Forest Service leases office space to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's (CAL FIRE) Fresno/Kings Unit. In 1994, it was completely rebuilt to become a model modern AirTanker Base which includes a modern interagency communication/command center. Fresno Air Base The Fresno Air Base responds to an average of 100 calls per year in its immediate response area which spans from the California-Nevada border to the east, Interstate 5 to the west, Merced River to the north, and Fresno-Tulare county lines to the south. On average, the base pumps about 500,000 gallons of retardant a year. With the base‚Äôs pumps, four loading pits, plus one maintenance or auxiliary pit (in a major event can be used as a loading pit), Fresno has a possible peak output of 300,000 gallons of retardant each day. The Air base is also approved for the Modular Airborne FireFighting System (MAFFS) with a maxminum of 6 aircraft. there is sufficient aircraft parking for up to 8 aircraft at a time. The Airbase is owned by the US Forest Service which permanently staffs the base with a forest aviation officer (Division Chief), air base manager (battalion chief), assistant base manager(Captain) and a seasonal staff which is a combination of either three Seasonal or regular fire fighters. The US Forest service has one Air Attack Aircraft (AA15) a Rockwell Aero Commander 690A and one type 1 or one type 2 Airtanker which is only Administered by the base. In July 2012 The CAL FIRE Fresno-Kings Unit withdraw both personnel and aircraft from the FAAB. CAL FIRE will still use the base for the reloading of Fire aircraft and for refueling of those aircraft has needed. before the start of the 2012 fire season CAL FIRE lease office space and the right to use the base in an emergency and had a permanent Staff of a unit air officer (battalion chief), air base Manager (fire captain) and a seasonal staff of one Assistant air base manager (fire apparatus engineer (FAE)), and three firefighters. The Former CAL FIRE aircraft assigned to Fresno included one North American Rockwell OV-10A Bronco Air Attack (AA430) which has been relocated to McClellan Reload base to act as a statewide spare Air attack aircraft. The one Grumman Marsh S-2F3AT Turbo Tracker airtanker(T78) was relocated to Porterville. Fresno Emergency Communication/Command Center The Fresno Emergency Communication/Command Center (ECC) is an interagency communication and command center that is located at the Fresno Air Attack Base. It is jointly operated by the US Forest Service (Sierra NF Emergency Communication Center) and CAL FIRE (Fresno/Kings Unit Emergency Command Center). The US Forest Service uses the emergency Communication center (ECC) for the Sierra NF and the US Fish & Wildlife Service San Luis National Wildlife Refuge Complex. CAL FIRE uses the Emergency Command Center (ECC) for its Fresno/Kings Unit, Fresno County Fire, Fowler City, Laton Volunteer Fire Department, Riverdale Public Utilities District, Orange Cove Fire, Auberry Volunteer Fire, Bald Mountain Fire, Shaver Lake Volunteer Fire, Huntington Lake Volunteer Fire, Big Creek Volunteer Fire, Mountain Valley Volunteer Fire, Pine Ridge Volunteers, and Pleasant Valley State Prison Fire Department. They also have contracts for fire protection within the Cities of Mendota, Huron, and Parlier. The ECC used to provide consolidated Regional Fire Dispatch Services to the Fresno Fire Department between 1995-2000. Along with these departments, they are also the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services (OES) coordination center for the Fresno County Operational Area, and OES Region V which covers Fresno, Kings, Kern, Tulare, Madera, Merced, and Mariposa Counties. As the coordination center, the personnel are tasked through the chain of command by the Governor to request local government support for major incidents throughout the state, and even the country if needed.

In 2011, the Golden League and two others consolidated to form the North American League, but the Cimarrones did not participate in that league. The Tijuana Embajadores was a proposed team from Tijuana that had at one time been scheduled to participate in the North American League (NAL), but that team also failed to start the season with the NAL. History Former Mexican League logo =Liga Mexicana de Beisbol= The team was originally known as the Tijuana Potros. Los Potros de Tijuana (Spanish for Tijuana Colts) originally played in the Liga Mexicana de B√©isbol (Mexican Baseball League). They played their home games at Estadio Nacional de Tijuana (Tijuana National Stadium) from 2005 to 2008. The franchise started as a Double-A team that played until 1991 when they folded. This team actually was a descendant of the Triple-A Los Toros de Tijuana (Tijuana Toros) before the Mexican League reportedly to have stripped the Toros owner of his franchise and gave it to new owners who renamed that team the Tijuana Potros after the original Double-A team that folded in 1991. The Toros ownership kept the team name, logo, uniforms and history as a result of the alleged political wrangling that went on in that league.Baseball Posse: Tijuana Toros (2004) GBL Logo =Golden Baseball League= The Golden Baseball League had originally planned on bringing the Tijuana Toros in as one of the charter teams, but that plan was dropped as a stadium agreement could not be reached between the Toros and Estadio Nacional de Tijuana. They had been playing in the Mexican League since 2005, but on December 15, 2008, the GBL signed a letter of intent to bring an expansion franchise to Tijuana after the 2008 Mexican League franchise was disbanded and relocated to Reynosa, Tamaulipas.Termina ayuno beisbolero Hitazos.com, 2007GBL South of the Border! GBL website, December 15, 2008 On January 13, 2009, the league officially welcome the Potros. They would join fellow expansion teams, the Tucson Toros and Victoria Seals. On May 7, 2009, the GBL announced the postponement of the Potros' inaugural season until 2010 due to Mexico's swine flu outbreak and the subsequent health risk and precautionary measures that resulted from it.Tijuana on Hold for '09, GBL website, May 8, 2009 =Name change= There were rumors floating around that the team is now being called the \\"Tijuana Cimarrones\\".http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3953254 These rumors were confirmed with the launching of the team's website, which was subsequently taken down. \\"Cimarrones\\" is not Spanish for \\"rams\\" (that would be \\"carneros\\"). A \\"cimarron\\" may be many things - a wild or un-tamed animal; a rough or uncouth individual; a runaway slave (in Cuba & Latin America - see \\"El Ultimo Cimarron\\" by Miguel Barnet); or a fruit-topped snow cone (in Sonora, MX). In the Old West (late 19th century western US) the Spanish word \\"cimarron\\" was used to describe a wild horse, wild cowboy- drifter, or a renegade Indian (i.e. Native American). Since the team is probably not named for snow cones or runaway slaves - and was formerly known as Los Potros (The Colts) - the most suitable translation would seem to be \\"The Wild Horses\\" or \\"The Wild Bunch.\\" The 2010 Golden Baseball League schedule had the team listed as the \\"Cimarrones.\\" Due to not being able to maintain financial obligations with the stadium, the league took over the team and they played their remaining home games at the Ray Kroc Baseball Complex in Yuma, Arizona. After the season ended, the team became inactive. There is some hope that the team could wind up being a team in the Arizona Winter League.

Kennedy was mortally wounded shortly after midnight at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Earlier that evening, the 42-year-old junior senator from New York was declared the winner in the South Dakota and California 1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries during the 1968 United States presidential election. He was pronounced dead at 1:44 a.m. PDT on June 6, about 26 hours after he had been shot. Following dual victories in the California and South Dakota primary elections for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States, Senator Kennedy spoke to journalists and campaign workers at a live televised celebration from the stage of his headquarters at the Ambassador Hotel. Shortly after leaving the podium and exiting through a kitchen hallway, he was mortally wounded by multiple shots fired from a handgun. Kennedy died in the Good Samaritan Hospital 26 hours later. The shooter was 24-year-old Sirhan Sirhan. In 1969, Sirhan was convicted of murdering the senator and sentenced to death. His sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1972. A freelance newspaper reporter recorded the shooting on audio tape, and the aftermath was captured on film. Kennedy's remains were taken to St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York for two days of public viewing before a funeral Mass was held on June 8. His funeral train traveled from New York to Washington, D.C., and throngs of spectators lined the route to view the journey. His body was interred at night in Arlington National Cemetery near his brother John. His death prompted the United States Secret Service to protect presidential candidates. Vice President Hubert Humphrey was also a presidential candidate; he went on to win the Democratic nomination but ultimately lost the election to Republican candidate Richard Nixon. Much like his brother's assassination, Robert Kennedy's assassination has led to a number of conspiracy theories; to date, no credible evidence has emerged that Sirhan was not the shooter, or that he did not act alone. Kennedy and Huey Long of Louisiana (in 1935) are the only two sitting United States Senators to be assassinated. Life Robert Kennedy campaigns in Los Angeles, 1968 (photo by Evan Freed) Kennedy was 22 years old in 1948 when he visited the British Mandate of Palestine and wrote dispatches for The Boston Post about the trip and its effect on him. During his stay, he wrote that he grew to admire the Jewish inhabitants of the area, and he became a strong supporter and advocate for Israel when he became a Senator. Appointed United States Attorney General in December 1960 by his brother, President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, he served in that post from January 1961 until his resignation on September 3, 1964, in order to run for election to the United States Senate. Opposing incumbent Republican Kenneth Keating, his first attempt at elective office scored a tight race win in an otherwise landslide Democratic Party year. He took office as Senator from New York on January 3, 1965. The run-up to the 1968 presidential election under President Lyndon B. Johnson was a period of great social unrest. There were riots in major cities amid Johnson's attempts to introduce anti-poverty and anti-discrimination legislation, and there was significant opposition to the ongoing Vietnam War. The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968, led to further riots in several cities. Kennedy entered the race for the Democratic Party's nomination for president on March 16, four days after Senator Eugene McCarthy received a large percentage of the vote in the New Hampshire primary against the incumbent President (42 percent to Johnson's 49 percent). Two weeks later, President Johnson announced that he was no longer seeking re-election, and Vice President Hubert Humphrey announced that he would seek the presidency a month later. Humphrey did not participate in any primaries, but he did obtain the support of many Democratic Party delegates. Following the California primary, Kennedy was in second place with 393 delegates compared to Humphrey's 561 and McCarthy's 258. Assassination Kennedy addressing supporters in the Embassy Ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel The 1968 California presidential primary elections were held on Tuesday, June 4\\\\. The statewide results gave Kennedy 46 percent and McCarthy 42 percent. Four hours after the polls closed in California, Kennedy claimed victory in the state's Democratic presidential primary. He spoke by phone with South Dakota Senator George McGovern. At approximately 12:10 a.m. PDT on June 5, he addressed his campaign supporters in the Ambassador Hotel's Embassy Room ballroom in the Mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles. At the time, the government provided Secret Service protection for an incumbent president, but not for presidential candidates. Kennedy's only security was provided by former FBI agent William Barry and two unofficial bodyguards: Olympic decathlon gold medalist Rafer Johnson and former football player Rosey Grier. Kennedy had welcomed contact with the public during the campaign, and people had often tried to touch him in their excitement. Kennedy planned to walk through the ballroom when he had finished speaking. He ended the speech by stating: \\"My thanks to all of you; and now it's on to Chicago, and let's win there!\\" He was on his way to another gathering of supporters elsewhere in the hotel. Reporters wanted a press conference, and campaign aide Fred Dutton decided that Kennedy would forgo the second gathering and instead go through the hotel's kitchen and pantry area behind the ballroom to the press area. Kennedy finished speaking and started to exit when William Barry stopped him and said, \\"No, it's been changed. We're going this way.\\" Barry and Dutton began clearing a way for Kennedy to go left through swinging doors to the kitchen corridor, but Kennedy was hemmed in by the crowd and followed ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel Karl Uecker through a back exit. Uecker led Kennedy through the kitchen area, holding his right wrist, but frequently releasing it as Kennedy shook hands with people whom he encountered. Uecker and Kennedy started down a passageway narrowed by an ice machine against the right wall and a steam table to the left. Kennedy turned to his left and shook hands with busboy Juan Romero, just as Sirhan Sirhan stepped down from a low tray-stacker beside the ice machine, rushed past Uecker, and repeatedly fired an eight-shot .22 Long Rifle caliber Iver Johnson Cadet 55-A revolver. Kennedy fell to the floor, and bodyguard William Barry hit Sirhan twice in the face while others, including writer George Plimpton and Grier, forced him against the steam table and disarmed him, as he continued firing his gun in random directions. Five other people were wounded: William Weisel of ABC News, Paul Schrade of the United Automobile Workers union, Democratic Party activist Elizabeth Evans, Ira Goldstein of the Continental News Service, and Kennedy campaign volunteer Irwin Stroll. After a minute, Sirhan wrestled free and grabbed the revolver again, but he had already fired all the bullets and was subdued. Barry went to Kennedy and placed his jacket under the candidate's head, later recalling: \\"I knew immediately it was a .22, a small caliber, so I hoped it wouldn't be so bad, but then I saw the hole in the Senator's head, and I knew\\". Reporters and photographers rushed into the area from both directions, contributing to the confusion and chaos. As Kennedy lay wounded, Juan Romero cradled his head and placed a rosary in his hand. Kennedy asked Romero, \\"Is everybody OK?\\" and Romero responded, \\"Yes, everybody's OK.\\" Kennedy then turned away and said, \\"Everything's going to be OK.\\" This moment was captured by Life photographer Bill Eppridge and Boris Yaro of the Los Angeles Times and became the iconic image of the assassination. There was some initial confusion concerning who was shot, one witness believing that the primary victim was Kennedy's campaign manager and brother-in-law Stephen Edward Smith. Another witness stated that a female in a polka-dot dress had exclaimed repeatedly, \\"We killed him,\\" before running away. Video footage of the witness's testimony can be seen in the Netflix series Bobby Kennedy for President. Kennedy's wife Ethel was three months pregnant; she stood outside the crush of people at the scene seeking help. She was soon led to her husband and knelt beside him. He turned his head and seemed to recognize her. Smith promptly appeared on television and calmly asked for a doctor. Friend and journalist Pete Hamill recalled that Kennedy had \\"a kind of sweet accepting smile on his face, as if he knew it would all end this way\\". After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, \\"Don't lift me\\", which were his last words, as he lost consciousness shortly after. He was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital, where he arrived near death. One doctor slapped his face, calling, \\"Bob, Bob\\", while another doctor manually massaged his heart. After obtaining a good heartbeat, doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so that she could hear his heart beating. After about 30 minutes, Kennedy was transferred several blocks to the Hospital of the Good Samaritan to undergo surgery. A gymnasium near the hospital was set up as temporary headquarters for the press and news media to receive updates on his condition. Surgery began at 3:12 a.m. and lasted three hours and 40 minutes. At 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, spokesman Frank Mankiewicz announced that Kennedy's doctors were \\"concerned over his continuing failure to show improvement\\"; his condition remained \\"extremely critical as to life\\". Kennedy had been shot three times. One bullet was fired at a range of perhaps and entered behind his right ear, dispersing fragments throughout his brain. The other two entered at the rear of his right armpit; one exited from his chest and the other lodged in the back of his neck. Despite extensive neurosurgery to remove the bullet and bone fragments from his brain, he was pronounced dead at 1:44 a.m. on June 6, nearly 26 hours after the shooting. Frank Mankiewicz left the hospital and walked to the gymnasium where the press and news media were set up for continuous updates on the situation. At 2 a.m. on June 6, Mankiewicz approached the podium, took a few moments to compose himself, and made the official announcement: Perpetrator The assassin, Sirhan Sirhan Sirhan Sirhan (born March 19, 1944) is a Palestinian Arab with Jordanian citizenship, born in Jerusalem, who held strongly anti-Zionist beliefs. A diary was found during a search of his home, and he wrote on May 19: \\"My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more and more of an unshakable obsession. RFK must die. RFK must be killed. Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated.... Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated before 5 June 68.\\"Edward Sanders, America: A History in Verse, Volume 3 1962‚Äì1970, page 267 (Black Sparrow Books, 2004) It has been suggested that the date of the assassination is significant because it was the first anniversary of the start of the Six-Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbors. When Sirhan was booked by police, they found a newspaper article in his pocket that discussed Kennedy's support for Israel; Sirhan testified at his trial that he began to hate Kennedy after learning of this support. In 1989, he told David Frost in prison: \\"My only connection with Robert Kennedy was his sole support of Israel and his deliberate attempt to send those 50 bombers to Israel to obviously do harm to the Palestinians\\". Some scholars view the assassination as one of the first major incidents of political violence in the United States stemming from the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict in the Middle East. The interpretation that Sirhan was motivated by Middle Eastern politics has been criticized as an oversimplification which ignores his psychological problems. Sirhan's lawyers attempted to use a defense of diminished responsibility during the trial, while Sirhan himself tried to confess to the crime and change his plea to guilty on several occasions. He testified that he had killed Kennedy \\"with 20 years of malice aforethought\\". The judge did not accept this confession and it was later withdrawn. Sirhan was convicted of the murder of Robert Kennedy on April 17, 1969, and was sentenced six days later, to death. In 1972, the sentence was commuted to life in prison with the possibility of parole after the California Supreme Court invalidated all pending death sentences that were imposed prior to 1972, due to its ruling in California v. Anderson. Since that time, Sirhan has been denied parole 15 times and is currently confined at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in southern San Diego County. His lawyers have claimed that he was framed, and he claims to have no memory of his crime. =Assassin's gun= The Iver Johnson .22 caliber revolver that Sirhan Sirhan used to assassinate Robert F. Kennedy originated from Albert Leslie Hertz, a resident of Alhambra just south of Pasadena, California. He originally bought the gun to protect his own business during the 1965 Watts riots, but never used it and kept it in its original wrapping paper and box. Hertz's wife decided the gun was too dangerous and gave it to her daughter, Dana Westlake. Westlake did not use it and gave the gun to her next-door neighbor, George Erhard. Erhard later sold the gun to Sirhan Sirhan's brother, Munir Bishara Sirhan, known as \\"Joe\\", who George knew was working at Nash's department store at the corner of Arroyo and Colorado in Pasadena. At the time, Erhard was looking to seek more money from the gun sale to finance some work on his car. In the interview with the Los Angeles Police Department, Munir said that his brother asked him to obtain a gun because he wanted to visit a rifle range. Munir explained to them that rifle ranges rented guns, in which Sirhan replied \\"I don't want to get involved. I don't want a signature.\\" Sirhan later asked him if he knew any gun owners, and Munir told investigators that \\"I don't know why my brother wanted it, you know, wanted anything to do with guns.\\" This request was because Sirhan was a non-citizen; it was illegal under California law for an alien to purchase firearms. Munir later approached Erhard in the parking lot of Nash's store and Erhard showed him the pistol. At this point, Munir said that he asked Erhard to bring the gun to Sirhan's house, since his brother was interested in buying it. He stated that he and Erhard went to Sirhan Sirhan's home and met him at the dining room, where the three agreed to a sale price: Munir produced $19 and Sirhan paid the $6 balance. However, the LAPD Summary Report stated that: It is likely that Munir and Sirhan purchased the gun in such a clandestine manner because they were both aware that it was unlawful for aliens to own handguns. Sirhan first shot the gun in March 1968 and practiced with it about a half dozen times between March and May 1968. He said he \\"liked guns.\\"' Munir said Sirhan kept the gun in the glove compartment of his De Soto. Munir often heard Sirhan playing with something that made a \\"click, click\\" sound, and he believed it was the gun.\\" Munir had been \\"frightened\\" by the look in Sirhan's eye when his brother handled the gun. In fact Munir was so worried he made Sirhan swear on their dead sister, Aida, that he would not use the gun in a \\"bad\\" way. Sirhan had violated three California laws merely by possessing the pistol he used to kill Robert Kennedy. Thus, if Sirhan were simply an unwitting patsy involved in a conspiracy, the conspirators must have knowingly chosen a man who had been risking the whole conspiratorial venture by possessing an illegal weapon and firing it at a police range. Had Sirhan been caught with the illegal weapon, the purported conspiracy would have collapsed. Media coverage At the time of the shooting, NBC and ABC News were signing off from their electoral broadcasts, while the CBS coverage had already concluded. CBS coverage began 21 minutes after the shooting with Joseph Benti, then preparing his anchoring duties for The CBS Morning News, from the election studio at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York; Walter Cronkite joined him a half hour later. Mike Wallace had co-anchored the primary election coverage with Cronkite and Benti, and he appeared briefly after the shooting. CBS reporters Terry Drinkwater and David Schumacher delivered on-camera updates and interviews from the Ambassador; colleagues Roger Mudd and John Hart phoned in reports to New York. Later, Mudd presented on-camera updates on Kennedy's condition from Good Samaritan Hospital. At ABC, Howard K. Smith signed off and the closing billboard aired followed by a wide studio shot of Smith, co-anchor Bill Lawrence, and staff with the graphic \\"Race to the White House: California Primary\\" on screen (accompanied by the John Philip Sousa march The Thunderer as theme music). When the theme completed, after a moment of silence and a \\"please stand by\\" announcement, a portion of the theme was played again. Announcer Carl Caruso then alerted viewers to \\"please stand by for a special report,\\" with the wide shot and graphic still on air, as the theme played a third time. During the long static shot, the ABC camera captured live the panic and bewilderment in the New York studio. Two and a half minutes more passed before Smith returned to air to say, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, we have kept the air on because we have heard an alarming report that Robert Kennedy was shot in that ballroom at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.\\" Smith would clarify that word was received about the sound of gunfire a short time earlier, but they had waited to receive additional confirmation about what happened before making any announcements. Meanwhile, the ABC reporters at the Ambassador crowded into the kitchen where Kennedy had been shot and the immediate aftermath was captured only by audio recording and cameras that had no live transmission capability. ABC was able to show scant live footage from the kitchen after Kennedy had been transported, but all of ABC's coverage from the Ambassador was in black and white. One of the ABC reporters at the Ambassador was Bob Clark, who had also reported from Dallas on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Clark and Marlene Sanders later reported from Good Samaritan Hospital. At about 7:00 a.m. EST, Frank Reynolds joined Smith at the New York anchor desk, with additional contributions by Roger Grimsby, newly transferred to ABC's flagship station WABC-TV and science editor Jules Bergman. Sam Donaldson contributed reports from the ABC bureau in Washington. NBC was also about to sign off in New York when anchor Frank McGee received a telephone call on camera, apparently informing him of the shooting. A visibly stunned McGee spent the next few minutes filling time until he was ready to inform viewers that Kennedy had been shot. NBC reporter Charles Quinn was one of the first to report from the scene of the shooting, telling viewers, \\"He's lying here on the floor. Senator Kennedy has been shot. He's been shot. There's blood on the floor.\\" Quinn and colleague Lew Allison gave updates and conducted interviews from the hotel ballroom and lobby; Sander Vanocur reported from a temporary studio in the hotel, interviewing eyewitnesses and others involved in events surrounding the shooting. NBC anchors Chet Huntley and David Brinkley had co- anchored the primary coverage with McGee, and they returned to the Burbank anchor desk at about 4:15 a.m. EST. Jack Perkins reported for NBC from Good Samaritan Hospital. CBS and NBC shot footage in the kitchen of the shooting's aftermath on color film, which could not be broadcast until it was developed two hours after the incident. Mutual News was among the first to broadcast a report from the assassination location, because reporter Andrew West of KRKD, a Mutual Broadcasting System radio affiliate in Los Angeles, captured on audio tape the sounds of the immediate aftermath of the shooting but not the actual shooting itself, using his reel-to-reel tape recorder and attached microphone. He had just recorded Kennedy's victory speech from the podium, and he followed Kennedy and his entourage to the kitchen pantry. West turned his recorder on again seconds after Kennedy was shot and started reporting the developments. Several seconds later, West gave an on-the-spot account of the struggle with Sirhan in the hotel kitchen pantry, shouting at Rafer Johnson to \\"Get the gun, Rafer, get the gun!\\" and telling others to \\"get a hold of his thumb and break it, if you have to! Get his thumb! Hold him, hold him! We don't want another Oswald!\\". Reporter West finished his audio recording, went to a telephone, connected his tape recorder, and called Mutual West in San Francisco, co- located with radio stations KKHI-AM-FM. Producer John Hawkins had shut down KKHI/Mutual West operations at midnight and was heading out the door, but answered the unexpected call. Hawkins recalls West screaming \\"roll a tape, Kennedy's been shot, roll a tape.\\" Hawkins recorded as West spoke a live introduction then played his tape. Hawkins sent the complete recording to Mutual's New York headquarters over a dedicated line. Soon after, Mutual News broadcast Andrew West's dramatic report to all radio stations which were monitoring for Mutual News bulletins overnight. As additional Mutual News stations returned to the air or resumed newscasts (often at 6:00AM) West's report was widely broadcast, and picked up by other stations and networks. KKHI radio could have been the first to broadcast West's report just after midnight, but it was already off the air until 6:00AM (KKHI-AM-FM were classical music stations). Los Angeles CBS radio affiliate KNX (AM) interrupted its rundown of local primary returns to provide coverage of the shooting. KNX also simulcast coverage from KNXT-TV (now KCBS-TV) with anchor Jerry Dunphy, which was also fed nationwide on the CBS Radio Network in the initial hours after the shooting. Over the following week, NBC devoted 55 hours to the shooting and aftermath, ABC 43, and CBS 42, with all three networks preempting their regular coverage and advertisements to cover the story. Conspiracy theories As with the 1963 assassination of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's death has been the subject of widespread analysis. Some individuals involved in the original investigation and some researchers have suggested alternative scenarios for the crime, or have argued that there are serious problems with the official case. =CIA involvement theory= In November 2006, the BBC's Newsnight program presented research by filmmaker Shane O'Sullivan alleging that several CIA officers were present on the night of the assassination. Three men who appear in films and photographs from the night of the assassination were positively identified by former colleagues and associates as former senior CIA officers who had worked together in 1963 at JMWAVE, the CIA's main anti-Castro station based in Miami. They were JMWAVE Chief of Operations David Morales, Chief of Maritime Operations Gordon Campbell and Chief of Psychological Warfare Operations George Joannides. However, several people who had known Morales, including family members, were adamant that he was not the man who O'Sullivan said was Morales. After O'Sullivan published his book, assassination researchers Jefferson Morley and David Talbot also discovered that Campbell had died of a heart attack in 1962, six years prior to the assassination of Kennedy. In response, O'Sullivan stated that the man on the video may have used Campbell's name as an alias. He then took his identifications to the Los Angeles Police Department whose files showed the men he identified as Campbell and Joannides to be Michael Roman and Frank Owens, two Bulova sales managers attending the company's convention in the Ambassador. O'Sullivan stood by his allegations stating that the Bulova watch company was a \\"well-known CIA cover\\". =Second gunman theory= The location of Kennedy's wounds suggested that his assailant had stood behind him, because some witnesses assert that Sirhan faced west as Kennedy moved through the pantry facing east. This has led to the suggestion that a second gunman actually fired the fatal shot, a possibility supported by Chief Medical Examiner and Coroner for the County of Los Angeles Thomas Noguchi who stated that the fatal shot was behind Kennedy's right ear and had been fired at a distance of approximately one inch. Other witnesses, though, said that Kennedy was turning to his left shaking hands as Sirhan approached, facing north and so exposing his right side. During a re-examination of the case in 1975, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered expert examination of the possibility of a second gun having been used, and the conclusion of the experts was that there was little or no evidence to support this theory. As recently as 2008, eyewitness John Pilger asserted his belief that there must have been a second gunman. In 2007, it was revealed that forensic expert Philip Van Praag had analyzed an audiotape of the shooting known as the Pruszynski recording in which Van Praag had discovered acoustic evidence that a second gun had been involved in the assassination. Van Praag found that 13 shots were fired even though Sirhan's gun held only eight rounds, its maximum bullet capacity, and Sirhan had no opportunity to reload it.Pruszynski recording & analysis by acoustic expert Philip Van Praag Van Praag states the recording also reveals at least two cases where the timing between shots was shorter than physically possible from Sirhan's gun alone. Forensic audio specialists Wes Dooley and Paul Pegas of Audio Engineering Associates in Pasadena examined Van Praag's findings and corroborated the presence of more than eight gunshots on the tape along with over-lapping shots, all of this indicating the presence of a second shooter. Similar corroboration came from forensic audio and ballistics expert Eddy B. Brixen in CopenhagenO'Sullivan, Shane (2008) Who Killed Bobby?: The Unsolved Murder of Robert Kennedy. New York: Sterling Publishing. p. 478. and audio specialist Phil Spencer Whitehead of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. Other acoustic experts, however, have claimed that they could find no more than eight shots recorded on the audiotape.Harrison, P. (2007) 'Analysis of \\"The Pruszynski Tape\\"' (report on recording of gunshots). In Ayton, M., The Forgotten Terrorist: Sirhan Sirhan and the Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. Washington: Potomac Books. The Pruszynski recording was uncovered in 2004 by CNN's Brad Johnson; its existence had been unknown to the general public previously.O'Sullivan, Shane (2008) Who Killed Bobby?: The Unsolved Murder of Robert Kennedy. New York: Sterling Publishing. p. 475. On February 22, 2012, Sirhan's lawyers William Francis Pepper and Laurie Dusek filed a court brief in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles claiming that a second gunman fired the shots that killed Kennedy. It was the fourth and final in a series of federal briefs filed under the writ of habeas corpus by Pepper and Dusek beginning in October 2010. Judge Beverly Reid O'Connell denied the petition in 2015. Aftermath and legacy =Memorial= Robert Kennedy's grave in Arlington National Cemetery Following Kennedy's autopsy on June 6, his remains were taken to Manhattan, where his closed casket was viewed by thousands at St. Patrick's Cathedral. The funeral mass was held on the morning of June 8. Kennedy's younger brother, Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy, delivered the eulogy with the words: Immediately following the mass, Kennedy's body was transported by a slow- moving train to Washington, D.C., and thousands of mourners lined the tracks and stations, paying their respects as the train passed by. On the way to the cemetery, the funeral procession passed through Resurrection City, a shantytown protest set up as part of the Poor People's Campaign. The procession stopped in front of the Lincoln Memorial, where residents of Resurrection City joined the group and sang \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\". Kennedy was buried near his older brother John, in Arlington National Cemetery, in the first burial to have ever taken place there at night; the second was the burial of his younger brother Ted in 2009. After Kennedy's assassination, Congress altered the Secret Service's mandate to include protection for presidential candidates. The remaining candidates were immediately protected under an executive order issued by Lyndon Johnson, putting a strain on the poorly resourced Secret Service. =1968 election= At the time of his death, Kennedy was substantially behind Humphrey in convention delegate support, but many believe that Kennedy would have ultimately secured the nomination following his victory in the California primary. Only thirteen states held primaries that year, meaning that most delegates at the Democratic convention could choose a candidate based on their personal preference. Historian and senior Kennedy campaign advisor Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., and others have argued that Kennedy's broad appeal and charisma would have been sufficiently convincing at the 1968 Democratic National Convention to give him the nomination. Historian Michael Beschloss believed that Kennedy would not have secured the nomination. Humphrey, after a National Convention in Chicago marred by violence in the streets, was far behind in opinion polls but gained ground. He ultimately lost the general election to Republican Richard Nixon by the narrow popular vote margin of 43.4 percent to 42.7 percent. Nixon won by a more decisive 301‚Äì191 margin in the electoral vote. =Cultural and societal impact= Kennedy's assassination was a blow to the optimism for a brighter future that his campaign brought for many Americans who lived through the turbulent 1960s. Juan Romero, the busboy who shook hands with Kennedy right before he was shot, later said, \\"It made me realize that no matter how much hope you have it can be taken away in a second.\\" Jack Newfield, a reporter who had been traveling with the campaign, expressed his feelings on the effect of the assassination, closing his memoir on Kennedy with: Kennedy's blood-stained shirt, tie and jacket are now in the possession of the Los Angeles County District Attorney. Controversy arose in 2010, when Kennedy's clothing was transported to the California Homicide Investigators Association conference in Las Vegas, where they were included in a temporary public display of never-before-seen artifacts from crime scenes related to prolific serial killers and infamous murders, such as the Black Dahlia murder and the killing of Hollywood actress Sharon Tate. The items and Kennedy's clothing were subsequently removed from the exhibit, with the LAPD apologizing to the Kennedy family. Until 1987, the LAPD retained the original files, reports, transcripts, fragments of the bullets that struck Kennedy and the four other bystanders in the kitchen pantry, the .22 caliber Iver-Johnson handgun used by Sirhan, Kennedy's blood-stained clothes and other artifacts related to the assassination. In 1987, the LAPD donated the entire evidence collection (except for Kennedy's clothes) to the California State Archives in Sacramento for permanent preservation.California State Archives The Robert F.

Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California, on June 5, 1968; Kennedy died the following day at Good Samaritan Hospital. Sirhan was convicted of murder and is serving a life sentence at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego County, California. Sirhan was born in Jerusalem to an Arab Christian family, where he attended a Lutheran school. In 1989, he told David Frost, \\"My only connection with Robert Kennedy was his sole support of Israel and his deliberate attempt to send those 50 [fighter jet] bombers to Israel to obviously do harm to the Palestinians.\\" Some scholars believe that the assassination was the first major incident of political violence in the United States stemming from the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict in the Middle East. Early life Sirhan was born into an Arab Palestinian Christian family in Jerusalem, Mandatory Palestine. As a child growing up in the West Bank, Sirhan was traumatized by the violence he witnessed in the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, including the death of his older brother, who was run over by a Jordanian military vehicle that was swerving to escape Israeli gunfire. When Sirhan was 12 years old, his family immigrated to the US, moving briefly to New York and then to California. In Altadena, he attended Eliot Junior High School, followed by John Muir High School and Pasadena City College, both in Pasadena. Sirhan's father, Bishara, has been characterized as a stern man who often beat his sons harshly. Shortly after the family's move to California, Bishara returned alone to the Middle East.Sirhan Sirhan profile at TruTV.com Standing and weighing at 20 years old, Sirhan moved to Corona to train to be a jockey while working at a stable, but lost his job and abandoned the pursuit after suffering a head injury in a racing accident. Sirhan never became an American citizen, retaining instead his Jordanian citizenship. As an adult, he changed church denominations several times, joining Baptist and Seventh-day Adventist churches. Then in 1966, he joined the occult organization Ancient Mystical Order of the Rose Cross, commonly known as the Rosicrucians. Robert F.

Kennedy was shot three times‚Äîonce in the head and twice in the back‚Äîwith a fourth bullet passing through his jacket. He died almost 26 hours later at Good Samaritan Hospital.

DailyNews Los Angeles (January 5, 2011) Elizabeth Evans, a friend of Pierre Salinger, one of Kennedy's campaign aides; and Irwin Stroll, a teenage Kennedy volunteer.\\"Irwin N. Stroll; Wounded in RFK Slaying, He Became Famed Designer\\", Los Angeles Times (February 20, 1995), Retrieved November 27, 2011. In a 2018 interview with The Washington Post, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that he traveled to the Richard J. Donovan correctional facility in California to meet with Sirhan, and that after a relatively lengthy conversation (the details of which he would not disclose), believed that Sirhan did not kill his father and that a second gunman was involved. Prosecution Despite the fact that Sirhan admitted his guilt in a recorded confession while in police custody on June 9, a lengthy, publicized trial followed in The People of the State of California v. Sirhan Sirhan. The judge did not accept his confession and denied his request to withdraw his plea of \\"not guilty\\" in order to plead \\"guilty\\". On February 10, 1969, Sirhan's lawyers made a motion in chambers to enter a plea of guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for life imprisonment rather than the death penalty. Sirhan told Judge Herbert V. Walker that he wanted to withdraw his original plea of not guilty in order to plead guilty as charged on all counts. He also asked that his counsel \\"dissociate themselves from this case completely.\\" The judge asked him what he wanted to do about sentencing, and Sirhan replied, \\"I will ask to be executed.\\" Walker denied the motion and said, \\"This court will not accept the plea.\\" He also denied Sirhan's request for his counsel to withdraw; his counsel entered another motion to withdraw from the case of their own volition, but Walker denied that too. Walker subsequently ordered that the record be sealed pertaining to the motion.People v. Sirhan, 7 Cal. 3d 710, June 16, 1972 The trial proceeded, and opening statements began on February 12. The lead prosecutor in the case was Lynn \\"Buck\\" Compton, a World War II veteran of Easy Company fame who later became a justice of the California Court of Appeal. David Fitts delivered the prosecution's opening statement, providing examples of Sirhan's preparations to kill Kennedy. The prosecution showed that Sirhan was seen at the Ambassador Hotel on June 3, two nights before the attack, to learn the building's layout, and that he visited a gun range on June 4. Alvin Clark, Sirhan's garbage collector, testified that Sirhan had told him a month before the attack of his intention to shoot Kennedy. Sirhan's defense counsel included attorney Grant Cooper, who had hoped to demonstrate that the killing had been the impulsive act of a man with a mental deficiency. But Walker admitted into evidence pages from three of the journal notebooks Sirhan had kept that showed the murder was premeditated and \\"quite calculating and willful.\\" On March 3, Cooper asked Sirhan in direct testimony if he had shot Kennedy; Sirhan replied, \\"Yes, sir,\\" but then said that he did not bear Kennedy any ill will. Sirhan also testified that he had killed Kennedy \\"with 20 years of malice aforethought.\\" He explained in an interview with David Frost in 1989 that this referred to the time since the creation of the State of Israel. He has maintained since then that he has no memory of the crime, or of making that statement in court. Cooper asked Sirhan to explain his reasons for attacking Kennedy, and Sirhan launched into \\"a vicious diatribe about the Middle East conflict between Arab and Jew.\\" Defense counsel Emile Zola Berman, who was Jewish, was upset by Sirhan's statements, and expressed his intention to resign from the defense team. Cooper eventually talked Berman out of resigning, and he stayed until the end of the trial. The defense based its case primarily on the expert testimony of Bernard L. Diamond, M.D., a professor of law and psychiatry at the University of California, Berkeley who testified that Sirhan was suffering from diminished capacity at the time of the murder. Sirhan was convicted on April 17, 1969, and was sentenced six days later to death in the gas chamber. Three years later, his sentence was commuted to life in prison, owing to the California Supreme Court's decision in The People of the State of California vs. Robert Page Anderson, which ruled that capital punishment is a violation of the California Constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The February 1972 decision was retroactive, invalidating all existing death sentences in California. =Appeals= Sirhan's lawyer Lawrence Teeter later argued that Grant Cooper was compromised by a conflict of interest and was, as a consequence, grossly negligent in defense of his client. The defense moved for a new trial amid claims of setups, police bungles, hypnotism, brainwashing, blackmail, and government conspiracies. On June 5, 2003, coincidentally the 35th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination, Teeter petitioned a federal court in Los Angeles to move the case to Fresno. He argued that Sirhan could not get a fair hearing in Los Angeles, where a man who helped prosecute him is now a federal judge: U.S. District Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. in Los Angeles was an assistant U.S. attorney during Sirhan's trial, and part of the prosecutorial team. Since 1994 Teeter had been trying to have state and federal courts overturn Sirhan's conviction, arguing his client was hypnotized and framed, possibly by a government conspiracy. During one hearing Teeter referred to testimony from the original trial transcripts regarding a prosecution eyewitness to the attack, author George Plimpton, in which he said that Sirhan looked \\"enormously composed. He seemed ... purged.\\" This statement coincided with the defense's argument that Sirhan had shot Kennedy while in some kind of hypnotic trance. The motion was denied. Teeter died in 2005, and Sirhan declined other counsel to replace him. On November 26, 2011, Sirhan's defense teams filed court papers for a new trial, saying that \\"expert analysis of recently uncovered evidence shows two guns were fired in the assassination and that Sirhan's revolver was not the gun that shot Kennedy\\"The Robert Kennedy Assassination. Mary Ferrell Foundation. and he \\"should be freed from prison or granted a new trial based on 'formidable evidence', asserting his innocence and 'horrendous violations' of his rights\\". On January 5, 2015, Sirhan's motion was denied by U.S. District Judge Beverly Reid O'Connell in Los Angeles, who said that Sirhan \\"failed to meet the showing required for actual innocence\\" that might excuse his having failed to seek his freedom sooner in federal court. In other words, Sirhan's case was not strong enough. \\"Though petitioner advances a number of theories regarding the events of June 5, 1968, petitioner does not dispute that he fired eight rounds of gunfire in the kitchen pantry of the Ambassador Hotel\\", O'Connell wrote. \\"Petitioner does not show that it is more likely than not that no juror, acting reasonably, would have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\\" =Motives= A motive cited for Sirhan's actions is the Middle East conflict. After his arrest, Sirhan said, \\"I can explain it. I did it for my country.\\" Sirhan believed that he was deliberately betrayed by Kennedy's support for Israel in the June 1967 Six-Day War, which had begun one year to the day before the assassination. During a search of Sirhan's apartment after his arrest, a spiral-bound notebook was found containing a diary entry that demonstrated that his anger had gradually fixated on Kennedy, who had promised to send 50 fighter jets to Israel if elected president. Sirhan's journal entry of May 18, 1968, read: \\"My determination to eliminate R.F.K. is becoming the more and more of an unshakable obsession...Kennedy must die before June 5th.\\" They found other notebooks and diary entries expressing his growing rage at Kennedy; his journals also contained many nonsensical scribbles that were thought to be his version of \\"free writing\\". He wrote in support of communism: \\"Long live Communism... I firmly support the communist cause and its people... American capitalism will fall and give way to the worker's dictatorship.\\" The next day, on June 6, the Los Angeles Times printed an article by Jerry Cohen that discussed Sirhan's motive for the assassination, confirmed by the memos Sirhan wrote to himself. The article stated: \\"When the Jordanian nationalist, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, allegedly shot Kennedy, ostensibly because of the senator's advocacy of U.S. support for Israel, the crime with which he was charged was in essence another manifestation of the centuries-old hatred between Arab and Jew. M.T. Mehdi, then secretary-general of the Action Committee on American-Arab Relations, believed that Sirhan had acted in justifiable self-defense, stating: \\"Sirhan was defending himself against those 50 Phantom jets Kennedy was sending to Israel.\\" Mehdi wrote a 100-page book on the subject called Kennedy and Sirhan: Why? Later in prison, Sirhan claimed that he was drunk. An interview with Sirhan in 1980 revealed new claims that a combination of liquor and anger over the anniversary of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war triggered his actions. \\"You must remember the circumstances of that night, June 5. That was when I was provoked,\\" Sirhan says, recorded in a transcript of one of his interviews with Mehdi, later president of the New York-based American-Arab Relations Committee. \\"That is when I initially went to observe the Jewish Zionist parade in celebration of the June 5, 1967, victory over the Arabs. That was the catalyst that triggered me on that night.\\" Then Sirhan said, \\"In addition, there was the consumption of the liquor, and I want the public to understand that.\\" Imprisonment In 1971, Sirhan was housed in the Adjustment Center at San Quentin State Prison.

Mehdi, Sirhan claimed that his actions were fueled by liquor and anger. He then complained that the parole board was not taking these \\"mitigating\\" circumstances into account when they continually denied his parole. On May 10, 1982, Sirhan told the parole board: \\"I sincerely believe that if Robert Kennedy were alive today, I believe he would not countenance singling me out for this kind of treatment. I think he would be among the first to say that, however horrible the deed I committed 14 years ago was, that it should not be the cause for denying me equal treatment under the laws of this country.\\"\\"Sirhan denied parole for 10th time in RFK killing\\" by Steve Wilstein. Daily Breeze (Torrance, CA), May 24, 1989 A parole hearing for Sirhan is now scheduled every five years, although a stipulation of Sirhan's sentence is that the parole period can end sooner if new evidence comes to light supporting his release. On March 2, 2011, after 42 years in prison, Sirhan's 14th parole hearing was held, with Sirhan represented by his current attorney, William Francis Pepper, who also represented James Earl Ray, who was convicted of assassinating Martin Luther King Jr. At this hearing, Sirhan testified that he continues to have no memory of the assassination nor of any details of his 1969 trial and confession. Pepper also repeated the claim Sirhan's lawyers had previously made that there was a second gunman who fired the fatal shots and that Sirhan was \\"hypno-programmed\\" and his memory of being programmed was \\"wiped\\" by an unknown conspiracy behind the assassination. Pepper said he hired Daniel Brown of Harvard Medical School to spend more than 60 hours with Sirhan in prison and recover his memory of both the shooting and having been put under hypnosis. His parole was denied on the grounds that Sirhan still does not understand the full ramifications of his crime. Sirhan Sirhan on February 9, 2016, the day before his 15th parole hearing. On February 10, 2016, at his 15th parole hearing, Sirhan was denied parole again. One of Sirhan's shooting victims from that night, Paul Schrade, now aged 91, testified in support of Sirhan, stating his belief that a second shooter killed Kennedy and that Sirhan was intended to be a distraction from the real gunman by an unknown conspiracy. Sirhan also repeated his claim to have no memory of the shooting. In his testimony before the parole board, Sirhan recalled events before the shooting in some detail ‚Äì going to a shooting range the day before, June 4, 1968, visiting the hotel on June 5 in search of a party and returning to the lobby after realizing he had drunk too many Tom Collins cocktails to drive. He next claimed to have drunk coffee in a backstage area near the hotel pantry with a woman to whom he was attracted, and who may have been involved with the conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy. Brown has stated that the unknown woman then took Sirhan into the pantry, which Sirhan described in his prison memory sessions as a dark room at the hotel, and that while in the pantry the woman gave Sirhan a post-hypnotic cue to fire a gun in Kennedy's direction minutes later. Sirhan was immediately subdued by several men in the pantry as Kennedy fell to the floor fatally wounded. Sirhan has claimed that after having coffee with the woman, the next thing he can remember is being choked and unable to breathe moments after the Kennedy shooting, stating: \\"It's all vague now. I'm sure you all have it in your records. I can't deny it or confirm it. I just wish this whole thing had never taken place.\\" Sirhan's parole was denied on the grounds that he had not expressed adequate remorse for his crime or acknowledged its severity. =Supporters= In 1974 domestic terrorists Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn dedicated their own communist manifesto Prairie Fire: The Politics of Revolutionary Anti-Imperialism, to Sirhan (along with 200 others), hailing him as a courageous political prisoner. In February 1973 one of the demands of Black September terrorists who took American hostages at the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Khartoum was the release of Sirhan.

It consists of pulling or renting existing stock clothing and costumes, altering them as needed to be used as stage clothes in a theatrical production, oversee their use, cleaning and eventual return to storage or rental company. Just as with costume design, the costume coordinator creates the overall appearance of the characters, but with the use of on hand items, including accessories. Sometimes coordinators may have a small budget to augment the existing stock or alter it for production needs. Many theatres with smaller budgets regularly reuse existing stock, especially older companies with large costume warehouses. It is also a staple of community theatre positions because it entails less time and effort and is the usual manner for schools to costume student performers from stored costumes donated or previously purchased. Coordination of costumes is also required at theme parks and festivals which require performers and dancers to have a consistent appearance, or maintained as originally designed. Celebrity Costumes There are costumes made for film and theater, but it is also made show off popular looks to fans and friends on the red carpet or other fancy places. Discovered by INSIDER articles, celebrity women tend to dress or half dress for that manner, when they are not filming or doing production. These specific locations are places like, the Red Carpet, Engagement photos, Music Awards, VMA's, Venice Film Festival, and the Grammy's. This isn't a bashing statement, it is an honoring one. Celebrity women are constantly recognized for what they are wearing outside of the professional/ business atmosphere. These celebrity women are praised by their glam and style. They become more iconic for their stunning appearances at these elegant events. These outfits and designs are still in some way a costume because it's making up a certain character. As mentioned in Jorgensen book, famous designer Edith Head says, a celebrity wears different costumes to become someone different. The clothing chosen by designers for celebrities are the gifts of celebration, style and beauty.(Pantazi, Chloe 2017) Costume Trends The fashion and costumes that are used in movies and theater actually have an effect on fashion shows and fans. These examples are seen on social media and common blogs. Some films are enjoyable by genres but others are memorable because of costumes. There are many specific designs and costumes that are used in production that valued and inspiring to most people today. Designers such as Keira Knightley and Audrey Hepburn have made many designs for films that are or have been in high fashion in reality. A few movies to think about and idealize are, Cinderella where there were much patients and dedication with the amounts of fabric used and the number of designers that worked on the dress. A few others, Mad Max Fury World, the designer received an Oscar for creating the costume for the character who Imperator Furiosa,; Atonement, where the green dress worn in the film was to illustrate jealousy and temptation. One other film would be Kill Bill, where the character The Bride played a strong roll and needed an even stronger costume to go with it. There are plenty of other movies and famous designers to read into along with different awards won for the costumes. (Fearn, Rebecca; 2016) Movie costumes can definitely become a trend in reality. For an example, the film where, Marilyn Monroe wore a white halterneck dress standing over a subway vent and how it became so popular because how beautiful it was or how correctly it was worn. It also left a message telling women \\"how to really wear it.\\" Costumes in film or stage have the ability to have some sort of an effect on fashion in society. To go through the list of top designs more, The Matrix where they wore trench coats and shades to build a serious character. Factory Girl being another film which shows exaggeration in the costumes for that time frame. One famous and popular film mentioned would be Cleopatra, where the designer Renle made very creative and unique costumes. The designer didn't use accurate costumes to tell the story but what made the film interesting was the fun that the designers and directors put into it. (Clough, Rebecca 2014) Famous Designers There are many famous designers that are left behind the scene and aren't always recognized for their work but some have significantly made it into the spotlight. Many designers began sewing when they are young and they would start off with small creations. Edith Head for an example is now as \\"The Greastest Costume Designer\\". In much news there are plenty of designers that have books written about them and their own websites of their designs. Edith Head had designed not only for herself but many other top celebrities like Grace Kelly. Sandy Powell is another known designer who talks about the particular work of a designer and the pressure. There are a lot of designs for a designer to complete and there isn't always enough time and sketches that need to be made for actors and directors preferences. In Head's words actors and actresses uses their fashion/costumes as a \\"camouflage\\" to indicate that they are a different person every time they are seen (Jorgensen 2010). Another designer is Kate Carin who does much work in South Africa. She has her own website that features her designs in films like, Saints and Strangers, Cape Town, The 51st State, Strongbow, The book of Negroes and the list goes on. This website talks about Carin's designs along with her relationships with directors; this is numerously stated in other research, mentioning the connection between the two. It also talks about her versatile style with being about to design costumes for commercials and also for period movies that takes research (Carin). Reading Costumes There is a lot of production and preparation used in a film so it's important to know how to read these costumes. There are popular costumes used in the 1300-1500s and also modern day costumes. These costumes discuss what certain costumes have and what does it mean. It also point out specific ways to educate oneself on the way costumes are used. There's a director of a costume organization named, Deborah Landis that who suggest helping students and teachers to appreciate costume designs more. The article digs in a little deeper, particularly focusing on media literacy and observation. It talks about the collaborations between costume designers, directors, and cinematographer. The article is similar to \\"Role of Importance\\" by differentiating between fashion and costume designers but this article has more depth. It begins with saying fashion designers have labels to sell their designs while costume designers have no label and they simply make characters. Again there's a lot of research costume designers done to make a perfect character; visiting places that are still standing, learning habits of the culture, collecting photos and so on. Costume designers use portraits to match their sketches. She continues after each section of telling what costume designer does along with providing assignments to teachers for students (Landis 2018). For many people, costumes have importance. Costumes are made to make and invent a character in a film or play. Popular movies like \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" , \\"Hamlet\\" , and so on; are very collaborative movies that people constantly describe each significant style and fabric that a character is wearing throughout the film. These films are known for their heavy leather, lacquer red silk and all other things that were embedded into a costume, and other things made to represent those ages. There's a lot that goes into a costume according to this book, you have to select the fabric, cut out the costume, make sure it fits, and aging the costume which is making it look older by spraying it down with different things or painting over it. After the end of designing the costumes, it is then presented to the director for approval. Along with most costumes there are props to finish off a personality like knives, pistols, crowns, etc. depending on a character's role. These decisions are made by both the director and costume designer to give characters purposes in stories.(Motley 1965) There's a book that highly discuss renaissance costumes called, \\"Settings and Costumes of the Modern Stage\\". This book doesn't just give information and photos about Costumes but also the stage and the setup to help with bringing characters to life. This information will be helpful because it gives costume designers their credit for their designs. The article discusses stage and costume connection, to help readers understand how costumes match the story/plot. This book has more pictures than words but it helps to create the understanding of a scene, story, and character. The book shows many photos and descriptions of plays like: Hamlet, Marriage, Resurrection, and so on. Authors, Simonson and Komisarjevsky also briefly mention the way New York Stage has made its changes in certain settings to a more glamorous fairy-tales (Simonson, Lee 1966). As mentioned above, there should be more appreciation for the work put into costumes. Even the simplest costumes that are in different genres affects a costume and tell a story. In science fiction it makes sense for directors and designers to dress up characters to create a fantasy and make it less compromising to relate. The film Tron Legacy where the colors of their costumes play big roles in the film and within the characters. These colors are specifically used to distinguish between the protagonist and antagonist. In Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, costumes indicate the enemy characters in this film that are called the seven villains. The costumes used in Robin Hood, was to connect to a certain time period of heroes of men that was formed in the medieval times. Costumes in films are used to enhance a reality of the narration not to define it. Simple outfits that are worn in film also tells some type of story or secret (Laverty, Lord Christopher 2011). Designers doesn't always enhance their characters by new fabric, costumes are rented from existing materials to fit characters in movies or plays. The use of colors and patterns in costumes are bold representations. Before a movie or play is produced, designers read scripts to identify the era in which the piece is taken place, this helps to get started on their first sketch. They create costume charts that label what characters are wearing in specific scenes. Their final sketch is presented after the first has been approved. The final sketch shows more vivid and unique features with the use of colors. All of this information sounds very similar to a fashion designer. Some people are unable to identify the difference between costume and fashion designers. Costume designing is made for characters in stories while fashion is for a person's style. Costume designs have limited time and assignments on creativity. There are more expenses used in costume designing and there is the need for research and knowledge of culture or history (UKEssay 2018).

It has a population of 145,237 (2004 census).Arar, Saudi Arabia Video Tourism and Events Arar is located in northern Saudi Arabia near the Iraqi border. It is known for its fertile pasture lands which lends itself well to its principal occupation of sheep and camel herding. The population of the entire Northern Borders Province, including the cities of Rafha, Turayf and Alaoiqilah and suburban villages and their inhabitants, was 320,524 at the 2010 census. Arar serves as a significant supply stop for travelers on the Saudi Arabian highway 85.

It was initially an oil pumping station with a health center and worker housing. Workers at Arar were primarily from the regions of Al-Ahsa, Ha'il, Yanbu and Al Wajh. Arar got its name from the original oil field that existed before the town, \\"Field RR\\", one of many in the country, where it was known by the locals as \\"R.R.\\" which later became  øAr øar. The name Arar means juniper in Arabic. In 1968, the remains of an ancient city were unearthed 30 km from the city of 'Ar'ar. The site yielded numerous sculptures of fish, turtles and other aquatic animals. A summit meeting between King Saud and King Hussein of Jordan took place in 'Ar'ar during the reigns of the two monarchs. Iraqi Airways Flight 163, crashed near the 'Ar'ar airport on 25 December 1986. The plane was flying from Baghdad, Iraq to Amman, Jordan.

He was, like his brothers John and Edward, a prominent member of the Democratic Party and has come to be viewed by some historians as an icon of modern American liberalism. Kennedy was born into a wealthy, political family in Brookline, Massachusetts. After serving in the U.S. Naval Reserve from 1944 to 1946, Kennedy returned to his studies at Harvard University, graduating in 1948. He received his law degree from the University of Virginia, and was admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1951. He began his career as a correspondent for The Boston Post and as a lawyer at the Justice Department, but later resigned to manage his brother John's successful campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1952. The following year, he worked as an assistant counsel to the Senate committee chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy. He gained national attention as the chief counsel of the Senate Labor Rackets Committee from 1957 to 1959, where he publicly challenged Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa over the union's corrupt practices. Kennedy resigned from the committee to conduct his brother's campaign in the 1960 presidential election. He was appointed United States Attorney General after the election and served as his brother's closest advisor until his 1963 assassination. His tenure is best known for its advocacy for the civil rights movement, the fight against organized crime and the Mafia, and involvement in U.S. foreign policy related to Cuba. He authored his account of the Cuban Missile Crisis in a book titled Thirteen Days. After his brother's assassination, he remained in office in the Johnson Administration for several months. He left to run for the United States Senate from New York in 1964 and defeated Republican incumbent Kenneth Keating. In office, Kennedy opposed racial discrimination and U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He was an advocate for issues related to human rights and social justice and formed working relationships with Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, and Walter Reuther. In 1968, Kennedy became a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for the presidency by appealing to poor, African American, Hispanic, Catholic, and young voters. His main challenger in the race was Senator Eugene McCarthy. Shortly after winning the California primary around midnight on June 5, 1968, Kennedy was mortally wounded when shot with a pistol by Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian, allegedly in retaliation for his support of Israel following the 1967 Six-Day War. Kennedy died the following morning. Sirhan was arrested, tried, and convicted, though Kennedy's assassination, like his brother's, continues to be the subject of widespread analysis and numerous conspiracy theories. Early life and education Robert Francis Kennedy was born outside Boston in Brookline, Massachusetts, on November 20, 1925. He was the seventh of nine children to businessman/politician Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and philanthropist/socialite Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy.Schlesinger (2002) [1978] p. 3. His parents were members of two prominent Irish American families in Boston. His eight siblings were Joseph Jr., John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Jean, and Ted. All four of his grandparents were children of Irish immigrants. His father was a wealthy businessman and a leading Irish figure in the Democratic Party. After he stepped down as ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1940, Joe Sr. focused his attention on his oldest son, Joseph Jr., expecting that he would enter politics and be elected president. He also urged the younger children to examine and discuss current events in order to propel them to public service.Hilty, p. 18. After Joseph Jr. was killed during World War II, the senior Kennedy's hopes fell on his second son, John, to become president. Joseph Sr. had the money and connections to play a central role in the family's political ambitions.Nasaw, David (2012). The Patriarch: The Remarkable Life and Turbulent Times of Joseph P. Kennedy, Penguin Press, pp 584, 602‚Äì3, 671. The Kennedy family in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, with Robert on the bottom left in a jacket, 1931 Kennedy's older brother John was often bedridden by illness and, as a result, became a voracious reader. Although he made little effort to get to know his younger brother during his childhood, John took him on walks and regaled him with the stories of heroes and adventures he had read. One of their favorite authors was John Buchan, who wrote The Thirty-Nine Steps, which influenced both Robert and John. John sometimes called Robert \\"Black Robert\\" due to his prudishness and disposition. Unlike his older brothers, Kennedy took to heart their mother Rose's agenda for everything to have \\"a purpose,\\" which included visiting historic sites during family outings, visits to the church during morning walks, and games used to expand vocabulary and math skills.Mills, p. 23. He described his position in the family hierarchy by saying, \\"When you come from that far down, you have to struggle to survive.\\" As the boys were growing up, he tried frequently to get his older brothers' attention, but was seldom successful. Kennedy spent his childhood in the suburbs of New York City, the family home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, and a winter retreat in Palm Beach, Florida. He later said that during childhood he was \\"going to different schools, always having to make new friends, and that I was very awkward ... [a]nd I was pretty quiet most of the time. And I didn't mind being alone.\\" He even had to repeat third grade.Oppenheimer, Jerry. The Other Mrs. Kennedy, p. 307. A teacher at Bronxville reflected that he was \\"a regular boy\\", adding, \\"It seemed hard for him to finish his work sometimes. But he was only ten after all.\\"Hilty, pp. 23‚Äì24. He developed an interest in American history, decorating his bedroom with pictures of U.S. presidents and filling his bookshelves with volumes on the American Civil War. He became an avid stamp collector and once received a handwritten letter from Franklin Roosevelt, also a philatelist. In March 1938, Kennedy sailed to London with his mother and four youngest siblings to join his father, who had begun serving as Ambassador to the United Kingdom. He attended the private Gibbs School for Boys in London for seventh grade. In April 1939, he gave his first public speech at the placing of a cornerstone for a youth club in England. According to embassy and newspaper reports, his statements were penciled in his own hand and delivered in a \\"calm and confident\\" manner.Hilty, p. 28. Bobby returned to the United States just before the outbreak of World War II in Europe. =St. Paul's and Portsmouth Priory= In September 1939, Kennedy began eighth grade at St. Paul's School, an elite Protestant private preparatory school for boys in Concord, New Hampshire, that his father favored. Rose Kennedy was unhappy with the school's use of the Protestant Bible. After two months, she took advantage of her ambassador husband's absence from Boston and withdrew Kennedy from St. Paul's. She enrolled him in Portsmouth Priory School, a Benedictine Catholic boarding school for boys in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, which held daily morning and evening prayers and Mass three times a week, with a High Mass on Sundays.Schlesinger p. 30. Kennedy attended Portsmouth for eighth through tenth grade.Schlesinger (2002) [1978] pp. 30, 41. At Portsmouth Priory School, Kennedy was known as \\"Mrs. Kennedy's little boy Bobby\\" after he introduced his mother to classmates, who made fun of them. He was defensive of his mother, and on one occasion chased a student out of the dormitory after the boy had commented on her appearance. He befriended Peter MacLellan and wrote to him, when his brother John was serving in the U.S. Navy, that he would be visiting his brother \\"because he might be killed any minute\\". Kennedy blamed himself when his grades failed to improve. In letters to her son, Rose urged him to read more and to strengthen his vocabulary. Rose also expressed disappointment and wrote that she did not expect him to let her down.Mills, pp. 34‚Äì35. He began developing in other ways, and his brother John noticed his increased physical strength, predicting that the younger Kennedy \\"would be bouncing me around plenty in two more years\\".Hilty, p. 38. Monks at Portsmouth Priory School regarded him as a moody and indifferent student. Father Damian Kearney, who was two classes behind Kennedy, reflected that he \\"didn't look happy\\" and that he did not \\"smile much\\". According to Kearney's review of school records, Kennedy was a \\"poor-to-mediocre student, except for history\\". =Milton Academy= In September 1942, Kennedy transferred to his third boarding school, Milton Academy, in Milton, Massachusetts, for 11th and 12th grades.Schlesinger (2002) [1978] p. 42. His father wanted him to transfer to Milton, believing it would better prepare him for Harvard. At Milton, he met and became friends with David Hackett. He invited Hackett to join him for Sunday Mass. Hackett started accompanying him, and was impressed when Kennedy took it upon himself to fill in for a missing altar boy one Sunday. Hackett admired Kennedy's determination to bypass his shortcomings, and remembered him redoubling his efforts whenever something did not come easy to him, which included athletics, studies, success with girls, and popularity. Hackett remembered the two of them as \\"misfits\\", a commonality that drew him to Kennedy, along with an unwillingness to conform to how others acted even if doing so meant not being accepted. Kennedy's grades improved. One of his first relationships was with a girl named Piedy Bailey. The pair was photographed together when he walked her home after chapel on a Sunday night. Bailey was fond of him and remembered him as being \\"very appealing\\". She recalled him being funny, \\"separate, larky; outside the cliques; private all the time\\". Soon after he transferred to Milton, he pressed his father to allow him to enlist, as he wanted to catch up to his brothers who were both serving in the military. Kennedy had arrived at Milton unfamiliar with his peers and made little attempt to know the names of his classmates; he called most of the other boys \\"fella\\" instead. For this, he was nicknamed \\"Fella\\". Most of the school's students had come in eighth or ninth grade and cliques had already been formed. Despite this, his schoolmates would later say the school had no prejudice. He had an early sense of virtue; he disliked dirty jokes and bullying, once stepping in when an upperclassman tried bothering a younger student.Thomas, pp. 37‚Äì40. The headmaster at Milton would later summarize that he was a \\"very intelligent boy, quiet and shy, but not outstanding, and he left no special mark on Milton\\". = Relationship with parents = In Kennedy's younger years, his father dubbed him the \\"runt\\" of the family and wrote him off. Close family friend Lem Billings once remarked to Joe Sr. that he was \\"the most generous little boy\\", and Joe Sr. replied that he did not know where his son \\"got that\\". Billings commented that the only similarity between Robert and Joe Sr. was their eye color. As Kennedy grew, his father worried that he was soft on others, conflicting with his ideology. In response, Kennedy developed a tough persona that masked his gentle personality, attempting to appease his father.Mills, pp. 18‚Äì19. Biographer Judie Mills wrote that Joe Sr.'s lack of interest in Robert was evident by the length of time it took for him to decide to transfer him to Milton Academy. Both Joe Jr. and John attended the exclusive Protestant prep school Choate from their first year, while Robert was already a junior by the time he was enrolled at Milton. Despite his father's disdain, Kennedy continued to seek his approval, requesting that Joe Sr. write him a letter about his opinions on different political events and World War II. As a child, Kennedy also strove to meet his mother's expectations to become the most dutiful, religious, affectionate, and obedient of the Kennedy children, but the father and son grew distant. Rose found his gentle personality endearing, though this was noted as having made him \\"invisible to his father\\". She influenced him heavily and, like her, he became a devout Catholic, throughout his lifetime practicing his religion more seriously than the other boys in the family. He impressed his parents as a child by taking on a newspaper route, seeking their approval and wishing to distinguish himself. However, he had the family chauffeur driving him in a Rolls-Royce so that he could make his deliveries. His mother discovered this and the deliveries ceased. Joe Sr. was satisfied with Kennedy as an adult, believing him to have become \\"hard as nails\\", more like him than any of the other children, while his mother believed he exemplified all she had wanted in a child. Mills wrote, \\"His parents' conflicting views would be echoed in the opinions of millions of people throughout Bobby's life. Robert Kennedy was a ruthless opportunist who would stop at nothing to attain his ambitions. Robert Kennedy was America's most compassionate public figure, the only person who could save a divided country.\\" Naval service (1944‚Äì1946) Kennedy (second from left) during his time at Bates College, in front of a snow replica of a Navy boat. Six weeks before his 18th birthday in 1943, Kennedy enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve as a seaman apprentice. He was released from active duty in March 1944, when he left Milton Academy early to report to the V-12 Navy College Training Program at Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His V-12 training began at Harvard (March‚ÄìNovember 1944) before he was relocated to Bates College in Lewiston, Maine (November 1944 ‚Äì June 1945). He returned to Harvard once again in June 1945 completing his post-training requirements in January 1946. At Bates he received a specialized V-12-degree along with 15 others, and during its Winter Carnival built a snow replica of a Navy boat. While in Maine, he wrote a letter to David Hackett in which he expressed feelings of inadequacy and frustration at being isolated from the action. He talked of filling his free time by taking classes with other sailors and remarked that \\"things are the same as usual up here, and me being my usual moody self I get very sad at times.\\" He added, \\"If I don't get the hell out of here soon I'll die.\\" In addition to Hackett, who was serving as a paratrooper, more of his Parker Hall dorm mates went overseas and left him behind. With others entering combat before him, Kennedy said this made him \\"feel more and more like a Draft Dodger or something\\". He was also frustrated with the apparent desire to shirk military responsibility by some of the other V-12 students. Kennedy's brother Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. died in August 1944,New York Times, August 15 and 17, 1944 (announcement of Kennedy's death) and October 25, 1945 (detailed account of the mission) when his bomber exploded during a volunteer mission known as Operation Aphrodite. Robert was most affected by his father's reaction to his eldest son's passing. He appeared completely heartbroken and his peer Fred Garfield commented that Kennedy developed depression and questioned his faith for a short time. After his brother's death, Kennedy gained more attention, moving higher up the family patriarchy.Thomas, p. 44. On December 15, 1945, the U.S. Navy commissioned the destroyer , and shortly thereafter granted Kennedy's request to be released from naval-officer training to serve aboard Kennedy starting on February 1, 1946, as a seaman apprentice on the ship's shakedown cruise in the Caribbean. On May 30, 1946, he received his honorable discharge from the Navy.Schlesinger (2002) [1978] p. 61. For his service in the Navy, Kennedy was eligible for the American Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal. Further study, journalism, and marriage (1946‚Äì1951) In September 1946, Kennedy entered Harvard as a junior, having received credit for his time in the V-12 program. He worked hard to make the varsity football team as an end; he was a starter and scored a touchdown in the first game of his senior year before breaking his leg in practice. He earned his varsity letter when his coach sent him in wearing a cast during the last minutes of a game against Yale. His father spoke positively of him when he served as a blocking back and sometime receiver for the faster Dave Hackett. Joseph Sr. attended some of Kennedy's practices and saw his son catch a touchdown pass in an early-season rout of Western Maryland. His teammates admired his physical courage. He was five feet ten and 155 pounds, which made him too small for college football. Despite this, he was a fearless hitter and once tackled a 230-pound fullback head-on. Wally Flynn, another player, looked up in the huddle after one play to see him crying after he broke his leg. He disregarded the injury and kept playing.Thomas, p. 51. Kennedy earned two varsity letters over the course of the 1946 and 1947 seasons. end at both Milton Academy (Massachusetts) and Harvard,Thomas, p. 38, 51. c. November 1948 Throughout 1946, Kennedy became active in his brother John's campaign for the U.S. Representative seat that was vacated by James Curley; he joined the campaign full-time after his naval discharge. Biographer Schlesinger wrote that the election served as an entry into politics for both Robert and John.Schlesinger, pp. 63‚Äì64. Robert graduated from Harvard in 1948 with a bachelor's degree in political science. Upon graduating, he sailed immediately on the with a college friend for a six- month tour of Europe and the Middle East, accredited as a correspondent for the Boston Post, filing six stories. Four of these stories, submitted from Palestine shortly before the end of the British Mandate, provided a first-hand view of the tensions in the land. He was critical of British policy on Palestine and praised the Jewish people he met there calling them \\"hardy and tough\\". He held out some hope after seeing Arabs and Jews working side by side but, in the end, feared that the hatred between the groups was too strong and would lead to a war.Schlesinger (2002) [1978] pp. 73‚Äì77. In September 1948, he enrolled at the University of Virginia School of Law in Charlottesville. Kennedy adapted to this new environment, being elected president of the Student Legal Forum, where he successfully produced outside speakers including James M. Landis, William O. Douglas, Arthur Krock, and Joseph McCarthy and his family members Joe Sr. and John F. Kennedy. Kennedy's paper on Yalta, written during his senior year, is deposited in the Law Library's Treasure Trove.Schlesinger, p. 84. On June 17, 1950, Kennedy married Ethel Skakel at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Greenwich, Connecticut. He graduated from law school in June 1951 and flew with Ethel to Greenwich to stay in his father-in- law's guest house. The couple's first child, Kathleen, was born on July 4, 1951. During this time, his brother John tried to keep Joe Sr. \\"at arm's length\\". The brothers rarely interacted until Kenny O'Donnell contacted Robert to repair the relationship between John and their father during John's Senate campaign. As a result of this, Joe Sr. came to view Robert favorably as reliable and \\"willing to sacrifice himself\\" for the family.Thomas, pp. 58‚Äì59. In September 1951, he went to San Francisco as a correspondent for the Boston Post to cover the convention that concluded the Treaty of Peace with Japan. In October 1951, he embarked on a seven-week Asian trip with his brother John (then a U.S. Congressman from Massachusetts' 11th district) and their sister Patricia to Israel, India, Pakistan, Vietnam, and Japan. Because of their age gap, the two brothers had previously seen little of each other‚Äîthis trip came at their father's behest and was the first extended time they had spent together, serving to deepen their relationship. On this trip, the brothers met Liaquat Ali Khan just before his assassination, and India's prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Senate committee counsel and political campaigns (1951‚Äì1960) = JFK Senate campaign and Joseph McCarthy (1952‚Äì1955) = In 1951, Kennedy was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar. That November, Kennedy moved with his wife and daughter to a townhouse in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., and started work as a lawyer in the Internal Security Section of the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice; the section was charged with investigating suspected Soviet agents. In February 1952, he was transferred to Brooklyn to help prepare fraud cases against former officials of the Truman administration. On June 6, 1952, Kennedy resigned to manage his brother John's U.S. Senate campaign in Massachusetts. JFK's victory was of great importance to the Kennedys, elevating him to national prominence and turning him into a serious potential presidential candidate. But John's victory was equally important to Robert, who felt he had succeeded in eliminating his father's negative perceptions of him.Thomas, p. 58. In December 1952, at his father's behest, Kennedy was appointed by family friend Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy as assistant counsel of the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.Schlesinger (1978) p. 101 Kennedy disapproved of McCarthy's aggressive methods of garnering intelligence on suspected communists. This was a highly visible job for him. He resigned in July 1953, but \\"retained a fondness for McCarthy\\".Schlesinger (1978) p. 106 The period of July 1953 to January 1954 saw him at \\"a professional and personal nadir\\", feeling that he was adrift while trying to prove himself to his family. In 1954, Kenneth O'Donnell and Larry O'Brien urged Kennedy to consider running for Massachusetts Attorney General, but he declined.Thomas, p. 69. After a period as an assistant to his father on the Hoover Commission, Kennedy rejoined the Senate committee staff as chief counsel for the Democratic minority in February 1954.Schlesinger (1978) p. 109. That month, McCarthy's chief counsel Roy Cohn subpoenaed Annie Lee Moss, accusing her of membership in the Communist Party. Kennedy revealed that Cohn had called the wrong Annie Lee Moss and he requested the file on Moss from the FBI. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover had been forewarned by Cohn and denied him access, calling RFK \\"an arrogant whippersnapper\\".Hilty, pp. 86‚Äì87. When Democrats gained a Senate majority in January 1955, Kennedy became chief counsel and was a background figure in the televised Army‚ÄìMcCarthy hearings of 1954 into McCarthy's conduct.Schlesinger (1978) pp. 113, 115. The Moss incident turned Cohn into an enemy, which led to Kennedy assisting Democratic senators in ridiculing Cohn during the hearings. The animosity grew to the point where Cohn had to be restrained after asking RFK if he wanted to fight him. For his work on the McCarthy committee, Kennedy was included in a list of Ten Outstanding Young Men of 1954, created by the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce. His father had arranged the nomination, his first national award.Hilty, pp. 90‚Äì91. In 1955 Kennedy was admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court. = Stevenson aide and focus on organized labor (1956‚Äì1960) = Chief Counsel Robert F. Kennedy and Senator John F. Kennedy (D‚àíMassachusetts) listen before the McClellan Committee hearings, May 1957 In 1956, Kennedy moved his growing family outside Washington to a house called Hickory Hill, which he purchased from his brother John. This enormous 13-bedroom, 13-bath home was situated on in McLean, Virginia. Kennedy went on to work as an aide to Adlai Stevenson during the 1956 presidential election which helped him learn how national campaigns worked, in preparation for a future run by his brother, Jack.Hilty, pp. 97‚Äì98. Unimpressed with Stevenson, he reportedly voted for incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower. Kennedy was also a delegate at the 1956 Democratic National Convention, having replaced Tip O'Neil at the request of his brother John, joining in what was ultimately an unsuccessful effort to help JFK get the vice-presidential nomination.Thomas, p. 404. Shortly after this, following instructions by his father, Kennedy tried making amends with J. Edgar Hoover.Thomas, p. 116. There seemed to be some improvement in their interactions, which came to be seen as \\"elemental political necessity\\" by Kennedy. This later changed after Kennedy was appointed attorney general, where Hoover saw him as an \\"unprecedented threat\\".Schlesinger (2002) [1978] pp. 254‚Äì256 From 1957 to 1959, he made a name for himself while serving as the chief counsel to the Senate's McClellan Committee under chairman John L. McClellan. Kennedy was given authority over testimony scheduling, areas of investigation, and witness questioning by McClellan, a move that was made by the chairman to limit attention to himself and allow outrage by organized labor to be directed toward Kennedy.Phillips, Cabell. \\"The McClellan-Kennedy Investigating Team.\\" New York Times. March 17, 1957. In a famous scene, Kennedy squared off with Teamsters Union President Jimmy Hoffa during the antagonistic argument that marked Hoffa's testimony.Schlesinger (1978) pp. 137‚Äì91 During the hearings, Kennedy received criticism from liberal critics and other commentators both for his outburst of impassioned anger and doubts about the innocence of those who invoked the Fifth Amendment.Shesol, Jeff. Mutual Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy, and the Feud That Defined a Decade. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1998. ; Richardson, Darcy G. A Nation Divided: The 1968 Presidential Campaign. Bloomington, Ind.: iUniverse, 2001. Senators Barry Goldwater and Karl Mundt wrote to each other and complained about \\"the Kennedy boys\\" having hijacked the McClellan Committee by their focus on Hoffa and the Teamsters. They believed Kennedy covered for Walter Reuther and the United Automobile Workers, a union which typically would back Democratic office seekers. Amidst the allegations, Kennedy wrote in his journal that the two senators had \\"no guts\\" as they never addressed him directly, only through the press. He left the committee in late 1959 in order to run his brother's presidential campaign. = JFK presidential campaign (1960) = In 1960 Kennedy published The Enemy Within, a book which described the corrupt practices within the Teamsters and other unions that he had helped investigate. John Seigenthaler assisted Kennedy. Kennedy went to work on the presidential campaign of his brother, John.Thomas, pp. 88‚Äì89. In contrast to his role in his brother's previous campaign eight years prior, Kennedy gave stump speeches throughout the primary season, gaining confidence as time went on.Hilty, p. 146. His strategy \\"to win at any cost\\" led him to call on Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. to attack Hubert Humphrey as a draft dodger; Roosevelt eventually did make the statement that Humphrey avoided service. Concerned that John Kennedy was going to receive the Democratic Party's nomination, some supporters of Lyndon Johnson, who was also running for the nomination, revealed to the press that JFK had Addison's disease, saying that he required life-sustaining cortisone treatments. Though in fact a diagnosis had been made, Kennedy tried to protect his brother by denying the allegation, saying that JFK had never had \\"an ailment described classically as Addison's disease\\".Sabato, p. 53. After securing the nomination, John Kennedy nonetheless decided to offer Lyndon Johnson the vice presidency. This did not sit well with some Kennedy supporters, and Robert tried unsuccessfully to convince Johnson to turn down the offer, leading him to view Robert with contempt afterward. RFK had already disliked Johnson prior to the presidential campaign, seeing him as a threat to his brother's ambitions.Thomas, p. 96. RFK wanted his brother to choose labor leader Walter Reuther. Despite Kennedy's attempts, Johnson became his brother's running mate. Kennedy worked toward downplaying his brother's Catholic faith during the primary but took a more aggressive and supportive stance during the general election. These concerns were mostly calmed after JFK delivered a speech in September in Houston where he said that he was in favor of the separation of church and state.Thomas, p. 105. The following month, Kennedy was involved in securing the release of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. from a jail in Atlanta. Kennedy spoke with Georgia governor Ernest Vandiver and later Judge Oscar Mitchell, after the judge had sentenced King for violating his probation when he protested at a whites-only snack bar. Attorney General of the United States (1961‚Äì1964) Senate Committee on Government Operations' Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations about organized crime, September 1963 After winning the 1960 presidential election, President-elect John F. Kennedy appointed his younger brother attorney general. The choice was controversial, with publications including The New York Times and The New Republic calling him inexperienced and unqualified. He had no experience in any state or federal court, causing the president to joke, \\"I can't see that it's wrong to give him a little legal experience before he goes out to practice law.\\" However, Kennedy was hardly a novice as a lawyer, having gained significant experience conducting investigations and questioning witnesses as a Justice Department attorney and Senate committee counsel and staff director. According to Bobby Baker, the Senate majority secretary and a prot√©g√© of Lyndon Johnson, President-elect Kennedy did not want to name his brother attorney general. However, their father overruled the president-elect. At the behest of Johnson, Baker persuaded the influential Southern senator Richard Russell to allow a voice vote to confirm the president's brother in January 1961, as Kennedy \\"would have been lucky to get 40 votes\\" on a roll-call vote. The deputy and assistant attorneys general chosen by Kennedy included Byron White and Nicholas Katzenbach. Kennedy also played a major role in helping his brother form his cabinet. John Kennedy wanted to name Senator J. William Fulbright, whom he knew and liked, as his Secretary of State.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 42 Fulbright was generally regarded as the Senate's resident foreign policy expert, but he was also a supporter of segregation and white supremacy in the South. Robert Kennedy persuaded his brother that having Fulbright as Secretary of State would cost the Democrats Afro-American votes, leading to Dean Rusk being nominated instead after John Kennedy decided that his next choice, McGeorge Bundy, was too young to serve as Secretary of State.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 42-43 Kennedy was also present at the job interview when the CEO of the Ford Motor Company, Robert McNamara, was interviewed by John Kennedy about becoming Defense Secretary.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 40-41 McNamara's self-confidence and his belief that he could via his \\"Systems Analysis\\" style of management \\"scientifically\\" solve any problem impressed the Kennedy brothers, through John was rattled for a moment when McNamara asked if it was his bestselling book Profiles in Courage was written by a ghost-writer.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 41 Author James W. Hilty concludes that Kennedy \\"played an unusual combination of roles‚Äîcampaign director, attorney general, executive overseer, controller of patronage, chief adviser, and brother protector\\" and that nobody before him had had such power. His tenure as attorney general was easily the period of greatest power for the office‚Äîno previous United States attorney general had enjoyed such clear influence on all areas of policy during an administration. To a great extent, President Kennedy sought the advice and counsel of his younger brother, with Robert being the president's closest political adviser. He was relied upon as both the president's primary source of administrative information and as a general counsel with whom trust was implicit. He exercised widespread authority over every cabinet department, leading the Associated Press to dub him \\"Bobby‚ÄîWashington's No. 2-man\\". The president once remarked about his brother, \\"If I want something done and done immediately I rely on the Attorney General. He is very much the doer in this administration, and has an organizational gift I have rarely if ever seen surpassed.\\" =Berlin= As one of the president's closest White House advisers, Kennedy played a crucial role in the events surrounding the Berlin Crisis of 1961. Operating mainly through a private, backchannel connection to Soviet spy Georgi Bolshakov, he relayed important diplomatic communications between the American and Soviet governments. Most significantly, this connection helped the U.S. set up the Vienna Summit in June 1961, and later to defuse the tank standoff with the Soviets at Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie in October. =Organized crime and the Teamsters= John F. Kennedy, J. Edgar Hoover, and Kennedy in 1961 As attorney general, Kennedy pursued a relentless crusade against organized crime and the Mafia, sometimes disagreeing on strategy with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Convictions against organized crime figures rose by 800 percent during his term. Kennedy worked to shift Hoover's focus away from communism, which Hoover saw as a more serious threat, to organized crime. According to James Neff, Kennedy's success in this endeavor was due to his brother's position, giving the attorney general leverage over Hoover. Biographer Richard Hack concluded that Hoover's dislike for Kennedy came from his being unable to control him. He was relentless in his pursuit of Teamsters Union president Jimmy Hoffa, due to Hoffa's known corruption in financial and electoral matters, both personally and organizationally, creating a so-called \\"Get Hoffa\\" squad of prosecutors and investigators. The enmity between the two men was intense, with accusations of a personal vendetta‚Äîwhat Hoffa called a \\"blood feud\\"‚Äîexchanged between them. On July 7, 1961, after Hoffa was reelected to the Teamsters presidency, RFK told reporters the government's case against Hoffa had not been changed by what he called \\"a small group of teamsters\\" supporting him. The following year, it was leaked that Hoffa had claimed to a Teamster local that Kennedy had been \\"bodily\\" removed from his office, the statement being confirmed by a Teamster press agent and Hoffa saying Kennedy had only been ejected. On March 4, 1964, Hoffa was convicted in Chattanooga, Tennessee, of attempted bribery of a grand juror during his 1962 conspiracy trial in Nashville, Tennessee, and sentenced to eight years in prison and a $10,000 fine.Brill, Steven. The Teamsters. Paperback ed. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1979. ; Sloane, Arthur A. Hoffa. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1991. After learning of Hoffa's conviction by telephone, Kennedy issued congratulatory messages to the three prosecutors. While on bail during his appeal, Hoffa was convicted in a second trial held in Chicago, on July 26, 1964, on one count of conspiracy and three counts of mail and wire fraud for improper use of the Teamsters' pension fund, and sentenced to five years in prison.Hoffa was convicted of embezzling money from a Teamster-run pension fund and using it to invest in a Florida retirement community. In return, Hoffa had a 45 percent interest in the project, and he and several others received kickbacks in the form of \\"finder's fees\\" from developers for securing the money. See: Brill, Steven. The Teamsters. Paperback ed. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1979. ; Sloane, Arthur A. Hoffa. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1991. Hoffa spent the next three years unsuccessfully appealing his 1964 convictions, and began serving his aggregate prison sentence of 13 years (eight years for bribery, five years for fraud) on March 7, 1967, at the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary in Pennsylvania. =Civil rights= Kennedy expressed the administration's commitment to civil rights during a 1961 speech at the University of Georgia Law School: Justice Department on June 14, 1963 FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover viewed civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. as an upstart troublemaker, calling him an \\"enemy of the state\\". In February 1962 Hoover presented Kennedy with allegations that some of King's close confidants and advisers were communists. Concerned about the allegations, the FBI deployed agents to monitor King in the following months. Kennedy warned King to discontinue the suspected associations. In response, King agreed to ask suspected Communist Jack O'Dell to resign from the SCLC, but refused to heed to the request to ask Stanley Levison, whom he regarded as a trusted advisor, to resign. In October 1963, Kennedy issued a written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, King's civil rights organization. Although Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King's phones \\"on a trial basis, for a month or so\\",Herst, Burton (2007). Bobby and J. Edgar, p. 372. Hoover extended the clearance so that his men were \\"unshackled\\" to look for evidence in any areas of King's life they deemed worthy.Herst, Burton, (2007) pp 372‚Äì374. The wiretapping continued through June 1966 and was revealed in 1968, days before Kennedy's death. Kennedy remained committed to civil rights enforcement to such a degree that he commented in 1962 that it seemed to envelop almost every area of his public and private life, from prosecuting corrupt Southern electoral officials to answering late night calls from Coretta Scott King concerning the imprisonment of her husband for demonstrations in Alabama. During his tenure as attorney general, he undertook the most energetic and persistent desegregation of the administration that Capitol Hill had ever experienced. He demanded that every area of government begin recruiting realistic levels of black and other ethnic workers, going so far as to criticize Vice President Johnson for his failure to desegregate his own office staff. However, relations between the Kennedys and civil rights activists could be tense, partly due to the administration's decision that a number of complaints which King filed with the Justice Department between 1961 and 1963 be handled \\"through negotiation between the city commission and Negro citizens.\\" Kennedy and Vice President Johnson meeting with civil rights leaders at the White House on June 22, 1963 Although it has become commonplace to assert the phrase \\"The Kennedy Administration\\" or even \\"President Kennedy\\" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the civil rights movement, between 1960 and 1963 a great many of the initiatives that occurred during his tenure were the result of the passion and determination of an emboldened Robert Kennedy, who, through his rapid education in the realities of Southern racism, underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as attorney general. Asked in an interview in May 1962, \\"What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it crime or internal security?\\" Kennedy replied, \\"Civil rights.\\"Bob Spivack, Interview of the Attorney General, May 12, 1962; published in \\"Robert Kennedy and His Times,\\" by Arthur M. Schlesinger, p. 313, Ballantine Books (1996). The president came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters at hand to such an extent that it was at the attorney general's insistence that he made his famous June 1963 address to the nation on civil rights. Kennedy played a large role in the response to the Freedom Riders protests. He acted after the Anniston bus bombings to protect the Riders in continuing their journey, sending John Seigenthaler, his administrative assistant, to Alabama to attempt to secure the Riders' safety there. Despite a work rule which allowed a driver to decline an assignment which he regarded as a potentially unsafe one, he persuaded a manager of The Greyhound Corporation to obtain a coach operator who was willing to drive a special bus for the continuance of the Freedom Ride from Birmingham, Alabama, to Montgomery, Alabama, on the circuitous journey to Jackson, Mississippi.Rucker, Walter, Upton James (2007). Encyclopedia of American Race Riots. Greenwood Publishing Press, p. 239. Later, during the attack and burning by a white mob of the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, at which Martin Luther King Jr. and some 1,500 sympathizers were in attendance, the attorney general telephoned King to ask for his assurance that they would not leave the building until the force of U.S. Marshals and National Guard he sent had secured the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for \\"allowing the situation to continue\\". King later publicly thanked him for dispatching the forces to break up the attack that might otherwise have ended his life.Ayers, Edward. Gould, Lewis. Oshinsky, David. (2008). American Passages: A History of the United States: Since 1865, Vol. 2, Cengage Learning, p. 853. Kennedy then negotiated the safe passage of the Freedom Riders from the First Baptist Church to Jackson, Mississippi, where they were arrested.Arsenault, Raymond (2006). Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice. Oxford UP. . He offered to bail the Freedom Riders out of jail, but they refused, which upset him. Kennedy's attempts to end the Freedom Rides early were tied to an upcoming summit with Nikita Khrushchev and Charles de Gaulle. He believed the continued international publicity of race riots would tarnish the president heading into international negotiations.Schlesinger, Arthur (2002). Robert Kennedy and His Times, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, p. 298. This attempt to curtail the Freedom Rides alienated many of the civil rights leaders who, at the time, perceived him as intolerant and narrow-minded.Thomas, p. 298. In an attempt to better understand and improve race relations, Kennedy held a private meeting in New York City in May 1963 with a black delegation coordinated by prominent author James Baldwin. In September 1962, Kennedy sent a force of U.S. marshals and deputized U.S. Border Patrol agents and federal prison guards to Oxford, Mississippi, to enforce a federal court order allowing the admittance of the first African-American student, James Meredith, to the University of Mississippi.U.S. Marshals Mark 50th Anniversary of the Integration of ‚ÄòOle Miss‚Äô The attorney general had hoped that legal means, along with the escort of federal officers, would be enough to force Governor Ross Barnett to allow Meredith's admission. He also was very concerned there might be a \\"mini-civil war\\" between federal troops and armed protesters.Schlesinger (2002) [1978], pp. 317‚Äì320. President Kennedy reluctantly sent federal troops after the situation on campus turned violent. Ensuing riots during the period of Meredith's admittance resulted in 300 injuries and two deaths, yet Kennedy remained adamant that black students had the right to enjoy the benefits of all levels of the educational system. The Office of Civil Rights also hired its first African-American lawyer and began to work cautiously with leaders of the Civil Rights Movement. Kennedy saw voting as the key to racial justice and collaborated with presidents Kennedy and Johnson to create the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which helped bring an end to Jim Crow laws. Between December 1961 and December 1963, Kennedy also expanded the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division by 60 percent. =U.S. Steel= At the direction of the president, Kennedy also used the power of federal agencies to influence U.S. Steel not to institute a price increase. The Wall Street Journal wrote that the administration had set prices of steel \\"by naked power, by threats, by agents of the state security police.\\" Yale law professor Charles Reich wrote in The New Republic that the Justice Department had violated civil liberties by calling a federal grand jury to indict U.S. Steel so quickly, then disbanding it after the price increase did not occur. =Death penalty issues= During the Kennedy administration, the federal government carried out its last pre- Furman federal execution (of Victor Feguer in Iowa, 1963), and Kennedy, as attorney general, represented the government in this case. In 1967 Kennedy expressed his strong willingness to support a bill then under consideration for the abolition of the death penalty. =Cuba= As his brother's confidant, Kennedy oversaw the CIA's anti-Castro activities after the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. He also helped develop the strategy during the Cuban Missile Crisis to blockade Cuba instead of initiating a military strike that might have led to nuclear war. He had initially been among the more hawkish members of the administration on matters concerning Cuban insurrectionist aid. His initial strong support for covert actions in Cuba soon changed to a position of removal from further involvement once he became aware of the CIA's tendency to draw out initiatives, and provide itself with almost unchecked authority in matters of foreign covert operations. President Kennedy with his brother Robert, 1963 Allegations that the Kennedys knew of plans by the CIA to kill Fidel Castro, or approved of such plans, have been debated by historians over the years. JFK's friend and associate, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., for example, expressed the opinion that operatives linked to the CIA were among the most reckless individuals to have operated during the period‚Äîproviding themselves with unscrutinized freedoms to threaten the lives of Castro and other members of the Cuban revolutionary government regardless of the legislative apparatus in Washington‚Äîfreedoms that, unbeknownst to those at the White House attempting to prevent a nuclear war, placed the entire U.S.‚ÄìSoviet relationship in perilous danger. The \\"Family Jewels\\" documents, declassified by the CIA in 2007, suggest that before the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the attorney general personally authorized one such assassination attempt.January 4, 1975, memorandum of conversation between President Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger, made available by the National Security Archive, June 2007CIA's 'family jewels' on show, The Daily Telegraph, June 23, 2007 However, ample evidence exists to the contrary, specifically that Kennedy was only informed of an earlier plot involving the CIA's use of Mafia bosses Santo Trafficante Jr. and John Roselli during a briefing on May 7, 1962, and in fact directed the CIA to halt any existing efforts directed at Castro's assassination.Schlesinger 2002 (reprint), pp. 493‚Äì494. Concurrently, Kennedy served as the president's personal representative in Operation Mongoose, the post-Bay of Pigs covert operations program established in November 1961 by the president. Mongoose was meant to incite a revolution within Cuba that would result in the downfall of Castro, not Castro's assassination. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy proved himself to be a gifted politician with an ability to obtain compromises, tempering aggressive positions of key figures in the hawk camp. The trust the President placed in him on matters of negotiation was such that his role in the crisis is today seen as having been of vital importance in securing a blockade, which averted a full military engagement between the United States and Soviet Russia. His clandestine meetings with members of the Soviet Government continued to provide a key link to Nikita Khrushchev during even the darkest moments of the Crisis, in which the threat of nuclear strikes was considered a very present reality.Schlesinger, \\"The Cuban Connection\\", Robert Kennedy and His Times On the last night of the crisis, President Kennedy was so grateful for his brother's work in averting nuclear war that he summed it up by saying, \\"Thank God for Bobby.\\"Clarity Through Complexity , October 2000, FindArticles.com, Retrieved June 10, 2007 = Assassination of President John F.

Edgar Hoover called and told him his brother had been shot. Hoover then hung up before he could ask any questions. Kennedy later said he thought Hoover had enjoyed telling him the news. Kennedy then received a call from Tazewell Shepard, a naval aide to the president, who told him that his brother was dead. Shortly after the call from Hoover, Kennedy phoned McGeorge Bundy at the White House, instructing him to change the locks on the president's files. He ordered the Secret Service to dismantle the Oval Office and cabinet room's secret taping systems. He scheduled a meeting with CIA director John McCone and asked if the CIA had any involvement in his brother's death. McCone denied it, with Kennedy later telling investigator Walter Sheridan that he asked the director \\"in a way that he couldn't lie to me, and they [the CIA] hadn't\\".Thomas, pp. 276‚Äì277. An hour after the president was shot, Bobby Kennedy received a phone call from Vice President Johnson before Johnson boarded Air Force One. RFK remembered their conversation starting with Johnson demonstrating sympathy before the vice president stated his belief that he should be sworn in immediately; RFK opposed the idea since he felt \\"it would be nice\\" for President Kennedy's body to return to Washington with the deceased president still being the incumbent.Sabato, p. 16. Eventually, the two concluded that the best course of action would be for Johnson to take the oath of office before returning to Washington. In his 1971 book We Band of Brothers, aide Edwin O. Guthman recounted Kennedy admitting to him an hour after receiving word of his brother's death that he thought he would be the one \\"they would get\\" as opposed to his brother. In the days following the assassination, he wrote letters to his two eldest children, Kathleen and Joseph, saying that as the oldest Kennedy family members of their generation, they had a special responsibility to remember what their uncle had started and to love and serve their country. He was originally opposed to Jacqueline Kennedy's decision to have a closed casket, as he wanted the funeral to keep with tradition, but he changed his mind after seeing the cosmetic, waxen remains. Kennedy was asked by Democratic Party leaders to introduce a film about his late brother at the 1964 party convention. When he was introduced, the crowd, including party bosses, elected officials, and delegates, applauded thunderously and tearfully for a full 22 minutes before they would let him speak.Grubin, David. RFK. American Experience, 2004. He was close to breaking down before he spoke about his brother's vision for both the party and the nation and recited a quote from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (3.2) that Jacqueline had given him: The ten-month investigation by the Warren Commission of 1963‚Äì1964 concluded that the president had been assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted alone. On September 27, 1964, Kennedy issued a statement through his New York campaign office: \\"As I said in Poland last summer, I am convinced Oswald was solely responsible for what happened and that he did not have any outside help or assistance. He was a malcontent who could not get along here or in the Soviet Union.\\" He added, \\"I have not read the report, nor do I intend to. But I have been briefed on it and I am completely satisfied that the Commission investigated every lead and examined every piece of evidence. The Commission's inquiry was thorough and conscientious.\\" After a meeting with Kennedy in 1966, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. wrote: \\"It is evident that he believes that [the Warren Commission's report] was a poor job and will not endorse it, but that he is unwilling to criticize it and thereby reopen the whole tragic business.\\" Jerry Bruno, an \\"advance man\\" for JFK who also worked on RFK's 1968 presidential campaign, would later state in 1993: \\"I talked to Robert Kennedy many times about the Warren Commission, and he never doubted their result.\\" In a 2013 interview with CBS journalist Charlie Rose, son Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that his father was \\"fairly convinced\\" that others besides Oswald were involved in his brother's assassination and that he privately believed the Commission's report was a \\"shoddy piece of craftsmanship\\". The killing was judged as having a profound impact on Kennedy. Beran assesses the assassination as having moved Kennedy away from reliance on the political system and to become more questioning. Tye views Kennedy following the death of his brother as \\"more fatalistic, having seen how fast he could lose what he cherished the most.\\"Tye, p. 314.  Vice presidential candidate  Kennedy with David Dubinsky in an undated photo. The sign in the background reads, \\"For President ‚Äì Lyndon B. Johnson\\". In the wake of the assassination of his brother and Lyndon Johnson's ascension to the presidency, with the office of vice president now vacant, Kennedy was viewed favorably as a potential candidate for the position in the 1964 presidential election. Several Kennedy partisans called for him to be drafted in tribute to his brother; national polling showed that three of four Democrats were in favor of him as Johnson's running mate. Democratic organizers supported him as a write-in candidate in the New Hampshire primary and 25,000 Democrats wrote in Kennedy's name in March 1964, only 3,700 fewer than the number of Democrats who wrote in Johnson's name as their pick for president. Kennedy discussed the vice presidency with Arthur Schlesinger. Schlesinger thought that he should develop his own political base first, and Kennedy observed that the job \\"was really based on waiting around for someone to die\\". In his first interview after the assassination Kennedy said he was not considering the vice presidency. During this time he said of the coalescing Johnson administration, \\"It's too early for me to even think about '64, because I don't know whether I want to have any part of these people. ...If they don't fulfill and follow out my brother's program, I don't want to have anything to do with them.\\" However, in January 1964 Kennedy did begin low key inquiries as to the vice-presidential position and by the summer was developing plans to help Johnson in cities and in the Northeast based on the 1960 JFK campaign strategies. Despite the fanfare within the Democratic Party, President Johnson was not inclined to have Kennedy on his ticket. The two men disliked one another intensely, with feelings often described as \\"mutual contempt\\" that went back to their first meeting in 1953, and had only intensified during JFK's presidency.Jeff Shesol, Mutual Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy, and the Feud that Defined a Decade (2012)Robert A. Caro, The Passage of Power (2012) pp. 61‚Äì63, 243‚Äì249. At the time, Johnson privately said about Kennedy that \\"I don't need that little runt to win\\" while Kennedy privately said about Johnson that he was \\"mean, bitter, vicious ‚Äî an animal in many ways\\".A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 297 To block Kennedy, Johnson considered nominating his brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, as vice presidential candidate, but the Kennedy family vetoed his name.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 294 Kenny O'Donnell, a Kennedy aide who stayed on to serve Johnson, told the president that if he wanted a Catholic vice president, the only candidate available was Kennedy.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 294 Johnson instead chose Senator Hubert Humphrey to be his running mate. During a post-presidency interview with historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, Johnson claimed that Kennedy \\"acted like he was the custodian of the Kennedy dream\\" despite Johnson being seen as this after JFK was assassinated, arguing that he had \\"waited\\" his turn and Kennedy should have done the same. Johnson recalled a \\"tidal wave of letters and memos about how great a vice president Bobby would be\\" being swept upon him, but knowing that he could not \\"let it happen\\" as he viewed the possibility of having Kennedy on the ticket as ensuring that he would never know if he could be elected \\"on my own\\". On 27 July 1964, Kennedy was summoned to the White House to be told by Johnson that he did not want him as his running mate, leading the former to say \\"I could have helped you\\".A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 298 Johnson wanted Kennedy to tell the media that he decided to withdraw his name, but he refused, saying the president could do that himself.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 298 Johnson wanted a way to announce that he had refused Kennedy serving as his running mate without appearing to be motivated by malice towards a man he disliked and distrusted.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 298 The Democratic powerbroker Clark Clifford suggested to Johnson a way to block Kennedy. At a meeting in the Oval Office that, unknown to him, was being recorded, Clifford said: \\"Why don't you reach a policy decision that, after careful consideration, you've decided that you're not going to select anyone from your cabinet?\\"A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 298 When Johnson replied \\"That's pretty thin, isn't it?\\", leading Clifford to answer, \\"Well, it is pretty thin, but it's a lot better than nothing\\".A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 298 In July 1964, Johnson issued an official statement ruling out all of his current cabinet members as potential running mates, judging them to be \\"so valuable ... in their current posts\\". In response to this statement, angry letters poured in directed towards both Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird, expressing disappointment at Kennedy being dropped from the field of potential running mates. Johnson, worried that delegates at the convention would draft Kennedy onto the ticket, ordered the FBI to monitor Kennedy's contacts and actions, and to make sure that he could not speak until after Hubert Humphrey was confirmed as his running mate. After making his announcement, Johnson at an \\"off-the-record\\" meeting in the Oval Office with three journalists boasted about how he had gotten \\"that damned albatross off his neck\\" as he proceeded to mock what he called Kennedy's \\"funny\\" voice and mannerisms.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 298 Though not published in the newspapers, Kennedy quickly learned of Johnson's performance and demanded an apology, only to have the president deny the story.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 298-299 After hearing Johnson's denial, Kennedy wrote: \\"He tells so many lies that he convinces himself after a while he's telling the truth. He just doesn't recognize truth or falsehood\\".A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 299 Johnson in a meeting with the Secretary of State Dean Rusk talked much about Kennedy. Both felt that Kennedy was \\"freakish ambitious\\" with Rusk saying: \\"Mr. President, I just can't wrap my mind around that kind of ambition. I don't know how to understand it\\".A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 310 Both Johnson and Rusk were afraid at the Democratic National Convention that Kennedy might use the nostalgia for his assassinated brother to \\"stampede\\" the delegates to nominate him, and were hoping that Kennedy might run for Senate in New York, though Rusk was also worried that a Senate run would serve as \\"a drag on your own position in New York state\\".A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 310 Furthermore, white Southerners tended to vote Democratic as a bloc at the time, and a poll in 1964 showed that 33% of Southerners would not vote Democratic if the civil rights supporter Kennedy were Johnson's running mate, which caused many Democrat leaders to oppose Kennedy serving as Vice President, lest it alienate one of the most solid and reliable blocs of Democratic voters.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 297 At the Democratic National Convention, Kennedy appeared on the stage to introduce a film honoring his late brother entitled A Thousand Days, causing the convention hall to explode with cheers for 22 minutes despite Kennedy's gestures indicating that he wanted the crowd to fall silent so he could began his speech.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 311-312 Senator Henry Jackson advised Kennedy to \\"Let them get it out of their system\\" as he stood on the stage raising his hand to signal he wanted the crowd to stop cheering.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 312 When the crowd finally stopped cheering, Kennedy gave his speech which ended with a quotation from Romeo and Juliet: \\"When he shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine, That all the world shall be in love with night, and pay no worship to the garish sun\\".A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 312 Johnson knew instantly that the reference to the \\"garish sun\\" that Kennedy quoted from Shakespeare was to him.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 312 U.S. Senate (1965‚Äì1968) = 1964 election = Kennedy at the 1964 Democratic National Convention Nine months after his brother's assassination, Kennedy left the cabinet to run for a seat in the U.S. Senate representing New York,Dallek (1998), Flawed Giant: Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1961‚Äì1973, p. 58. announcing his candidacy on August 25, 1964, two days before the end of that year's Democratic National Convention. He had considered the possibility of running for the seat since early spring, but also giving consideration for governor of Massachusetts or, as he put it, \\"go away\\", leaving politics altogether after the plane crash and injury of his brother Ted in June, two months earlier.Thomas, pp. 293. Positive reception in Europe convinced him to remain in politics.Schlesinger (1978), p. 666. Kennedy was lauded during trips to Germany and Poland, the denizens of the latter country's greetings to Kennedy being interpreted by Leaming as evaporating the agony he had sustained since his brother's passing.Leaming, Barbara (2014). Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis: The Untold Story. Macmillan. pp. 178‚Äì179. . Kennedy was given permission to run by the New York State Democratic Committee on September 1, amid mixed feelings in regards to his candidacy. He also received the nomination of the Liberal Party of New York. Despite their notoriously difficult relationship, Johnson gave considerable support to Kennedy's campaign. His opponent in the 1964 race was Republican incumbent Kenneth Keating, who attempted to portray Kennedy as an arrogant carpetbagger since he did not reside in the state.Schlesinger, p. 668. The New York Times editorialized, \\"there is nothing illegal about the possible nomination of Robert F. Kennedy of Massachusetts as Senator from New York, but there is plenty of cynical about it, ... merely choosing the state as a convenient launching‚Äêpad for the political ambitions of himself.\\"Tye, pp. 320 The primary reason Kennedy chose not to run for the U.S. Senate from his home state of Massachusetts was because his younger brother Ted was running for re-election. RFK charged Keating with having \\"not done much of anything constructive\\" despite his presence in Congress during a September 8 press conference. Kennedy won the November election, helped in part by Johnson's huge victory margin in New York.Leaming, Barbara (2014). Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis: The Untold Story. Macmillan. pp. 189‚Äì190. . =Tenure= Kennedy drew attention in Congress early on as the brother of President Kennedy, which set him apart from other senators. He drew more than fifty senators as spectators when he delivered a speech in the Senate on nuclear proliferation in June 1965.Palermo, pp. 8‚Äì9. However, he also saw a decline in his power, going from the president's most trusted advisor to one of a hundred senators, and his impatience with collaborative lawmaking showed. Though fellow senator Fred R. Harris expected not to like Kennedy, the two became allies; Harris even called them \\"each other's best friends in the Senate\\". Kennedy's younger brother Ted was his senior there. Robert saw his brother as a guide on managing within the Senate, and the arrangement worked to deepen their relationship. Senator Harris noted that Kennedy was intense about matters and issues which concerned him.Schlesinger (2002) [1978], pp. 682, 683. Kennedy gained a reputation in the Senate for being well prepared for debate, however his tendency to speak to other senators in a more \\"blunt\\" fashion caused him to be \\"unpopular ... with many of his colleagues\\". President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Immigration Act of 1965 as Ted and Robert Kennedy and others look on While serving in the Senate, Kennedy advocated gun control. In May 1965 he co- sponsored S.1592, proposed by President Johnson and sponsored by Senator Thomas J. Dodd, that would put federal restrictions on mail-order gun sales. Speaking in support of the bill, Kennedy said, \\"For too long we dealt with these deadly weapons as if they were harmless toys. Yet their very presence, the ease of their acquisition and the familiarity of their appearance have led to thousands of deaths each year. With the passage of this bill we will begin to meet our responsibilities. It would save hundreds of thousands of lives in this country and spare thousands of families ... grief and heartache. ... \\" In remarks during a May 1968 campaign stop in Roseburg, Oregon, Kennedy defended the bill as keeping firearms away from \\"people who have no business with guns or rifles\\". The bill forbade \\"mail order sale of guns to the very young, those with criminal records and the insane,\\" according to The Oregonian's report. S.1592 and subsequent bills, and the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, paved the way for the eventual passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968. Kennedy and his staff had employed a cautionary \\"amendments‚Äìonly\\" strategy for his first year in the senate. In 1966 and 1967 they took more direct legislative action, but were met with increasing resistance from the Johnson administration.Shesol (1997) p. 329 Despite perceptions that the two were hostile in their respective offices to each other, U.S. News reported Kennedy's support of the Johnson administration's \\"Great Society\\" program through his voting record. Kennedy supported both major and minor parts of the program, and each year over 60% of his roll call votes were consistently in favor of Johnson's policies.Shesol (1997) p. 336. On February 8, 1966, Kennedy urged the United States to pledge that it would not be the first country to use nuclear weapons against countries that did not have them noting that China had made the pledge and the Soviet Union indicated it was also willing to do so. In June 1966, he visited apartheid-era South Africa accompanied by his wife, Ethel, and a few aides. The tour was greeted with international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. He spoke out against the oppression of the native population, and was welcomed by the black population as though he were a visiting head of state. In an interview with Look magazine he said: At the University of Cape Town he delivered the annual Day of Affirmation Address. A quote from this address appears on his memorial at Arlington National Cemetery: \\"Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope.\\" On January 28, 1967, Kennedy began a ten-day stay in Europe, meeting Harold Wilson in London who advised him to tell President Johnson about his belief that the ongoing Vietnam conflict was wrong. Upon returning to the U.S. in early February, he was confronted by the press who asked him if his conversations abroad had negatively impacted American foreign relations.Shesol (1997) pp. 364‚Äì365. Kennedy speaks with a youth while touring Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant in Brooklyn, N.Y., February 1966 During his years as a senator, he helped to start a successful redevelopment project in poverty- stricken Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant, Brooklyn. Schlesinger wrote that Kennedy had hoped Bedford-Stuyvesant would become an example of self-imposed growth for other impoverished neighborhoods. Kennedy had difficulty securing support from President Johnson, whose administration was charged by Kennedy as having opposed a \\"special impact\\" program meant to bring about the federal progress that he had supported. Robert B. Semple Jr. repeated similar sentiments in September 1967, writing the Johnson administration was preparing \\"a concentrated attack\\" on Robert F. Kennedy's proposal that Semple claimed would \\"build more and better low-cost housing in the slums through private enterprise.\\" Kennedy confided to journalist Jack Newfield that while he tried collaborating with the administration through courting its members and compromising with the bill, \\"They didn't even try to work something out together. To them it's all just politics.\\"Schlesinger, p. 789. Pel√© and Kennedy shaking hands after a game at Maracan√£ Stadium, Rio de Janeiro He also visited the Mississippi Delta as a member of the Senate committee reviewing the effectiveness of \\"War on Poverty\\" programs, particularly that of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Marian Wright Edelman described Kennedy as \\"deeply moved and outraged\\" by the sight of the starving children living in the economically abysmal climate, changing her impression of him from \\"tough, arrogant, and politically driven.\\" Edelman noted further that the senator requested she call on Martin Luther King Jr. to bring the impoverished to Washington, D.C., to make them more visible, leading to the creation of the Poor People's Campaign. Kennedy sought to remedy the problems of poverty through legislation to encourage private industry to locate in poverty- stricken areas, thus creating jobs for the unemployed, and stressed the importance of work over welfare. Kennedy worked on the Senate Labor Committee at the time of the workers' rights activism of Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, and the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA).Mills, pp. 339‚Äì340. At the request of labor leader Walter Reuther, who had previously marched with and provided money to Chavez, Kennedy flew out to Delano, California, to investigate the situation. Although little attention was paid to the first two committee hearings in March 1966 for legislation to include farm workers by an amendment of the National Labor Relations Act, Kennedy's attendance at the third hearing brought media coverage. Biographer Thomas wrote that Kennedy was moved after seeing the conditions of the workers, who he deemed were being taken advantage of. Chavez stressed to Kennedy that migrant workers needed to be recognized as human beings. Kennedy later engaged in an exchange with Kern County sheriff Leroy Galyen where he criticized the sheriff's deputies for taking photographs of \\"people on picket lines.\\"Pawel, p. 123. As a senator, he was popular among African Americans and other minorities including Native Americans and immigrant groups. He spoke forcefully in favor of what he called the \\"disaffected\\",Thomas, p. 196. the impoverished, and \\"the excluded\\",Edelman, p. 34. thereby aligning himself with leaders of the civil rights struggle and social justice campaigners, leading the Democratic party in pursuit of a more aggressive agenda to eliminate perceived discrimination on all levels. He supported desegregation busing, integration of all public facilities, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and anti-poverty social programs to increase education, offer opportunities for employment, and provide health care for African Americans. Consistent with President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, he also placed increasing emphasis on human rights as a central focus of U.S. foreign policy. Vietnam The JFK administration had backed U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world in the frame of the Cold War, but Kennedy was not known to be involved in discussions on the Vietnam War when he was his brother's attorney general.Schlesinger (2002) [1978], p. 727.Hilty, p. 460. According to historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, before choosing to run for the Senate, Kennedy had sought an ambassadorship to South Vietnam. Entering the Senate, Kennedy initially kept private his disagreements with President Johnson on the war. While Kennedy vigorously supported his brother's earlier efforts, he never publicly advocated commitment of ground troops. Though bothered by the beginning of the bombing of North Vietnam in February 1965, Kennedy did not wish to appear antipathetic to the president's agenda.Mills, p. 359. But by April, Kennedy was advocating a halt to the bombing to Johnson, who acknowledged that Kennedy played a part in influencing his choice to temporarily cease bombing the following month. Kennedy cautioned Johnson against sending combat troops as early as 1965, but Johnson chose instead to follow the recommendation of the rest of his predecessor's still intact staff of advisers. In July, after Johnson made a large commitment of American ground forces to Vietnam, Kennedy made multiple calls for a settlement through negotiation. The next month, John Paul Vann, a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army, wrote that Kennedy \\"indicat[ed] comprehension of the problems we face\\", in a letter to the senator.Palmero, p. 13. In December 1965, Kennedy advised his friend, the Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, that he should counsel Johnson to declare a ceasefire in Vietnam, a bombing pause over North Vietnam, and to take up an offer by Algeria to serve as a \\"honest broker\\" in peace talks.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 409 The left-wing Algerian government had friendly relations with North Vietnam and the National Liberation Front and had indicated in 1965-1966 that it was willing to serve as a conduit for peace talks, but most of Johnson's advisers were leery of the Algerian offer.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 416 On 31 January 1966, Kennedy in a speech on the Senate floor stated: \\"If we regard bombing as the answer in Vietnam, we are headed straight for disaster\\".A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 422 In February 1966, Kennedy released a peace plan that called for preserving South Vietnam while at the same time allowing the National Liberation Front, better known as the Viet Cong, to join a coalition government in Saigon.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 422 When asked by reporters if he was speaking on behalf of Johnson, Kennedy replied: \\"I don't think anyone has ever suggested that I was speaking for the White House\\".A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 422 Kennedy's peace plan made front page news with The New York Times calling it a break with the president while the Chicago Tribunal labelled him in an editorial \\"Ho Chi Kennedy\\".A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 423 Vice President Humphrey on a visit to New Zealand stated that Kennedy's \\"peace recipe\\" included \\"a dose of arsenic\\" while the National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy quoted to the press Kennedy's remarks from 1963 saying he was against including Communists in coalition governments (though Kennedy's subject was Germany, not Vietnam).A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 423 Kennedy was displeased when he heard anti-war protesters chanting his name, saying \\"I'm not Wayne Morse\\".A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 423 To put aside reports of a rift with Johnson, Kennedy flew with Johnson on Air Force One on a trip to New York on 23 February 1966, and barely clapped his hands in approval when Johnson denied waging a war of conquest in Vietnam.A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 423 In an interview with the Today program, Kennedy conceded that his views on Vietnam were \\"a little confusing\\".A.J. Langguth Our Vietnam (2000) pp. 423 Senator Robert F. Kennedy and President Lyndon B. Johnson in the Oval Office, 1966 In April 1966, Kennedy had a private meeting with Philip Heymann of the State Department's Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs to discuss efforts to secure the release of American prisoners of war in Vietnam. Kennedy wanted to press the Johnson administration to do more, but Heymann insisted that the administration believed the \\"consequences of sitting down with the Viet Cong\\" mattered more than the prisoners they were holding captive.Palmero, pp. 33‚Äì34. On June 29 of that year, Kennedy released a statement disavowing President Johnson's choice to bomb Haiphong, but he avoided criticizing either the war or the president's overall foreign policy, believing that it might harm Democratic candidates in the 1966 midterm elections.Palmero, pp. 36‚Äì37. In August, the International Herald Tribune described Kennedy's popularity as outpacing President Johnson's, crediting Kennedy's attempts to end the Vietnam conflict which the public increasingly desired. In the early part of 1967, Kennedy traveled to Europe, where he had discussions about Vietnam with leaders and diplomats. A story leaked to the State Department that Kennedy was talking about seeking peace while President Johnson was pursuing the war. Johnson became convinced that Kennedy was undermining his authority. He voiced this during a meeting with Kennedy, who reiterated the interest of the European leaders to pause the bombing while going forward with negotiations; Johnson declined to do so. On March 2, Kennedy outlined a three-point plan to end the war which included suspending the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam, and the eventual withdrawal of American and North Vietnamese soldiers from South Vietnam; this plan was rejected by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, who believed North Vietnam would never agree to it. On May 15, Kennedy debated Governor of California Ronald Reagan about the war.Sabato, p.340. On November 26, 1967, during an appearance on Face the Nation, Kennedy asserted that the Johnson administration had deviated from his brother's policies in Vietnam, his first time contrasting the two administrations' policies on the war. He added that the view that Americans were fighting to end communism in Vietnam was \\"immoral\\".Shesol, p. 386.Clarke, p. 32. On February 8, 1968, Kennedy delivered an address in Chicago, where he critiqued Saigon \\"government corruption\\" and expressed his disagreement with the Johnson administration's stance that the war would determine the future of Asia. On March 14, Kennedy met with defense secretary Clark Clifford at the Pentagon regarding the war. Clifford's notes indicate that Kennedy was offering not to enter the ongoing Democratic presidential primary if President Johnson would admit publicly to having been wrong in his war policy and appoint \\"a group of persons to conduct a study in depth of the issues and come up with a recommended course of action\\"; Johnson rejected the proposal.Hilty, p. 614. On April 1, after President Johnson halted bombing of North Vietnam, RFK said the decision was a \\"step toward peace\\" and, though offering to collaborate with Johnson for national unity, opted to continue his presidential bid. On May 1, while in Lafayette, Indiana, Kennedy said continued delays in beginning peace talks with North Vietnam meant both more lives lost and the postponing of the \\"domestic progress\\" hoped for by the US. Later that month, Kennedy called the war \\"the gravest kind of error\\" in a speech in Corvallis, Oregon. In an interview on June 4, hours before he was shot, Kennedy continued to advocate for a change in policy towards the war. Despite his criticism of the Vietnam War and the South Vietnam government, Kennedy also stated in his 1968 campaign brochure that he did not support either a simple withdrawal or a surrender in South Vietnam and favored instead a change in the course of action taken so it would bring an \\"honorable peace.\\"Robert F. Kennedy 1968 for President Campaign Brochure Accessed May 20, 2018. Presidential candidate Tired but still intense in the last days before his Oregon defeat, Robert Kennedy speaks from the platform of a campaign train. In 1968 President Johnson prepared to run for re-election. In January, faced with what was widely considered an unrealistic race against an incumbent president, Kennedy stated that he would not seek the presidency. After the Tet Offensive in Vietnam in early February 1968, he received a letter from writer Pete Hamill that said poor people kept pictures of President Kennedy on their walls and that Kennedy had an \\"obligation of staying true to whatever it was that put those pictures on those walls.\\"Schlesinger (1978) p. 845 Kennedy traveled to Delano, California, to meet with civil rights activist C√©sar Ch√°vez, who was on a 25-day hunger strike showing his commitment to nonviolence. It was on this visit to California that Kennedy decided he would challenge Johnson for the presidency, telling his former Justice Department aides, Edwin Guthman and Peter Edelman, that his first step was to get lesser-known Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota to drop out of the presidential race. The weekend before the New Hampshire primary, Kennedy announced to several aides that he would attempt to persuade McCarthy to withdraw from the race to avoid splitting the antiwar vote, but Senator George McGovern urged Kennedy to wait until after that primary to announce his candidacy. Johnson won a narrow victory in the New Hampshire primary on March 12, 1968, against McCarthy, but this close second- place result dramatically boosted McCarthy's standing in the race. After much speculation, and reports leaking out about his plans, and seeing in McCarthy's success that Johnson's hold on the job was not as strong as originally thought, Kennedy declared his candidacy on March 16, 1968, in the Caucus Room of the old Senate office building, the same room where his brother had declared his own candidacy eight years earlier. He stated, \\"I do not run for the presidency merely to oppose any man, but to propose new policies. I run because I am convinced that this country is on a perilous course and because I have such strong feelings about what must be done, and I feel that I'm obliged to do all I can.\\" McCarthy supporters angrily denounced Kennedy as an opportunist. They believed that McCarthy had taken the most courageous stand by opposing the sitting president of his own party and that his surprising result in New Hampshire had earned him the mantle of being the anti-war candidate. Kennedy's announcement split the anti-war movement in two. On March 31, 1968, Johnson stunned the nation by dropping out of the race. Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a champion of the labor unions and a long supporter of civil rights, entered the race with the financial backing and critical endorsement of the party \\"establishment\\", including most members of Congress, mayors, governors, \\"the south\\", and several major labor unions. With state registration deadlines long past, Humphrey joined the race too late to enter any primaries but had the support of the president.Schlesinger (2002) [1978], p. 884. Kennedy, like his brother before him, planned to win the nomination through popular support in the primaries. Kennedy campaigning in Los Angeles (photo courtesy of John F. Kennedy Presidential Library & Museum, Boston) Kennedy ran on a platform of racial and economic justice, non-aggression in foreign policy, decentralization of power, and social change. A crucial element of his campaign was an engagement with the young, whom he identified as being the future of a reinvigorated American society based on partnership and equality. His policy objectives did not sit well with the business community, where he was viewed as something of a fiscal liability, opposed as they were to the tax increases necessary to fund social programs. At one of his university speeches (Indiana University Medical School), he was asked, \\"Where are we going to get the money to pay for all these new programs you're proposing?\\" He replied to the medical students, about to enter lucrative careers, \\"From you.\\"Newfield, Jack. (1988) [1969]. Robert Kennedy: A Memoir. Plume It was this intense and frank mode of dialogue with which he was to continue to engage those whom he viewed as not being traditional allies of Democratic ideals or initiatives. In a speech at the University of Alabama, he argued, \\"I believe that any who seek high office this year must go before all Americans, not just those who agree with them, but also those who disagree, recognizing that it is not just our supporters, not just those who vote for us, but all Americans who we must lead in the difficult years ahead.\\" He aroused rabid animosity in some quarters, with J. Edgar Hoover's Deputy Clyde Tolson reported as saying, \\"I hope that someone shoots and kills the son of a bitch.\\"Clyde Tolson, qu. in: Thurston Clarke, 'The Last Good Campaign', Vanity Fair, No. 574, June 2008, p. 173. Kennedy's presidential campaign brought out both \\"great enthusiasm\\" and anger in people. His message of change raised hope for some and brought fear to others. Kennedy wanted to be a bridge across the divide of American society. His bid for the presidency saw not only a continuation of the programs he and his brother had undertaken during the president's term in office, but also an extension of Johnson's Great Society.Schlesinger (2002) [1978], p. xvi. Kennedy visited numerous small towns and made himself available to the masses by participating in long motorcades and street-corner stump speeches, often in troubled inner cities. He made urban poverty a chief concern of his campaign, which in part led to enormous crowds that would attend his events in poor urban areas or rural parts of Appalachia.Schlesinger (2002) [1978], pp. 863, 864, 882, 883. speech on Martin Luther King Jr. On April 4, 1968, Kennedy learned of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and gave a heartfelt impromptu speech in Indianapolis's inner city, calling for a reconciliation between the races. The address was the first time Kennedy spoke publicly about his brother's killing. Riots broke out in 60 cities in the wake of King's death, but not in Indianapolis, a fact many attribute to the effect of this speech. Kennedy addressed the City Club of Cleveland the next day, on April 5, 1968, delivering the famous On the Mindless Menace of Violence speech. He attended King's funeral, accompanied by Jacqueline and Ted Kennedy. He was described as being the \\"only white politician to hear only cheers and applause.\\"Clarke, p. 129. Despite Kennedy's high profile and name recognition, McCarthy won most of the early primaries, including Kennedy's native state of Massachusetts and some primaries in which he and Kennedy were in direct competition.name=\\"Rising1997\\"> Kennedy won the Indiana Democratic primary on May 7 with 42 percent of the vote, and the Nebraska primary on May 14 with 52 percent of the vote. On May 28, Kennedy lost the Oregon primary, marking the first time a Kennedy lost an election, and it was assumed that McCarthy was the preferred choice among the young voters. If he could defeat McCarthy in the California primary, the leadership of the campaign thought, he would knock McCarthy out of the race and set up a one-on-one against Vice President Humphrey at the Chicago national convention in August. Assassination Ambassador Hotel moments before the assassination, June 4, 1968 Kennedy scored major victories when he won both the California and South Dakota primaries on June 4. He addressed his supporters shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, in a ballroom at The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Leaving the ballroom, he went through the hotel kitchen after being told it was a shortcut to a press room. He did this despite being advised by his bodyguard‚Äîformer FBI agent Bill Barry‚Äîto avoid the kitchen. In a crowded kitchen passageway, Kennedy turned to his left and shook hands with hotel busboy Juan Romero just as Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian, opened fire with a .22-caliber revolver. Kennedy was hit three times, and five other people were wounded. George Plimpton, former decathlete Rafer Johnson, and former professional football player Rosey Grier are credited with wrestling Sirhan to the ground after he shot the senator. As Kennedy lay mortally wounded, Romero cradled his head and placed a rosary in his hand. Kennedy asked Romero, \\"Is everybody OK?\\", and Romero responded, \\"Yes, everybody's OK.\\" Kennedy then turned away from Romero and said, \\"Everything's going to be OK.\\" After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted the senator onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, \\"Don't lift me\\", which were his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. He was rushed first to Los Angeles' Central Receiving Hospital, less than east of the Ambassador Hotel, and then to the adjoining (one city block distant) Good Samaritan Hospital. Despite extensive neurosurgery to remove the bullet and bone fragments from his brain, Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1:44 a.m. (PDT) on June 6, nearly 26 hours after the shooting. Robert Kennedy's death, like the 1963 assassination of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, has been the subject of conspiracy theories. =Funeral= Kennedy's body was returned to Manhattan, where it lay in repose at Saint Patrick's Cathedral from approximately 10:00 p.m. until 10:00 a.m. on June 8.Lukas, J. Anthony. \\"Kennedy's Body Is Flown Here For Funeral Rites.\\" The New York Times. June 7, 1968. A high requiem Mass was held at the cathedral at 10:00 a.m. on June 8. The service was attended by members of the extended Kennedy family, President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson, and members of the Johnson cabinet.Shipler, David K. \\"Family Serves in Funeral Mass.\\" The New York Times. June 9, 1968; Kilpatrick, Carroll. \\"Johnsons Attend Kennedy Services.\\" Washington Post. June 9, 1968. Ted, the only surviving Kennedy brother, said the following: Robert F. Kennedy's grave in Arlington National Cemetery The requiem Mass concluded with the hymn \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\", sung by Andy Williams. Immediately following the Mass, Kennedy's body was transported by a special private train to Washington, D.C. Kennedy's funeral train was pulled by two Penn Central GG1 electric locomotives. Thousands of mourners lined the tracks and stations along the route, paying their respects as the train passed. The train departed New York at 12:30 pm.\\"Kennedy Rites Are Announced.\\" Washington Post. June 7, 1968. When it arrived in Elizabeth, New Jersey, an eastbound train on a parallel track to the funeral train hit and killed two spectators and seriously injured four, after they were unable to get off the track in time, even though the eastbound train's engineer had slowed to 30 mph for the normally 55 mph curve, blown his horn continuously, and rung his bell through the curve.Wicker, Tom. President Joins Kennedys in Tribute at Graveside. The New York Times. June 9, 1968. The normally four-hour trip took more than eight hours because of the thick crowds lining the tracks on the journey.Reed, Roy. \\"Thousands Visit Kennedy's Grave on Day of Mourning.\\" The New York Times.

June 8, 1968. but sticking brakes on the casket- bearing car contributed to delays, and the train finally arrived at 9:10 p.m. on June 8. =Burial= Kennedy was buried close to his brother John in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. Although he had always maintained that he wished to be buried in Massachusetts, his family believed Robert should be interred in Arlington next to his brother.Martin, p. 19; Barnes, p. 289. The procession left Union Station and passed the New Senate Office Building, where he had his offices, and then proceeded to the Lincoln Memorial, where it paused. The Marine Corps Band played The Battle Hymn of the Republic. The funeral motorcade arrived at the cemetery at 10:24 pm. As the vehicles entered the cemetery, people lining the roadway spontaneously lit candles to guide the motorcade to the burial site. The 15-minute ceremony began at 10:30 p.m. Cardinal Patrick O'Boyle, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington, officiated at the graveside service in lieu of Cardinal Richard Cushing of Boston, who fell ill during the trip. Also officiating was Archbishop of New York Terence Cooke. On behalf of the United States, John Glenn presented the folded flag to Senator Ted Kennedy, who passed it to Robert's eldest son, Joe, who passed it to Ethel Kennedy. The Navy Band played The Navy Hymn. Officials at Arlington National Cemetery said that Kennedy's burial was the only night burial to have taken place at the cemetery. (The re-interment of Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, who died two days after his birth in August 1963, and a stillborn daughter, Arabella, both children of President Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline, also occurred at night.) After the president was interred in Arlington Cemetery, the two infants were buried next to him on December 5, 1963, in a private ceremony without publicity. His brother, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was also buried at night, in 2009.)Barry, Dan. \\"Kennedy Mourners Memorialize 'Soul of the Democratic Party'.\\" New York Times. August 30, 2009. Accessed 2012-07-22. On June 9, President Lyndon B. Johnson assigned security staff to all U.S. presidential candidates and declared an official national day of mourning. After the assassination, the mandate of the U.S. Secret Service was altered by Congress to include the protection of U.S. presidential candidates. Robert F. Kennedy Memorial built in 1971 across from his grave in Arlington National Cemetery Personal life =Family= The Kennedy brothers. Presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, Bobby, and Ted, July 1960 in Cape Cod, Massachusetts On June 17, 1950, Kennedy married socialite Ethel Skakel, the third daughter of businessman George and Ann Skakel (n√©e Brannack), at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Greenwich, Connecticut. The couple had 11 children; Kathleen (b. 1951), Joseph (b. 1952), Robert Jr. (b. 1954), David (1955‚Äì1984), Courtney (b. 1956), Michael (1958‚Äì1997), Kerry (b. 1959), Christopher (b. 1963), Max (b. 1965), Douglas (b. 1967), and Rory (b. December 1968, after her father's assassination). Kennedy owned a home at the well-known Kennedy compound on Cape Cod, in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts; however, he spent most of his time at his estate in McLean, Virginia, known as Hickory Hill (located west of Washington, D.C.). His widow, Ethel, and their children continued to live at Hickory Hill after his death. Ethel Kennedy sold Hickory Hill for $8.25 million in 2009. =Attitudes and approach= Kennedy was said to be the gentlest and shyest of the family, as well as the least articulate orally. By the time he was a young boy, his grandmother, Josie Fitzgerald, worried he would become a \\"sissy\\". His mother had a similar concern, as he was the \\"smallest and thinnest\\", but soon afterward, the family discovered \\"there was no fear of that\\". Family friend Lem Billings met Kennedy when he was eight years old and would later reflect that he loved him, adding that Kennedy \\"was the nicest little boy I ever met\\". Billings also said Kennedy was barely noticed \\"in the early days, but that's because he didn't bother anybody\\". Luella Hennessey, who became the nurse for the Kennedy children when Kennedy was 12, called him \\"the most thoughtful and considerate\\" of his siblings.Schlesinger, pp. 21‚Äì23. Kennedy was teased by his siblings, as in their family it was a norm for humor to be displayed in that fashion. He would turn jokes on himself or remain silent.Thomas, pp. 30‚Äì31. Despite his gentle demeanor, he could be outspoken, and once engaged a priest in a public argument that horrified his mother, who later conceded that he had been correct all along. Even when arguing for a noble cause, his comments could have \\"a cutting quality\\".Hilty, pp. 51‚Äì52. Although Joe Kennedy's most ambitious dreams centered around Bobby's older brothers, Bobby maintained the code of personal loyalty that seemed to infuse the life of his family. His competitiveness was admired by his father and elder brothers, while his loyalty bound them more affectionately close. A rather timid child, he was often the target of his father's dominating temperament. Working on the campaigns of older brother John, he was more involved, passionate, and tenacious than the candidate himself, obsessed with detail, fighting out every battle, and taking workers to task. He had always been closer to John than the other members of the family. Kennedy's opponents on Capitol Hill maintained that his collegiate magnanimity was sometimes hindered by a tenacious and somewhat impatient manner. His professional life was dominated by the same attitudes that governed his family life: a certainty that good humor and leisure must be balanced by service and accomplishment. Schlesinger comments that Kennedy could be both the most ruthlessly diligent and yet generously adaptable of politicians, at once both temperamental and forgiving. In this he was very much his father's son, lacking truly lasting emotional independence, and yet possessing a great desire to contribute. He lacked the innate self- confidence of his contemporaries yet found a greater self-assurance in the experience of married life, an experience that he stated had given him a base of self-belief from which to continue his efforts in the public arena. Upon hearing yet again the assertion that he was \\"ruthless\\", Kennedy once joked to a reporter, \\"If I find out who has called me ruthless I will destroy him.\\" He also confessed to possessing a bad temper that required self-control: \\"My biggest problem as counsel is to keep my temper. I think we all feel that when a witness comes before the United States Senate, he has an obligation to speak frankly and tell the truth. To see people sit in front of us and lie and evade makes me boil inside. But you can't lose your temper; if you do, the witness has gotten the best of you.\\"Schlesinger, p. 150. Attorney Michael O'Donnell wrote, \\"[Kennedy] offered that most intoxicating of political aphrodisiacs: authenticity. He was blunt to a fault, and his favorite campaign activity was arguing with college students. To many, his idealistic opportunism was irresistible.\\" > In his earlier life, Kennedy had developed a reputation as the family's > attack dog. He was a hostile cross-examiner on Joseph McCarthy's Senate > committee; a fixer and leg-breaker as JFK's campaign manager; an unforgiving > and merciless cutthroat‚Äîhis father's son right down to Joseph Kennedy's > purported observation that \\"he hates like me.\\" Yet Bobby Kennedy somehow > became a liberal icon, an antiwar visionary who tried to outflank Lyndon > Johnson's Great Society from the left. On Kennedy's ideological development, his brother John once remarked, \\"He might once have been intolerant of liberals as such because his early experience was with that high-minded, high-speaking kind who never got anything done. That all changed the moment he met a liberal like Walter Reuther.\\" =Religious faith and Greek philosophy= Kennedy's Catholicism was central to his politics and personal attitude to life and its purpose; he inherited his faith from his family. He was more religious than his brothers and approached his duties with a Catholic worldview. Throughout his life, he made reference to his faith, how it informed every area of his life, and how it gave him the strength to re-enter politics following his older brother's assassination. His was not an unresponsive and staid faith, but the faith of a Catholic Radical, perhaps the first successful Catholic Radical in American political history.Schlesinger, p. 191 Cf. Murray Kempton, The Progressive, September 1960. In the last years of his life, he also found great solace in the playwrights and poets of ancient Greece, especially the writings of Aeschylus, suggested to him by Jacqueline after JFK's death. In his Indianapolis speech on April 4, 1968, on the day of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Kennedy quoted these lines from Aeschylus: > Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the > heart, until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the > awful grace of God.  Legacy  Kennedy was the first sibling of a president of the United States to serve as U.S. Attorney General. Biographer Evan Thomas wrote that at times Kennedy misused his powers by \\"modern standards\\", but concluded, \\"on the whole, even counting his warts, he was a great attorney general.\\" Walter Isaacson commented that Kennedy \\"turned out arguably to be the best attorney general in history\\", praising him for his championing of civil rights and other initiatives of the administration. As Kennedy stepped down from being attorney general in 1964 to assume the office of senator from New York, The New York Times, notably having criticized his appointment three years prior, praised Kennedy for raising the standards of the position. Some of his successor attorneys general have been unfavorably compared to him, for not displaying the same level of poise in the profession. Near the end of his time in office as attorney general under Barack Obama, Eric Holder cited Kennedy as the inspiration for his belief that the Justice Department could be \\"a force for that which is right.\\" Kennedy has also been praised for his oratorical abilities and his skill at creating unity. Joseph A. Palermo of The Huffington Post observed that Kennedy's words \\"could cut through social boundaries and partisan divides in a way that seems nearly impossible today.\\" Dolores Huerta and Philip W. Johnston expressed the view that Kennedy, both in his speeches and actions, was unique in his willingness to take political risks. That blunt sincerity was said by associates to be authentic; Frank N. Magill wrote that Kennedy's oratorical skills lent their support to minorities and other disenfranchised groups who began seeing him as an ally. Look Kennedy's assassination was a blow to the optimism for a brighter future that his campaign had brought for many Americans who lived through the turbulent 1960s. Juan Romero, the busboy who shook hands with Kennedy right before he was shot, later said, \\"It made me realize that no matter how much hope you have it can be taken away in a second.\\" Kennedy's death has been cited as a significant factor in the Democratic Party's loss of the 1968 presidential election. Since his passing, Kennedy has become generally well-respected by liberals and conservatives, which is far from the polarized views of him during his lifetime. Joe Scarborough, John Ashcroft, Tom Bradley, Mark Dayton, John Kitzhaber, Max Cleland, Tim Cook, Phil Bredesen, Joe Biden, J. K. Rowling, Jim McGreevey, Gavin Newsom, and Ray Mabus have acknowledged Kennedy's influence on them. Josh Zeitz of Politico observed, \\"Bobby Kennedy has since become an American folk hero‚Äîthe tough, crusading liberal gunned down in the prime of life.\\" Kennedy's (and to a lesser extent his older brother's) ideas about using government authority to assist less fortunate peoples became central to American liberalism as a tenet of the \\"Kennedy legacy\\". Honors President George W. Bush dedicates The Justice Department building in honor of Robert Kennedy as Ethel Kennedy looks on. In the months and years after Robert F. Kennedy's death, numerous roads, public schools, and other facilities across the United States have been named in his memory. The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights was founded in 1968, with an international award program to recognize human rights activists. The sports stadium in Washington, D.C., was renamed Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in 1969. In 1978 the United States Congress awarded Kennedy its Gold Medal of Honor. On January 12, 1979, a 15-cent commemorative U.S. Postal Service stamp (U.S. #1770) was issued in Washington.D.C., honoring R.F.K. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing distributed 159,297,600 of the perforated, blue-and-white stamps‚Äîan unusually-large printing. The stamp design was taken from a family photo suggested by his wife, Ethel. In 1998 the United States Mint released a special dollar coin that featured his image on the obverse and the emblems of the United States Department of Justice and the United States Senate on the reverse. On November 20, 2001, U.S. President George W. Bush and Attorney General John Ashcroft dedicated the Department of Justice headquarters building in Washington, D.C., as the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building, honoring Kennedy on what would have been his 76th birthday. They both spoke during the ceremony, as did Kennedy's eldest son, Joseph. The 1998 Robert F. Kennedy special dollar coin In a further effort to remember Kennedy and continue his work helping the disadvantaged, a small group of private citizens launched the Robert F. Kennedy Children's Action Corps in 1969. The private, nonprofit, Massachusetts-based organization helps more than 800 abused and neglected children each year. A bust of Kennedy resides in the library of the University of Virginia School of Law where he obtained his law degree. On June 4, 2008 (the eve of the 40th anniversary of his assassination), the New York State Assembly voted to rename the Triborough Bridge in New York City the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge. New York State Governor David Paterson signed the legislation into law on August 8, 2008. The bridge is now commonly known as the RFK-Triborough Bridge. On September 20, 2016, the United States Navy announced the renaming of a refueling ship in honor of Kennedy during a ceremony attended by members of his family. Personal items and documents from his office in the Justice Department Building are displayed in a permanent exhibit dedicated to him at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum. Papers from his years as attorney general, senator, peace and civil rights activist and presidential candidate, as well as personal correspondence, are also housed in the library. Established in 1984, the Robert F. Kennedy Assassination Archives stored at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth contains thousands of copies of government documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act public disclosure process as well as manuscripts, photographs, audiotape interviews, video tapes, news clippings and research notes compiled by journalists and other private citizens who have investigated discrepancies in the case.https://www.lib.umassd.edu/archives/findaids/MC1RFKAA.pdf =Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.= Several public institutions jointly honor Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. * In 1969, the former Woodrow Wilson Junior College, a two-year institution and a constituent campus of the City Colleges of Chicago, was renamed Kennedy‚ÄìKing College. * In 1994 the City of Indianapolis erected the Landmark for Peace Memorial in Robert Kennedy's honor near the space made famous by his speech from the back of a pickup truck the night King died. The monument in Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Park depicts a sculpture of RFK reaching out from a large metal slab to a sculpture of King, who is part of a similar slab. This is meant to symbolize their attempts in life to bridge the gaps between the races‚Äîan attempt that united them even in death. A state historical marker has also been placed at the site. A nephew of King and Indiana U.S. Congresswoman Julia Carson presided over the event; both made speeches from the back of a pickup truck in similar fashion to RFK's speech. In 2019, Kennedy's \\"Speech on the Death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\\" (April 4, 1968) was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".

Newspeak is the fictional language of Oceania, a totalitarian superstate that is the setting of dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), by George Orwell. To meet the ideological requirements of English Socialism in Oceania, the ruling English Socialist Party (Ingsoc) created Newspeak, a controlled language of simplified grammar and restricted vocabulary designed to limit the individual's ability to think and articulate \\"subversive\\" concepts such as personal identity, self-expression and free will. Such concepts are criminalized as thoughtcrime since they contradict the prevailing Ingsoc orthodoxy.The Oxford Companion to the English Language, Tom McArthur, Ed. (1992) p. 693. In \\"The Principles of Newspeak\\", the appendix to the novel, Orwell explains that Newspeak follows most of the rules of English grammar, yet is a language characterised by a continually diminishing vocabulary; complete thoughts reduced to simple terms of simplistic meaning. Linguistically, the political contractions of Newspeak‚ÄîIngsoc (English Socialism), Minitrue (Ministry of Truth), Miniplenty (Ministry of Plenty)‚Äîidentify the political philosophy and the government institutions of Oceania; like the Russian contractions politburo (Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union), Comintern (Communist International), kolkhoz (collective farm), and Komsomol (Young Communists' League)‚Äîidentify the institutions of the Soviet Union; likewise, the German political contractions‚ÄîNazi (Nationalsozialismus) and Gestapo (Geheime Staatspolizei)‚Äîrespectively identify the political philosophy and the secret state police of Nazi Germany. The Party's long-term goal with regard to the new language is for every member of the Party and society, except the Proles‚Äîthe working-class of Oceania‚Äîto exclusively communicate in Newspeak, by A.D. 2050. Orwell and Newspeak That Orwell was interested in linguistic questions and questions pertaining to the function and change of language is a fact that can already be seen in his essay \\"Politics and the English Language\\" (1946) as well as in the Appendix to Nineteen Eighty-Four. As in \\"Politics and the English Language\\", the perceived decline and decadence of the English Language is a central theme in Nineteen Eighty-Four and Newspeak. In the essay Orwell criticises standard English, with its perceived dying metaphors, pretentious diction, and high-flown rhetoric, which he would later satirise in the meaningless words of doublespeak, the product of unclear reasoning. The conclusion thematically reiterates linguistic decline: \\"I said earlier that the decadence of our language is probably curable. Those who deny this may argue that language merely reflects existing social conditions, and that we cannot influence its development, by any direct tinkering with words or constructions.\\" Orwell's main objection against this decline of the English language is not so much based on aesthetic grounds, but rather that for him the linguistic decline goes hand-in-hand with a decline of thought, the real possibility of manipulation of speakers as well as listeners and eventually political chaos. The recurring theme in Nineteen Eighty-Four of a connection between authoritarian regimes and (authoritarian) language is already found in \\"Politics and the English Language\\": Newspeak is a constructed language, of planned phonology, grammar, and vocabulary, like Basic English, which Orwell showed interest in while working at the BBC during the Second World War (1939‚Äì1945), but soon came to see the disadvantages of. Newspeak has considerable similarities to the system of Basic English proposed by Charles Kay Ogden in 1930. Basic ('British American Scientific International Commercial') English was a controlled language and designed to be an easy-to- learn English with only 850 core words. Like Newspeak, the Basic vocabulary is classified into three categories, two of them with two subcategories. The classification systems do however not coincide. Principles The political purpose of Newspeak is to eliminate the expression of the shades of meaning inherent in ambiguity and nuance from Oldspeak (Standard English). In order to reduce the language's function of communication, Newspeak uses concepts of simple construction: pleasure vs. pain, happiness vs. sadness. Goodthink vs. crimethink linguistically reinforces the State's totalitarian dominance of the people of Oceania. In Newspeak, English root words function as both nouns and verbs, which reduce the vocabulary available for the speaker to communicate meaning. For example, think is both a noun and a verb, thus, the word thought is not functionally required to communicate the concepts of thought in Newspeak and therefore is not in the Newspeak vocabulary. As personal communication, Newspeak is to be spoken in staccato rhythm, using words that are short and easy to pronounce. The Party intends to make speech physically automatic and intellectually unconscious in order to diminish the possibility of critical thought occurring to the speaker. English words of comparative and superlative meanings and irregular spellings were simplified into regular spellings; thus, better becomes gooder and best becomes goodest. The prefixes plus- and doubleplus- are used for emphasis (for example, pluscold meaning \\"very cold\\" and doublepluscold meaning \\"extremely cold\\"). Adjectives are formed by adding the suffix ‚Äìful to a root-word, e.g. goodthinkful means \\"Orthodox in thought.\\"; while adverbs are formed by adding the suffix ‚Äìwise, e.g. goodthinkwise means \\"In an orthodox manner\\". =Thought control= The intellectual purpose of Newspeak is to make Ingsoc-approved thoughts the only expressible thoughts. As constructed, Newspeak's vocabulary communicates the exact expression of sense and meaning that a member of the Party could wish to express. It excludes secondary denotations and connotations. The linguistic simplification of Oldspeak into Newspeak was realised with neologisms, the elimination of ideologically undesirable words, and the elimination of the politically unorthodox meanings of words. The word free still existed in Newspeak, but only to communicate a lack of something, e.g. \\"The dog is free from lice\\" or \\"This field is free of weeds\\". The word could not denote free will, because intellectual freedom was no longer supposed to exist in Oceania. The limitations of Newspeak's vocabulary enabled the Party to effectively control the population's minds, by allowing the user only a very narrow range of spoken and written thought; hence, words such as: crimethink (thought crime), doublethink (accepting contradictory beliefs), and Ingsoc (English Socialism) communicated only their surface meanings. In the story of Nineteen Eighty-Four, the lexicologist character Syme discusses his editorial work on the latest edition of the Newspeak Dictionary: =Vocabulary= Newspeak words are classified by three distinct classes: the A, B, and C vocabularies. The words of the A vocabulary describe the functional concepts of daily life (e.g. eating and drinking, working and cooking). It consists mostly of English words, but they are very small in number compared to English, while for each word, its meanings are \\"far more rigidly defined\\" than in English. The words of the B vocabulary are deliberately constructed for political purposes to convey complex ideas in a simple form. They are compound words and noun-verbs with political significance that are meant to impose and instill upon Oceania's citizens politically correct mental attitudes required by the Party. In the appendix, Orwell explains that the very structure of the B vocabulary (the fact that they are compound words) carries ideological weight. The large amounts of contractions in the B vocabulary‚Äîfor example, the Ministry of Truth being caled Minitrue, the Records department being called Recdep, the Fiction Department being called Ficdep, the Teleprogrammes Department being called Teledep‚Äîis not done simply to save time. Like with examples of compound words in the political language of the 20th century‚ÄîNazi, Gestapo, Politburo, Comintern, Inprecorr, Agitprop, and many others‚ÄîOrwell remarks that the Party believed that abbreviating a name could \\"narrowly and subtly\\" alter a word's meaning. Newspeak is supposed to make this effort a conscious purpose: The B words in Newspeak are supposed to sound at least somewhat nice, while also being easily pronounceable, in an attempt to make speech on anything political \\"staccato and monotonous\\" and, ultimately, mask from the speaker all ideological content. The words of the C vocabulary are scientific and technical terms that supplement the linguistic functions of the A and B vocabularies. These words are the same scientific terms in English, but many of them have had their meanings rigidified in order to, just like with the A vocabulary, attempt to prevent speakers from being able to express anti- government thoughts. Distribution of the C vocabulary is limited, because the Party want the citizens of Oceania to know only a select few ways of life or techniques of production. Hence, the Oldspeak word science has no equivalent term in Newspeak; instead, these words are simply treated as specific technical words for speaking of technical fields. Grammar Newspeak's grammar is greatly simplifed compared to English. It also has two \\"outstanding\\" characteristics: Almost completely interchangeable linguistic functions between the parts of speech (any word could function as a verb, noun, adjective, or adverb), and heavy inflectional regularity in the construction of usages and of words. Inflectional regularity means that most irregular words were replaced with regular words combined with prefixes and suffixes. For example the preterite and the past participle constructions of verbs are alike, with both ending in ‚Äìed. Hence, the Newspeak preterite of the English word steal is stealed, and that of the word think is thinked. Likewise, the past participles of swim, give, bring, speak, and take were, respectively swimmed, gived, bringed, speaked, and taked, with all irregular forms (such as swam, gave, and brought) being eliminated. The auxiliaries (including to be), pronouns, demonstratives, and relatives still inflect irregularly. They mostly follow their use in English, but the word whom and the shall and should tenses were dropped, whom being replaced by who and shall and should by will and would. =Prefixes= * \\"Un‚Äì\\" is used to indicate negation, as Newspeak has no non-political antonyms. For example, the standard English words warm and hot are replaced by uncold, and the moral concept communicated with the word bad is expressed as ungood. When appended to a verb, the prefix \\"un‚Äì\\" communicates a negative imperative mood, thus, the Newspeak word unproceed means \\"do not proceed\\" in Standard English. * \\"Plus‚Äì\\" is an intensifier that replaces very and more; thus, plusgood replaced very good and English words such as great. * \\"Doubleplus‚Äì\\" is an intensifier that replaces extremely and superlatives; to that purpose, the Newspeak word doubleplusgood replaced words such as fantastic and excellent. * \\"Ante‚Äì\\" is the prefix that replaces before; thus antefilling replaces the English phrase \\"before filling.\\" * \\"Post‚Äì\\" is the prefix that replaces after. =Suffixes= In spoken and written Newspeak, suffixes are also used in the elimination of irregular conjugations: * \\"‚Äìful\\" transforms any word into an adjective, e.g. the English words fast, quick, and rapid are replaced by speedful and slow is replaced by unspeedful. * \\"‚Äìd\\" and \\"‚Äìed\\" form the past tense of a verb, e.g. ran becomes runned, stole becomes stealed, drove becomes drived, thought becomes thinked, and drank becomes drinked. * \\"‚Äìer\\" forms the more comparison of an adjective, e.g. better becomes gooder. * \\"‚Äìest\\" forms the most comparison of an adjective, e.g. best becomes goodest. * \\"‚Äìs\\" and \\"‚Äìes\\" transform a noun into its plural form, e.g. men becomes mans, oxen becomes oxes, and lives becomes lifes. * \\"‚Äìwise\\" transforms any word into an adverb by eliminating all English adverbs not already ending in \\"‚Äìwise\\", e.g. quickly becomes speedwise, slowly becomes unspeedwise, carefully becomes carewise, and words like fully, completely, and totally become fullwise. Therefore, the Oldspeak sentence \\"He ran extremely quickly\\" would become \\"He runned doubleplusspeedwise\\". List of Newspeak words Note: The novel says that the Ministry of Truth uses a jargon \\"not actually Newspeak, but consisting largely of Newspeak words\\" for its internal memos. As many of the words in this list (e.g. \\"bb\\", \\"upsub\\") come from such memos, it is not certain whether those words are actually Newspeak. *ante ‚Äî The prefix that replaces before *artsem ‚Äî Artificial insemination *bb ‚Äî Big Brother *bellyfeel ‚Äî The blind, enthusiastic acceptance of an idea *blackwhite ‚Äî To accept whatever one is told, regardless of the facts.

Personal background Born in April 1967, Murphy grew up in Hicksville, New York and was educated at Chaminade High School in Mineola, New York. He attended Georgetown University and received a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) from the McDonough School of Business. Having excelled academically, he was accepted into Georgetown Law. Murphy was the film critic for the Georgetown school newspaper, The Hoya, for three years, and in summer jobs at his father's advertising agency worked on ad campaigns for such films as Blow Out (1981), Under the Rainbow (1981) and Ragtime (1981). In 1986 Murphy realized that his calling lay in films rather than law; he enrolled in the School of Cinema-Television (now named USC School of Cinematic Arts) in California, where he had classmates including eventual directors Bryan Singer, Jon Turteltaub, Gary Fleder, and Stephen Sommers, and received a Master of Fine Arts. He is married to Susan Montford, a film director, film producer, and screenwriter with whom he frequently collaborates. Career After completing the graduate film program, Murphy teamed with Jane Hamsher to produce Natural Born Killers based on a script written by Quentin Tarantino, who was then unknown. Director Oliver Stone committed to direct the film, and he installed Murphy and Hamsher as on-set producers, which was described as \\"the equivalent of a crash course in filmmaking\\". Murphy said, \\"We wouldn't be where we are if not for Oliver.\\" The film attracted attention upon release in 1994, and Hamsher documented the producers' involvement in the film in the best-selling book Killer Instinct. In 1998, Murphy formed the production company Angry Films. He had an opportunity to see an unfinished cut of The Usual Suspects, which was directed by Singer, a classmate from USC. They decided to work together on Apt Pupil, based on a Stephen King novella and released in 1998. Murphy then worked as producer on the 2001 film Bully; its director, Larry Clark, was not impressed with the original screenplay, but committed to the film after Murphy encouraged him to read the book. Murphy also grew interested in adapting graphic novels by Alan Moore, such as From Hell and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, for film. He produced the movie From Hell, directed by the Hughes Brothers and released in 2001, as well as the film The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, directed by Stephen Norrington and released in 2003. Murphy and producer Tom DeSanto optioned rights to the Transformers toy line from Hasbro and pitched it to Hollywood studios. According to Murphy, the studios passed initially, but then began to express interest after further internal meetings involving younger staff, from the generation who had played with Transformers in their childhood. Paramount Pictures and producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura pursued the property, and DreamWorks got involved. DreamWorks executive Michael De Luca proposed the idea to Steven Spielberg, who took the project and convinced Michael Bay to direct the film. Transformers was released in 2007 and was a major box office success. During production, Murphy hosted a forum on his personal website so Transformers fans could discuss the film and make suggestions, enabling them to influence the film's script and casting. However, the forum remained Murphy's personal project, rather than an official site for the film, partly due to his corporate partners' unease about how the website might be perceived. Murphy was also one of the originating producers of the 2009 sequel Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.

The ruins of the old colony can be found in the contrada (quarter) Piano del Conte-Morana and Piano Grillo. A necropolis dating from the 6th-5th century BC has been identified in the contrada Paraspola-Pirruna. The name appears in different forms among different authors: Akrilla, Akrille; in ancient sources: Akrillaiu; the name is variously written by Latin writers Acrilla and Acrille. History  =Hellenic era= The city was founded by the Corinthian and Syracusan colonists at the same time of Kamarina (598 BC), overlooking the Valley of the Hipparis to establish their power against the city of Gela, founded by a Cretan-Rhodian effort. Akrillai was also a road- station on the route from Syracuse to Gela and Akragas. By passing via Akrai and Kasmenai, the road avoided the low Hyblaean Mountains and Hybla Heraea. The city based its economy on trade, thanks to its strategic position along the Via Selinuntina. Near to Akrillai was the Hellenistic settlement of Scornavacche, where recent excavations have found several clay ovens. Throughout its existence Akrillai remained under the influence of the mother- city Syracuse, with which it was allied. According to the Roman historian Titus Livius, the city was used as a fortress and military base during the Carthaginians' second Sicilian campaign. In 406 BC, after the fall of Akragas and Gela, the city was destroyed for the first time, as the Carthaginians passed on their way to attack and besiege Syracuse. =Roman Acrillae = Titus Livius also recountsthelatinlibrary.com Livy, Book XXIV, 35-36 in Latin.Livy, Book XXIV, 24.35-24.36 the battle fought at Akrillai in 213 BC between Syracusan forces guided by the strategos Hippokrates, and the Roman army led by the consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus: With the defeat of Hippokrates‚Äô Syracusans, the city of Akrillai became part of the Roman province of Sicily, its name Latinized as Acrillae.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854), ed. William Smith, LLD (20.68) =Arab Gulfi= In 827 AD the town was destroyed again, this time by the Arabs of Asad ibn al-Furat. The name Acrillae disappeared and the rebuilt centre was known by the Arab name of Gulfi, which means \\"the rose-garden\\" and \\"place rich with vegetation\\". The nearby river Dirillo also takes its name from Acrillae: called Achates (agate) during the Greek-Roman era and said to be where agates were first found,Theophrastus, On StonesPliny the Elder, The Natural History, Book XXXVII Chapter 54, at the Perseus ProjectThe Chambers Dictionary (2001) Edinburgh: Chambers Harrap Publishers. P.27 in Arab times the river was called Wadi Ikrilu (River of Acrille). Excavations Akrillai was discovered by the historian Corrado Melfi and identified by the archaeologist Antonio Di Vita, an academic of the Lincei, who conducted several campaigns of excavation. The many findings are housed in the Hyblean Archaeological Museum of Ragusa and in the Regional Archeological Museum of Syracuse.

They constituted the sixteenth and seventeenth episodes of the fifth season, and the 88th and 89th overall episodes of the series. The first episode originally aired on NBC on February 5, 2009, and the second on February 12. During both episodes, Michael and Pam visit the various branches of Dunder Mifflin to make business lectures, and in particular visit the Utica branch ‚Äì where Jim's ex-girlfriend Karen Filippelli is regional manager, and the Nashua branch, where Michael's ex-girlfriend and the love of his life, Holly is an H.R. rep. In both episodes, Jim and Dwight hit a snag as the new heads of the Party Planning Committee when they forget Kelly's birthday. In the first episode, Andy develops a crush on a customer, and in the second episode, Angela's unhealthy obsession with her cats is spotlighted when she installs a nanny cam. Both episodes were directed by Ken Kwapis and written by Mindy Kaling, who also plays Kelly Kapoor in the show. \\"Lecture Circuit\\" included guest appearances by screenwriter Dan Goor, comedian Rob Huebel and actress Rashida Jones, who reprises her role of Karen, a regular character from the third season. Although the character Holly Flax played a major part in the storyline, actress Amy Ryan did not appear in \\"Lecture Circuit\\". The episodes received generally positive reviews. According to Nielsen Media Research, the first part was watched by 8.4 million viewers and the second part was watched by 8.89 million viewers. Plot =Part one= Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is asked to visit the Dunder Mifflin branches to lecture about his success in Scranton. He and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), who is coming along as his assistant and driver, plan to visit every branch except Nashua because Michael is not ready to face his ex-girlfriend Holly Flax, who works there. They first visit the Utica branch, where former Scranton employee Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) is now regional manager. Pam, who is engaged to Karen's ex-boyfriend Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), fears the encounter will be awkward. However, she is pleasantly surprised upon learning Karen is now married and pregnant, and the two get along very well ‚Äì when Pam reveals her and Jim's engagement, Karen even offers genuine congratulations. Michael's lecture in Utica proves to be a disaster when he pretends to receive a call saying that his father has died, has Pam throw Mini-Mounds at the audience, and tries to teach the employees a trick for how to memorize names and ends up insulting everybody. Nevertheless, Pam is ecstatic to have found closure with Karen. Later, on the road, Michael tells Pam that he never found closure with Holly and, at Pam's suggestion, they decide to blow off the other lectures and drive to Nashua to find Holly. Back in Scranton, Jim and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) have been named the reluctant heads of the Party Planning Committee by Michael due to previous fights between Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey). Jim and Dwight prove terrible at the job, and when an upset Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) chastises them for forgetting her birthday, they try to make it up to her by throwing a party but they do a poor job - Dwight chooses brown and gray balloons (because they \\"match the carpet\\") and doesn't blow them up all the way, uses toilet paper as streamers, and his banner simply states \\"IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.\\" Jim does just as poorly when he cannot get anyone to contribute money, forgets Kelly's age, and how to spell her name. Dwight reads her file and learns that Kelly spent time in juvenile hall, but is disappointed to learn it does not affect her job performance. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) finds himself attracted to Julia, a female potential client who is talking with Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker). Andy repeatedly acts awkwardly in front of Julia and accidentally sets off her car alarm while trying to look inside and find out what music she likes. After failing to hit on her by singing to the tune of Feist's \\"1234\\", Andy admits his attraction to her to Stanley, who then gives the potential client over to Andy in exchange for two of his clients. After walking her out to the car, Andy tries to kiss her, but is immediately rebuked. Andy apologizes and mentions that he just got out of a relationship. Julia claims she also just got out of a relationship and Andy starts feeling a connection, but she still rejects him and he loses the account. =Part two= Michael and Pam arrive at the Nashua branch, only to learn Holly is away on a human relations retreat. They also learn Holly is dating one of the Nashua salesmen named A.J. (Rob Huebel). Deeply upset, Michael is at first unable to go forward with the presentation, but Pam tries to comfort him by telling him that she felt the same way when Jim was dating Karen. She encourages Michael to do the best presentation possible so people will tell Holly about it. He starts the presentation, but it falls apart when Michael starts asking A.J. intimate questions about his relationship with Holly. Michael leaves in the middle of the talk, leaving Pam to awkwardly finish the rest of the presentation. When Michael goes to Holly's desk he cuts a sleeve off her sweater, and notices a document on her computer called \\"Dear Michael\\", which he copies onto his flash drive. Later, at a diner, Michael tells Pam about the letter, but she insists reading it would be violating Holly's trust. Pam herself reads the letter and deletes it right after. She does not tell him the exact contents, but she reassures him Holly still has feelings for Michael and it is not over, giving an ecstatic Michael the closure he sought. In Scranton, the party planning continues to go poorly. Dwight publicly and loudly confronts Kelly about her time in juvenile hall, which turns out to be for stealing the boat of an ex- boyfriend when she was 14. Kelly also declares she hates the cake Jim picked for her, which is completely blank; he later decorates it and ends up spelling her name incorrectly as \\"Kelley\\". When Kelly insists the party needs a theme, Jim and Dwight are unable to think of anything. Despite a rough start to the party, they finally settle on offering her one hour of napping or one hour of watching television by putting a Chiclet on the cake to represent a pillow or TV. She loves the idea and chooses the nap. Angela appears much happier than usual because she bought a new $7,000 cat with the money she received from selling Andy's engagement ring. She has also set up a nanny cam so she can monitor the cats from work. However, she is horrified to see one of her other cats having sex with the new cat, and rushes home to stop it. Later, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) watch Angela arrive home on the nanny cam screen, and become incredibly disgusted when Angela starts licking the cat to help clean it. Angela eventually returns to work and coughs up a hairball. Oscar claims the image will haunt him for the rest of his life; both the psychological issues that go behind licking a cat and the hairball itself. Production \\"Lecture Circuit\\" was directed by Ken Kwapis and written by Mindy Kaling, who also plays Kelly Kapoor in the show. The first episode included a cameo performance by Rashida Jones, a regular cast member during the third season, during which she played Jim Halpert's love interest Karen Filippelli. \\"Lecture Circuit\\" aired just two months before Jones began her regular role as Ann Perkins in the NBC comedy series Parks and Recreation, which was created by Office producers Greg Daniels and Michael Schur. Dan Goor, a future writer for Parks and Recreation, made a cameo as Karen's husband in the photographs featured in the part one episode. Rob Huebel, a comedian best known for the MTV sketch comedy series Human Giant, guest starred as Holly's boyfriend, A.J. Amy Ryan, who played Holly Flax in previous episodes, did not appear in either \\"Lecture Circuit\\" episode, although the decision by Michael and Pam to visit Holly at the end of the first episode led to speculation about whether she would appear in the second. Cultural references Michael handing out candy bars during his lectures is a reference to the third season episode, \\"Business School\\", where Michael passed out chocolate bars during his speech to a business school classroom. Michael expresses regret for insulting Tony Gardner, the heavyset man who briefly transferred from the Stamford branch of Dunder Mifflin to the Scranton branch, who Michael drives to quit by trying to lift onto a table for an orientation demonstration in the third season episode, \\"The Merger\\". Among the Dunder Mifflin branches Michael visits is Nashua, New Hampshire, where Holly works, and Utica, New York, where Karen works. Michael said he can only prepare for his lectures by listening to \\"silence or Sam Kinison\\", an American stand-up comedian known for his extreme and vulgar sense of humor. Michael said he learned the Pledge of Allegiance, the lyrical oath of loyalty to the United States flag, by setting the lyrics to the rhythm of \\"Old McDonald Had a Farm\\", a children's song about the various animals on a farm. During one lecture, Michael and Pam both do impressions of the protagonist from Forrest Gump, the 1994 film starring Tom Hanks as a mentally handicapped man. Michael also uses the title from the films Good Morning, Vietnam (at his Nashua lecture by saying \\"Good morning, Vietna...shua!\\") The Princess Bride, Gone with the Wind and Jerry Maguire in his lectures. Holly's computer has a screensaver with images of Ed Grimley, the nerdy character with a cowlick played by comedian Martin Short in the comedy shows SCTV and Saturday Night Live. Angela said she sold Andy's engagement ring on eBay, an online auction website. Creed gives Andy romantic advice and says, \\"This is how I got Squeaky Fromme\\", a reference to the Manson family member who tried to assassinate U.S. President Gerald Ford. A picture of President George W. Bush appears on a fake three-dollar bill Creed gives Jim to pay for the party. Creed suggests Kelly watch The Bonnie Hunt Show, a syndicated talk show hosted by actress Bonnie Hunt. Andy puts Splenda, an artificial sweetener, into Stanley's coffee because he has adult onset diabetes, a disorder characterized by high blood glucose. Andy sings Julia a song by Feist, the Canadian singer and songwriter, after he spots a Feist CD in her car. Michael takes a document file from Holly's computer that was created with Microsoft Word, the Microsoft word processing program. Pam said she hates the notion of even Al-Qaeda hating her, a reference to the Islamist terrorist organization that organized the September 11 attacks against New York City. Kelly confesses she went to juvenile detention in Berks County, Pennsylvania, at age 14 for doing something \\"like Thelma & Louise, but with a boat\\", a reference to the 1991 road movie starring Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon on the run from their troubled, caged lives. Jim said during a birthday trip to a museum at age seven, his father bought him a plastic toy triceratops, a three-horned dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous Period, which Dwight insists is not a good dinosaur. Pam remembers the name of one audience member by comparing her to k.d. lang, the Canadian singer known for her extremely short hair. Reception In its original American broadcast on February 5, 2009, the first part of \\"Lecture Circuit\\" was seen by 8.4 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. The original broadcast for the second part on February 12 was seen by 8.89 million viewers. The second episode received a 4.3 rating/11 share among viewers aged between 18 and 34, and a 3.8 rating/9 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49, numbers which were close to the season's average rating. The first episode received a 5.0 rating/14 share among viewers aged between 18 and 34, and a 4.3 rating/11 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49. Both ratings were three-tenths of a drop from the previous episode, \\"Stress Relief\\", which was heavily viewed because it immediately followed the broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII on NBC. The drop in ratings led some media outlets to speculate that the post-Super Bowl ratings boost was only temporary and would not help The Office in the long run. Both episodes of \\"Lecture Circuit\\" received generally positive reviews. Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly described them as \\"nearly perfect\\", calling them the two best episodes of the season so far: \\"[Writer Mindy Kaling] nailed the characterizations, the interactions, the tossed-off one-liners, the weird-yet- realistic scenarios...I wonder how much it helps that she's out on the acting floor every day, getting attuned to her costars' rhythms?\\" Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune of Scranton, Pennsylvania, said the first \\"Lecture Circuit\\" episode was his favorite episode of the fifth season so far, which he said provided several laugh-out-loud moments and a poignancy with Michael's decision to find Holly. McAuliffe described the second episode as a \\"satisfying wrap-up\\" and said Michael's outburst during the lecture was \\"one of the most painful Michael meltdown moments in the show's history\\". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the first episode perfectly balanced drama and comedy. He particularly complimented the chemistry between both Carell and Fischer and between Krasinski and Wilson, and said he was particularly pleased to receive closure over the Karen character. But Sepinwall said the second episode felt padded with \\"material I would have been fine seeing as deleted scenes\\". Although he described Carell's reaction to the news that Holly still has feelings for him as a \\"wonderful performance\\", Sepinwall also said the subplot involving Angela's cat was particularly unfunny and that subplot with Jim and Dwight, \\"so brilliant last week, ran out of steam quickly here.\\" Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club said the episode \\"was full of laughs but had a bit of a bittersweet aftertaste\\" and had \\"one hell of a cliffhanger\\" ending. Rabin praised the Jim and Dwight teaming in the first episode, but said the plot line of Michael's lectures were predictable and \\"promised more than it delivered\\". Rabin said the second episode \\"wrapped up everything up nicely [and] delivered larfs aplenty\\"; he particularly enjoyed the subplot involving Angela's cats, and the fact that it \\"left the door open for Holly's return\\". Will Leitch of New York magazine praised the cliffhanger ending of the first episode and said he was pleased the Holly character was still in the show's equation. Leitch also praised Ed Helms, who \\"is nailing the right combination of ridiculous and sad-sack pathos\\", although he said he \\"[wasn't] nearly as inspired\\" by the Jim and Dwight subplot. Leitch also enjoyed the second episode, particularly the \\"legitimately sweet moment\\" when Pam tells Michael that Holly still has feelings for him. Leitch was less praiseworthy of the Angela subplot involving her cats, and said the character \\"appears to have officially gone batshit insane.\\" Travis Fickett of IGN criticized the first episode and said, \\"I'm starting to wonder if the show is showing signs of winding down.\\" Fickett said the idea of Michael giving awkward lecture tours felt old and familiar, so much so that \\"I was convinced it was a repeat\\". He also said the Jim and Dwight idea was funny, but \\"nothing the show hasn't tapped before\\". Likewise, Fickett described the second episode as \\"average Office and feels overly familiar without really blazing any new ground.\\" He also said it was disappointing Holly did not appear, and that Angela felt like a \\"caricature\\" in her subplot. The first part of the episode was voted the fifth highest-rated episode out of 26 from the fifth season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally; the episode was rated 8.64 out of 10. The second part of the episode, however, was voted the third-worst of the season, with a rating of 7.14 However, the scene with Angela licking her cat was heavily criticized by reviewers, prompting some observers to describe it as the moment when The Office jumped the shark, a phrase used to describe the moment of downturn for a previously successful television show. When asked about this during an interview, actor Oscar Nu√±ez responded, \\"No show is 'Jump the Shark'-proof, but there have been other moments on The Office that I think were more 'Jump the Shark' than that.\\" He did not specify what other moments he meant.

DC Grose: Quebec Rapids - 1865  Some unfounded suppositions An Irish painter by the name of Daniel Charles Grose who died in 1838 may have been the grandfather of the Canadian painter. The evidence is all circumstantial, however. History Daniel Charles Grose was born in 1832 in Whitby, England. He was one of a half-dozen children born to Daniel Henderson and Sarah Rachel Grose.\\"England and Wales Non-Conformist Record Indexes (RG4-8), 1588-1977,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:FQ46-3T5 : 11 December 2014), Daniel Charles Grose, 02 Apr 1832, Baptism; citing p. 104, Whitby, Yorkshire, record group RG4, Public Record Office, London. The Grose family were actors and performers who travelled throughout the north of England for most of the 1830s and 1840s. Truly a family affair, a London paper in 1843 described a theatre under the management of Mr [Daniel Henderson] Grose as appearing to \\"have a gross of little Groses, who constitute his company.\\" After serving in the Merchant Navy in the early 1850s, Daniel Charles Grose married his first wife, Louisa Askew, on June 8, 1856 at Chatham, Kent, England. He was living with his in laws in England in 1861 but by 1865 he and his wife had moved to Toronto, Ontario where he seems to have described himself for the first time as an artist. By 1868, Grose and Louisa had moved to Brooklyn, New York, where he lived extensively throughout the rest of his life. It is unclear what happened to Louisa, who was in the 1870 New York Census, but while visiting his family in Canada in 1875, Grose married his second wife Molly or Mary Jane White. This second marriage was not a happy one and after a couple of years they separated. Mary returned to her family in New Brunswick, but soon went back to New York where she died in 1881 of \\"exhaustion due to acute mania.\\" It is possible that Grose was trying to not be found as he had moved to Washington DC where, in the 1880 census, he was calling himself Charles Daniel Grose. Grose's work indicates an affinity to the second generation of the Hudson River School (ca 1848‚Äì1900). The Samuel Dorksy Museum of Art, lists two of his works as examples of the Hudson school. Most of Grose's exeunt work depicts pastoral landscapes, or romantic scenes with ruins. The earliest known Grose works are dated 1865 and consist of a series of landscapes in the province of Quebec. On May 25, 1881, in Washington, D.C., Grose married Harriet Estella Smith (1863‚Äì1914), also an artist.District of Columbia Marriage Records 15:326 She was the daughter of Captain Dwight Hayden Smith and his wife Luana Elizabeth Smith of Alexandria, Virginia. Between 1881 and 1884 Grose and Harriet took a trip around the world. They moved back to Brooklyn but continued travelling nearly until his death, leaving New York again in 1895 and not returning from Australia until 1898. Grose was a member of and exhibited at the Brooklyn Art Association. Grose died in Alexandria at his mother-in-law's house (Mrs. H Dwight Smith) on February 24, 1900.Washington Post, Obituary of Grose, Daniel Charles (pg 3), February 24th, 1900 His funeral was held the next day in Washington at his former residence.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 5, 2009. In the episode, a lonely Michael strikes up a pleasant conversation with a woman while giving blood, but passes out before he can learn her name. He holds a Valentine's Day singles party at the Dunder Mifflin office with the hopes of meeting her. Meanwhile, Jim and Pam go on an awkward double date with Phyllis and Bob Vance. The episode was written by Brent Forrester and directed by Randall Einhorn. It featured the first appearance of actress Lisa K. Wyatt as Lynn, who would make recurrent appearances as a love interest for Kevin. The episode received generally mixed reviews and, according to Nielsen ratings, was watched by 8.63 million viewers during its original broadcast. Plot Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is depressed because it is the first Valentine's Day since he and Holly Flax broke up. Michael donates blood at a mobile blood drive being held in the business park's parking lot and has a nice conversation with a female donor (Kathryn Aselton) sitting next to him. When they both finish at the same time, Michael passes out because he did not eat for three days before giving blood, and when he wakes up she is gone. A disappointed Michael finds a glove he assumes she left behind and takes it, hoping she will come back for it. When Michael goes back into the office, he gathers all the single employees into the conference room to discuss their own personal romantic dilemmas. After becoming further depressed by their sad dating stories, Michael tries lifting their spirits by holding a singles mixer. He puts up flyers which also advertise the finding of a missing glove, hoping his mystery woman will come to the party as a result. When Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) are threatened with banishment by Michael after they constantly gaze happily on each other, Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) invites them to have lunch with her and her husband Bob Vance (Robert R. Shafer). Their meal initially goes well, but Phyllis and Bob disappear for a while after their food arrives. Hungry and not wanting to be rude by eating before they get back, Jim and Pam check the bathrooms and hear Phyllis and Bob having sex in the disabled bathroom. Phyllis and Bob finally come back to their table and Jim and Pam lose their appetites and look on in disgust as Phyllis and Bob seductively put food in each other's mouths. A few outsiders attend Michael's party. One of the attendees (Tate Hanyok) strikes up a conversation with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), who tries to sell her paper; Dwight becomes angry when she tells him she already has a paper supplier. Another attendee named Lynn (Lisa K. Wyatt) converses with Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), who is still somewhat depressed over his breakup with his fianc√©e Stacy and walks away when he admits it was she who broke it off. Kevin returns later to apologize to Lynn and admits he gets nervous talking to pretty girls; Lynn is flattered and gives Kevin her e-mail address. Afterwards, Michael is disappointed the woman who lost her glove does not show up and tells the employees they can go home early, but the empathetic staff decide to stay, and encourage Michael to leave with them when she doesn't arrive. Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) attempts to get a cookie from a blood drive nurse at the drive by claiming he gave blood earlier and showing a cotton ball taped to his arm as proof. The nurse recognizes he is lying because they are using band-aids; a frustrated Stanley leaves, and tells Phyllis, who is about to try the same trick. Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) leaves the blood mobile with a bag of donated blood in his coat pocket. Production \\"Blood Drive\\" was written by Brent Forrester and directed by Randall Einhorn. It featured the first appearance of actress Lisa K. Wyatt as Lynne, who would continue to make frequent appearances as a romantic interest for Kevin. During the episode, the Ed Helms character Andy is described as attending solo honeymoons in Napa Valley, The Bahamas and Walt Disney World Resort, which he previously booked before breaking off his engagement with Angela. Following the episode, NBC posted fake photos of Ed Helms visiting those locations on the show's official Angela Martin and Andrew Bernard wedding website. The photos included Helms scuba-diving, standing in front of a hot air balloon and visiting Disney's Epcot Center, and includes an assurance by Andy that he \\"wanted all my bros and bras in cyberspace to know that the Ol' Nard Dog is doing just fine.‚Äù The official website for The Office included three cut scenes from \\"Blood Drive\\" within a week of its original release. In the first 85-second clip, Dwight assures his office-mates that the blood taken in the bloodmobile will not be used in any \\"ritualistic ways\\". Later, while giving blood himself, he asks the hospital employee, \\"How do I know it's not going to go into a person who will later come back to kill me?\\" The second clip was two minutes of extended footage from the singles party. Meredith talks about her husband leaving her for a garbage-woman whom her kids now consider their real mother instead of herself, and Dwight said he believes his soulmate, \\"probably died 700 years ago in feudal Japan after having impersonated a samurai, or at the very least she lives somewhere outside the Scranton Wilkes-Barre corridor.\\" In the final 90-second clip, Dwight shows off his bobblehead doll collection to a woman, Creed tries unsuccessfully to pick up Lynne, and Dwight gets rid of an attractive male visitor who Michael fears could be competition. Dwight tells him the party is cancelled \\"due to a death in the elevator\\". Cultural references During the singles party, Angela mentions that two men previously had a duel over her in Ohio, which is the second duel fought over her. This is a reference to \\"The Duel\\", an Office episode from earlier in the fifth season, in which Andy and Dwight duel for her affections in the Dunder Mifflin parking lot. In the beginning of the \\"Blood Drive\\" episode, Jim, Pam, Michael and Dwight drive a phone salesman away by repeatedly saying \\"Ayyyy!\\" in the style of Fonzie, the popular character from the sitcom Happy Days. The mysterious woman leaves a single pink glove behind after meeting Michael, in a similar fashion to the classic folk tale Cinderella. Kelly refers to the encounter as \\"like a modern-day Enchanted\\". Michael says he was hit by \\"Cupid's sparrow\\", a mistaken reference to the Roman mythological god who would inspire love by shooting people with arrows. Michael makes jokes about feeling like a human juice box, describing himself as \\"Type O-Cean Spray\\", a combination of type O blood and the Ocean Spray juice company, and as \\"Hawaiian Blood Punch\\", a reference to the fruit punch drink Hawaiian Punch. Jim says, \\"I have a lot of work to do this afternoon. Those mines aren't going to sweep themselves,\\" a reference to the computer game Minesweeper. Ryan is said to be \\"sleeping with random prostitutes\\" in Thailand; prostitution in the Southeast Asian nation is technically illegal, but is in practice tolerated and regulated. Kevin said his previous engagement ended immediately after he remarked that the Philadelphia Eagles, a National Football League football team, might have a chance at winning the NFC East division championship. Reception In its original American broadcast on March 5, 2009, \\"Blood Drive\\" was watched by 8.63 million overall viewers, which was about average for the series at the time. The episode received a 5.1 rating/14 share among viewers aged between 18 and 34, and a 4.5 rating/11 share among viewers between 18 and 49. The episode of 30 Rock, which aired at 9:30 p.m. directly after The Office, was seen by 7.35 million viewers, an increase of 30 percent in viewership from the previous week's 6.3 million. Commentators said \\"Blood Drive\\" was directly responsible for this ratings increase for 30 Rock because the lead-in Office episode was new, whereas the previous week's episode was a repeat. The episode received generally mixed reviews. Brian Howard of The Journal News described it as \\"classic Office\\" and praised the camaraderie the staff showed for each other and the \\"bizarre discomfort\\" of the double date with Jim, Pam, Phyllis and Bob. Howard described Dwight and Kevin as the episode's stand-outs. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the episode lacked many laugh-out-loud moments, but was effective because the characters are so well developed: \\"The Office has, over the years, become as much of a kitchen sink drama as it is a comedy. ... The characters are so well-drawn by now, and for the most part so likable, that a sweet, low-key episode about Michael and the staff bonding over their singlehood worked even without a lot of memorable jokes.\\" Travis Fickett of IGN described the episode as \\"familiar territory, but it has plenty of fun moments.\\" Fickett praised the scene with Carell and the mystery woman, and Jim and Pam's lunch. But Fickett said the series needed to address why Pam was staying with the company: \\"Jim and Pam still work there because, well, that's part of the show ‚Äì but there really isn't a very good reason as to why these two would still be at this dead end job.\\" Will Leitch of New York magazine described \\"Blood Drive\\" as \\"mostly a placeholder episode\\", although he said it was \\"legitimately touching\\" when the cast stays late with Michael during the party. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club, who gave the episode a B+ grade, said the episode included both pathos and \\"big laughs\\". He particularly liked the joke of Andy attending all his honeymoons: \\"The thought of Andy forlornly embarking on a couple's massage solo or sharing a romantic hot-air balloon ride with himself was funny and sad in the best Office tradition.\\" Entertainment Weekly writer Jeff Labrecque said the episode was \\"unusually sweet\\", but said the double date with Pam, Jim, Phyllis and Bob \\"felt slightly undercooked\\". Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune of Scranton, Pennsylvania, said the episode was \\"a highly amusing, if not fantastic, half-hour\\" and particularly praised the opening scene involving the phone system salesman. Several reviewers described Dwight's quote, \\"I can retract my penis up into itself,\\" as the most memorable line of the episode. Phyllis and Bob Vance's sexual rendezvous in the handicapped restroom during the double date ranked number 8 in phillyBurbs.com's top ten moments from the fifth season of The Office. \\"Blood Drive\\" was voted the seventeenth-highest-rated episode out of 26 from the fifth season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally; the episode was rated 7.86 out of 10.

The term refers to the victims who were often thrown alive into foibas (deep natural sinkholes; by extension, it also was applied to the use of mine shafts, etc. to hide the bodies). In a wider or symbolic sense, some authors used the term to apply to all disappearances or killings of Italian people in the territories occupied by Yugoslav forces. They excluded possible 'foibe' killings by other parties or forces. Others included deaths resulting from the forced deportation of Italians, or those who died while trying to flee from these contested lands. Origin and meaning of the term The name was derived from a local geological feature, a type of deep karst sinkhole called foiba.Katia Pizzi, A City in Search of an Author, pg 91 The term includes by extension killings and \\"burials\\" in other subterranean formations, such as the Basovizza \\"foiba\\", which is a mine shaft. In Italy the term foibe has, for some authors and scholars,See Raoul Pupo (Foibe, Bruno Mondadori, Milano 2003; Il lungo esodo. Istria: le persecuzioni, le foibe, l'esilio, Rizzoli, Milano 2005 etc.), Gianni Oliva, (Foibe. Le stragi negate degli italiani della Venezia Giulia e dell'Istria, Mondadori, Milano 2003), Arrigo Petacco, (L'esodo. La tragedia negata degli italiani d'Istria, Dalmazia e Venezia Giulia, Mondadori, Milano 1999), et alia taken on a symbolic meaning; for them it refers in a broader sense to all the disappearances or killings of Italian people in the territories occupied by Yugoslav forces. According to author Raoul Pupo: > \\"It is well known that the majority of the victims didn't end their lives in > a Karst cave, but met their deaths on the road to deportation, as well as in > jails or in Yugoslav concentration camps.\\"Raoul Pupo, Le foibe giuliane > 1943-45; \\"L'impegno\\"; a.XVI; n. 1; April 1996. ¬´√à noto infatti che la > maggior parte delle vittime non fin√¨ i suoi giorni sul fondo delle cavit√† > carsiche, ma incontr√≤ la morte lungo la strada verso la deportazione, ovvero > nelle carceri o nei campi di concentramento jugoslavi¬ª. Pupo also notes: > \\"With regard to the civilian population of Venezia Giulia the Yugoslav > troops did not behave at all like an army occupying enemy territory: nothing > in their actions recalls the indiscriminate violence of Red Army soldiers in > Germany, on the contrary, their discipline seems in some ways superior even > to that of the Anglo-American units.\\" The primary targets of the foibe were military and repressive forces of the Fascist regime, and civilians associated with the regime. However, there were also victims of personal revenge, denunciations (as under German occupation), criminal activity, excess of zeal, misinterpreted motives, etc. The terror spread by these disappearances and killings eventually caused the majority of the Italians of Istria, Rijeka, and Zadar to flee to other parts of Italy or the Free Territory of Trieste.Raoul Pupo wrote: \\"...the horrible death in a cave (...) become the very representation of a barbaric and obscure violence hanging over as a potential doom of an entire community. This is the image that settles in the memory of contemporaries, and become an obsession in moments of political and national uncertainty. This has the power to condition appreciably the choices of the people, such as the one by Istrians that decide to leave their lands assigned to Yugoslav sovereignty...\\" (\\"...la morte orrenda in una voragine della terra, (...) diventa la rappresentazione stessa di una violenza oscura e barbarica, sempre incombente come potenziale destino di un'intera comunit√†. √à questa l'immagine che si fissa nella memoria dei contemporanei, che diviene un'ossessione nei momenti di incertezza nazionale e politica, e che ha la forza di condizionare in maniera avvertibile anche scelte di massa, come quella compiuta dagli istriani che decidono di esodare dai territori passati sotto sovranit√† jugoslava...\\"). According to Fogar and Miccoli there is > \\"the need to put the episodes in 1943 and 1945 within [the context of] a > longer history of abuse and violence, which began with Fascism and with its > policy of oppression of the minority Slovenes and Croats and continued with > the Italian aggression on Yugoslavia, which culminated with the horrors of > the Nazi-Fascist repression against the Partisan movement.\\"See Raoul Pupo, > Le foibe giuliane 1943-45, \\"...la necessit√† di inserire gli episodi del 1943 > e del 1945 all'interno di una pi√π lunga storia di sopraffazioni e di > violenze, iniziata con il fascismo e con la sua politica di oppressione > della minoranza slovena e croata proseguita con l'aggressione italiana alla > Jugoslavia e culminata con gli orrori della repressione nazifascista contro > il movimento partigiano.\\" \\"Le foibe giuliane 1943-45\\", storia900bivc.it; > accessed 26 September 2015. Other authors assert that the post-war pursuit of the 'truth' of the foibe, as a means of transcending Fascist/Anti-Fascist oppositions and promoting popular patriotism, has not been the preserve of right-wing or neo-Fascist groups. Evocations of the 'Slav other' and of the terrors of the foibe made by state institutions, academics, amateur historians, journalists, and the memorial landscape of everyday life were the backdrop to the post-war renegotiation of Italian national identity. The estimated number of people killed in Trieste is disputed, varying from hundreds to thousands.\\"In Trieste, Investigation of Brutal Era Is Blocked\\", New York Times, 20 April 1997. Raoul Pupo estimates 3,000 to 4,000 total victims, across all areas of former Yugoslavia and Italy, while adding that the foibe issue has been exploited politically by the Italian far-right. Gaia Baracetti notes that Italian representations of foibe, such as a miniseries on national television, are replete with historical inaccuracies and stereotypes, portraying Slavs as ‚Äúmerciless assassins‚Äù, similar to fascist propaganda, while ‚Äúlargely ignoring the issue of Italian war crimes‚Äù Events 4 November 1943: next to the Foiba of Terli are decomposed corpses of Albina Radecchi (A), Catherine Radecchi (B), Fosca Radecchi (C) and Amalia Ardossi (D) The first (disputed) claims of people being thrown into foibe date to 1943, after the Wehrmacht took back the area from the Partisans. The Germans threw around 70 local people into a foiba in retaliation for the bombing of a cinema that German soldiers attended..Konrad Eisenbichler, A Tragedy Revealed by Door Arrigo Petacco,pg 63; accessed 17 March 2016. Other authors claimed the 70 hostages were killed and burned in the Nazi lager of the Risiera of San Sabba, on 4 April 1944.Deportazione Campi, bibliolab.it; accessed 17 March 2016. , storiain.net; accessed 17 March 2016. , lageredeportazione.org; accessed 17 March 2016. After Italy's surrender in September 1943, Partisan forces extended their liberated territory to much of the former Italian occupation zone, and in some areas carried out reprisal killings, In 1944, the secretary of the Fascist party stated in the local Fascist party newspaper, ‚ÄúCorriere Istriano‚Äù, that altogether 481 Italians were killed in the 1943 reprisals in all of Istria and Dalmatia, and that among these victims ‚ÄúFascists were the most numerous‚Äù. Another report from the time describes the 1943 foibe victims as \\"our squadristi\\" (i.e. members of fascist squads) Many of the bodies found in the Basovizza pit, and in the foibe of Corgnale, Grgar, Plomin, Komen, Socerb, Val Rosandra, Cassorana, Labin, Tinjan, Cerenizza, Heki, and others were ethnic Italians. Scholar Katia Pizzi writes that, > \\"despite evidence that Fascist soldiers had also used foibe as open-air > cemeteries for opponents of the regime, only their equivalent use on the > part of Yugoslav partisans appeared to arouse general censure, enriched as > it was with the most gruesome details.\\"Katia Pizzi, 'Silentes Loquimur': > 'Foibe' and Border Anxiety in Post-War Literature from Trieste, questia.com; > accessed 26 September 2015. IBetween 1945 and 1948, Italian authorities recovered a total 369 corpses from foibe in the Italian territory temporarily held by Yugoslav forces (Zone A), and another 95 were recovered from mass graves in the same area. Many of these were military forces, some of these were German soldiers and Slovene collaborators. In 1947, the British envoy, W. J. Sullivan wrote of Italians arrested and deported by Yugoslav forces from around Trieste: > \\"there is little doubt, while some of the persons deported may have been > innocent, others were undoubtedly active fascists with more than mere party > memberships on their conscience. Some of these have returned to Trieste but > have kept well out of the of the Allied authorities, not participating in > enquiries about the deportations for fear of arrest and trial 'for their > former fascist activities'.\\" At the end of the war, near the site of the most famous Basovizza foibe, a big battle took place between Germans and Yugoslav forces, and after the battle local villagers threw dead German soldiers and horses into the mine shaft. After the war the Basovizza foibe was used by the Italian authorities as a garbage dump. Newspaper reports from the postwar era claimed anywhere from 18 to 3,000 Basovizza foibe victims, but Trieste authorities refused to fully excavate Basovizza, citing financial constraints. Thus no Italian victims were ever recovered or determined at Basovizza. In 1959 the pit was sealed and a monument erected, which later became the central site for the annual foibe commemorations. Number of victims The number of those killed or left in foibe during and after the war is still unknown; it is difficult to establish and a matter of controversy. Estimates range from hundreds to twenty thousand. Scholar Katia Pizzi claims that \\"In 1943 and 1945, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Italians, both partisans [belligerents] and civilians, were imprisoned and subsequently thrown alive by Yugoslav partisans into various chasms in the Karst region and the hinterland of Trieste and Gorizia\\".Katia Pizzi, 'Silentes Loquimur': 'Foibe' and Border Anxiety in Post-War Literature from Trieste; accessed 26 September 2015. According to data gathered by a joint Slovene-Italian historical commission established in 1993, \\"the violence was further manifested in hundreds of summary executions - victims were mostly thrown into the Karst chasms (foibe) - and in the deportation of a great number of soldiers and civilians, who either wasted away or were killed during the deportation\\". Historians Raoul Pupo and Roberto Spazzali, have estimated the total number of victims at about 5,000, and note that the targets were not \\"Italians\\", but military and repressive forces of the Fascist regime, and civilians associated with the regime. More recently, Pupo has revised the total victims estimates to 3,000 to 4,000. Italian historian Guido Rumici estimated the number of Italians executed, or died in Yugoslav concentration camps, as between 6,000 and 11,000,Guido Rumici, Infoibati (1943-1945). I Nomi, I Luoghi, I Testimoni, I Documenti, Mursia, 2002; . while Mario Pacor estimated that after the armistice about 400-500 people were killed in the foibe and about 4,000 were deported, many of whom were later executed. According to some, the episodes of 1945 occurred partly under conditions of guerrilla warfare by Croatian and Slovenian Partisans against the Germans, the Italian Social Republic and their Slavic collaborators (the Chetniks, the Usta≈°e and Domobranci) and partly after the territory had been secured by Yugoslav army formations. It was not possible to extract all the corpses from the foibe, some of which are deeper than several hundred meters; some sources are attempting to compile lists of locations and possible victim numbers. Between October and December 1943, the Fire brigade of Pola, helped by mine workers, recovered a total of 159 victims of the first wave of mass killings from the foibe of Vines (84 bodies), Terli (26 bodies), Treghelizza (2 bodies), Pucicchi (11 bodies), Villa Surani (26 bodies), Cregli (8 bodies) and Carnizza d'Arsia (2 bodies); another 44 corpses were recovered in the same period from two bauxite mines in Lindaro and Villa Bassotti.Foibe: revisionismo di Stato e amnesie della RepubblicaFoibe, bilancio e rilettura, nonluoghi.info, February 2015; accessed 17 March 2016. More bodies were sighted, but not recovered. The most famous Basovizza foiba, was investigated by English and American forces, starting immediately on June 12, 1945. After 5 months of investigation and digging, all they found in the foiba were the remains of 150 German soldiers and one civilian killed in the final battles for Basovizza on April 29‚Äì30, 1945. The Italian mayor, Gianni Bartoli continued with investigations and digging until 1954, with speleologists entering the cave multiple time, yet they found nothing. Between November 1945 and April 1948, firefighters, speleologists and policemen inspected foibe and mine shafts in the \\"Zone A\\" of the Free Territory of Trieste (mainly consisting in the surroundings of Trieste), where they recovered 369 corpses; another 95 were recovered from mass graves in the same area. No inspections were ever carried out either in the Yugoslav-controlled \\"Zone B\\", or in the rest of Istria. Other foibe and mass graves were discovered in more recent times; for instance, human remains were discovered in the Idrijski Log foiba near Idrija, Slovenia, in 1998; four skeletons were found in the foiba of Plahuti near Opatija in 2002; in the same year, a mass grave containing the remains of 52 Italians and 15 Germans was discovered in Slovenia, not far from Gorizia; in 2005, the remains of about 130 people killed between the 1940s and the 1950s were recovered from four foibe located in northeastern Istria.Sono 130 i corpi riemersi da quattro foibe istriane, gelocal.it; accessed 17 March 2016.Monte Maggiore, quattro infoibati I resti appartengono a persone decedute poco pi√π di cinquant‚Äôanni faSlovenia, da una fossa comune spuntano i resti di 52 italianiEsplora il significato del termine: Cosi‚Äô ho fatto scoprire la foiba dimenticata Cosi' ho fatto scoprire la foiba dimenticataAlla foiba di Montenero d‚ÄôIdria Background Istrian population (1900-10) - Italians were majority in west coast (darker shades), while Slavic-speakers were majority elsewhere Since the early Middle Ages, Latin, South Slavic and Venetian communities in Istria and Dalmatia had lived peacefully side by side. The population was divided into urban-coastal communities (mainly Romance speakers) and rural communities (mainly Slavic speakers), with small minorities of Morlachs and Istro-Romanians.\\"Italian islands in a Slavic sea\\". Arrigo Petacco, Konrad Eisenbichler, A tragedy revealed, p. 9. Sociologically, the population was divided into Latin middle-upper classes (bourgeoisie and aristocracy in coastal areas and in the towns) and Slavic lower classes (peasants and shepherds inland). In the 1910 Austro-Hungarian census, Istria had a population of 57.8% Slavic-speakers (Croat and Slovene), and 38.1% Italian speakers.Spezialortsrepertorium der √∂sterreichischen L√§nder I-XII, Wien, 1915‚Äì1919 For the Austrian Kingdom of Dalmatia, (i.e. Dalmatia), the 1910 numbers were 96.2% Slavic speakers and 2.8% Italian speakers: = After World War I = To get Italy to join the Triple Entente in WWI, the secret 1915 Treaty of London promised Italy Istria and parts of Dalmatia, German- speaking South Tyrol, the Greek Dodecanese Islands, parts of Albania and Turkey, plus more territory for Italy's North Africa colonies. After World War I, the whole of the former Austrian Julian March, including Istria, and Zadar in Dalmatia were annexed by Italy, while Dalmatia (except Zadar) was annexed by the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Contrary to the Treaty of London, in 1919 Gabrielle D‚ÄôAnnunzio led an army of 2,600 Italian war veterans to seize the city of Fiume (Rijeka). D‚ÄôAnnunzio created the Italian Regency of Carnaro, with him as its dictator, or Comandante, and a constitution foreshadowing the Fascist system. After D‚ÄôAnnuzio's removal, Fiume briefly become a Free State, but local Fascists in 1922 carried out a coup, and in 1924 Italy annexed Fiume. As a result, 480,000 Slavic-speakers came under Italian rule, while 12,000 Italian speakers were left in Yugoslavia, mostly in Dalmatia. Italy began a policy of forced Italianization Italy forbade Slavic languages in public institutions and schools, moved 500 Slovene teachers to the interior of Italy, replacing them with Italian ones, the government changed people‚Äôs names to Italian ones, Slavic cultural, sporting and political associations were banned. As a result, 100,000 Slavic speakers left Italian areas in an exodus, moving mostly to Yugoslavia. In Fiume alone, the Slavic population declined by 66% by 1925, compared to pre-WWI levels. The remnants of the Italian community in Dalmatia (which had started a slow but steady emigration to Istria and Venice during the 19th century) left their cities toward Zadar and the Italian mainland. During the early 1920s, nationalistic violence was directed both against the Slovene and Croat minorities in Istria (by Italian nationalists and Fascists) and the Italian minority in Dalmatia (by Slovene and Croat nationalists). Examples are the 1918‚Äì20 unrest in Split, when members of the Italian minority and their properties were assaulted by Croatian nationalists (and two Italian Navy personnel and a Croatian civilian were later killed during riots), and the burning of the Trieste National Hall, the main center of the Slovene minority in Trieste, by Italian nationalists and fascists. During D‚ÄôAnnunzio‚Äôs armed 1919-1920 occupation of Fiume, hundreds of mostly non-Italians were arrested, including many leaders of the Slavic community, and thousands of Slavs started to flee the city, with additional anti-Slav violence during the 1922 Fascist coup,. In a 1920 speech in Pola (Pula) Istria, Benito Mussolini proclaimed In 1944, near the end of a war in which Nazis, Fascists and their allies killed over 800,000 Yugoslavs, Croat poet Vladimir Nazor wrote: \\"We will wipe away from our territory the ruins of the destroyed enemy tower, and we will throw them in the deep sea of oblivion. In the place of a destroyed Zara, a new Zadar will be reborn, and this will be our revenge in the Adriatic\\".L'esodo. (Zara had been under Fascist rule for 22 years, and was in ruins because of heavy Allied bombing). In 1911, complaining of local Italian efforts to falsely count Slovenes as Italians, the Trieste Slovene newspaper Edinost wrote: ‚ÄúWe are here, we want to stay here and enjoy our rights! We throw the ruling clique the glove a duel, and we will not give up until artificial Trieste Italianism is crushed in dust, lying under our feet.‚Äù Due to these complaints, Austria carried a census recount, and the number of Slovenes increased by 50-60% in Trieste and Gorizia, proving Slovenes were initially falsely counted as Italians. =World War II= In April 1941, Italy attacked Yugoslavia, and occupied large portions of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia, directly annexing Ljubljana Province, Gorski Kotar and Central Dalmatia, along with most Croatian islands. To suppress the mounting resistance led by the Partisans, the Italians adopted tactics of \\"summary executions, hostage-taking, reprisals, internments and the burning of houses and villages.\\".General Roatta's War against the Partisans in Yugoslavia: 1942, IngentaConnect The Italian government sent tens-of-thousands of Slavs, among them many women and children, to Italian concentration camps , such as Rab, Gonars, Monigo, Renicci, Molat, Zlarin, Mamula, etc. From Ljubljana Province alone, historians estimate the Italians sent 25,000 to 40,000 Slovenes to concentration camps, which represents 8-12% of the total population. Thousands died in the camps, including hundreds of children. The Italian forces executed thousands of additional civilians as hostages and conducted massacres, such as the Podhum massacre in 1942. . Investigations Investigations of the crimes had not been initiated either by Italy, Yugoslavia or any international bodies in the post-war period until after Slovenia became an independent country in 1991. In 1993 a study titled Pola Istria Fiume 1943-1945Gaetano La Perna, Pola Istria Fiume 1943-1945, Mursia, 1993 by Gaetano La Perna provided a detailed list of the victims of Yugoslav occupation (in September‚ÄìOctober 1943 and from 1944 to the very end of the Italian presence in its former provinces) in the area. La Perna gave a list of 6,335 names (2,493 military, 3,842 civilians). The author considered this list \\"not complete\\".Gaetano La Perna, Pola Istria Fiume 1943-1945, Mursia, 1993, p. 452 A 2002 joint report by Rome's Society of Fiuman studies (Societ√† di Studi Fiumani) and Zagreb's Croatian Institute of History (Hrvatski institut za povijest) concluded that from Rijeka and the surrounding area \\"no less than 500 persons of Italian nationality lost their lives between 3 May 1945 and 31 December 1947. To these we should add an unknown number of 'missing' (not less than a hundred) relegated into anonymity due to missing inventory in the Municipal Registries together with the relevant number of victims having (...) Croatian nationality (who were often, at least between 1940 and 1943, Italian citizens) determined after the end of war by the Yugoslav communist regime.\\"p. 95: \\"Si pu√≤ comunque affermare con assoluta certezza che a Fiume, per mano di militari e della polizia segreta (OZNA prima e UDBA poi), (...) non meno di 500 persone di nazionalit√† italiana persero la vita fra il 3 maggio (1945) e il 31 dicembre 1947.

According to the Slovene government, \\"the list contains the names of persons arrested in May 1945 and whose destiny cannot be determined with certainty or whose death cannot be confirmed\\". Alleged motives It has been alleged that the killings were part of a purge aimed at eliminating potential enemies of communist Yugoslav rule, which would have included members of German and Italian fascist units, Italian officers and civil servants, parts of the Italian elite who opposed both communism and fascism (including the leadership of Italian anti-fascist partisan organizations and the leaders of Fiume's Autonomist Party, including Mario Blasich and Nevio Skull), Slovenian and Croatian anti-communists, collaborators and radical nationalists. Others claim the main motive for the killings was retribution for the years of Italian repression, forced Italianization, suppression of Slavic sentiments and killings performed by Italian authorities during the war, not just in the concentration camps (such as Rab and Gonars), but also in reprisals often undertaken by the fascists. However, still others claim Tito's political aim of adding the Istrian territories as far as Trieste to the new Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. The ethnic map of the area could potentially be a decisive factor in a treaty of peace with Italy and for this reason, according to some Italian historians, the reduction of the ethnic Italian population was held desirable. Pamela Ballinger in her book, History in Exile: Memory and Identity at the Borders of the Balkans, wrote: The report by the mixed Italian-Slovenian commission describes the circumstances of the 1945 killings as follows:Slovene-Italian Relations 1880-1956 Report 2000 Post- War The foibe have been a neglected subject in mainstream political debate in Italy, Yugoslavia and former-Yugoslav nations, only recently garnering attention with the publication of several books and historical studies. It is thought that after World War II, while Yugoslav politicians rejected any alleged crime, Italian politicians wanted to direct the country's attention toward the future and away from the idea that Italy was, in fact, a defeated nation. So, the Italian government tactically \\"exchanged\\" the impunity of the Italians accused by Yugoslavia for the renunciation to investigate the foibe massacres. Italy never extradited or prosecuted some 1,200 Italian Army officers, government officials or former Fascist Party members accused of war crimes by Yugoslavia, Ethiopia, Greece and other occupied countries and remitted to the United Nations War Crimes Commission. On the other hand, Belgrade didn't insist overmuch on requesting the prosecution of alleged Italian war criminals. Thus, both Italian war crimes and Yugoslav war and post-war mass killings were set aside if not forgotten to maintain a \\"good neighbour\\" policy. Re-emergence of the issue For several Italian historians these killings were the beginning of organized ethnic cleansing. The event was discussed by Jo≈æe Pirjevec in connection to the Porz√ªs massacre, in which 17 members of the anti-fascist group \\"Brigate Osoppo\\" (among whom was a female prisoner) were killed by members of the Italian Communist Party (among them, the nineteen-year-old Guido Pasolini, the brother of famous Italian writer Paolo Pasolini). Silvio Berlusconi's coalition government brought the issue back into open discussion: the Italian Parliament (with the support of the vast majority of the represented parties) made February 10 National Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe, first celebrated in 2005 with exhibitions and observances throughout Italy (especially in Trieste). The occasion is held in memory of innocents killed and forced to leave their homes, with little support from their home country. In Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's words: Time has come for thoughtful remembrance to take the place of bitter resentment. Moreover, for the first time, leaders from the Italian Left, such as Walter Veltroni, visited the Basovizza foiba and admitted the culpability of the Left in covering up the subject for decades. However, the conciliatory moves by Ciampi and Veltroni were not endorsed by all Italian political groups. Nowadays, a large part of the Italian Left acknowledges the nature of the foibe massacres, as attested by some declarations of Luigi Malabarba, Senator for the Communist Refoundation Party, during the parliamentary debate on the institution of the National Memorial Day: \\"In 1945 there was a ruthless policy of exterminating opponents. Here, one must again recall Stalinism to understand what Tito's well-organized troops did. (...) Yugoslav Communism had deeply assimilated a return to nationalism that was inherent to the idea of 'Socialism in One Country'. (...) The war, which had begun as anti-fascist, became anti-German and anti-Italian.\\" Italian president Giorgio Napolitano took an official speech during celebration of the \\"Memorial Day of Foibe Massacres and Istrian-Dalmatian exodus\\" in which he stated:Presidenza della Repubblica, Giorgio Napolitano, official speech for the celebration of \\"Giorno del Ricordo\\" Quirinal on 10 February 2007 integral text from official website of the Italian President Bureau The Croatian President Stipe Mesiƒá immediately responded in writing, stating that: The incident was resolved in a few days after diplomatic contacts between the two presidents at the Italian foreign ministry. On February 14, the Office of the President of Croatia issued a press statement: In Italy, with Law 92 of 30 March 2004http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/04092l.htm Legge n. 92 del 30 marzo 2004 has been instituted the Day of Remembrance in day 10 February, to keep memory of victims of Foibe and of the exodus to which almost the whole population of Italian origins living in Dalmatia and Julian March has been constricted by jugoslavians. The same law has instituted a specific medal to be conferred to relatives of victims: :100px Medal of Day of Remembrance to relatives of victims of foibe killings In February 2012, a photo of Italian troops killing Slovene civilians was shown on public Italian TV as if being the other way round. When historian Alessandra Kersevan, who was a guest, pointed out to the television host Bruno Vespa that the photo depicted the killings of some Slovenes rather than Italians, the host did not apologize. A diplomatic protest followed.Il giorno del ricordo - Porta a Porta, from Rai website; accessed 26 September 2015.

Since most of the foibe currently lie outside Italian territory, no formal and complete investigation could be carried out during the years of the Cold war, and books could be of a speculative or anecdotal nature. Many authors from the left wing have maintained that the foibe were an exaggeration (or, some suggested, an invention) of the extreme right for propaganda purposes, and that the fascist crimes in the same areas dwarf even the most lavish of the foibe allegations. * Pamela Ballinger, History in Exile: Memory and Identity at the Borders of the Balkans, Princeton University Press, 2002, . * Benjamin David Lieberman, Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe, Ivan R.

London's existing principal airports, Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, are each sub-optimally located in various ways, such as being too close to built-up areas or requiring aircraft to fly low over London. In the case of Heathrow, the growth of air traffic has meant that the airport is operating at 98% capacity. Several locations for a new airport have been proposed in the Thames Estuary, to the east of London. These include Maplin Sands off Foulness on the north side of the estuary; Cliffe and the Isle of Grain in Kent on the south side; and artificial islands located off the Isle of Sheppey such as the \\"Boris Island\\" proposal championed by Boris Johnson, the then Mayor of London. Economic considerations have so far ruled out a new coastal airport, while political considerations have ruled out a new inland airport, leaving planners with an as-yet-unresolved dilemma. On 17 December 2013 the \\"Airports Commission: interim report\\" was published. The proposal for an Isle of Grain airport underwent further study in 2014 before the final report was delivered in Summer 2015. In October 2016, the go-ahead for a third runway at Heathrow was given meaning that the idea of a Thames Estuary airport is now unlikely.. Background Before World War II, Croydon Airport was London's principal airport. In 1943 the government built a new heavy military transport airfield on a rural site to the west of London near the village of Heathrow. It was converted to civilian use after the war and went into service as London Airport, later London Heathrow Airport, on 25 February 1946. Another airport already existed at Gatwick and had been used since 1930 as a relief airport for Croydon. A rapid growth in air traffic during the 1950s led to Gatwick becoming London's official second airport in 1954 to accommodate the overspill from Heathrow. Neither location is ideal ‚Äì the prevailing winds over Heathrow mean that flights have to approach the airport by flying over London, and growth of the city means both airports are now located in built-up areas. In 1943 the aircraft designer Frederick George Miles of Miles Aircraft and long time associate, architect Guy Morgan suggested the construction of a new airport, including a flying boat base, between Cliffe and Allhallows. Intended to serve 8 million passengers per year, the cost of the scheme was estimated at ¬£20 million. It was planned with a central Terminus, three concrete runways each two and a half miles long and was intended to operate 24 hours a day. By 1960, it was becoming apparent that further air capacity was needed. Stansted, a former military airfield in Essex, was proposed as a third airport in 1963. A Government White Paper endorsed Stansted in 1967 and in 1968, after an inconclusive public inquiry, the Government appointed Hon. Mr Justice Roskill to head the Commission on the Third London Airport (the \\"Roskill Commission\\") to review sites for a third airport. Cublington in the Vale of Aylesbury was its chosen site.Hall, p. 20 It was seen offering the best access, as it was situated on the key London-Birmingham axis, it would be away from built-up areas and it would cost less than most of the alternatives.Hall, p. 33 The proposal met with strong opposition from local people and more broadly from politicians and middle-class voters which made it politically untenable.Hall, p. 37 Proposals =Maplin (Foulness)= One influential member of the Roskill Commission, Colin Buchanan, dissented on environmental and planning grounds and proposed an alternative site at Maplin Sands, Foulness, in the Thames Estuary. This opened the door to strong political opposition against Cublington and in April 1971 the government announced that the site at Maplin Sands had been selected for the third London airport, even though it was the most remote and overall the most expensive of the options considered, and that planning would begin immediately. In due course the Maplin Development Act received Royal Assent in October 1973. In 1973 a Special Development Order was made under the Town and Country Planning Acts granting planning permission for the project, and the Maplin Development Authority was constituted and began its work. The project would have included not just a major airport, but a deep-water harbour suitable for the container ships then coming into use, a high-speed rail link together with the M12 and M13 motorways to London, and a new town for the accommodation of the thousands of workers who would be required. The new town would eventually cover 82 square miles, with a population of 600,000 people, while the surface route to the airport would require a corridor 100 yards wide and over 30 miles long. The cost would be a then-astronomical ¬£825 million (¬£ million today), which many ‚Äì particularly in the Labour Party, which was in opposition at the time ‚Äì regarded as unacceptable.Hall, pp. 38‚Äì39 The Maplin airport project was abandoned in July 1974 when Labour came to power.Hall, p. 40 A reappraisal of passenger projections indicated that there would be capacity until 1990 at Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton, aided by regional airports. The scheme was abandoned in favour of a cheaper plan to enlarge Stansted rather than building an entirely new airport; the requirement for a container ship harbour was to be discharged by the development of Felixstowe. The dilemma regarding the location of an additional airport, whether inland or on the coast, was summed up by an airport expert quoted by New Scientist magazine in 1973: \\"An inland site is not on politically, and a coastal site is not on economically.\\" Duncan Needham argues that the challenge of airport expansion at Maplin provides direct parallels with airport expansion following the 2006 Department of Transport strategy and debates by policy makers in the subsequent U.K governments regarding a proposed third runway at Heathrow. =Cliffe= In 2002 a Department for Transport study identified a site at Cliffe on the Hoo Peninsula in north Kent as the leading contender among potential sites for a new airport for London. The proposal was for up to four runways arranged in two east-west close parallel pairs, with a possible fifth runway on a different alignment, which might be used only at night and in particular weather conditions. In December 2003 the government decided against the Cliffe proposal on the grounds that the costs of a coastal site were too high, and there was a significant risk that the airport would not be well used. After 2008, the then Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, led scoping studies for a further airport in north Kent. Suggestions included the development of a major International hub at Cliffe which would link in with the HS1 line through Kent to St Pancras. The Cameron government was committed to a full Aviation Review and a scoping study was released in March 2011. =Isle of Sheppey= The \\"Marinair\\" proposal was put forward in the 1990s, in which an airport would be built on an offshore artificial island in the Thames estuary, north east of the Isle of Sheppey. When the proposal was put forward again in the government's 2002 consultation, it was rejected on the grounds of insufficient information and prohibitive expense. The Marinair plans had been developed in the years prior to 1990 by Covell Matthews Partnership, and a Thames Estuary Airport Company Ltd established to manage the project, under the direction of A. E. T. Matthews, Managing Director. =\\"Boris Island\\"= The proposal was revived in 2008 by then Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, located a little further to the east towards the Shivering Sands area, north-east of Whitstable. The deputy mayor, Kit Malthouse, has supported a Thames estuary airport since before taking office. In November 2008 the mayor appointed Doug Oakervee (executive chair of Crossrail) to lead the Greater London Authority's preliminary feasibility study which determined in October 2009 that there is \\"no logical constraint\\" to the plan. The proposal has acquired the popular nickname of \\"Boris Island\\", and is frequently referred to as such in the press. A new iteration of the proposal named the London Britannia Airport was unveiled in November 2013. In early 2014 it was revealed that the UK Airports Commission, in its interim report, did not recommend the London Britannia proposal for further analysis. =Thames Hub Airport= The Thames Hub Airport (like Shivering Sands, nicknamed \\"Boris Island\\" after Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London'Boris Island' airport idea to be included in official consultation(retrieved 24 January 2012)) is a proposal for a 4-runway hub airport to be located on the Isle of Grain in Kent. The airport was part of the Thames Hub integrated infrastructure development developed by architects Foster + Partners, infrastructure consultants Halcrow and economists Volterra and launched at the Institution of Civil Engineers in London on 2 November 2011.\\"Thames Hub\\" Foster + Partners Thames Hub combines rail, freight logistics, aviation, energy and its transmission, flood protection and regional development in the Thames Estuary and connects this infrastructure to a trade and utilities spine that runs the length of the country. The airport would be built on a platform straddling the land and sea off the Isle of Grain on the Hoo Peninsula. It would be opened in 2029 with an initial handling capacity of 110 million passengers per annum. It would be connected to London by a short spur off HS1 with a journey time of 26 minutes. The site was selected for its proximity to London ‚Äì at 34 miles (55 km) from the centre and close proximity to HS1, the airport could be reached in 26 minutes by high- speed rail. The proposal to build the airport on a platform, like those at Chek Lap Kok in Hong Kong and New Doha International Airport in Qatar, would allow flights to take off and land over water, significantly reducing noise impacts and enabling the airport to operate 24 hours a day. The airport would accommodate long-haul airline schedules and growing demand in the Asian market. Thus it would reassert London's geographical advantage as the stop-off point between North America and Eurasia, which is being eroded by a combination of new long-range aircraft and the emergence of networks centred on a global hub, such as Dubai. The Thames Hub Airport proposal was submitted to the UK's Airports Commission by Foster+Partners in July 2013 as a proposed solution to the question of how the UK can maintain its global hub status. The future remained unclear as the option was not on the Commission's original short list, but was still considered. It was finally rejected on grounds of cost (possibly as high as ¬£100 billion) and environmental damage by the Airports Commission in an announcement made on 2 September 2014, leaving Gatwick and Heathrow as the remaining options. Advantages Many advantages have been claimed for an airport in the Thames estuary, particularly as a replacement for Heathrow:The Marinair proposal provides many arguments for an airport in the Thames estuary. * Flights could arrive and depart 24 hours a day. * The airport would be connected directly to the Channel Tunnel railway services, replacing the demand on short European flights with more efficient train service which reduces CO2 emissions by 10 times per journey. * The new airport would be located over water and not land, so reduces the risks related to emergency landing in densely populated urban areas or concerns over mid-air collision at overloaded runways. * Use of the existing infrastructure such as high-speed rail line and expanded 8 lane M25/M2 would require far less public funding and would be less complex to adapt than in London for Heathrow Airport rail and road upgrades. * Would negate the need for a controversial third runway at London Heathrow Airport, or a second runway at London Gatwick Airport or London Stansted Airport * Offshore island can be easily expanded and new barrier would help to control floodplain. * The cost of the airport development would be absorbed by the cost to include a new Thames Barrier that will generate power using hydropower turbines. * A high-speed rail link to London with a journey time of around 20 minutes would encourage more passengers to reach the airport using public transport. Objectors point to the possibility that a high-speed rail link to Heathrow could also be built. However, such a link would require expensive tunnelling under London, and was costed in July 2008 at ¬£4.5bn. * A high-speed rail link to the nearby High Speed 1 would make London's airport a more suitable hub for north-western continental Europe: closer, and easier to reach. * Crossrail could be extended easily to connect new airport. * Eurostar could be accessed easily via the new airport. * Under the Shivering Sands proposal, it would be possible to reach the airport from terminals in both Kent and Essex, diminishing the amount of new traffic and congestion imposed on either county. * New flight paths to the new airport would reduce the impact on air and noise pollution over London by huge volumes. * Regeneration of the deprived Thames Gateway. * Release of of prime land at Heathrow, close to the M4 and with excellent rail links, highly suitable for housing redevelopment. * Flexible approach for future expansion, such as new runways or Virgin Galactic type development. * Possible direct connection with Central London using high-speed catamarans as a new state-of- the-art tourist attraction. * The development and running of the airport would create tens of thousands of jobs. * Possibility to be used as a hub for international cruise liners, utilizing the high-speed connections from all over the UK and Europe. * The new airport will connect air, rail, sea and motorway transport within a single hub, excellent for transport and to import/export product from the island. Disadvantages A number of disadvantages to an airport in the Thames estuary have been pointed out: * It would require major investment in local infrastructure (roads, railways, schools, hospitals) in order to service the tens of thousands of employees at a major airport. * There would be considerable upheaval involved in moving London's main airport to a new location, though other major cities have successfully moved their main airports, including Paris (1974), Singapore (1981), Jakarta (1985), Munich (1992), Denver (1995), Oslo (1998), Hong Kong (1998), Kuala Lumpur (1998), Athens (2001), Seoul (2001), Bangkok (2006) and Doha (2013) while other cities, such as Montr√©al, have had difficulty with such a transition. * There would be significant job losses at Heathrow, and knock-on impacts to the economy of west London. * Fog would be a key difficulty to overcome for a possible hub airport. In 2012, the Met Office concluded that the Thames Estuary was 'three times' more foggy than Heathrow. Fog and snow frequently affect flights at Heathrow, forcing aircraft to leave more space for take-off and landing due to low visibility. Whereas a Thames estuary airport could transfer travellers by Eurostar and new fog guidance systems can be used to overcome these issues, however Heathrow has not yet installed them. * The construction costs of the airport alone would be large, estimated at ¬£11.5 billion for Cliffe, and ¬£3.5 billion more for an offshore island scheme. * There would be large costs for constructing road and rail access to the airport. These were estimated at ¬£1.8 billion for Cliffe, including two rail connections to High Speed 1, a road tunnel under the Thames to Benfleet, largely to access the south east Essex labour market, and other road and rail connections. Heathrow rely on public transport and funding for transport infrastructure; major upgrades are also required and need to be considered for rail and motorways. * Proposals rely on using capacity on High Speed 1; however, it currently only uses under 10% of its full potential. * Building an artificial offshore island can be expanded; however is time- consuming, adding 3 to 5 years to the construction time. * There is a risk of bird strike, higher for coastal sites, lower for offshore sites. * The level of demand for an airport in the Thames estuary is uncertain, and may require government intervention to force airlines to use it. * The massive skilled, semi- and unskilled workforce that a new airport would require (currently all situated in or near West London) * Building a major new airport to expand capacity may encourage more flights, and thereby increase emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, unless a channel tunnel is connected to replace many flights. * The presence of the wreck of the SS Richard Montgomery, which has around 1,400 tons of explosives on board. A safe way to remove the wreck, present since 1944, has not yet been found. * It would require a radical upgrade to the current flight patterns which are based on 1970s patterns, and the proximity to Dutch and Belgian airspace may cause knock-on effects in other countries if not planned properly like Heathrow. * The South East of England (SE) is already highly developed, with a population density reported (in 2011) as the third (or sixth, by other criteria) most dense in the world. Many areas of the SE already have three or four layers of audible air traffic over them. * The location would be more difficult to access from the rest of the country compared to Heathrow. * Building the airport would destroy the habitat of thousands of wetland birds. * The airport would be placed in the flight path of four of London's five major airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, and London-City). * London Southend Airport would have to close down. Due to its close proximity from the planned airport sites. * A 2012 report by the South East Local Enterprise Partnership prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff concluded that they \\"do not believe that [the Thames Estuary Airport] is a viable solution to the capacity issues facing the SE.\\" in the short term, but \\"applaud the fact that a long term solution is being seriously discussed\\". * Infrastructure - building of new main airport (and the required supporting industrial, technical and hospitality activities) may be very costly, especially to achieve the same position and size of terminals and technologies like in case of Heathrow or Dubai ports, where, despite cheap sand start place, the cost of all was very big. * Travel to London ticket price. Unknown is how much the ticket may cost, and if the airport would be at position of London tariff schemes. The position of Heathrow as part of the London underground system is often cited as a cost and time difference. For an average traveller usually the time and cost to travel into city centre would be main reason of choosing. Location in the deep sea may be treated as an advantage for most people, only if the travel time (at least by public transport) would be faster or similar that from LHR, and would cost less, or for e.g. be fared like usual Zone 1 ticket.http://alexasigno.co.uk/gatwick-vs- heathrow/ * The proximity of Amsterdam's Schiphol airport would also affect traffic patterns and force aircraft into more circuitous flight paths. * The potential interference with one of the busiest shipping routes in Europe.http://www.theengineer.co.uk/in-depth/analysis/your-questions-answered- thames-estuary-airport/1017292.article References External links * Favorable reaction of London Mayor towards the Marinar concept.

It is a manor house set on a estate that was originally part of a tract called Nicholson's Manor. It was patented by William Nicholson of Kent County, Maryland in 1719. The property in what is now known as the Worthington Valley was split up in 1754 and sold in 1050-acre lots to Roger Boyce, Corbin Lee, Brian Philpot, and Thinsey Johns. The house known as Stone Hall was built on the 360-acre plantation bought by Thomas Gent, in 1775 from Philpot. Gent served as a colonel in the Baltimore Militia during the Revolutionary War. The house was built in four section beginning in the late eighteenth century: the initial stage consisted of a -story fieldstone structure built before 1783; the north and south wings were added between 1783 and 1798; and the -story, gable-roofed, fieldstone main block at the north end. During the later years as a working plantation in the antebellum period, the -story structure was likely used as a separate kitchen. Other outbuildings would have included slave quarters. Many of these were likely kept after emancipation to be used by sharecroppers. The last section of the mansion, a -story fieldstone addition, was built about 1930, probably after the property was bought by Garnet and Salina Hulings. Also on the property is a barn, carriage house, and a blacksmith shop. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

The film stars Jess Weixler and was produced by Lichtenstein on a budget of $2 million. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2007, and was distributed by Roadside Attractions for a limited release in the United States. Its title refers to the ancient trope of the vagina dentata. Teeth was positively received by critics and had an international box office gross of $2,340,110. At Sundance, Weixler received the Grand Jury Prize for Acting. Plot Dawn O'Keefe (Jess Weixler) is a teenage spokesperson for a Christian abstinence group called the Promise. She attends groups with her two friends, Alisha (Julia Garro) and Phil (Adam Wagner). At her home on several occasions, she hears her stepbrother Brad (John Hensley), and his girlfriend Melanie (Nicole Swahn) arguing because Brad refuses to have vaginal intercourse with her, insisting on only having anal sex. One afternoon after giving a speech to her group about the purity ring worn by members of the group, she is introduced to Tobey (Hale Appleman), whom she finds attractive. The four begin going out as a group. Dawn has fantasies about marrying Tobey, although after acknowledging the attraction, they agree that they cannot spend time together. Soon after, they give in and meet at a local swimming hole. After swimming together, they go into a cave to get warm and they begin kissing. Dawn becomes uncomfortable and tries to get Tobey to go back outside, but Tobey becomes more physical and aggressive. Dawn panics and tries to push him off, which results in Tobey growing more infuriated. As he shakes Dawn she smacks her head on the ground and, while she is dazed, Tobey takes the opportunity to begin raping her. Dawn fights back and inadvertently bites off his penis with her vagina. A horrified Dawn stumbles away and she flees the scene. After a Promise meeting, she meets her classmate Ryan (Ashley Springer) at a dance; they talk, and he drops her off at her home. Dawn goes back to the swimming hole and she screams in horror when she sees a freshwater crab crawling on Tobey's penis. She drops her purity ring off a cliff. She then researches \\"vagina dentata\\" and realizes that she may have it. She visits a gynecologist, Dr. Godfrey (Josh Pais), in an attempt to find out what is happening to her. When he assaults her in the guise of an examination, reaching up inside her without a glove, she panics and her vagina bites off all four fingers on his right hand. While biking home, several police vehicles pass her, and she sees someone driving a car that looks like Tobey's car. She decides to go back to visit the pool to investigate. When she arrives, she sees the police bringing up Tobey's body ‚Äì he presumably died of shock in the water. Meanwhile, back at home, her ill mother, Kim O'Keefe (Vivienne Benesch), collapses. Dawn comes home and finds her, while Brad and Melanie are seen in his room having sex while Dawn's mother lies on the floor. Dawn's mother is taken to the hospital. Dawn goes to Ryan seeking help, hysterical about her encounter with the doctor and her mother. Ryan gives her a sedative and masturbates her with a vibrator. Though initially afraid she will hurt him, she finds that when she is relaxed and is consenting to the sexual activity taking place, her \\"teeth\\" do not engage. The following morning they have sex again, but mid-coitus, Ryan's friend calls. Ryan smugly boasts that he and the friend had bet on whether he could score with Dawn. In her anger, her vagina bites off his penis, and she leaves him to call his mother for help. Dawn's stepfather Bill (Lenny Von Dohlen) attempts to throw Brad out, but Brad sets his dog on Bill, during which Brad confesses his love for Dawn. Dawn meets her stepfather and Melanie at the hospital after her mother has died, and seeing her stepfather hurt and hearing from Melanie how Brad told her to ignore her mother's cries for help earlier, she becomes emboldened by her power and goes back home to seek revenge. Dawn puts on make-up and goes to seduce her stepbrother. In the midst of the act, Brad recalls that, while still kids, Dawn bit his finger, but it was not her mouth that bit him. As he realizes this, Dawn's vagina bites off his penis. She releases it on the ground and Brad's dog eats it, spitting out the genital pierced glans. Dawn leaves him and he presumably bleeds to death. Dawn cycles away from home, but her bike tire sustains a puncture, so she begins hitchhiking. She gets a lift from an old man (Doyle Carter), but falls asleep and rides for several hours, waking up after nightfall at a gas station. When she tries to get out, he repeatedly locks the doors. He licks his lips as if to ask for a sexual favor to release her; Dawn hesitates, and then looks towards the camera ‚Äî and the old man ‚Äî with a seductive smile.

Vagina dentata (Latin for toothed vagina) describes a folk tale in which a woman's vagina is said to contain teeth, with the associated implication that sexual intercourse might result in injury, emasculation, or castration for the man involved. The topic of \\"vagina dentata\\" may also cover a rare medical condition affecting the vagina, in which case it is more accurately termed a vaginal dermoid cyst. In folklore Such folk stories are frequently told as cautionary tales warning of the dangers of unknown women and to discourage rape. Erich Neumann relays one such myth in which \\"a fish inhabits the vagina of the Terrible Mother; the hero is the man who overcomes the Terrible Mother, breaks the teeth out of her vagina, and so makes her into a woman.\\" =South America= The legend also appears in the mythology of the Chaco and Guiana tribes of South America. In some versions, the hero leaves one tooth. = Hinduism = In Hinduism, the asura Andhaka, son of Shiva and Parvati (but not aware of it), is killed by Shiva when he tries to force the disguised Shiva into surrendering Parvati. Andhaka's son Adi, also an asura, takes the form of Parvati to seduce and kill Shiva with a toothed vagina in order to avenge Andhaka, but is also slain. =Ainu and Shinto legends= The Ainu legend is that a sharp-toothed demon hid inside the vagina of a young woman and emasculated two young men on their wedding nights. Consequently, the woman sought help from a blacksmith who fashioned an iron phallus to break the demon's teeth.Chamberlain, B. H. \\"The Island of Women\\". Aino Folk-Tales, 1888. pp. vii, 37. The legendary iron phallus is considered to be enshrined at the Kanayama Shinto Shrine in Kawasaki, Japan, and there the popular Festival of the Steel Phallus is held each spring. Also, prostitutes once considered that praying at that shrine protected them against sexually transmitted diseases. =MƒÅori mythology= In MƒÅori mythology, the trickster MƒÅui tries to grant mankind immortality by reversing the birth process, turning into a worm and crawling into the vagina of Hine-nui-te-p≈ç (the goddess of night and death) and out through her mouth while she sleeps. His trick is ruined when a laughs at the sight of his entry, awakening Hine-nui-te-p≈ç, who bites him to death with her obsidian vaginal teeth. =Western Asia= Arabs from South-Eastern Iran and islands in Strait of Hormuz have a legend about Menmendas, a creature that looks like a beautiful young woman with spikes on her thighs. She walks in the coastal mountains with a small box of jewels and attracts every man on her way. Menmendas goes with an attracted man into an empty house, puts the box of jewels under her head and lies down with spreading legs. If the man understands who this woman is, he can cast a fistful of sand in her eyes and run away with the box. If the man gets attracted and turned on, the woman gathers him into half-and-half by her legs. Yu. E. Berezkin, E. N.

Medical In rare instances, dermoid cysts (a type of tumor) may grow in the vagina. Dermoid cysts are formed from the outer layers of embryonic skin cells. These cells are able to mature into many different types of tissues, and these cysts are able to form anywhere the skin is or where the skin folds inwards to become another organ, such as in the ear or the vagina. However, when dermoid cysts occur in the vagina, they are covered by a layer of normal vaginal tissue and therefore appear as a lump, not as recognizable teeth.

Yapese Dictionary: English Finderlist. Updated 15 June 2012. Retrieved 25 November 2013.) traditionally refers to an island group located in the Caroline Islands of the western Pacific Ocean, a part of Yap State. The name \\"Yap\\" in recent years has come to also refer to the state within the Federated States of Micronesia, inclusive of the Yap Main Islands and its various outer islands. For specifying the island group, the name Yap Main Islands is most exact. The Yap Main Islands are considered to be made up of four separate islands: Yap Island proper (Marbaq), Gagil-Tamil, Maap (), and Rumung. The four islands are separated by relatively narrow water features, and the islands are surrounded by a common coral reef. They are formed from an uplift of the Philippine Sea Plate, and are referred to as \\"high\\" islands as opposed to atolls. The land is mostly rolling hills, densely vegetated. Mangrove swamps line much of the shore, although there are beaches on the northern sides of the islands. Excluding the reef area, the Yap Main Islands are approximately 24 km long, 5‚Äì10 km wide, and 98 km. The highest elevation is at Mount Taabiywol in Fanif municipality on Yap island proper. The Yapese people's indigenous cultures and traditions are strong compared to other states in Micronesia. Administratively, the Yap Main Islands are divided into ten municipalities that sometimes cross the water features that divide Yap into its constituent islands.

Its sighting was also recorded by the Spanish expedition of Ruy L√≥pez de Villalobos on 26 January 1543, who charted them as Los Arrecifes (\\"the reefs\\"). At Yap, the Villalobos' expedition received the same surprising greeting as previously in Fais Island from the local people approaching the ships in canoes: \\"Buenos d√≠as Matelotes!\\" (\\"Good day, sailors!\\") in perfect sixteenth-century Spanish evidencing previous presence of the Spaniards in the area. The original account of this story is included in the report that the Augustinian Fray Jer√≥nimo de Santisteban, travelling with the Villalobos' expedition, wrote for the Viceroy of New Spain, while in Kochi during the voyage home., vol.xiv (Madrid, 1870), pp.151‚Äì65. Yap also appeared in Spanish charts as Los Garbanzos (The Chickpeas in Spanish) and Gran Carolina (Great Caroline in Spanish). From the 17th century until 1899, Yap was a Spanish colony within the Captaincy General of the Philippines of the Spanish East Indies. The Spanish used Yap Island as a prison for those captured during the Philippine Revolution. After the defeat against the United States in 1898 and subsequent loss of the Philippines, Spain sold these islands and its other minor Pacific possessions to Germany. Yap was a major German naval communications center before the First World War and an important international hub for cable telegraphy, with spokes branching out to Guam, Shanghai, Rabaul, Naura and Manado (Sulawesi's North coast). It was occupied by Japanese troops in September 1914, and passed to the Japanese Empire under the Versailles Treaty in 1919 as a mandated territory under League of Nations supervision. US commercial rights on the island were secured by a special US- Japanese treaty to that effect, concluded on 11 February 1922.Text in League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 12, pp. 202‚Äì211. In World War II, Japanese-held Yap was one of the islands bypassed in the U.S. \\"island-hopping\\" strategy, although it was regularly bombed by U.S. ships and aircraft, and Yap-based Japanese bombers did some damage in return. The Japanese garrison comprised 4,423 IJA men under the command of Colonel Daihachi Itoh and 1,494 IJN men. At the end of World War II, Yap was occupied by the U.S. military victors. The U.S. held it and the rest of the Caroline Islands as a trusteeship under a United Nations mandate (the \\"Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands\\") until 1986. In that year, Yap, Truk, Pohnpei, and Kosrae formed the independent nation of the Federated States of Micronesia. Under a Compact of Free Association with the United States, Micronesian citizens and goods are allowed entry into the U.S. with few restrictions. American Peace Corps has been active in Yap from 1966 to 2018. Other US-based non-profit organizations, including Habele, have an ongoing presence on both Yap proper and its outer islands, aimed at reducing educational disparities and inequalities in access to effective classroom instruction. Culture =Stone money= stone money (Rai) in the village of Gachpar Yap is known for its stone money, known as Rai, or Fei: large doughnut-shaped, carved disks of (usually) calcite, up to 4 m (12 ft) in diameter (most are much smaller). The smallest can be as little as in diameter. Many of them were brought from other islands, as far as New Guinea, but most came in ancient times from Palau. Their value is based on both the stone's size and its history. Historically the Yapese valued the disks because the material looks like quartz, and these were the shiniest objects available. Eventually the stones became legal tender and were even mandatory in some payments.Goldberg, Dror. \\"Famous Myths of 'Fiat Money, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking 2005, 957‚Äì967 The value of the stones was kept high due to the difficulty and hazards involved in obtaining them. To quarry the stones, Yapese adventurers had to sail to distant islands and deal with local inhabitants who were sometimes hostile. Once quarried, the disks had to be transported back to Yap on rafts towed behind sail-driven canoes. The scarcity of the disks, and the effort and peril required to get them, made them valuable to the Yapese. In 1874, Irish American sea captain David O'Keefe hit upon the idea of employing the Yapese to import more \\"money\\" in the form of shiploads of large stones, also from Palau. O'Keefe then traded these stones with the Yapese for other commodities such as sea cucumbers and copra. The 1954 film His Majesty O'Keefe cast Burt Lancaster in the captain's role. Although some of the O'Keefe stones are larger than the canoe-transported stones, they are less valuable than the earlier stones due to the comparative ease with which they were obtained. As no more disks are being produced or imported, this money supply is fixed.Washington Post, 1984. The islanders know who owns which piece but do not necessarily move them when ownership changes. Their size and weight (the largest ones require 20 adult men to carry) make them very difficult to move around. Although today the United States dollar is the currency used for everyday transactions in Yap, the stone disks are still used for more traditional or ceremonial exchange. The stone disks may change ownership during marriages, transfers of land title, or as compensation for damages suffered by an aggrieved party. = Other currencies = There are four other types of currency on the Island. First there is \\"Mmbul\\" which is a length of lava-lava, the cloth used for loincloths, three or four feet long and two feet wide, wrapped up in a Betel nut sheath. Then there is \\"Gau\\" or \\"Gaw\\", a necklace of shells, up to 10 feet in length. The shells come from Canet, an island near Ponape, from Ponape itself and from Euripik. Since these come from a distance, Gau is worth more than Mmbul. \\"Yar\\" is money made of large shells about eight inches wide, pierced and tied on a coconut rope. Finally, \\"Reng\\" is the name of money made of turmeric, which is ground and mixed with water and the paste shaped into a ball, typically used for tribal ceremonies. =Living structures= There are three types of traditional buildings on Yap. The \\"tibnaw\\" is a family house and has a roof made of woven thatch (dried palm fronds). Inside, there is one open room with no lavatory. Kitchens are separate structures (t'ang) outside the family houses. The \\"faluw\\" is the \\"men's house\\"; such buildings were built on the shoreline with easy access to the sea. Prior to World War I, women had been kidnapped and taken to the faluw. Today this practice no longer occurs. Women considered it an honor to be chosen for the faluw, because only the most beautiful women would be taken there. Such a woman was called the \\"mispil\\" (resident female) of the faluw. As the island's culture was more and more influenced by the rest of the world's views on prostitution, this practice ended. Largest of the three types is the \\"p'ebay\\", a place for the community to come together for school, dances or meetings. As with all structures on Yap, it is necessary to obtain permission before entering. There are a few men's houses that women are allowed to enter, however people must always ask for permission. =Language and ethnicity= The Yapese language belongs to the Austronesian languages, more specifically to the Oceanic languages. Yap was initially settled by ancient migrants from the Malay Peninsula, the Indonesian Archipelago, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. The people of the Yap State outer islands are descendants of Micronesian settlers, and as such have significant ethnic dissimilarities from the people of the Yap Main Islands. Their culture and languages (Ulithian and Woleaian) are closely related to those of the outer islands of Chuuk. English is used as a common language. Traditional style structure with stone money indicating great wealth. The first stones were mined on Palau and carried by outrigger canoe some . =Navigation= The Yapese and Neighboring Island Yapese were some of the most renowned navigators in the Pacific. Yapese sailors traveled phenomenal distances in outrigger canoes, without the aid of a compass, navigating by the stars and the patterns of ocean waves using techniques of Micronesian and Polynesian navigation. During pre-colonial times, the people of Yap established an island empire and dominion over what are now the Neighboring Islands of Yap State. Beginning in the 19th century, Yap was colonized by the Spanish, Germans, and Japanese in succession. The double-hulled voyaging canoe Alingano Maisu, gifted by the Polynesian Voyaging Society to master navigator Mau Piailug, is home-ported on the island of Yap under the command of Piailug's son, Sesario Sewralur. =Social structure= Yapese society is based on a highly complex \\"caste system\\" involving at least seven tiers of rank.Patterson, Carolyn Bennett, et al. \\"At the Birth of Nations: In the Far Pacific.\\" National Geographic Magazine, October 1986 page 492. National Geographic Virtual Library, Accessed 17 May 2018. Historically, the caste rank of an entire village could rise or fall in comparison to other villages depending on how it fared in inter- village conflicts. Winning villages would rise in rank as a part of a peace settlement, while losing villages would have to accept a decline in comparative rank. In many cases lower ranked villages were required to pay tribute to higher ranked villages. Further, dietary taboos might be imposed on lower ranking villages, i.e., they might be prohibited from harvesting and eating the more desirable fish and animals of the sea. Further, within each village each family had its own rank comparative to the others. Until the arrival of the German colonizers, the caste ranking system was fluid and the ranks of villages and families changed in response to inter-village intrigues and confrontations. In the early twentieth century, however, the German colonial administration pacified Yap and enforced a prohibition against violent conflict. The caste ranking of each village in modern Yap thus remains the same as it was when the system was frozen in place by the Germans. The freeze left the villages of Ngolog, Teb, and Gachpar in the modern-day municipalities of Rull, Tamil, and Gagil respectively, as the highest ranking.

He is a pleasant and personable ghost, but often criticized by his three wicked uncles, the Ghostly Trio. The character was featured in 55 theatrical cartoons made between 1945 and 1959. The character has been featured in comic books published by Harvey Comics since 1952, and Harvey purchased the character outright in 1959. Casper became one of Harvey's most popular characters, headlining dozens of comic book titles. Following Harvey's purchase of the character, he appeared in five television series: Matty's Funday Funnies (1959‚Äì1961), The New Casper Cartoon Show (1963‚Äì1970), Casper and the Angels (1979‚Äì1980), The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper (1996‚Äì1998) and Casper's Scare School (2009‚Äì2012). The character has also made his theatrical appearance in the live-action film adaptation released by Universal Pictures, Casper (1995), and would later appear in four direct-to-video and made-for-TV follow-up films.  Creation of Casper the Friendly Ghost  Casper was created in the late 1930s by Seymour Reit and Joe Oriolo, the former devising the idea for the character and the latter providing illustrations. Initially intended as the basis for a 1939 children's storybook, there was at first little interest in their idea. When Reit was away on military service during World War II before the book was released, Oriolo sold the rights to the book to Paramount Pictures' Famous Studios animation division for a total of $175. This one-time payment was all that he received, missing out on a share of the revenue earned from the films, comic books and merchandising to come. The Friendly Ghost, the first Noveltoon to feature Casper, was released by Paramount in 1945 with a few differences from the book. In the cartoon adaptation, Casper is a cute ghost-child with a New York accent who inhabits a haunted house along with a community of adult ghosts who delight in scaring the living. Casper, however, is a nonconformist among ghosts: he would prefer to make friends with people. He packs up his belongings and goes out into the world, hoping to find friends. However, the animals that he meets (a rooster, a mole, a cat, a mouse named Herman, and a group of hens) take one horrified look at him, scream: \\"A ghost!\\" and run off in the other direction. Distraught, Casper unsuccessfully attempts to commit suicide (apparently forgetting that he is already dead) by lying down on a railway track before an oncoming train, before he meets two children named Bonnie and Johnny who become his friends. The children's mother, apparently widowed and impoverished, at first is frightened of Casper, but later welcomes him into the family after he unintentionally frightens off a greedy landlord, who, unwilling to own a \\"haunted\\" house, tears up the mortgage and gives her the house outright. The short ends with the mother kissing Bonnie, Johnny, and Casper as she sends them off to school, with Casper wearing clothing as if he were a living child. Casper appeared in two more subsequent cartoons, There's Good Boos To-Night and A Haunting We Will Go. There's Good Boos To-Night differs wildly from later Casper cartoons: although the theme of Casper trying to find a friend and failing in these attempts before succeeding also occurs in later cartoons, the tone of this short turns remarkably dark when a hunter and his dogs appear, chasing the little fox cub named Ferdie that Casper has befriended. Although Casper scares the hunter and dogs away, Casper discovers Ferdie dead after a harrowing chase scene. Happily, however, Ferdie returns as a ghost to join his friend Casper in the afterlife. These were later adapted into Noveltoons before Paramount started a Casper the Friendly Ghost series in 1950, and ran the theatrical releases until summer 1959. Although having much success, the series was later criticized by animation historians and viewers, mainly due to the story of each entry of the series as being largely the same: Casper (now slightly thinner than the pudgy figure that appeared in the earlier cartoons) escapes from the afterlife of a regular ghost because he finds that scaring people can be tiresome year after year, tries to find friends but inadvertently scares almost everyone, and finally finds a (cute little) friend, whom he saves from some sort of fate, leading to his acceptance by those initially scared of him. In 1955, composer Winston Sharples composed an instrumental theme for Casper's cartoons.  Harvey Comics  Casper went on to become one of the most famous properties from Famous Studios. Casper was first published in comics form in 1949 by St. John Publications. In 1952, Alfred Harvey, founder and publisher of Harvey Comics began producing Casper comic books. Casper first appeared in Harvey Comics Hits #61 (Oct 1952), and then got a solo book, Casper the Friendly Ghost, in December. In 1959, Harvey purchased the rights to the character outright. Casper went on to headline a large number of comic book series, as well as appearing in back up stories and guest appearances in other titles. The Casper series inspired three popular spinoffs: Spooky the Tuff Little Ghost, Wendy the Good Little Witch, and The Ghostly Trio. Casper's titles include: * Casper * Casper Adventure Digest * Casper and... * Casper and Friends * Casper and Friends Magazine * Casper and Nightmare * Casper and Spooky * Casper and The Ghostly Trio * Casper: A Spirited Beginning (film adaptation) * Casper Big Book * Casper Digest * Casper Digest Stories * Casper Digest Winners * Casper Enchanted Tales Digest * Casper Ghostland * Casper Giant Size * Casper Halloween Trick or Treat * Casper in Space * Casper in 3-D * Casper Magazine * Casper Movie Adaptation * Casper Space Ship * Casper's Ghostland * Casper's Scare School * Casper Special * Casper Strange Ghost Stories * Casper, the Friendly Ghost * Casper TV Showtime * Famous TV Funday Funnies * The Friendly Ghost, Casper * Harvey Two-Pack * Nightmare and Casper * Richie Rich and Casper * Richie Rich, Casper, and Wendy * TV Casper and Company * Casper and the Spectrals In 2009, a new Casper comic was published, called Casper and the Spectrals by Arden Entertainment. Much like The Man of Steel and Batman: Year One did with their respective characters, it revamped Casper and several other Harvey characters for a new audience. After selling 6,400 copies of the first comic, the last two issues were published in 2010.  Television  Casper has starred in five television shows: * Matty's Funday Funnies (1959‚Äì1961) * The New Casper Cartoon Show (1963‚Äì1970) * Casper and the Angels (1979‚Äì1980) * The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper (1996‚Äì1998) * Casper's Scare School (2009‚Äì2012) After Harvey bought the rights to Casper and many other Famous properties in 1959 (including Herman and Katnip, Little Audrey, and Baby Huey), they began broadcasting the post-September 1950 theatrical Famous shorts on a television show sponsored by Mattel Toys titled Matty's Funday Funnies on ABC in 1959 which introduced the Barbie doll to the public. The other Famous produced Casper cartoons had already been acquired by television distributor U.M. & M. TV Corporation in 1956. U.M. & M. retitled just \\"A Haunting We Will Go\\", but credited \\"Featuring Casper The Friendly Ghost\\" as \\"Featuring Casper's Friendly Ghost\\". New cartoons were created for The New Casper Cartoon Show in 1963, also on ABC. The original Casper cartoons were syndicated under the title Harveytoons (initially repackaged as Casper and Company) in 1963 and ran continually until the mid-90s. Casper has remained popular in reruns and merchandising. Hanna-Barbera Productions also gave Casper two holiday specials, Casper's First Christmas (which also starred Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, Snagglepuss, Quick Draw McGraw, Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy) and Casper's Halloween Special (aka Casper Saves Halloween), and also the Saturday morning cartoon series Casper and the Angels (an animated takeoff on two live action hit shows Charlie's Angels and \\"CHiPS\\") in the autumn of 1979, all on NBC. Also featured on the NBC version was a big ghost named Hairy Scary (voiced by John Stephenson). None of Casper's original co- stars appeared in the show. In 1996, Amblin Entertainment and Universal Cartoon Studios created a new Casper series for Fox Kids called The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper, based on the 1995 feature, that lasted two years and was never seen on television again after 1998. Two live-action direct-to-video follow-ups to the film, Casper: A Spirited Beginning and Casper Meets Wendy (which introduced Hilary Duff as fellow Harvey Comics character Wendy the Good Little Witch), were made. They were followed by Casper's Haunted Christmas (starring Spooky and Poil from the comics and animated spin-off of the first movie), and Casper's Scare School, which were done entirely in CGI with no live-action elements. These films are often referred to as being \\"prequels\\" to the 1995 feature despite the fact that they heartily contradict the feature and do not appear to even take place in the same universe. In 2007, MoonScoop Group, in association with Classic Media, TF1 et DQ, produced a TV show of 52 X 12 named Casper's Scare School. In 2020, Casper appeared in a supporting role in the \\"Scare Bud\\" episode of Harvey Girls Forever!, a series based on Harvey Comics characters.https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/12/11/netflix- january-2020-new-grace-and-frankie-sabrina/4386946002/  Films  The Famous Studios version of Casper was scheduled to appear as a cameo in the deleted scene \\"Acme's Funeral\\" from the 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Computer- animated Casper as he appears in the live action films Numerous Casper cartoons were released on home video by Universal Studios (via MCA Inc.), which also adapted the friendly ghost into a live-action feature film titled Casper in 1995, where he and his wicked uncles, the Ghostly Trio, were rendered via computer animation, which initially created the first CGI lead character in a film. The film constructed a back-story for the character and is the only time in the series that the question of his death has been addressed. According to the film, Casper was a twelve-year-old boy living in Whipstaff Manor with his inventor father J.T. McFadden until he died from pneumonia after playing out in the cold until it was past nightfall. In 2001, Harvey Entertainment was acquired by Classic Media which, until 2012, licensed the Harvey properties including Casper. Casper made a cameo in a MetLife commercial along with several other cartoon characters in 2012. Later that same year, Classic Media was acquired by DreamWorks Animation, which in turn would be acquired by NBCUniversal in 2016, and thus Universal Studios, the producer of the original live-action feature film, now manages the rights to the character and other related characters in addition to regaining the rights to Casper's Haunted Christmas (which Universal itself originally released in late 2000). In 2019, Casper made an appearance in a GEICO commercial.

Within recent years, focus has been increasingly on geophysics and environmental research. The research activities at the institute span from small scale measurement of turbulence up to studies of the large scale ocean currents, from local air and noise pollution up to studies of global scale climate change. Areas of research focus on the Norwegian Current, the West Spitsbergen Current and the Norwegian Sea. Shifts and fluctuations in these currents are monitored, as they are thought to be indicators for climate change. Research has included sequestration and related matters dealing with Carbon capture and storage. The director of the institute is Dr. Peter M. Haugan.

Previous Member of Parliament The seat had become vacant when the constituency's Liberal Member of Parliament (MP), Rhys Hopkin Morris (5 September 1888 ‚Äì 22 November 1956) resigned after being appointed a Metropolitan Police Magistrate (a full-time paid magistrate, sitting as a judicial officer at courts in the London Metropolitan Police area). Rhys Hopkin Morris was born in Maesteg, Glamorgan. He qualified as a barrister in 1919, after serving as an Army officer during the First World War. Hopkin Morris was an uncompromising adherent of traditional Liberalism. He was unsympathetic to David Lloyd George. As Hopkin Morris said in 1924, \\"I am not a follower of Mr Lloyd George and I have no intention of being one\\". He voted against Lloyd George being Liberal leader in 1926 and was the only Liberal MP to vote against Lloyd George's re-election as leader in 1929. Hopkin Morris had first contested Cardiganshire, as the official candidate of the Liberal Party, in the 1922 general election. He lost to Lloyd George's private secretary Ernest Evans, standing for the National Liberal Party. In the 1923 general election, after the two Liberal factions had re-united, Evans was the Liberal nominee. Rhys Hopkin Morris stood again, as an Independent Liberal, and won the seat. Thereafter he took the Liberal whip and was MP for the seat until resigning in August 1932. After the by-election, Hopkin Morris served as a Magistrate from 1932 until 1936. He was then appointed to the newly created post of British Broadcasting Corporation regional director for Wales. In that post he argued for Welsh language broadcasting, particularly during the Second World War. After this involvement in broadcasting, between 1936 and 1945, Hopkin Morris returned to politics. He was elected Liberal MP for Carmarthen in the 1945 general election and retained that seat until his death in 1956. Rhys Hopkin Morris was Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means (a deputy Speaker of the House of Commons) between November 1951 and November 1956. He was knighted in 1954. Candidates Three candidates were nominated for the by-election. The list below is set out in descending order of the number of votes received at the by-election. At the time of the by-election, both the Conservative and Liberal parties were participating in the coalition National government. Despite this coalition both parties nominated a candidate. The Liberal ministers resigned from the National government on 28 September 1932, just six days after the by-election. 1\\\\. Owen Evans (5 February 1876 ‚Äì 11 June 1945) was the Liberal candidate. Evans was a barrister and company director. After winning the by-election he retained the seat until his death, shortly before the dissolution of Parliament in 1945. He was awarded a knighthood, but died before he was actually knighted. 2\\\\. The Conservative candidate was E.C.L. Fitzwilliam, who had previously contested the seat in the 1929 general election. 3\\\\. Representing the Labour Party was the Reverend D.M. Jones. He was only the second Labour candidate to contest the constituency.

Development The BSA Spitfire Hornet ('64-'65) and Hornet ('66-'67) (and the 500cc BSA Wasp) were developed by BSA in 1964 as purpose built off road and desert racer motorcycles in response to demand from the US market for a 'stripped down' BSA Lightning with more power. Although they could be used on public roads, BSA Spitfire Hornets and Hornets were supplied without headlights or taillights, with 'straight through' exhaust pipes; high pipes (east coast model) and low TT pipes (west coast model) and twin carburettors. The 6 volt coil 'ET' (energy transfer) ignition system was designed to include easy conversion to add lights for road use but the exhaust pipes needed to be fitted with mufflers to become road legal. The 'Mandarin Red' Spitfire Hornet ('64-'65) was further upgraded in 1965 with a more positive gear selector and a quick change gearbox sprocket. Ignition was also improved, as was the lubrication system but customers complained of vibration. In '66 the name was changed to Hornet but still retained the Mandarin Red (looked like orange) color. In '67 the color was changed to a darker red 'Cherokee Red' and was the last production year for the Hornet. BSA Spitfire Hornet 120px The BSA Spitfire Hornet was a true racing motorcycle, with the A65 engine upgraded with high compression pistons and a performance cam. The gear ratios were altered for sprint acceleration and the brakes (the 8 inch model from the BSA Gold Star) were improved with special cooling fins. The BSA Spitfire Hornet was popular in the US, but was not marketed in the UK. (The name 'Spitfire' was later used for the top-selling BSA Spitfire road bike). For 1966 and 1967 the Spitfire Hornet's name was changed to Hornet. Steve McQueen BSA Hornet road test Actor Steve McQueen tested the BSA Hornet and described it as \\"a keen bike - but I found it awfully heavy\\". McQueen suggested that a lot more weight would have to be stripped off to make the bike competitive. He also noted that the Hornet also had a tendency to want to go its own way but had what he called a 'good-functioning' power train. He also suggested that if the front forks were raked on a more forward angle the BSA would have \\"a more stable ride in the rough and would be generally a smoother performer\\".

It is a -story, brick dwelling that is three bays in width. Although initially of a Federal architecture inspired plan, later Italianate alterations dominate its present exterior appearance. It features a steeply pitched gable roof. Also on the property are several farm buildings and a family cemetery. History In 1664, Thomas Todd made the first purchase of land in what would become over 1000 acres of Baltimore County, MD. During the War of 1812, the house, which overlooks Shallow Creek and the Chesapeake Bay, was used by the Todd family as a lookout point to observe the approaching British Fleet. When troops were spotted coming ashore, family members would sound an alarm. As they withdrew from Baltimore on September 14, 1814, following the Battle of North Point, the British burned the house in retaliation. The Todd farmhouse was one of the few private properties burned by the British. The house was rebuilt in 1816 and remodeled in 1867. The Todd family owned the property until the early 1970s, when it was purchased by Mr. Elmer H. Cook, a teacher and historian who grew up in the Fort Howard area. After his death in 1996, the house stood vacant and was vandalized. It underwent further renovations in 2009, and was opened to the public as part of the annual Defenders Day celebrations held in September. The Todd House is owned by the State of Maryland and overseen by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.

He represented Cole Harbour in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1978 to 1993 as a Progressive Conservative member. Early life and career Nantes was born in 1945 at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, the son of Gerald T. Nantes and Mary Catherine Hogan. He was educated at St. Dunstan's University, the Technical University of Nova Scotia and Dalhousie University. Nantes married Diane LaRose in March 1967. Nantes was the president and chief executive officer of the Nova Scotia Tidal Power Corporation from January 1980 to March 1984. Political career Nantes entered provincial politics in the 1978 election, winning the Cole Harbour riding. He was re-elected in 1981. On November 4, 1983, Nantes was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Minister of Labour. Nantes was re- elected in the 1984 election, and continued to serve in the Labour portfolio until moving to Minister of Municipal Affairs in a November 1985 cabinet shuffle. In November 1987, Nantes was shuffled to Minister of Small Business Development. In the 1988 election, Nantes was re-elected for a fourth term, defeating Liberal Alan Mitchell by 1400 votes. In a post election cabinet shuffle, he was named Minister of Health. On September 25, 1990, Nantes resigned from cabinet after Halifax police charged him with releasing confidential mental health information about a former deputy minister who had made allegations of widespread patronage in the Tory government. An initial investigation of Nantes's remarks found that no charges could be laid as he was protected by parliamentary privilege, but the case was reopened when the local CBC station broadcast similar comments made by Nantes to reporters outside the legislature. Nantes went on trial in January 1991, and was acquitted of the charges in March 1991. On January 22, 1993, Nantes announced that he was not running for re-election in the 1993 election.

Over the course of 15 seasons, he amassed Primeira Liga totals of 278 games and twenty-three goals, mainly at Benfica, winning ten major titles. He is also notable for ill-fated reasons, after a friendly in his honor between Benfica and Torino, as the Italian team returned home, their plane crashed into the Basilica of Superga, killing all aboard and ending the Grande Torino team. Club career Born in Guimar√£es, Ferreira arrived at Porto at 17, he made his debut for the northerners in the 1937 Campeonato de Portugal Final, against Sporting on 4 July 1937. In the following year, in a match against Benfica on 20 February 1938, he crashed with Rog√©rio de Sousa and broke his foot, needing three months to recover, only reappearing in another match against Benfica, on 10 April 1938. After a disagreement with Porto's over a wage increase, in which he was told, \\"O Senhor ou assina ou p√µe-se na rua, n√£o queremos c√° malandros a pedir dinheiro.\\" (\\"Sir, you either sign or get lost, because he do not want slackers asking for money.\\") ‚Äì he moved to Benfica, debuting on 20 November 1938 in a home win against Sporting in Est√°dio das Amoreiras. A powerful and energetic player, he became an undisputed player in the midfield, alongside Albino, Moreira and Jacinto Marques, assuming the captain armband from 1944 onwards, in 293 official matches. Due to his performances, he received offers from Real Madrid in 1945, and from Torino in 1949, after Ferruccio Novo had watch him compete for the national team in a 1‚Äì4 loss against Italy on 27 February 1949. On 3 May 1949, Ferruccio Novo, sent his team to Lisbon, to play in an honorary match for him. After losing 3‚Äì4, the Italian team returned to Turin the next day, but the plane that was carrying them, crashed into the Basilica of Superga, in what became known as Superga air disaster. The five-time champions of Italy, known as Grande Torino, was destroyed. Ferreira was devastated, spending many sleepless nights, sending money to the relatives of the victims, and adding a picture with a black frame of the Grande Torino team to his personal trophy room. Ferreira took part in the 1950 Latin Cup win, but did not play in the final due to not being physically fit, not having the title added to his count. He was, however, present in the 8‚Äì2 trashing of Porto in the opening of Est√°dio das Antas on 28 May 1952; ending his career eighteen days later, by lifting the club sixth Ta√ßa de Portugal in a win against Sporting. He played 398 official matches, scoring thirty-four goals, and winning four championships, and six Portuguese Cups. International career Ferreira debuted for the Portugal national football team in a 2‚Äì3 loss against France on 28 January 1940. Over the course of eleven years, he added 25 caps, 12 of those, as captain. He made his last appearance in a draw against Belgium on 17 June 1951.

History It was formed in 1942, by fishmongers Frank Purley and his brother Charles Reginald Purley (born 1910 in Twickenham) as Longford Engineering Company Ltd. Charles had moved to Bognor in 1929. It began making munitions for the war on Longford Road in Bognor, but began making experimental refrigerators from 1945. It made its first fridge in 1946, the year the Shripney Road site was obtained, with production beginning in 1947. The name was changed to LEC Refrigeration on 13 December 1954. Around 60% of its products were for the domestic market, with the rest for commercial use. Before 1956, it was selling more products abroad than in the United Kingdom. It was based at the Shripney Works, a fourteen-acre site at Bersted in the north of Bognor Regis in Sussex, off Shripney Road (A29) next to the Bognor Regis branch line. On the other side of the railway, it had 56 acres of land, part of which was used as its own airfield. Charles Purley would be the company's chairman for many years until October 1991. The airfield, ICG code EGKC with an asphalt surface had its last known movements C172 in 2007, from 2013 a Self Launching motor Glider G-GCRV with kind permission on SDLL has been operating there, more recently the Airfield was purchased by BR Aviation Ltd July 2016, where upon Bognor Gliding Club was accepted into membership into the British Gliding Association in October same year, the airfield is marked on all the databases & CAA maps as an active Gliding club www.brgc.co.uk By 1960, only 13% of homes in the United Kingdom had a refrigerator, compared to 96% in the United States. Around that time Lec produced its Twelve Six range of fridges, costing ¬£179 each. In 1970, the Co Op (Co-operative Wholesale Society) decided to produce its own range of freezers, manufactured by Lec, which retailed at ¬£93. In 1973, it opened a factory in Northern Ireland. In the 1970s, its freezers were the Which? best buys. By the beginning of the 1980s, it had around 1,600 employees, and had around 20% of the domestic refrigeration market in the United Kingdom. Its products had the Regis suffix, to denote where they were made. By the 1980s, the company was known as LEC Refrigeration plc, an LSE listed company. In March 1993, the company laid off staff, and its workforce dropped to below 1,000, when it decided to import its compressors from Denmark instead of making them itself. From 1994, a new ¬£35 million computerised factory was built on the neighbouring New Era industrial estate. From August 2005, production of domestic fridges was moved to Whiston at a site off the A57 near Whiston Hospital, run by Glen Dimplex Home Appliances.GDHA The Bognor site has been redeveloped into a Sainsbury's.BognorRedevelopment Old sitePublic consultation The factory is due to be demolished in mid-2011.Demolition =Special product division= From 1956, it opened its special products division which made fridges for hospitals, aircraft and laboratories.

It is one of the four main types of social movements in sociology: alternative, redemptive, reformative, and revolutionary. Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) is an example of an alternative social movement because it targets one behavior‚Äîdrunk driving.

Padmarajan, based on his short story of the same name. It stars Jayaram, Mukesh, Shobana, Parvathy Jayaram and Madhu. The film is about mistaken identity and the problems that a young, innocent man has to undergo in his life. The film was the debut of Jayaram and it was a critical as well as commercial success. The film was remade in Tamil as Manidhan Marivittan (1989). Plot Vishwanathan (Jayaram) is an innocent young man in, Alappuzha, who lives with his parents and his younger sister. When he takes a recess before a job interview, he gets mistaken by many for a hardcore criminal and is arrested by the police. Luckily, George Kutty (Mukesh), the police inspector, happens to be the classmate of Vishwanathan and gets him released. George Kutty explains to Vishwanathan about the crimes done by the doppelganger criminal, whose real name and background is a mystery even for the police. With several criminal cases pending against him while still on the run, Vishwanathan is warned to be cautious. However, things become sour when the mistaken identity costs a marriage proposal for his sister, causing a rift between a lethargic Vishwanathan and his father. Eventually, Vishwanathan gets a job in Kochi, the nearest city and falls in love with his co-worker Ambili (Shobhana). Soon enough, she accidentally runs into the criminal who planned to assault her, which makes her hate Vishwanathan. Vishwanathan manages to convince her about the existence of his doppelganger, thus breaking the ice. Mohandas, his boss in the company, has a visitor in his office, who also mistakes Vishwanathan for the criminal, which ends in losing his job. With a better marriage proposal now lined up for his sister and the subsequent pressure from his mother, Vishwanathan is now desperate for a face to face confrontation with the criminal, while still in the dark about the criminal's whereabouts. Trying to attract some leads, Vishwanathan poses as the criminal and inadvertently receives a payment originally intended for the criminal, thereby inviting the ire of the latter. Vishwanthan, who takes the money with him for his sister's marriage, is chased by the criminal and his goons. In a bitter fight, the criminal is accidentally stabbed to death by one of his goons. But his body is later mistaken to be of Vishwanathan's, as the latter's bag containing his certificates and bank passbook was found near the body. On reaching home, Vishwanathan witnesses his family performing the last rites for him. That night, Vishwanathan appears in front of his father, hands over the bag of money and explains him the fact. His father consoles Vishwanathan and tries to bring him back. Vishwanathan refuses to go with him and decides to live as the criminal for the rest of his life, as a revenge for ruining his otherwise peaceful life. However, towards the very end of the film, the self- proclaimed impostor glances at the dying pyre, leaving the viewers wondering whether the man who was killed was the criminal or Vishwanathan.

Trivia Aparan had no songs and had just a handful of characters. The highlight of this film is that the other person, whom Vishwanathan is mistaken to be, is never shown. It is only from the dialogues of other characters that we come to know about him. But in the last few scenes, we happen to hear his voice, while threatening Vishwanathan over the phone. Parvathy Jayaram, who acted as the sister of Jayaram, later married him in 1992. P. Padmarajan, who launched Jayaram, is also considered as his mentor in cinema. Later, Jayaram acted in two more films by P. Padmarajan. The basic idea of the film is based on the short story \\"Aparan\\" by P. Padmarajan. The credit for the story has been given to Padmarajan and M. K. Chandrasekharan.

Each year the Trondheim Marketing Association awards the Robert Millar Prize (Robert Millar-prisen) in his honour. Background Millar was born at Ballymena, County Antrim in Northern Ireland. He grew up in a strongly religious environment, within a Presbyterian community. Educated at Royal Belfast Academical Institution and later at Queen's University Belfast, Millar trained to become a Presbyterian priest and studied in New College, Edinburgh. In 1903, Millar moved to Trondheim, Norway. He first began to work as an English language teacher at Trondheim Cathedral School. In 1906, he became secretary for the Norwegian Trekking Association in Trondheim. Career Millar has been credited for introducing modern marketing in Norway. From 1909 he was Norway's first marketer, working for the steamship company, Det Nordenfjeldske Dampskibsselskab. In 1914 he started the publication Romilla Revenue, to publish critical articles about advertisement in Norway. Two years later he founded the Trondheim Marketing Association. In 1914, Millar wrote Reklamel√¶rer, the first Norwegian language textbook on advertising. In October 1914, Millar launched the advertising magazine, Romilla Revenue. For many years there had been talk about building a tramway from the city center to the Bymarka recreational area. On 20 August 1915, Millar and two friends were waiting for the bus to take them to Fjellseter. When the bus never came, they decided during dinner in the city centre to try to establish the tramway. The same day he sent a number of letters to people and associations, inviting them to found a private company to build and operate the tramway. The first meeting was held on 3 November with Millar appointed chair and engineer Ferdinand Bjerke added to the committee. Millar stayed in the position until 6 September 1916, when A/S Graakalbanen was founded to build and operate the Gr√•kallen Line of the Trondheim Tramway. Kjenstad, 1994: 12‚Äì17 In 1917, Millar moved to Kristiania (now Oslo) to work with advertising for the newly established Handelsbanken. He also started his own advertising agency that year, Robert Millar & Co. In 1918 he was a co-founder of the advertising school at Oslo Stock Exchange, the first of its kind in the Nordic countries. From the late 1920s, Millar was affiliated with the advertising agency Gum√¶lius and Reklames Annoncebureau, and from the late 1930s he was affiliated with Forenede Annonsebyr√•er. Millar worked actively in advertising until he died in 1960. . Personal life Millar was married in 1905 with Signe Flor (1882-1958) and in 1916 with Hermine Larson (1881-1928). Both marriages were dissolved. In 1925, he married Ella Berus (1895-1971). Their daughter Margaret (1917-2001) was married to associate professor Alf Kinge (1902-1989). Both Robert Millar and his wife, Ella, were buried in the churchyard of Bekkelaget Church in the district of Nordstrand of Oslo.

It carries the message that the lyrics of the song are trying to present, and depicts the differences between a rich family and a poor family. The video follows a wealthy young girl and a young boy that lives in poverty. The two meet when the boy is playing with a ball, and the little girl retrieves it for him. The girl's father disapproves of her befriending the boy because he is poor. The children attempt to run away together, and are found by their parents in the woods by the end of the video.

Early days Chapman was born in London during the Blitz. His grandfather had achieved senior rank in the British Indian Army; his father served in the wartime Merchant Navy and his mother was a former midwifery training sister at Queen Charlotte's Hospital London, before running her own maternity nursing home in Ealing. His primary education was dysfunctional, with him going to no fewer than four schools. As a chorister at a local church, he auditioned to join the Westminster Abbey Choir School but failed because he had been watching trams driving around Westminster on a very smoggy evening, which clogged up his voice. Had he passed, he would have sung at Queen Elizabeth II's coronation ceremony in June 1953. Instead, his secondary education was at Bedales School whose headmaster, Hector Jacks, said that he would never pass A-Level examinations, which turned out to be true. Bedales, the countryside and the farm were revelations for a 13 year old London boy, born and bred in the concrete jungle of Ealing. He disliked afternoon sports and opted to do 'Outdoor Work' (O.W) instead. At the time the Bedales farm was fully operational with a herd of Friesian cows, poultry and sheep. It also had a piggery at the south west corner of the estate, with its own pigman and a number of pedigree Wessex Saddleback pigs (with black bodies and a white- collar and front hooves). Pat chose to work at the piggery and' or the dairy (he learned to hand-milk and machine milk the cows) for his O.W. The farm supplied the school with meat, milk and fruit and vegetables. In the school holidays, as a teenager, he obtained work as an electrical stage hand / light board operator in West End theatre land, obtaining a highly coveted NATKE union card. On leaving school, he worked full-time in the theatre, including stage management at the Belgrade Theatre Coventry, where from time to time he was required to play bit parts, and he actually 'trod the boards' with the likes of Ian McKellen, David Warner and Edina Ronay. He followed this by joining the Royal Air Force where he trained as a fast jet pilot. He then worked for six years on sales and marketing at Lesney Products, during which time he went to night school at Enfield Tech (latterly part of Middlesex University) obtaining an HNC in Business Studies and a Diploma from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. This led to his being accepted as a mature student at Fitzwilliam College, University of Cambridge reading economics. At the same time he started the stage lighting and sound company, Entec. In 1968 his company established itself by providing the lighting for Cambridge May Balls, as well as performing liquid light shows for BBC Television, including a six-month contract on Top of the Pops and a four-part Doctor Who story, Claws of Axos in 1970/1. Chapman was a pioneer in touring lighting for rock acts and festivals, introducing techniques which are in use to this day. Chapman and his crews provided lighting and sound systems for an eclectic mix of rock, heavy metal, pop and glam rock groups, including, to name some, The Carpenters, Bing Crosby, Black Sabbath, Ray Conniff, Dusty Springfield, Bob Dylan, Bob Marley and the Wailers, Mud, The New Seekers, Lou Reed, Status Quo, Rod Stewart, Sweet, Ike and Tina Turner and Wings. In 1979 Chapman's investor, the Marquee Club‚Äôs Harold Pendleton, took over Chapman's Entec interests. He moved to Haslemere, Surrey, where he still lives, and spent the next four years consulting to a number of major entertainment multiples the like of Mecca Leisure Group, Rank Ballrooms, Warner Bros. and Pontins, both in the UK and overseas, advising on the equipping and installation of lighting and sound systems. Branches of Chapman's family had lived in India from 1715 to 1935, first working for the East India Company then the British Raj. Chapman inherited their deep-rooted interest in the country, her history, her food and curry in particular. After he left school, Pat's friends, knowing his passion for the subject, asked him to teach them the secrets of spices and their cooking. At that time little information had been published on the subject of curry, yet national interest in the subject was emerging. He decided to set up a club as the vehicle to exchange information. In 1981 Chapman's friend and writing mentor, columnist Carol Sarler, then editor of the best-selling Honey Magazine wrote a piece on curry featuring the (then) non-existent Curry Club with recipes by Chapman, after which the Curry Club was founded on 1 January 1982. Many like-minded people have joined the Curry Club since it began and come from every continent including Asia. Membership is a cross-section of the British public. Currently Chapman frequently demonstrates curry, holds regular curry cookery courses and from time to time takes small groups of curry enthusiasts to India to visit a region and sample its cuisine. Since 2008 Chapman has been an active member of the Army Benevolent Fund committee, specifically to help with fund-raising for their annual Big Curry event. For the 2010 National Curry Week celebrations he was commissioned by Cobra Beer to create recipes which add spice to top British Regional favourite dishes. Since 2012 he has been a trustee of the Cobra Foundation, an independent charity supported my Molson Coors and Cobra Beer to distribute funds to young people in South Asia by providing health, education, community support. On 17 November 2019 Chapman was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Asian Curry Awards from the Asian Catering Federation, of which he is the longstanding Chairman of Judges. Too ill to attend in person, (he was suffering from a very bad cold) fellow judge George Shaw accepted the award on his behalf saying, \\"Everyone who works in the curry sector owes Pat a huge debt and never has a Lifetime Achievement Award so been richly deserved.\\" To come On 22 November 2020 it is planned that Sanjay Anand of Madhu's Caterers and Restaurants will present this Lifetime Achievement Award to Pat Chapman in conjunction with Yawar Khan https://uk.linkedin.com/in/yawar-khan-7519756a owner Akash Tandoori Restaurant, Wallington, Surrey https://akashtandoori.co.uk/Akash Tandoori Restaurant, Wallington and founder The Asian Catering Federation and Awards. The Asian Catering Federation. http://acfederation.org/ Writing Chapman's first cookery book, The Indian Restaurant Cookbook, was published in 1984 and is still in print. To date Chapman has written some 36 books, with international sales exceeding 2 million copies. Most are on Curry, but some of his other books cover cuisines such as Thai, Chinese, Middle Eastern and International spicy cuisines. His Balti Cookbook was the first on the subject and became a Sunday Times Number 1 bestseller. Chapman built up a database on Indian restaurants, which as of 2018 contained over 10,000 entries. In 1984, this led to the publication of the Good Curry Guide, a critique of the top 1,000 UK curry restaurants. It has been sponsored by Cobra Beer since 1992, and was cited by the Oxford English Dictionary for usage of the word balti Television appearances Chapman has appeared on British television many times, including on the shows Who'll Do The Pudding?, This Morning, Food and Drink, Great Food Live and Good Food Live. He also had a regular spot on the Good Morning with Anne and Nick show.

History  After Kuwait gained independence in 1961, the Kuwaiti parliament passed new laws that limited voting to those who were male, over the age of 21, and had family living in Kuwait since before 1920. Women from the first graduating class at various universities across Kuwait banded together to create the Women‚Äôs Cultural and Social Society in 1963. Their goals were to raise awareness of women‚Äôs issues, but more importantly, to boost Kuwaiti women up and give them the opportunities to succeed. Kuwaiti women did have many more freedoms in comparison to their close neighboring countries, such as access to a higher education. =Women's suffrage in 1985 and 2005= The franchise was expanded to include women in 2005. When voting was first introduced in Kuwait in 1985, Kuwaiti women had the right to vote. This right was later removed. In 2005, Kuwaiti women were re-granted the right to vote.  Women's Suffrage Movement  In 1973, parliament looked over a bill which would have given women the right to vote and run for elected office, which was ultimately overturned due to pressure from conservatives all over. Over 10 years later in 1984, the movement seemed to have gained some support when the current emir (Jaber Sabah) and the prime minister (Crown Prince Saad Sabah) announced that they were in favor of a women‚Äôs suffrage bill, which in turn offered some false hope. Different bills continued to be denied through 1985 and 1986 respectively, and until this changed, the highest position in government a Kuwaiti woman could hold was that of assistant secretary. Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, Kuwait then became heavily involved in the Iraq-Iran war. With the involvement in the war, it became vital for women to become hospital volunteers and even push the boundaries to smuggle in food and necessary items for their families. Since women took the initiative, they also demanded acknowledgment and recognition for their efforts. The parliament agreed and the first woman was finally appointed as the ambassador of the Persian Gulf in 1993. In May 1999, the current emir issued a decree that allowed women the right to vote and run for office, however, under the Kuwaiti Constitution, Parliament was allowed to reject and overrule the emir, and it did. However, for a period of 6 months, women had the right to vote. Unfortunately, there were no elections heard during this time before the emir was overruled. The movement began to gain speed after this, and the first non-violent demonstration kicked off in 1996 when 500 women stopped working for an hour to show solidarity in their right for suffrage. Small demonstrations continued throughout the next 6 years and in 2002 a few Kuwaiti women decided to protest outside voter registration centers. Things continued to escalate and in the 2003 election, women created mock ballots that ‚Äúallowed hundreds of women to cast symbolic votes for real candidates.‚Äù In March 2005, 1,000 people surrounded the Kuwaiti parliament to reinforce their need for suffrage. On May 17, 2005 a bill was passed 37 votes for and 21 votes against women‚Äôs suffrage, granting Kuwaiti women the right to vote and run for an elected office. Four years later, in May 2009, four female candidates won parliamentary seats in a general election out of fifty available seats.CNN Although this was 8% of parliament, by the 2013 election, no women had been elected in to the current parliament and the last woman elected resigned in May 2014. = Activists = Noureya Al-Saddani: An author, historian, broadcaster, and director, Al- Saddani started the first women‚Äôs organization in Kuwait. In 1971 she proposed to the National Assembly to grant women's political rights Lulwa Almulla: worked around the globe and in her home country of Kuwait as well for the past 26 years, attempting to gain suffrage for women in her home. Although she helps run the family business, her true passion was in volunteering. She claims that women's suffrage does not end there and now women must be empowered to hold places in parliament. \\"The Criminal Court today sentenced Rana al-Sadoun to three years with hard labour in the case of her repeating a speech by Musallam al-Barrak.\\" = Kuwait and the ICCPR = Kuwait first ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1994 and 2 years later ratified the ICCPR, or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in 1996. In the year 2000, the Kuwaiti government has done little to modify its legislation that discriminates on the basis of gender.  Objections under the ICCPR  \\"Although the Government of Kuwait endorses the worthy principles embodied in these two articles as consistent with the provisions of the Kuwait Constitution in general and of its article 29 in particular, the rights to which the articles refer must be exercised within the limits set by Kuwaiti law.\\" = Nationality = In the area of nationality, Kuwaiti women do not have the right to give their children Kuwaiti citizenship if they marry non- Kuwaiti men. Kuwaiti women cannot receive residential care and other rights that men can have if they marry non-Kuwaiti women. If a person is born in or outside Kuwait and their father is a Kuwaiti national, they are automatically a national themselves.

An uncredited remake of the 2005 South African Academy Award-winning film Tsotsi, the film was written and produced by Ameer himself, and features musical score composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja. The film follows Yogi, a slum-dwelling criminal who makes a living out of murders and robberies. When he is chased by cops during a robbing spree, Yogi steals a woman's car and succeeds in fleeing. His life starts to change when he realizes there is a baby inside the car, and he can't just let go of it even though he attempts to do so while abandoning the getaway car. Launched in October 2007, Yogi was released theatrically on 27 November 2009, opening to mixed reviews. Critics praised the performances but criticized the excessive melodrama, slow pacing and similarities to Tsotsi. It became a moderate box office success. The same year, it was showcased at the 6th Dubai International Film Festival.  Plot  Yogeshwaran aka Yogi and his gang of three men live in a slum on the edge making a living out of robberies and murders and having no human emotions. Yogi, in particular, has a dark secret about his bad past, which he keeps to himself. One day during a robbing spree, he is chased by the police. He gets into a car parked by a woman in front of a fruit shop and manages to flee, when he suddenly hears the cry of a child, finding a three- month-old baby in the car's backseat. He abandons the car and leaves the baby in there, but as he hears the baby crying, he is moved, and the human being in him wakes up. He gets back to shove the baby into a large shopping bag and takes it home with him. He from them hides the baby from the rest of his gang and tries to take care of the baby alone. Yogi, then holding at gunpoint, coerces Rajasulochana, a young mother hailing from Andhra Pradesh and deserted by her husband, to breastfeed that baby. Meanwhile, it is revealed that the child's real mother, Caroline, is desperate to get her child back, whilst her husband Linden, happening to be merely the stepfather of the baby, searches with the help of rowdies for the baby, which he actually wants dead. In the meantime, Yogi slowly gets transformed, turning into a new man thanks to the baby, which apparently prompts feelings in him, even planning to keep and bring up the child himself. A flashback reveals his past, where he had an atrocious childhood as he was terrorized by his sadistic father, a beggar who was responsible for the death of his mother and sister and for making Yogi himself a brute. However, he changes his plans and decides to reunite the baby with its mother, but unfortunately, the child slips into Linden's hands. Yogi gets to know that Linden wants to kill the baby and tries to prevent that and save the baby.

Even before completing Paruthiveeran, it was reported that Ameer's next film will be Kutravaali, a film about a criminal, that will not feature any songs, starring Suriya in the lead role, which, however turned out to be wrong. In January 2007 then, it was reported, that Ameer will be directing a film, titled Kannabiran, again with Surya in the lead role, produced by himself. In the following months, Ameer again and again cited, that he was working on Kannabiran and he was still looking for someone to play the lead role. It was also stated, that he might direct a film with Vikram or Vijay after Kannabiran. All these reports turned out be rumors, when Ameer suddenly shelved the Kannabiran-project for unknown reasons and instead teamed up with director Subramaniam Siva to create a film, that will be written and produced by himself and directed by Subramaniam Siva, which will be titled Yogi, in which Ameer himself will act in the lead role. The distribution rights were initially said to be brought by Kalaignar TV, who had beaten Sun Pictures, who had also plans to acquire the film's rights. However, as a sudden twist, the film's rights slipped into the hands of Sun Pictures, who were said to distribute this film. Eventually these news turned out to be fictional, with the film being released by the production house itself. =Casting= Ameer decided to take up the title role of the film himself, after no other actor was ready to enact the character of Yogeshwaran. He then was looking for an actress to take up the lead female role. Initially looking for a 13-year-old schoolgirl to play that role as per the original script, he had to drop the idea as he couldn't find any suitable actress for that role and hence changed the script. Priyamani, who played the lead female character of \\"Muththazhagu\\" in Ameer's previous venture, Paruthiveeran, that won her much accolades, fame and the National Film Award, and who, according to Ameer, was the first choice, was approached to play the role as later was Trisha Krishnan, who debuted in Ameer's 2002 film Mounam Pesiyadhe. However, both the actresses refused the offer, before Madhumitha then accepted to play the role of the lead female character named Rajasulochana, which is said to have great scope to perform. Also actress Swathi, who acted in films like Selva and Vaanmathi with Vijay and Ajith Kumar, respectively in the 1990s was signed up to play an important role in the film. Moreover, Ameer insisted, that the actress should dub for herself in the film as well. Also lyricist Snehan was cast to play a vital role in the film as was journalist Devaraj, director Nandha Periyasamy and a real-life politician Gazzali. Apart from these, 20 newcomers are said to make their debut in the film, including two real-life slum dwellers, who would play as Ameer's friends. =Filming= Filming was held for 161 days in various areas in and around Chennai on a cost of nearly 12 crores. The shooting of the film began in mid-November 2007 and was completed by mid-July 2009. Since the story is said to revolve around a slum dweller in an urban slum, shooting was mainly held around slum areas in Chennai as in Egmore, Saidapet, Chennai Central and Teynampet. The various locations in Chennai include the Chennai City Centre and the Sathyam Theatre, for which the unit had to get permissions first, which was said to be very costly and one main reason for the delay of the shooting. Several fight scenes in the climax were shot at the teraace of Big Bazaar in Vadapalani, at Ennore and a house in Besant Nagar. In August 2009, however, it was reported, that \\"last leg shooting\\" was being held in Thiruvottiyur in Chennai at the famous Vadivudaiyamman Temple. In April 2008, reports claimed, that Ameer was injured during the shooting, which was going on at the AVM Studios, when he was jumping from 40 meter high and sustained fracture in his right hand. Music The musical score of Yogi is composed by Ameer's friend, Yuvan Shankar Raja, teaming up with Ameer again for this picture, having earlier worked on several projects as Mounam Pesiyadhe (2002), Raam (2005), and Paruthiveeran (2007), which all turned out to be huge musical hits. The score and most of the songs are centred on the traditional Indian string instrument sarangi, an essential part of Hindustani classical music, which is considered the hardest to Indian instrument to master. Noted Sarangi player Ustad Sultan Khan was therefore assigned to perform the sarangi pieces in this film. The soundtrack was released on 13 September 2009 at Sathyam Cinemas among many prominent personalities. Yuvan Shankar Raja and Ameer had travelled to France in September 2007 to compose and record the songs, which were released only two years later. The album consists of six tracks and features the voices of Ameer himself, composer Yuvan Shankar Raja, lyricist Snehan, rapper Blaaze, Neha Bhasin and noted Sarangi player Ustad Sultan Khan, who has performed the Sarangi in this album as well, among others. Both versions of \\"Yogi Yogi Thaan\\" weren't featured in the film. The lyrics were written by Snehan, who usually pens for Ameer's films. The soundtrack received generally positive reviews. Karthik of Bangalore Mirror described it as \\"brilliant\\", while a critic from Indiaglitz.com wrote it was \\"stylish\\" and \\"scintillating\\". Rediff's Pavithra Srinivasan gave a mixed review, citing that Yuvan Shankar Raja \\"partially delivers in Yogi\\". However, despite garnering favorable reviews, the songs failed to become prominent, due to the film's poor theatrical run. Reception Pavithra Srinivasan from Rediff.com gave the film 3 stars out 5 and praised the secondary actors, dialogues, twists, music and art direction. Criticism was aimed towards the performance of Ameer, slow pacing and the film's similarities with Tsotsi. Bhama Devi Ravi from The Times of India gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5, noting it had plenty of fight scenes unlike the original, and praised the film's rawness along with the performances. However, the reviewer felt the film reminded too much of Tsotsi, and also criticized the melodramatic episodes and lack of depth in characterization. Behindwoods similarly gave it 2.5 stars out of 5, praising the performances and depiction of the darker side of human life. The reviewer criticized the dosage of melodrama and the placement of some fight scenes. S. Viswanath from Deccan Herald praised the performances of Ameer and Madhumitha, but similarly criticized the film's similarities with Tsotsi and execution. A reviewer from Sify.com praised the performances and cinematography, while criticizing the music, loopholes in writing and excessive melodrama in the second half, along with the execution and predictability of the climax. Malathi Rangarajan from The Hindu praised the performances of Devaraj and Madhumitha, Ganja Karuppu's situational humor, editing and music. However, she felt Ameer was expressionless and the pace was too slow for an action film.

Swyncombe hamlet consists almost entirely of its Church of England parish church of Saint Botolph, the former rectory and Swyncombe House. The population of the parish is in the hamlets of Cookley Green and Russell's Water, and the scattered hamlet of Park Corner. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 250. It is partially forested and is the fifth largest of 87 civil parishes in the District.  Manor Swyncombe's toponym is derived from the Old English words Swin for wild boar and combe for valley or hollow. After the Norman conquest of England the manor of Swyncombe was granted to the Norman Miles Crispin, the first castellan of Wallingford Castle. The Domesday Book records that by 1086 he had granted it to Gilbert Crispin, a monk who in 1085 was made Abbot of Westminster. The Jacobethan manor, Swyncombe House, was built in 1840 to replace an early 16th-century manor house. The rectory was built in a neoclassical style in 1803 by Daniel Harris, who at the time was governor of Oxford Castle and also practised as a building contractor, engineer and architect. Parish church St Botolph's parish church was originally early Norman. The Gothic Revival architect Benjamin Ferrey heavily restored the building in 1850. The font possibly predates the building, but its cover and the rood screen with loft date from early in the 20th century. In the 19th century restoration, medieval wall paintings were found and repainted. St Botolph's is a Grade II* listed building.

It is the process of changing one's attitudes and behaviours, in preparation for a shift in one's role. Words commonly associated with anticipatory socialization include grooming, play-acting, training and rehearsing. The concept of anticipatory socialization, first defined by sociologist Robert K. Merton, has its origins in a 1949 study of the United States military which found that privates who modelled their attitudes and behaviours on those of officers were more likely to be promoted than those who didn't. When people are blocked from access to a group they might have wanted to join, they reject that group's values and norms, and instead begin the anticipatory socialization process with groups that are more receptive to them. People doing this, for example economically disadvantaged teenagers who aspire to become drug dealers rather than professionals, are sometimes criticized as lacking motivation, however sociologists say they are simply making a pragmatic adjustment to the opportunities available to them. Examples of anticipatory socialization include law school students learning how to behave like lawyers, older people preparing for retirement, and Mormon boys getting ready to become missionaries. Recent studies show that anticipatory socialization is prevalent among pregnant mothers who choose to reveal the fetal sex pre-birth. Knowing the gender of the baby will affect the way in with the mother interacts with the baby, as a result of preconceived expectations of gender group norms.

Jaroslav Krƒçek (born 22 April 1939) is a Czech radio producer, conductor, inventor of musical instruments and composer of classical and folk music.  Biography  Jaroslav Krƒçek was born in ƒåty≈ôi Dvory near ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice in southern Bohemia. He studied at the B. Jeremi√°≈° School of Music in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice before studying composition with Miloslav Kabel√°ƒç and conducting with Bohum√≠r Li≈°ka, both at Prague Conservatory. > In 1968‚Äì70, under the auspices of Czechoslovak Radio, a course in electronic > and concrete music was run in which I participated, since it was led by my > teacher, the composer Miloslav Kabel√°ƒç. For my end-of-course composition I > produced Son√°ty Slav√≠ƒçkov√©, in the course of which I learned much that I was > later to employ in my composition Raab > [Jaroslav Krƒçek from liner notes to 'Aide-M√©moire/Folk Music/Son√°ty > Slav√≠ƒçkov√©' LP, Recommended Records, England, 1985]. Krƒçek was the musical director for Plze≈à Radio and the music editor for the recording company Supraphon. He is the artistic leader and performer in the folklore group Chorea Bohemica (founded 1967),Chorea Bohemica for which he has composed and adapted a number of songs and dances. Musica Bohemica,Musica Bohemica a chamber ensemble specialising in Czech (Bohemian) Christmas songs, was created in 1975 by Krƒçek as an offspring of Chorea Bohemica. Some of Krƒçek's music is inspired by early Czech music, medieval and Renaissance songs, 16th century hymn books and baroque music. Also interested in folk music of the 18th and 19th centuries, Krƒçek has arranged several hundred folksongs and folk dances. He has done extensive and systematic individual, creative work in the realisation of folklore and anonymous musical works. Krƒçek has recorded more than fifty albums of his own compositions and folk songs.  Raab: an electronic opera  Raab (aka Raab The Harlot) or Nevƒõstka Raab (The Prostitute Raab) is one of Krƒçek's most renowned compositions. It was created in the Prague Electronic Music Studio in 1970‚Äì71. It is often described as an electronic opera, or electroacoustic oratorio. It was banned by the communist regime in 1972, and it was never staged in Czechoslovakia until the Velvet Revolution of 1989. The music of Raab was composed during the same period as many contemporary avant-garde music dramas such as Iannis Xenakis' Nuits (1968) and Bernd Alois Zimmermann's ' (1969). Plot The story of Raab (Rahab in English, Rachav in Hebrew) is based on the account of the Fall of Jericho as told in the Book of Joshua. A Jewish king was planning to conquer the town: Joshua son of Nun sent two spies out from Shittim secretly and instructed them: ‚ÄúFind out what you can about the land, especially Jericho. They stopped at the house of a prostitute named Rahab and spent the night there [Joshua 2:1]. Rahab helps the two spies and hides them from the King of Jericho's guards, thus helping the Israelites conquer Jericho. The libretto is by Zdenƒõk Barborka using an invented language approximating Aramaic, the vernacular language of the Jews during most of the Biblical era. The opera opens with an introductory recitation in Czech, followed by one of several long instrumental crescendos built from slow trumpet calls and cymbal crashes, reaching a climax before a long decaying low-pitched rumble: an allusion to the trumpets used by Joshua during the seven-day siege of Jericho. The sound is reminiscent of the bell scene in Andrei Tarkovsky's film Andrei Rublev, 1966. It sets the tone for the rest of a hieratic, imposing score. The opera relies mostly on vocals with occasional electroacoustic interjections in the form of processed acoustic instruments like viola, tam-tam or full orchestra, transformed through studio treatment and montage. Vocal deliveries are diverse, ranging from singing to sprechgesang, from the plaintive to the exalted, from emphatic to hushed voices. The cast included core members of the Chorea Bohemica ensemble, from which the Musica Bohemica ensemble was derived, founded by Krƒçek in 1975. A new production of Nevƒõstka Raab was staged in 2003 at Jan√°ƒçek Academy of Music and Performing Arts (JAMU) in Brno, with costume and stage design by Radka Mizerov√° (born 1976). Another production was presented in 2004, by stage director Magdalena Krƒçkov√° (born 1977) at Jiƒç√≠n's Cultural House (Kulturn√≠ d≈Øm v Jiƒç√≠nƒõ).

There are two types in common use designed to reduce heat flow via radiation and convection respectively.  Solar control film  This works by reflecting the infra-red component of solar energy (often 700W/sq M) and absorbing the UV component. Some films are also silvered or tinted to reduce visible light. Typical absorption for a silvered film is 65% for visible and infra red with 99% for UV. This type of film sticks directly onto the glass.  Convection control film  A film is attached to the window frame to trap a pocket of air between the glass and the film, creating a double-glazed system with an insulating gap of still air. Thermal conductivity of still air is 0.024 W/m/K and much lower than that of glass (0.96 W/m/K).Thermal conductivity of common materials Engineering toolbox Factors which limit the performance of a double glazed window are gap width, convection within the cavity and radiative heat transfer across the gap which is largely independent of its width. Optimal gap width depends on the temperature difference imposed across the gap. A European standard (EN 673) uses 20 ¬∞C difference between the inside and outside temperature which results in an optimal simulated gap width of about 17 mm for a standard double glazed window. A US standard (NFRC) uses a 39 ¬∞C difference which yields a smaller optimal gap width of about 13 mm. Using the European standard a window with an ideal gap of 17 mm has a simulated U-Value of about 2.8 W/m¬≤/K, a window with a much smaller gap of 6 mm has a U-value of about 3.3 W/m¬≤/K, while a single glazed window has a U-value of about 5.5 W/m¬≤/K.

Autry House, Houston, Texas Alfred Charles Finn (July 2, 1883 ‚Äì June 26, 1964) was an American architect. He started in the profession with no formal training in 1904 as an apprentice for Sanguinet & Staats. He worked in their offices in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Houston. His credits during his tenure residential structures, but firm was a leader in steel-frame construction of skyscrapers. Finn practiced independently between 1913 and 1953, first subcontracting as a project manager for the Rice Hotel project. He collaborated on many projects in Houston with Jesse Jones as the pair changed the face of downtown Houston in the 1910s and 1920s. Meanwhile, Finn also supervised or designed buildings in various parts of Texas, including Brenham, Dallas, Galveston, Palestine, and Tyler. He continued architectural work for residential properties in the Houston area. During the 1930s, partly because of his relationship with Jones, Finn worked for the federal government, and later his firm performed contract work for federal agencies. His public buildings included federal buildings, a college administration building and a complex of dormitories, and he designed the San Jacinto Monument. He was one of the leaders in the development of the Art Deco style in Texas, though his work reflects a wide range of styles and syntheses. Along with Joseph Finger, Finn was one of the two leading architects in Houston during the first half of the twentieth century. A number of his works are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).  Early years  Alfred Charles Finn was born to Edwin E. and Bertha (Rogge) Finn in Bellville, Texas, the second of eight children. He grew up in Hempstead, Texas, and moved to Houston in 1900 to work for Southern Pacific Railroad as a carpenter and draftsman. In 1904, he started as an apprentice for Sanguinet & Staats in Dallas. After three years, he transferred to the firm's headquarters in Fort Worth, a position he held until 1912. Sanguinet & Staats transferred him to Houston, but he left the firm in 1913 to establish a private practice. However, before leaving the firm, Finn worked on two private residences at Courtlandt Place (both NRHP- listed) for A.S. Cleveland (1911) and James L. Autry (1912), and he is credited with the Link-Lee House on Montrose Boulevard (1912, NRHP-listed). Private practice Rice Hotel, Houston, Texas in 1916 Illustration of the Gulf building, Houston, Texas, 1929 Upper story of the Simon Theatre, Brenham, Texas Finn's first commission was as project manager for the Rice Hotel, under contract with the firm of Mauran, Russell & Crowell. The owner of the new hotel, Jesse H. Jones, soon after established a collaboration with Finn which would change the face of Downtown Houston. Finn designed two buildings for Jones across the way from the Rice Hotel: the Foster Building, aka the Houston Chronicle Building, in 1914, and the Rusk Building in 1916. The corner of Texas and Travis was dominated by buildings built by Finn and Jones. In 1926, Finn designed a new seventeen-story wing for the Rice Hotel on behalf of Jones. Finn did architectural work for other commercial clients in the 1920s. He completed State National Bank Building (NHRP-listed) at 412 Main Street in 1923. Jones contracted with Finn to build the Lamar Hotel, where Jones established his new residence. The Jones apartment consumed the whole top floor, though he hired John F. Staub for the interior design.Fenberg (2011), p. 134. Jones also promised a venue for the 1928 Democratic National Convention without consulting the city of Houston, pledging $200,000 of his own capital. He engaged Finn and Kenneth Franzheim to design and erect the Sam Houston Hall in just four months. The Sam Houston Hall, ostensibly built to be a temporary structure, was larger than Madison Square Garden, and equipped with heavy-duty fans and apertures between the roof and the walls to facilitate air flow.Fenberg (2011), pp. 140141. Jones contracted with Finn on another project in downtown Houston, this time with in collaboration with Franzheim and J.E.R. Carpenter, to finish the 37-story, art deco Gulf Building in 1929 at that time the tallest building in Texas. Finn designed theaters in Brenham, Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston. Only one of these is still extant (as of October 12, 2017): the Simon Theatre in Brenham, designed in 1925.A Brief History of the Simon Theatre - Brenham, Texas Finn and Jones collaborated in the fruition of two theaters in Downtown Houston, the Metropolitan in 1926 and the Loew's State in 1927.Wilson (1983), pp. 6566. Finn established a robust practice for residential architecture, especially in some wealthy Houston subdivisions such as Courtlandt Place, Montrose, and Shadyside. His first work in the Rossmoyne subdivision was the Sterling-Berry House (NHRP-listed), which he completed in 1916 and enhanced with a large portico in 1919. He designed a new house on nearby Montrose Boulevard for Henry H. Dickson, President of the Dickson Wheel Car Company (1917).Wilson (1983), pp. 6667. In the Houston Heights, his early work included the Woodward House (NRHP-listed), which he completed in 1918. In 1920, he designed a home for Earl K. Wharton in the wealthy enclave of Shadyside.Wilson (1983), p. 69. Already known in the Courtlandt Place subdivision through his work on the A.S. Cleveland House and James L. Autry House while under the employ of Sanguinet & Staats, Finn moved and remodeled an 1890 Victorian house for Sarah Brashear Jones (Jones-Hunt House, NRHP-listed) in 1920. Other homes in Houston designed by Finn include the Sid Westheimer house (1920), and one for oil mogul, Walter Fondren (1923). He designed the Benjamin Apartments (NRHP-listed), a synthesis of Renaissance Revival style and Arts and Crafts principles. Perhaps Finn's most ambitious residential project was the Ross Sterling House in Bay Ridge Park near Morgan's Point, completed in 1928. He and Robert Smallwood designed a two-and- one-half story house overlooking the Houston Ship Channel with a bay-side portico design based on the south facade of the White House. The next year Finn's office completed a commission for William Lewis Moody III. Smallwood designed the Georgian neo-classical home in Galveston's Cedar Lawn Subdivision, and this neighborhood is now NRHP-listed. Finn was an architect for the Capitol Lofts, and the L. A. and Adelheid Machemehl House. Finn designed the fifteen-story People's National Bank Building (NRHP-listed) at Courthouse Square in Tyler, Texas. The brick-and-black-granite-faced art deco skyscraper was finished in 1932, in the middle of the Great Depression. The East Texas oil boom created a demand for office space in Tyler, and Finn designed an expansion which added six stories to a four-story wing in 1936. Public service and civic buildings thumb Finn served as the first Architectural Supervisor for the then recently formed Federal Housing Administration in 1934. He took on this position while Jesse H. Jones was chairing the Reconstruction Finance Corporation during the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration. During the 1930s, Finn also designed buildings on behalf of the Public Works Administration. These included Jefferson Davis Hospital and the Sam Houston Coliseum in Houston, the U.S. Post Office in Galveston, and the San Jacinto Monument in Baytown, Texas.Wilson (1983), p. 81. While no longer reporting directly to the federal government, Finn did contract architecture work for the United States War Department and the Defense Homes Corporation during World War II. His office built the China Springs Air Force Base near Waco, Texas, temporary buildings for Texas A&M;, and defense housing in Freeport, Texas. After the war, Finn won a contract to build the United States Naval Hospital at Houston.Wilson (1983), pp. 71, 74. He designed the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building on the University of Houston campus, an elongated Art Deco building completed in 1950. Personal life Finn fathered two sons after marrying Mary Elizabeth Riley in 1909. In addition to membership at St. Paul's Methodist Church, he joined the Arabia Temple Shrine, the local Gray's Lodge York and Scottish Rite Freemason's chapter, the Houston Club, and the Rotary Club. Death and legacy Finn died on June 26, 1964, and is interred at Forest Park Cemetery in Houston. The Houston Metropolitan Research Center is the repository for the Alfred C. Finn Papers. The JPMorgan Chase building in downtown Houston underwent a major conversion of its lobby and mezzanine into a 20,000 square-foot dining hall. The new facility is called \\"Finn Hall,\\" in honor of Finn, the building's architect.

He told The Jewish Chronicle newspaper, \\"It‚Äôs the best job in British quizzing and to get paid for doing something you love is just the icing on the cake. But I have to admit I hate losing.\\" Simmons was born in Edinburgh and now lives in Leeds, West Yorkshire. Career Before becoming an 'Egghead', Simmons won ¬£64,000 on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, broadcast on 5 February 2005 (Series 17, Episode 6). He reached the hot seat on his 3rd attempt, having appeared as a fastest finger first contestant on two occasions during Series 15 in early 2004. One of these failed appearances (on 24 April 2004) featured Pat Gibson becoming the 4th UK winner of the ¬£1,000,000 jackpot. Gibson would later join Simmons on Eggheads in 2009. Alongside teammates and fellow former Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? contestants Diane Hallagan and Lee Warburton, Simmons won the final series of Radio 4 quiz Masterteam in 2005/06. He was a semi-finalist on Mastermind and also reached the final of the 2008/09 series of the radio programme Brain of Britain, but was defeated by Geoff Thomas. He has been a researcher at text question and answer service AQA 63336 since 2006. Simmons was part of an AQA team that appeared on Eggheads; he won his own round but the team was defeated in the final round. He returned to compete individually on spin-off show Are You an Egghead? in 2008, where he won Series 1 and earned the right to appear as the 6th Egghead on the regular programme. He defeated fellow future Egghead David Rainford in the semi final and beat Shaun Wallace in the final. This meant he became the first person to appear on Eggheads as part of both the Eggheads and a 'challengers' team. In 2012 he again reached the final of the Brain of Britain and won the competition. Before the final, some controversy was caused as he was thought of as \\"a professional quizzer\\". As reported by the BBC website, \\"There is no rule banning Eggheads from appearing on Brain of Britain ‚Äì the only rule is that former champions are not allowed to return.\\" In 2013 he was ranked number three quizzer in the world.

In North America, the species is more commonly associated with northern coniferous forests. Google Books The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word mucosus, meaning mucus. Taxonomy Originally described as Agaricus mucosus by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard in 1792, Cortinarius mucosus belongs to the subgenus Myxacium (characterized by the presence of a viscid to glutinous outer veil and stipe), section Myxacium (distinguished by the presence of clamp connections), according to the infrageneric classification of the genus Cortinarius proposed by Moser in Singer (1986).Seidl MT. (2000). Phylogenetic relationships within Cortinarius subgenus Myxacium, sections Defibulati and Myaxcium. Mycologia 92(6): 1091‚Äì1102. Description The cortina is evident on this young specimen. The species has a sticky brown to orange cap, 4 to 10 cm (1¬Ω to 4 in) in diameter, that is darker towards the center and with a rolled-in margin. The gills are closely spaced, have an adnexed attachment to the stipe, and are pale yellowish at first, becoming rusty brown as the spores mature. Like all species in the genus Cortinarius, young specimens have a cortina, a cobweb- like annulus that protects the developing gills. The slimy stipe, long by thick, is whitish until the spores mature and begin falling. The spore print is rust- to ochre-colored. Both the odor and the taste of this mushroom are nondescript. The spores have a rough surface, and an elliptical shape, with dimensions of 12‚Äì14 x 5.5‚Äì6.5 ¬µm. The basidia are 4-spored, and cystidia are not present on the edge of the gills. The species is commonly found under birch and coniferous trees.First Nature It prefers acidic, sandy soils.  Edibility  Due to the prevalence of toxins in the genus Cortinarius, and the difficulty of positively identifying specimens to species level, consumption of any Cortinarius species is not generally recommended. Also, specimens of C. mucosus collected from northern Poland were found to bioaccumulate high concentrations of the toxic element mercury‚Äîthat is, the concentration of mercury in the mature mushroom was significantly higher than that of the soil in which it grew.Falandysz J, Kawano M, Swieczkowski A, Brzostowski A, Dadej M.

According to an analysis published by the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution in 2008, Pakistan was, \\"with the possible exception of Iran, perhaps the world's most active sponsor of terrorist groups... aiding these groups that pose a direct threat to the United States. Pakistan's active participation has caused thousands of deaths in the region; all these years Pakistan has been supportive to several terrorist groups despite several stern warnings from the international community.\\" Daniel Byman, an author, also wrote that, \\"Pakistan is probably 2008's most active sponsor of terrorism\\". In 2018, former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif suggested that the Pakistani government played a role in the 2008 Mumbai attack. In July 2019, reigning Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan on his official visit to the United States claimed the presence of 30000-40000 armed terrorists in the country. He further stated that previous governments were hiding this truth particularly from the US in the last 15 years. The U.S. Country Reports on Terrorism describes Pakistan as a \\"Terrorist safe haven\\" where terrorists are able to organize, plan, raise funds, communicate, recruit, train, transit, and operate in relative security because of inadequate governance capacity, political will, or both.  Background  Until Pakistan became a key ally in the War on Terrorism, the US Secretary of State included Pakistan on the 1993 list of countries which repeatedly provide support for acts of international terrorism. In fact, many consider that Pakistan has been playing both sides in the fight against terror, on the one hand, demonstrating to help curtail terrorist activities while on the other, stoking it. Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid and author Ted Galen Carpenter have accused Pakistan's Inter- Services Intelligence (ISI) of providing help to the Taliban and rebels in Kashmir.  Allegations of state-sponsored terrorism  Author Gordon Thomas states that whilst aiding in the capture of Al Qaeda members, Pakistan \\"still sponsored terrorist groups in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, funding, training and arming them in their war of attrition against India\\". Journalist Stephen Schwartz notes that several terrorist and criminal groups are \\"backed by senior officers in the Pakistani army, the country's ISI intelligence establishment and other armed bodies of the state\\". According to Ted Galen Carpenter, a senior fellow for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, \\"Without the active support of the government in Islamabad, it is doubtful whether the Taliban could ever have come to power in Afghanistan. Pakistani authorities helped fund the militia and equip it with military hardware during the mid-1990s when the Taliban was merely one of several competing factions in Afghanistan‚Äôs civil war. Only when the United States exerted enormous diplomatic pressure after the 11 Sept. attacks did Islamabad begin to sever its political and financial ties with the Taliban. Even now it is not certain that key members of Pakistan‚Äôs intelligence service have repudiated their Taliban clients. Afghanistan is not the only place where Pakistani leaders have flirted with terrorist clients. Pakistan has also assisted rebel forces in Kashmir even though those groups have committed terrorist acts against civilians. A disproportionate number of the extremist madrasas schools funded by the Saudis operate in Pakistan.\\" Pakistan's former ambassador to the U.S., Husain Haqqani has said Pakistan sponsors terrorism. Author Daniel Byman states, \\"Pakistan is probably today's most active sponsor of terrorism.\\"Deadly Connections: States That Sponsor Terrorism By Daniel Byman, , 2005, Cambridge University Press, pp 155 Writing in an article published by The Australian he stated, \\"following the terror massacres in Mumbai, Pakistan may now be the single biggest state sponsor of terrorism, beyond even Iran, yet it has never been listed by the US State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism\\".Asia's Islamism engine , The Australian, 4 December 2008 Former Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf has conceded that his forces trained militant groups to fight India in Indian-administered Kashmir. He confessed that the government ‚Ä≥turned a blind eye‚Ä≥ because it wanted to force India to enter into negotiations, as well as raise the issue internationally. He also said Pakistani spies in the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate (ISI) cultivated the Taliban after 2001 because Karzai's government was dominated by non-Pashtuns, who are the country's largest ethnic group, and by officials who were thought to favour India. India has been consistent in alleging that Pakistan was involved in training and arming underground militant groups to fight Indian forces in Kashmir.  Inter-Services Intelligence and terrorism  The ISI, has often been accused of playing a role in major terrorist attacks across India including terrorism in Kashmir,Terrorism Havens: Pakistan ‚Äì Council on Foreign Relations the July 2006 Mumbai Train Bombings, the 2001 Indian Parliament attack, the 2006 Varanasi bombings, the August 2007 Hyderabad bombings, and the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. The ISI is also accused of supporting Taliban forces and recruiting and training mujahideen to fight in Afghanistan and Kashmir. Based on communication intercepts, US intelligence agencies concluded Pakistan's ISI was behind the attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul on 7 July 2008, a charge that the governments of India and Afghanistan had laid previously. The Pakistani intelligence agency, the ISI, is believed to be aiding these organisations in eradicating perceived enemies or those opposed to their cause, including India, Russia, China, Israel, the United States, the United Kingdom and other members of NATO. Satellite imagery from the FBI suggest the existence of several terrorist camps in Pakistan, with at least one militant admitting to being trained in the country as part of the going Kashmir Dispute, Pakistan is alleged to be supporting separatist militias Many nonpartisan sources believe that officials within Pakistan's military and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) sympathise with and aid Islamic terrorists, saying that the \\"ISI has provided covert but well-documented support to terrorist groups active in Kashmir, including the al-Qaeda affiliate Jaish-e- Mohammed\\". President of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai has regularly reiterated allegations that militants operating training camps in Pakistan have used it as a launch platform to attack targets in Afghanistan. He has also urged Western military allies to target extremist hideouts in neighbouring Pakistan.Karzai wants action by allied forces in Pakistan 11 August 2008 Dawn, Pakistan In response to the millants from Afghanistan hiding in the mountainous tribal region of Pakistan .

Many Kashmiri groups also maintain their headquarters in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which is cited as further proof by the Indian Government. # Criticism ## The normally reticent United Nations Organization (UNO) has also publicly increased pressure on Pakistan on its inability to control its Afghanistan border and not restricting the activities of Taliban leaders who have been declared by the UN as terrorists.  Alleged Pakistani Army support of terrorists  Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has admitted that Pakistan supported and trained terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in 1990s to carry out militancy in Kashmir. From 1979 Pakistan was in favour of religious militancy. \\"The Kashmiri freedom fighters including Hafiz Saeed and Lakhvi were our heroes at that time. We trained Taliban and sent them to fight against Soviet Union. Taliban, Haqqani, Osama Bin Laden and Zawahiri were our heroes then (during the Soviet-Afghan war). Later they became villains\\" says Pervez Musharraf. The United States had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, knew of Bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad, Pakistan. According to Pervez Hoodhboy, \\"Bin Laden was the 'Golden Goose' that the army had kept under its watch but which, to its chagrin, has now been stolen from under its nose. Until then, the thinking had been to trade in the Goose at the right time for the right price, either in the form of dollars or political concessions\\". Pakistan was also alleged to be responsible for the evacuation of about 5000 of the top leadership of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda who were encircled by Nato forces in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. This event known as the Kunduz airlift, which is also popularly called the \\"Airlift of Evil\\", involved several Pakistani Air Force transport planes flying multiple sorties over a number of days. However, the validity of these claims have been questioned by the Pentagon. Both United States and Pakistan have rejected that any such airlift took place. General Richard Myers, chief of staff, claimed that Kunduz airfield has been \\"disabled\\" by United States attacks. Although part of airfield could be used, the runway was not long enough for transport aircraft to take off or land. Donald Rumsfeld, US defense secretary, claimed that he received no such report that validate or verify these claims of aircraft moving in or out of the city. He further said that he doubted these claims. According to a 2001 article titled \\"Overview of State-Sponsored Terrorism\\" issued by the US Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, \\"In South Asia, the United States has been increasingly concerned about reports of Pakistani support to terrorist groups and elements active in Kashmir, as well as Pakistani support, especially military support, to the Taliban, which continues to harbor terrorist groups, including al-Qaida, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.\\" In 2011, American troops reportedly recovered Pakistani military supplies from Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan.Swami, Praveen. \\"Taliban receiving Pakistan military equipment, U.S. investigation reveals.\\" The Hindu, 9 January 2012. LeT began carrying out operations in Indian-controlled Kashmir in the 1990s. It actively infiltrated militants across the Line of Control (LoC) from Pakistan to carry out sabotage activities with the help of the ISI and the Pakistan Army. Pakistan Army and Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI) have long considered Lashkar-e-Taiba to be the country's most reliable proxy against India and the group still provides utility in this regard as well as the potential for leverage at the negotiating table.  Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamaat-ud-Dawa  The militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) is widely blamed for the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. The US has put a $10m bounty for its founder Hafiz Muhammad Saeed. Saeed now heads the Jamaat-ud- Dawa (JuD) group, widely seen as a front for LeT. LeT was banned by Pakistan in 2002 after it allegedly carried out an attack on the Indian parliament. JuD is currently banned by the US, the EU, India and Russia as a terrorist organisation. In June 2014, Washington declared JuD an LeT affiliate and announced head money for JuD's political wing chief and Saeed's brother-in-law Abdur Rahman Makki. Zaki ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the leader of Lashkar-e-Taiba and allegedly the planner of 2008 Mumbai attacks was released in Pakistan which caused condemnations in India. JuD regularly conducts mass rallies and congregation, advocating jihad in Kashmir. For its December 2014 rally, Pakistan ran two special trains to carry the crowd to Lahore. India's foreign ministry termed this as 'nothing short of mainstreaming of terrorism and a terrorist'. The congregation was held near Pakistan's national monument, the Minar-e-Pakistan and a security of 4000 policemen was provided. JuD also asks donations for its anti-India and pro-jihad campaigns.  Haqqani Network  Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of US, Mike Mullen described the Haqqani Network as the 'veritable arm of Pakistan's ISI'. Mullen said the country's main intelligence agency ISI was supporting Haqqani network, who are blamed for an assault on the US embassy in Kabul in September 2011 and also the September 2011 NATO truck bombing which injured 77 coalition soldiers and killed five Afgan civilians. \\"Operation Zarb-e-Azb has helped disrupt Haqqani network's ability to launch attacks on Afghan territory\\", a senior commander for US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, Lieutenant General Joseph Anderson said in a Pentagon-hosted video briefing from Afghanistan. He added that the Haqqani network was now fractured too. In a November 2014 interview to BBC Urdu, Adviser to the Pakistani Prime Minister on National Security and Foreign Affairs, Sartaj Aziz said that Pakistan should not target militants like the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani Network, who do not threaten Pakistan's security. After it was raised in Pakistan's parliament, Pakistan's Foreign Office clarified that the statement was said in historical context.  United States  US National Security Advisor James L Jones sent a message in the past to Pakistan saying that double standards on terrorism were not acceptable. In September 2016, the Chairman of the US House Subcommittee on Terrorism, Congressman Ted Poe from Texas, along with Dana Rohrabacher from California, introduced a bill in the United States House of Representatives calling for a declaration of Pakistan as a \\"state sponsor of terrorism\\". The bill HR 6069H.R.6069 - Pakistan State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act, Bill sponsored by Rep. Ted Poe, United States Congress, 20 September 2016. requires the US president to issue a report within 90 days detailing Pakistan's role in supporting international terrorism followed by discussion from the US Secretary of State. Ted Poe said in a statement that Pakistan was not only an untrustworthy ally but it has also aided and abetted the enemies of the United States. He called the 2016 Uri attack the \\"latest consequence of Pakistan‚Äôs longstanding irresponsible policy of supporting and providing operational space for 'jihadi' terrorist groups\\". US lawmakers move bill to designate Pakistan a terrorist state, The Express Tribune, 21 September 2016. Chairman Poe introduces the Pakistan State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act, Press release, U.S. Congressman Ted Poe (official web site), 20 September 2016. U.S. Senator John McCain said that the bill would not be successful, and pointed out that it was moved by a small minority within the Congress. McCain also acknowledged Pakistan's losses in the fight against terrorism.  United Kingdom  In July 2010, British Prime Minister David Cameron accused the Pakistani government of double standards: \\"We cannot tolerate in any sense the idea that this country is allowed to look both ways and is able, in any way, to promote the export of terror, whether to India or whether to Afghanistan or anywhere else in the world.\\" However, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague, who was travelling with the prime minister Cameron, clarified Cameron's remarks: \\"He wasn't accusing anybody of double dealing. He was also saying that Pakistan's made great progress in tackling terrorism. Of course there have been many terrorism outrages in Pakistan itself.\\" Cameron's remarks sparked a diplomatic row with Pakistan, where he came under attack by officials and politicians who strongly criticised his comments. In December 2010, he attempted to visit Pakistan while on a tour to Afghanistan in an effort to mend relations. However, his visit was refused by Pakistan, notably as a snub to his remarks. Afghanistan US intelligence officials claim that Pakistan's ISI sponsored the 2008 Indian embassy bombing in Kabul. They say that the ISI officers who aided the attack were not renegades, indicating that their actions might have been authorised by superiors. The attack was carried out by Jalaluddin Haqqani, who runs a network that Western intelligence services say is responsible for a campaign of violence throughout Afghanistan, including the Indian Embassy bombing and the 2008 Kabul Serena Hotel attack. Citizenship and Immigration Minister of Canada Chris Alexander called Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism that threatens world security in 2014. In response to the Afghan War documents leak, The Guardian had a very different take on allegations that Pakistan is sponsoring terrorism. Its Sunday, 25 July 2010 article by Declan Walsh states: \\"But for all their eye-popping details, the intelligence files, which are mostly collated by junior officers relying on informants and Afghan officials, fail to provide a convincing smoking gun for ISI complicity. Most of the reports are vague, filled with incongruent detail, or crudely fabricated. The same characters ‚Äì famous Taliban commanders, well-known ISI officials ‚Äì and scenarios repeatedly pop up. And few of the events predicted in the reports subsequently occurred. A retired senior American officer said ground-level reports were considered to be a mixture of \\"rumours, bullshit and second-hand information\\" and were weeded out as they passed up the chain of command\\". Afghanistan‚ÄìPakistan relations have become more strained after the Afghan government began openly accusing Pakistan of using its ISI spy network in aiding the Taliban and other militants. Pakistan usually denies these allegations but has said in the past that it does not have full control of the actions of the ISI. There have been a number of reports about the Afghanistan‚ÄìPakistan skirmishes, which usually occur when army soldiers are in hot pursuit chasing insurgents who cross the border back and forth. This leads to tensions between the two states, especially after hearing reports of civilian casualties. After the May 2011 death of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, many prominent Afghan figures began being assassinated, including Mohammed Daud Daud, Ahmad Wali Karzai, Jan Mohammad Khan, Ghulam Haider Hamidi, Burhanuddin Rabbani and others. Also in the same year, the Afghanistan‚ÄìPakistan skirmishes intensified and many large scale attacks by the Pakistani-based Haqqani network took place across Afghanistan. This led to the United States warning Pakistan of a possible military action against the Haqqanis in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The U.S. blamed Pakistan's government, mainly Pakistani Army and its ISI spy network as the masterminds behind all of this. U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, Cameron Munter, told Radio Pakistan that \\"the attack that took place in Kabul a few days ago, that was the work of the Haqqani network. There is evidence linking the Haqqani Network to the Pakistan government. This is something that must stop.\\" Other top U.S. officials such as Hillary Clinton and Leon Panetta made similar statements. Despite all of this, Afghan President Hamid Karzai labelled Pakistan as Afghanistan's \\"twin brother\\".Pakistan a twin brother, talks to go on: Karzai. Pajhwok Afghan News. Sujoy Dhar. 5 October 2011. Such words in diplomatic talks mean that Afghanistan cannot turn enemy against the state of Pakistan to please others. The two states are working together to find solutions to the problems affecting them. This includes possible defence cooperation and intelligence sharing as well as further enhancing the two-way trade and abolishment of visas for \\"holders of diplomatic passports to facilitate visa free travel for the diplomats from the two nations.\\" After the May 2017 Kabul attack, the Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS) claimed that the blast was planned by the Afghan insurgent group Haqqani Network, and reiterated allegations that those elements had support and presence across the border in Pakistan. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani stated that Pakistan has instigated an \\"undeclared war of aggression\\" against the country. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nafees Zakaria rejected the Afghan allegations as \\"baseless\\".  India  The government of Pakistan has been accused of aiding terrorist organisations operating on their soil who have attacked neighbouring India. Pakistan denies all allegations, stating that these acts are committed by non-state actors. India alleged that the 2008 Mumbai attacks originated in Pakistan, and that the attackers were in touch with a Pakistani colonel and other handlers in Pakistan. The testimony of David Headley, who was implicated for his role in the Mumbai attacks, points to significant ISI involvement in the activities of the LeT, including the Mumbai attacks. This led to a UN ban on one such organisation, the Jama'at-ud-Da'wah, which the Pakistani government is yet to enforce. On 5 April 2006, the Indian police arrested six Islamic militants, including a cleric who helped plan bomb blasts in Varanasi. The cleric is believed to be a commander of a banned South Asian Islamic militant group, Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, and is linked to the ISI. Pakistan denied involvement in militant activities in Kashmir, though President Asif Ali Zardari admitted in July 2010 that militants had been \\"deliberately created and nurtured\\" by past governments \\"as a policy to achieve some short- term tactical objectives\\" stating that they were \\"heroes\\" until 9/11. In October 2010, former Pakistan President and former head of the Pakistan Army, Pervez Musharraf revealed that Pakistani armed forces trained militant groups to fight Indian forces in Kashmir. Many Kashmiri militant groups designated as terrorist organisations by the US still maintain their headquarters in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. This is cited by the Indian government as further proof that Pakistan supports terrorism. Many of the terrorist organisations are banned by the UN, but continue to operate under different names. Even the normally reticent United Nations (UN) has also publicly increased pressure on Pakistan on its inability to control its Afghanistan border and not restricting the activities of Taliban leaders who have been declared by the UN as terrorists. Both the federal and state governments in India continue to accuse Pakistan of helping several banned terrorist organisations, including the Indian organisations unhappy with their own Government, like the ULFA in Assam. Apart from Kashmir, Pakistan has also been accused by India of supporting insurgency in Punjab province of India. India alleges that Pakistan has provided support to separatist Sikh outfits in an attempt to create independent state of Khalistan. Pakistan has rejected all accusations made by India. An Indian MLA from Punjab believes that Pakistan support to Sikh separatist outfits is an attempt to seek revenge for Indian role during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Former Pakistani army chief Mirza Aslam Beg in an interview embraced jihad against India and opportunity to use Kartarpur corridor to assist Khalistan movement. In 2019, Pakistani Prime Minister publicly discouraged Pakistani people from going to Kashmir to do Jihad. People who went to Kashmir will do an \\"injustice to the Kashmiri people\\". Most of the Pakistani militants who had crossed the border over the years and were caught by the Indian security forces were found to belong to the Punjab province of Pakistan.  Bangladesh  In two separate incidents officials of the Pakistani High Commission in Dhaka, were alleged to be financing the terrorist activities of the banned Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) organization. Diplomatic official Mazhar Khan was charged by Bangladesh's foreign ministry of running an illegal Indian currency business in Dhaka beside alleged links with militants. However, Pakistan's foreign office maintains that allegations against him are baseless and the incident is unfortunate. In December 2015, Pakistan decided to withdraw second secretary Farina Arshad after the Bangladeshi authorities asked the diplomat to leave for reportedly having \\"extended financial support to a suspected militant who faces spying charges.\\" JMB operative Idris Sheikh, who also holds Pakistani nationality had claimed he had received money from her and was in contact with her for some time. Pakistan has withdrawn one of its diplomats from Bangladesh after \\"harassment\\", the foreign ministry said. A formal statement from Islamabad dismissed the charges as \\"baseless\\", adding: \\"an incessant and orchestrated media campaign was launched against her on spurious charges\\" International isolation Pakistan is being threatened of international isolation on the allegations of its inability to act on countering terrorism due to the efforts of PM Narendra Modi. The 2016 SAARC summit which was to be held in Islamabad in 2016 was cancelled after being boycotted by four nations - India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Bhutan.  Al Qaeda leaders killed or captured in Pakistan  Critics had accused Pakistan's military and security establishment of protecting Osama bin Laden, until he was found and killed by US forces. This issue was expected to worsen US ties with Pakistan. Bin Laden was killed in what most feel was his residence for at least three years, in Abbottabad, in Pakistan. It was an expensive compound, less than 100 kilometres' drive from the capital, Islamabad, probably built specifically for Bin Laden. The compound is southwest of the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA), a prominent military academy that has been compared to Sandhurst in Britain and West Point in the United States.\\"Bin Laden's front yard\\" (May 3, 2011).

It was released on August 19, 2008 through Inpop Records in the United States. The album's lead single \\"A Breath or Two\\" was released prior to the album, and reached No. 11 on Christian contemporary hit radio.  Musical style  Similar to his last album, Speak, Jimmy Needham has frequently been compared to Jason Mraz in musical style, as well as John Mayer and Marc Broussard. Not Without Love's main genre is alternative CCM, although Needham takes influence from other styles such as rock and blues with a \\"jazzy pop\\" sound. = Lyrics = The lyrical songwriting in Not Without Love has often been noted as having \\"clever wordplay\\" similar to pop/jazz musician Jason Mraz. Needham was newly married when writing the album, and two songs were written about his wife Kelly Needham. \\"Firefly\\" is a lighthearted, \\"ragtime style\\" song about marriage, while \\"Unfailing Love (Kelly's Song)\\" is a ballad that Needham sang at his wedding, originally written as a proposal to Kelly.  Promotion and release  Jimmy Needham and his wife Kelly perform the song \\"Unfailing Love\\" in August 2008. In promotion of the album, Not Without Loves first single, \\"A Breath or Two\\", was released to radios in mid-2008. The album was subsequently released on August 19, 2008 in the U.S. under the Inpop label. It debuted at number 8 on both the Christian AC Soundscan and Overall Christian Digital charts. Later in the year, Needham guested on Christian rock band BarlowGirl's Million Voices Tour along with Brooke Barrettsmith; the tour began on September 12 in Houston, Texas, and ran until mid-November 2008. \\"A Breath or Two\\" also garnered success, reaching #13 on R&Rs; Christian CHR radio chart by the week of September 4, and reached a peak of at least #11 through early 2009. The album's second single, \\"Forgiven and Loved\\", was released early in the year near the same time. = Reception = Not Without Love received generally positive reviews from critics. AllMusic reviewer Jared Johnson noted that Jimmy Needham \\"stepped up his game\\" with his second release, having better production quality than his debut album; Johnson claimed that \\"Christian music lovers need a lot more like this\\".

It is a rectangular fieldstone building built about 1695. The fort was built to serve as a stronghold against attacks by Native Americans and was used during the French and Indian War. It is approximately 48 feet long and 18 feet wide with one large stone fireplace. Modifications in the early-19th century raised the height of the fort building adding a second story loft and a wood shingle roof. It was constructed following a 1693 order from Governor Francis Nicholson and his Council. The property was acquired in 1965 by the Baltimore County Department of Recreation and Parks. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. In 2019, the Maryland Historical Trust removed a sign at Fort Garrison after officials received complaints over the use of the term \\"hostile Indians\\". The language, dating back to 1934, was removed on the basis of bias against Native Americans.

With his win, Thornton has now won over ¬£84,000 in less than a year's competition on the PDC circuit, and is within range of the world's top sixteen. In only his fourth tournament since defecting from the BDO, Mark Webster made his first Pro Tour semi-final, having survived a scare during his third round match. In a battle of the 2008 BDO World Darts Championship champions, Anastasia Dobromyslova wasted eight match darts at 5‚Äì4, before Webster came back and won 6‚Äì5. Webby would eventually fall to Thornton 6‚Äì3. Meanwhile, in a category four World Darts Federation event, Troy Hanlon won the Halifax Open in Canada. Hanlon beat Seymour Dixon in the final.

He defeated Colin Lloyd 6‚Äì1 in the final to pick up the ¬£6,000 prize. The star of the day's play however, was Louis Blundell, who surprised everyone by reaching the semi-finals to pick up ¬£1,500. On the way, he beat former UK Open runner-up Gary Mawson, Peter Wright, Steve Maish and Mark Walsh before an incredible 6‚Äì0 whitewash of world number two James Wade. The Shevington native's luck was out though, as he would fall to Lloyd in a final leg decider. * 15 ‚Äì Fresh from his whitewash humbling by Louis Blundell the previous day, James Wade won his first tournament of 2009 after clinching the UK Open North-West Regional. Wade beat Kevin McDine 6‚Äì3 in the final, but again a lesser-known name made a mark. Durham's Paul Knighton reached his first PDC Pro Tour quarter-final beating Raymond van Barneveld 6‚Äì1 and Barrie Bates 6‚Äì3 along the way. He fell to McDine in another final-leg decider but earned ¬£800 which pushed him up the PDC Order of Merit. In the BDO, Darryl Fitton won the prestigious Isle of Man Open, beating Ted Hankey to pick up the ¬£5,000 first prize. In the women's event, Julie Gore saw off Lisa Ashton to win the tournament. * 19 ‚Äì Week seven saw the halfway stage being reached of the Premier League campaign when it took place at The Brighton Centre. Mervyn King suffered a second consecutive defeat, this time to Terry Jenkins 8‚Äì5 which saw him being dethroned as Premier League leader. Succeeding to the throne as table-topper was James Wade. Wade's fifth consecutive victory ‚Äì 8‚Äì3 over Wayne Mardle ‚Äì sees Wade top the table on eleven points. Phil Taylor moved up into second place after a similar win over John Part. Part fell out of the top four as Raymond van Barneveld won the all-Dutch clash with Jelle Klaasen, again by eight legs to three. In other news, Simon Whitlock became the third big name from the British Darts Organisation to move across to the Professional Darts Corporation. It marks a return to the PDC circuit for Whitlock as he competed in PDC events in 2003, reaching the second round of the 2003 PDC World Darts Championship before losing to Richie Burnett. * 20 ‚Äì Martin Goodin won the Torremolinos Open by beating Tim Jones 3‚Äì0 in the final. Jones was playing in his first tournament final, just two months after winning the John Smith's People's Darts Championship at the Lakeside. Namesake Linda Jones won the women's event, beating Carole Frison of France 3‚Äì0. * 21 ‚Äì Phil Taylor wins yet another Players Championship event, with a win in the Brentwood Players Championship. He defeated Ronnie Baxter in the final by six legs to two. Brad Wethington beat Lito Moises in the final to win the Virginia Beach Darts Classic, while Robin Curry beat Paula Murphy to win the women's event. In Gibraltar, John Ferrell beat Paul Harvey to win the Gibraltar Open. In the women's event, Carole Frison made her second final in two days, as she won the title, beating Paula Jacklin in the final. * 22 ‚Äì Yet another PDC Pro Tour weekend double for Phil Taylor as he wins the UK Open South-East Regional. He defeated Terry Jenkins in the final by six legs to four. The tournament also saw a return to form for Michael van Gerwen, who reached the semi-final before losing to Taylor. * 26 ‚Äì Week eight of the Premier League at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham ended with a third different table- topper in three weeks. Phil Taylor returned to the top after an 8‚Äì2 win over Raymond van Barneveld. James Wade dropped to second behind The Power after he could only draw 7‚Äì7 with John Part, who moved back into the playoff spots due to van Barneveld's misfortune. In the other two matches, Mervyn King defeated Wayne Mardle ‚Äì and his new throwing action ‚Äì 8‚Äì2 and Jelle Klaasen earned his first win after edging out Terry Jenkins 8‚Äì6. * 28 ‚Äì Mark Walsh stuns Phil Taylor in the final of the Midlands Players Championship to win only his third PDC Pro Tour title. Walshie led both 2‚Äì0 and 5‚Äì2 before going on to win 6‚Äì4 in Coventry. Amazingly, that was only Taylor's second defeat of 2009, having only lost to James Wade on February 26, at night four of the Premier League in Belfast. Mervyn King also recorded his first competition nine-darter during his match with Stuart Bousfield, to which he received ¬£4,000 after the bonus had rolled over for ten Pro Tour events. In other events, Jyhan Artut won the first day of the German Darts Corporation event in Niedernhausen. Artut beat Andree Welge 6‚Äì2 in the final. Meanwhile, Down Under, Brian Roach wins the first day of the Gaels Club Open in Penrith, New South Wales and took home the $800 first prize. He won a deciding leg against Barry Jouannet, after Jouannet took the game from 5‚Äì2 to the deciding leg. * 29 ‚Äì Phil Taylor bounced back from his shock defeat to Mark Walsh the day before by winning yet another UK Open Regional title, by winning the West Midlands qualifier in Coventry. In the final, he beat Wolverhampton's Wayne Jones 6‚Äì5, after Jones had missed darts to win his first PDC Pro Tour title. For the second consecutive day, a nine-darter was recorded. This time it was Raymond van Barneveld, who achieved this during his match against Kirk Shepherd. Meanwhile, on day two in Niedernhausen, Jyhan Artut completed the weekend double by beating Tomas Seyler 6‚Äì4 in the final. In Penrith, Barry Jouannet went one better than his result the previous day, by winning day two of the Gaels Club Open. He beat Jerry Weyman 7‚Äì4 in the final to win $800. =April= * 2 ‚Äì Week nine of the Premier League sees the players go back across the border for the second of three nights to be held in Scotland, this time at Glasgow's Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre. In front of a partisan crowd, Raymond van Barneveld returned to the top four after a crushing 8‚Äì1 win over John Part. In match two, Terry Jenkins beat Wayne Mardle 8‚Äì2. Match three saw Phil Taylor just edge past Jelle Klaasen 8‚Äì6, although Taylor was booed constantly throughout the match, and after the match, the Englishman said that he had been hit by an apple. Mervyn King, fresh from his nine-darter last weekend, won the final match 8‚Äì3 against James Wade. * 4 ‚Äì Phil Taylor wins yet another Players Championship, by winning the first of the weekend's events in Nuland. In the final, he beat Scotland's Gary Anderson ‚Äì who was appearing in his first final since coming across to the PDC ‚Äì by six legs to five. Anderson is known to be a formidable player when playing in the Netherlands, having won both the International Darts League and the World Darts Trophy. The players' averages were incredible, for an eleven-leg match. Anderson averaged 108.24, whereas Taylor recorded 116.04, in order to win the ¬£6,000 first prize. * 5 ‚Äì An eleventh tournament win of 2009 for Phil Taylor as he beat Gary Anderson once again, 6‚Äì2 in the final of the second Players Championship in Nuland. There was a fourth nine-darter of the year, with Vincent van der Voort recording his first in open play against Mario Masurka. The English team won the BDO British Internationals championship, after an 8‚Äì4 win over Wales. In the women's event, Wales clinched their first title in a dozen years, winning 4‚Äì2 against England. * 7 ‚Äì After coming down with a virus, Wayne Mardle pulled out of week ten of the Premier League due to be played on April 9, in Exeter. John Part will play two matches, with Mardle due to make his games up on April 16 in Nottingham. * 9 ‚Äì John Part was the undoubted hero of week ten of the Premier League in Exeter, as he won one and drew the other of his two matches, to move into fourth place in the standings. In match one, he defeated Mervyn King 8‚Äì6, before drawing with Jelle Klaasen in the final match. In the other matches, Phil Taylor and Terry Jenkins drew 7‚Äì7 and James Wade beat Raymond van Barneveld 8‚Äì5. * 11 ‚Äì Michael van Gerwen won his first major UK tournament, by winning the South-West Players Championship in Taunton. The teenager beat his Dutch compatriot Vincent van der Voort 6‚Äì3 in the final, to pick up the winner's cheque. With the win, van Gerwen moved up to 30th in the PDC Order of Merit. * 12 ‚Äì Phil Taylor claimed yet another UK Open Regional title, by demolishing Andy Hamilton 6‚Äì0 in the final of the South-West Regional in Taunton. Over the six legs, Taylor's match average exceeded 120, finishing at 120.24, using just 75 darts. Elsewhere, Eser Tekin won the Turkish Masters, beating Emre Toros to pick up the ‚Ç¨100 first prize. In the women's event, Neslihan Algul beat Mine Aloglu; and in Greece, John Michael and Evi Nakka won their respective Greek Open titles. * 15 ‚Äì Wayne Mardle is rushed into hospital, after contracting mumps. This ruled him out of the Week 11 matchups of the Premier League, in Nottingham. This left him with five matches to catch up over the last three weeks. This meant that Mervyn King and James Wade would play twice during week eleven, in a hastily rearranged fixture list. * 16 ‚Äì In the revised schedule of week eleven of the Premier League, James Wade was the only winner on the night; an 8‚Äì1 thrashing of Terry Jenkins. The other three matches (Jelle Klaasen v Mervyn King, King v Raymond van Barneveld and Phil Taylor v Wade) all ended up in 7‚Äì7 draws. This took Wade to the top of the standings with 17 points from 12 games, ahead of Taylor, who has 16 from 11 and King, who has 15 from 12. * 18 ‚Äì James Wade, fresh from returning to the top of the Premier League standings, won only his second title of 2009, by picking up the Players Championship event in Derby. He defeated Colin Lloyd 6‚Äì4 in the final, to pick up yet another ¬£6,000 as he looks to keep within ¬£300,000 of Phil Taylor in the PDC Order of Merit. Gary Anderson achieved his first nine-darter in the PDC, during his match with Darren Latham. He would latterly fall to his former BDO companion Mark Webster, but Anderson has now broken into the top 80 in the PDC, in just seven weeks. John Henderson won the German Open, after beating Stephen Bunting 3‚Äì2, while Trina Gulliver held off the in-form Tricia Wright 2‚Äì1, to win the women's event. The youth events were won by Zoe Jones and Tim van de Hoek, with the pairs events won by Ron Meulenkamp/Robert Wagner (men's) and Gulliver/Francis Hoenselaar (women's). * 19 ‚Äì Mark Walsh produced a sensational comeback to win the penultimate regional qualifier for the UK Open, by winning the East Midlands Regional in Derby. After being 4‚Äì0 down to Dutchman Raymond van Barneveld, Walshie reeled off 5 consecutive legs, before taking a deciding leg. It was his second tournament win of 2009. Ken Dobson caused a major surprise by reaching the semi-finals, before falling to Walsh 6‚Äì2. Elsewhere, Darin Young won the WDF-sanctioned Charlotte Open, beating Canada's Shawn Brenneman in the final. In another USA v Canada final, Paula Murphy beat Robin Curry to win the women's event. * 20 ‚Äì Wayne Mardle was given the all-clear to rejoin the Premier League circuit, for Thursday night's fixtures in Aberdeen. The PDC also revealed the fixtures for the last three weeks, after Mardle's illness had led to the original fixtures being scrapped. * 22 ‚Äì The Professional Darts Corporation released a statement confirming that Wayne Mardle had been removed from the 2009 Premier League, after he was re- admitted to hospital, with mumps. In order for four matches to be played at each remaining night, challenge matches were arranged, featuring Robert Thornton, Adrian Lewis, Dennis Priestley, Mark Webster and Gary Anderson. Also, the qualification places of James Wade and Phil Taylor to the play-offs were confirmed, as they could not be caught. * 23 ‚Äì Week twelve of the Premier League in Aberdeen began with one of the challenge matches arranged the day before. James Wade took on Robert Thornton in a race-to-7 match. Wade averaged in excess of 105 to beat the Scot 7‚Äì2. Regular Premier League matches completed the night, with Terry Jenkins and Mervyn King drawing 7‚Äì7, Raymond van Barneveld beating Jelle Klaasen 8‚Äì5, and Phil Taylor thrashed John Part 8-3. Taylor averaged 116.01 during the match, breaking his own record of 114.53, for the highest three-dart average recorded on television. King and van Barneveld confirmed their places in the play-offs, with Wade and Taylor confirmed to finish in the top two. * 25 ‚Äì Sixteen players qualified for the UK Open thanks to their performances during the Holsten Pub Qualifiers in Batley and Aylesbury. From the Batley event, Darren Weaver, Graham Usher, Chris Hornby, Stuart Monaghan, David Smurthwaite, Gary Stephens, Glen Durrant and Alan Davie all qualified, and from the Aylesbury event, Peter Green, Stuart Pickles, Coen Wiekamp, Adrian Genery, Steve Penney, Phil Currie, Steve Dolan and John McGuirk qualified. Elsewhere, John Henderson continued his good run, as he won the Scottish Singles Championship, beating Brian Woods 3‚Äì2 in the final. In the women's event, teenager Lorraine Hyde saw off Linda Marshall 3‚Äì1. Also, the pairs events were held towards the Open Holland, with Carla Molema winning the women's pairs and mixed pairs, with partners Irina Armstrong and Pedro Heijnen. Molema and Armstrong beat Melissa Landkroon and Melanie Os 4‚Äì0, while Molema and Heijnen beat Karin Krappen and Daniel Brouwer 5‚Äì0. The men's pairs were won by Hans Zeelenberg and Niels-Jan Stuiver, beating Alan Norris and Stephan Gerritsen 5‚Äì2. * 26 ‚Äì The sixteen remaining UK Open spots were snapped up during the Holsten Pub Qualifiers in Salford and Birmingham. Salford saw Kevin Beare, Duane Garfield, Matthew Campbell, Andy Boulton, Harry Robinson, Ken Mather, Les Fitton and Derek Williams all qualified, and in Birmingham, Andy Roberts, Mark Layton, Paul Cook, Paul Rowley, Mark Cox, Johnny Haines, Mike Langley and Andy Pearce all qualified. Meanwhile, the International Open Holland continued with the singles events. Mareno Michels saw off Scotland's Mark Barilli 3‚Äì2 to win the men's event. Karin Krappen avenged her mixed pairs defeat by beating Carla Molema 2‚Äì1 in the final of the women's event. The youth events were won by Jeffrey Sparidaans and Mercedes Pieters. * 30 ‚Äì The penultimate week of the Premier League saw play move to Sheffield, where two challenge matches and two league matches. In the challenge matches, Raymond van Barneveld saw off Adrian Lewis 7‚Äì5, and Phil Taylor saw off Dennis Priestley 7‚Äì4. Priestley also provided some humour to the crowd by donning a hula shirt, something made famous by Wayne Mardle whom Priestley had replaced due to his ill health. In the league, Terry Jenkins made sure that he didn't finish bottom after an 8‚Äì3 win over John Part, while James Wade completed his matches with an 8‚Äì4 win over Jelle Klaasen. =May= * 2 ‚Äì Simon Whitlock returned in style to the DPA circuit, by winning the Saturday Goulburn Workers Club Open, in New South Wales. He saw off Steve MacArthur 7‚Äì5 in the final, having been 4‚Äì0 up at one stage. * 3 ‚Äì Another $1,000 went the way of Simon Whitlock as he completed the Australian Grand Prix double, by winning the Sunday Goulburn Workers Club Open. This time, he saw off Russell Stewart 7‚Äì2 in the final. Despite only competing in this weekend, Whitlock is up to fourth in the DPA Order of Merit, $800 behind leader Paul Nicholson. * 7 ‚Äì The regular season of the 2009 Premier League ended as the final week took place in Cardiff, and just like the previous week, was made up of two challenge matches and two league matches. In a battle of former BDO world champions, Jelle Klaasen saw off Mark Webster 7‚Äì3, while John Part was humbled 7‚Äì4 by Gary Anderson; the Scot averaged 107.40 during the match. In the league matches, Raymond van Barneveld clinched third after a 7‚Äì7 draw with Terry Jenkins, who finished fifth, and Phil Taylor sealed the number one spot after an 8‚Äì2 win over Mervyn King. The semi-finals at Wembley Arena on May 25, will see Taylor and King face each other once again, while van Barneveld will do battle with James Wade. * 9 ‚Äì The PDC Pro Tour returned after a three-week break with the Welsh Players Championship in Newport. After his superb win over John Part the previous Thursday, Gary Anderson clinched his first tournament win after beating Mervyn King 6‚Äì2 in the final. Anderson moved into the world's top sixty after the win, while King moved into the world's top five. * 10 ‚Äì In a weekend of firsts, Jamie Caven won his first Pro Tour title, by winning the UK Open Welsh Regional in Newport. He edged out Alan Tabern in a final leg decider to pick up the ¬£6,000 first prize. What makes Caven's success even more special is the fact that he is blind in one eye. The Welsh Regional was the final qualifying event for the UK Open and will see 130 players take part at the tournament. Elsewhere, Simon Whitlock's great run continued, as he won his third successive tournament on the DPA circuit. Whitlock saw off Phil Hazell 7‚Äì5 in the final of the Clubs NZ Viva Las Vegas event, despite trailing 4‚Äì1. Both players receive airfare and accommodation for the PartyPoker.net Las Vegas Desert Classic in July. * 25 ‚Äì James Wade won the 2009 Premier League Darts after an amazing night unfolded at Wembley Arena. Mervyn King knocked out four-time defending champion Phil Taylor 10‚Äì6 in the first semi-final. In the second semi, Wade put pay to the chances of Raymond van Barneveld 10‚Äì8. In the final, Wade raced into a 7‚Äì0 lead over King, but eventually won 13‚Äì8. * 31 ‚Äì Scott Burnett won the North American Darts Championship in Boxborough, Massachusetts after a 6‚Äì3 win over Darin Young. With the win, Burnett earned a place at the 2009 Las Vegas Desert Classic at the start of July. =June= * 7 ‚Äì Phil Taylor won the 2009 UK Open after a hard-fought 11‚Äì6 win over Colin Osborne in the final. Osborne's final performance also earns him a place at the 2009 Grand Slam of Darts. * 13 ‚Äì Mark Walsh claimed his third tournament of the year with a 6‚Äì4 win over Jamie Caven in the Barnsley Players Championship. Caven's ¬£3,000 earned also helps towards earning a place at the 2009 World Matchplay. * 14 ‚Äì A week after reaching the UK Open final, Colin Osborne wrapped up his first tournament title of 2009 with a 6‚Äì2 win over Gary Anderson in Barnsley. Anderson's runner-up earnings pushed him towards the edge of the top 50 in the PDC Order of Merit. Colin Monk earned ¬£2,000 for a nine dart finish in a 6‚Äì1 win over Ray Farrell. * 20 ‚Äì \\"Pieman\\" Andy Smith claimed his first tournament win since October 2007 after winning the German Darts Trophy in Dinslaken. Smith edged out Colin Lloyd in a deciding leg to win the ¬£6,000 first prize. Along the way, Smith also hit a nine dart finish during a 6‚Äì5 victory over Mark Walsh. Joe Cullen made his first semi-final since turning professional, losing 6‚Äì3 to Smith in the semi-finals. * 21 ‚Äì Mark Walsh picked up his fourth title of 2009 with a win in Dinslaken over Andy Hamilton 6‚Äì5. Walsh, the highest ranked player on the Players Championship Order of Merit in the tournament also knocked out Ronnie Baxter, Gary Anderson and Steve Beaton en route to the final. Meanwhile, on the DPA circuit, Simon Whitlock continued his good form by winning the Mittagong RSL Club Open in Mittagong, New South Wales. He beat Kevin Luland 8‚Äì2 in the final to claim his eighth title of the year. * 28 ‚Äì The first six of twelve remaining places in the 2009 Las Vegas Desert Classic were sealed in the first of two qualifying tournaments at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada. Sealing places in the tournament were Dutch trio Jelle Klaasen, Co Stomp√© and Vincent van der Voort, Australian Simon Whitlock and English pair Jamie Caven and Peter Wright. * 29 ‚Äì The final six places for the 2009 Las Vegas Desert Classic were taken during the second qualifying event at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada. Former champion Peter Manley, who has dropped out of the world's top 16 due to poor form, Colin Monk, Wes Newton, Louis Blundell, Phillip Hazel and Gary Anderson all qualified for the ¬£200,000 event. * 30 ‚Äì Ronnie Baxter handed Phil Taylor only his second Players Championship loss of the season, with a stunning 6‚Äì2 win over the world number one in the Las Vegas Players Championship at the Mandalay Bay Resort. Baxter's win also takes him within a few pounds of the top six qualification places for the 2010 Premier League. Wes Newton and Larry Butler both hit nine dart finishes against Colin Osborne and Jan van der Rassel respectively, sharing an ¬£800 bonus prize. Their nine-darters didn't help them progress in the tournaments, as they lost against their respective opponents 6‚Äì3 and 6‚Äì2. =July= * 5 ‚Äì Phil Taylor picked up yet another Las Vegas Desert Classic win, with a 13‚Äì11 victory over Raymond van Barneveld. Taylor had breezed into the final with an easy 11‚Äì1 win over John Part in the semi-finals, whereas van Barneveld had a tougher match, defeating James Wade 11‚Äì6.

In the US, U-value is used to refer to the amount of heat that can pass through a window, with a lower score being better.\\"Energy efficient windows\\". Energy.gov Energy Efficiency Technologies Below is a list of technologies that decrease heat transfer in windows. =Double- and triple-glazed windows= Clear single glass has a U-factor of 1 (R-1); clear double glazing has a U-factor of 0.5 (about R-2), while clear triple glazing has a U-factor of about 0.333 (R-3). Double and triple glazing are critical for energy efficiency. Single glass windows are no longer in general use. The insulation provided by double or triple glazing can be further improved by selecting windows with low-e coatings, thermal breaks and argon or other similar gas between the panes; and also by selecting windows with high energy-efficient frames. =Low-e coatings= Modern double and triple-glazing windows have low-e coatings - their glass panes have thin metallic coatings, able to significantly improve their thermal insulating performance. Another area where low-e films are used is thermal barriers. Some thermal barriers (like insulbar LEF) decreases thermal losses due to radiation by a low-e folio applied to the thermal insulation profile. =Thermal insulation profiles = To reduce heat flow and the U-factor, metal frames should have an insulating plastic profile placed between the inside and outside of the frame and sash. These profiles are called also thermal break and they are made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide 66. The glass fibre proportion is 25 %. The material used for this insulating bar stands out for its low thermal conductivity value = 0.30 W/mK and its good mechanical properties ‚Äì even at higher temperatures. A non- thermally-separated frame from an aluminium window has a thermal transmission coefficient Uf of 6.8 W/m2K. If this system is thermally separated with an insulating profile with a width of 42 mm, then the thermal transmission coefficient can be reduced to 1.3 W/m2K A product introduced by Ensinger, called insulbar LO is a lambda (thermal conductivity) optimised solution to thermal insulation profiles. Its lambda value is only 0.18 W/m.K =Warm edge spacers= Most modern windows use glazing spacers to keep the distance between their panes and for sealing purposes. Many of these spacers are made from aluminum, which is a very conductive material. There is a better alternative for higher insulation performance: special plastic spacers, mostly named as warm-edge spacers. =Inert gas fills= Double and triple-glazed windows also use argon or krypton or other inert gas between their panes. It‚Äôs another key element for a better thermal insulation. Most windows use argon (which is cheaper), but krypton is a better choice whenever the distance between the panes has to be smaller (the distance has to be about 13 mm (¬Ω inch) for argon, and about 9 mm (3/8 inch) for krypton; increasing or decreasing the space will degrade performance). =Window frames= The type of window frame and the insulation of its cavity are also critical for energy- efficiency and thermal performance (or for strength, durability and maintenance). Aluminum frames are excellent for strength, durability and maintenance but they are a poor choice from a thermal insulation point of view. Aluminum is an extremely conductive material. Therefore, thermal insulation profiles are used to create a thermal separation of the inner and outer shells of metal frames. The variety of thermal insulation profiles (insulbar) allows low Uf values (for example 1.3 W/m¬≤K by using a 34mm insulation profile and up to 1.1 W/m¬≤K with contemporary aluminium systems) to be reached. Polyamide insulation profiles with %25 glass fibre content are the right choice for optimum heat insulation and mechanical properties. Wood frame windows provides a better insulation value, but they are a poor choice for durability or maintenance (unless you choose wood-clad windows). Vinyl and fiberglass are better insulation and noise reduction materials. Certain windows have vinyl or fiberglass frames that feature chambers, to further enhance insulation and noise reduction. =High insulation-performance windows= The insulation performance of windows is measured by its U-factor/value coefficient, which should be as low as possible. To know the U-factor of a window you may look at the rating label (labels often show the U-factor of the window). If you live in a cold climate, and you are planning on building an energy-efficient house, you should look for triple-glazing windows with a U-value between 0.19 and 0.26; in moderate and hot climates, also look for windows with a low U-value; but since, in general, quality double-glazing windows are a more cost-competitive and effective choice for mixed and hot climates, consider windows with a U-value of about 0.30, if possible.\\"Window energy ratings\\" . National Fenestration Rating Organization =Other ways of improving the insulation of a window= # Using glass with heat reflective properties # Sticking on thermal reflective plastic # Double glazing using heat-shrink plastic film and double sided tape The frames can also be significant especially if they are made from a high thermal conductivity material such as metal. In this case plastic spacers should be used to create thermal breaks between the inner and outer sections of the frame.

It was located next to airport's passenger terminal building, and connected via a skyway (still left standing but leading to nowhere, after demolition of terminal). The hotel closed in 2002. History Tropical atrium with palm trees in the former Chateau Mirabel. With guest rooms having a unique view of the interior surroundings The hotel opened in 1977 by Canadian Pacific Hotels under the name \\"Chateau Aeroport\\". The property, developed along the same visual lines of other CP Hotels properties of the era, including the Chateau Airport Calgary and the Red Oak Inns of Thunder Bay and Peterborough. It had a large indoor atrium style foyer with fully grown palm trees, garden foliage, swimming pool and heated whirlpool; over which most rooms looked. It also had a glass elevator and terraced restaurant. High season was November to May. It accommodated passengers departing on early morning flights out of Mirabel Airport, with the 344 room and 11 suite complex located directly adjacent to the airport terminal and its above ground parking area. The hotel was a victim of the airport's decline. On August 26, 2002, facing high vacancies due to Mirabel Airport's dwindling usage, it closed after 25 years in service. Mirabel was eventually closed for passenger traffic in 2004. Uncertain future The building has sat abandoned for nearly two decades. In February 2011 it was announced the site would reopen as a hotel and conference centre. Syscomax, a construction and management company, signed a long term lease with Montreal Airport ADM to operate the former hotel. Renovations were started on the adjacent eight-storey administration building with plans for it to be used by aerospace companies until complete. Plans for a 2012 and then a revised 2014 reopening fell through, as no work was ever started. In November 2014 a decision announced by Aeroports de Montreal saw the demolition of the adjacent airport terminal building and outdoor parking structures complete by 2016. The hotel has since been boarded up and left to deteriorate.

Protochlorophyllide,KEGG compound database entry or monovinyl protochlorophyllide, is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll a. It lacks the phytol side-chain of chlorophyll and the reduced pyrrole in ring D. Protochlorophyllide is highly fluorescent; mutants that accumulate it glow red if irradiated with blue light.Meskauskiene R, Nater M, Goslings D, Kessler F, op den Camp R, Apel K. FLU: a negative regulator of chlorophyll biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 2001; 98(22):12826-31 pdf. In angiosperms, the later steps which convert protochlorophyllide to chlorophyll are light-dependent, and such plants are pale (chlorotic) if grown in the darkness. Gymnosperms, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria have another, light-independent enzyme and grow green in the darkness as well.  Conversion to chlorophyll  The enzyme that converts protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide a, the next intermediate on the biosynthetic pathway, is protochlorophyllide reductase,KEGG enzyme entry 1.3.1.33 EC 1.3.1.33. There are two structurally unrelated proteins with this activity: the light-dependent and the dark-operative. The light-dependent reductase needs light to operate. The dark-operative version is a completely different protein, consisting of three subunits that exhibit significant sequence similarity to the three subunits of nitrogenase, which catalyzes the formation of ammonia from dinitrogen. Yuichi FujitaDagger and Carl E. Bauer (2000). Reconstitution of Light-independent Protochlorophyllide Reductase from Purified Bchl and BchN-BchB Subunits. J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 275, Issue 31, 23583-23588. This enzyme might be evolutionary older but (being similar to nitrogenase) is highly sensitive to free oxygen and does not work if its concentration exceeds about 3%.S.Yamazaki, J.Nomata, Y.Fujita (2006) Differential operation of dual protochlorophyllide reductases for chlorophyll biosynthesis in response to environmental oxygen levels in the cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya boryana. Plant Physiology, 2006, 142, 911-922 Hence, the alternative, light-dependent version needed to evolve. Most of the photosynthetic bacteria have both light-dependent and light-independent reductases. Angiosperms have lost the dark-operative form and rely on 3 slightly different copies of light-dependent version, frequently abbreviated as POR A, B, and C. Gymnosperms have much more copies of the similar gene (Loblolly pine has about 11 Loblolly Pine (Pinus taeda L.) Contains Multiple Expressed Genes Encoding Light-Dependent NADPH:Protochlorophyllide Oxidoreductase (POR)). In plants, POR is encoded in the cell nucleus and only later transported to its place of work, chloroplast. Unlike with POR, in plants and algae that have the dark-operative enzyme it is at least partially encoded in the chloroplast genome.J Li, M Goldschmidt-Clermont, M P Timko (1997). Chloroplast-encoded chlB is required for light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase activity in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Plant Cell 5(12): 1817‚Äì1829. .  Potential danger for plant  Chlorophyll itself is bound to proteins and can transfer the absorbed energy in the required direction. Protochlorophyllide, however, occurs mostly in the free form and, under light conditions, acts as a photosensitizer, forming highly toxic free radicals. Hence, plants need an efficient mechanism of regulating the amount of chlorophyll precursor. In angiosperms, this is done at the step of Œ¥-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), one of the intermediate compounds in the biosynthetic pathway. Plants that are fed by ALA accumulate high and toxic levels of protochlorophyllide, as do mutants with a disrupted regulatory system. Arabidopsis FLU mutant with damaged regulation can survive only either in a continuous darkness (protochlorophyllide is not dangerous in the darkness) or under continuous light, when the plant is capable to convert all produced protochlorophyllide into chlorophyll and do not overaccumulate it despite of the lack of regulation. In barley Tigrina mutant (mutated on the same gene,) light kills the majority of the leaf tissue that has developed in the darkness, but part of the leaf that originated during the day survives. As a result, the leaves are covered by white stripes of necrotic regions, and the number of the white stripes is close to the age of the leaf in days. Green regions survive the subsequent nights, likely because the synthesis of chlorophyll in the mature leaf tissue is greatly reduced anyway.  Biosynthesis regulatory protein FLU  In spite of numerous past attempts to find the mutant that overacumulates protochlorophyllide under usual conditions, only one such gene (flu) is currently (2009) known. Flu (first described in ) is a nuclear-encoded, chloroplast-located protein that appears containing only protein-protein interaction sites. It is currently not known which other proteins interact through this linker. The regulatory protein is a transmembrane protein that is located in the thylakoid membrane. Later, it was discovered that Tigrina mutants in barley, known a long time ago, are also mutated in the same gene. It is not obvious why no mutants of any other gene were observed; maybe mutations in other proteins, involved into the regulatory chain, are fatal. Flu is a single gene, not a member of the gene family. Later, by the sequence similarity, a similar protein was found in Chlamydomonas algae,A Falciatore, L Merendino, F Barneche, M Ceol, R Meskauskiene, K Apel, JD Rochaix (2005). The FLP proteins act as regulators of chlorophyll synthesis in response to light and plastid signals in Chlamydomonas. Genes & Dev, 19:176-187 showing that this regulatory subsystem existed a long time before the angiosperms lost the independent conversion enzyme. In a different manner, the Chlamydomonas regulatory protein is more complex: It is larger, crosses the thylakoid membrane twice rather than once, contains more protein-protein interactions sites, and even undergoes alternative splicing. It appears that the regulatory system underwent simplification during evolution.

In the United States, the DVD sold 163,890 units in its first week and as of January 2014, it has sold approximately 524,725 units. This is the last direct-to-video Scooby-Doo film to use the bright animation style keen to the What's New, Scooby-Doo? TV series, making it the last What‚Äôs New, Scooby-Doo? related production. It was also the last Scooby-Doo production to feature Casey Kasem as the voice of Shaggy Rogers before his retirement in 2010 and subsequent death in 2014. Plot At a Tokyo museum of ancient history, Mr. Takagawa, the curator, and Kenji, a janitor, witness the resurrection of the evil Black Samurai, an ancient Japanese warrior whose armor was to be the newest exhibit at the museum. The next day, the Mystery Inc. gang arrives at Tokyo, where Daphne is ready to participate in a martial arts tournament at a prestigious academy. The gang meet Daphne's friend Miyumi, who explains the difficulty of winning the tournament and entering the school as a student. The gang and Miyumi take a fully functioning robotic plane to the school, which is run by Miss Mirimoto. After Daphne defeats Miss Mirimoto's bodyguard, Sojo, and almost defeats Miyumi, Mirimoto tells her she shows promise as a fighter. Also at the tournament is Mr. Takagawa, who explains to Mirimoto that the Black Samurai has risen and will be after the Destiny Scroll, which is at the school. That night, during a feast, the Black Samurai and his Ninja warriors attack the school and steal the scroll. But Mirimoto explains the scroll was only a copy, and shows the gang the real one. Mr. Takagawa explains to the gang the legend of the Black Samurai. The Black Samurai was an ancient warrior who asked the great swordsmith Masamune to craft a powerful sword. The sword maker agreed, but told the Samurai it would take a year to make. Masamune's evil apprentice Muramasa offered to make another sword for the Samurai in only half the time, which the Samurai accepted. But the apprentice's evil nature passed into the blade, and when the Samurai took the sword, he became infected with the evil and was turned into the Black Samurai, wielding the Sword of Doom. When Masamune finished crafting his sword, the Sword of Fate, he presented it to the Green Dragon, who used it to fight against the Black Samurai. After a long battle in the sky, the Green Dragon successfully defeated the Black Samurai and imprisoned him in the Sword of Doom. The Dragon then hid the sword, and put its whereabouts in a riddle on the Destiny Scroll. Velma is able to solve the riddle, and Miss Mirimoto instructs the gang, Miyumi and Mr. Takagawa to find the Sword of Doom before the spirit can. The gang finds the sword in a cave on an island in the Pacific Ocean, where they deal with a tribe living on the island and are attacked by the Black Samurai. During the fight, the Black Samurai is revealed to be Sojo. But once the gang brings Sojo back to Miss Mirimoto, she and Miyumi capture them. Miss Mirimoto explains that she staged the tournament to bring the Mystery Inc to Japan so that they would find the Sword of Doom for her. She also reveals her plan to release the Black Samurai so she can use him to return Japan to the way it was in feudal times. The ninja army is revealed to be robots in which Miss Mirimoto planted the various fighting techniques of her students (including Daphne's). She then locks Fred, Daphne, Velma and Mr. Takagawa in the museum, but not before Daphne kicks the Samurai's sword from Miss Mirimoto's hand into Scooby and Shaggy's possession. Scooby and Shaggy manage to escape Miss Mirimoto with the samurai sword, but are chased by the ninja warriors. They are saved by Matsuhiro, a sushi shop owner and Samurai (but also lose the sword to the ninja warriors in the process) who trains them as Samurai and is also aware of the legend. Matsuhiro instructs Scooby and Shaggy to pass through the gates of earth, air, fire and water in order to find the Green Dragon and the Sword of Fate. When they do so, the Green Dragon enters the sword and takes them back to the museum to combat the Black Samurai. Kenji frees Fred, Daphne, Velma and Mr. Takagawa, and they, plus Miyumi, who decides to fight with them, attempt to stop Sojo and Miss Mirimoto from resurrecting the Black Samurai, but their plan fails. After reviving the Samurai, Miss Mirimoto tries to make him her servant, but she has miscalculated: the villain has no interest in working alongside her and throws her against the palace stairs, knocking her out. Scooby and Shaggy arrive riding the Green Dragon and, along with a little encouragement from Matsuhiro, defeat the Black Samurai by using the Sword of Fate to destroy the Sword of Doom, breaking the curse on the Samurai, who finally passes on to the afterlife. The gang later attends the newly renovated museum, where a statue of Scooby is erected in his honor.

Closely related to Northrop's Gamma mail plane, 13 were produced by the Northrop Corporation, followed by 19 aircraft built under license by Canadian Vickers Limited. Development and design When Jack Northrop set up the Northrop Corporation as a joint venture with the Douglas Aircraft Company in 1932, he set out to design two closely related single- engined aircraft as the new company's first products: a mailplane/record- breaking aircraft, which was designated the Gamma, and a passenger transport, the Delta.Francillon 1979, pp.23‚Äì24, 143. The Delta was a low-winged monoplane, with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. It was of all-metal, stressed-skin construction, with streamlining spats covering the main landing gear. While the Delta's wings were common with those of the Gamma, it had a new, wider fuselage, which seated the pilot in an enclosed cockpit immediately behind the engine, and had accommodation for eight passengers in a cabin behind the pilot.Green 1967, p.57.Francillon 1979, p.157. The first Delta was flown in May 1933, and received an airworthiness certificate in August that year. Operational history Although it was intended that the Delta would be sold in both airliner and executive transport (initially named \\"Victoria\\") versions,Flight 8 February 1934, p.123. a change to the regulations governing commercial air transport in the United States in October 1934, prohibiting the use of single-engined aircraft to carry passengers at night or over rough terrain which would prevent a forced landing, stopped the market for single- engined airliners in the United States, and only three aircraft, all ordered before the passing of this regulation, were built as airliners. These consisted of the prototype, leased to Trans World Airlines for use to carry airmail, which crashed on 10 November 1933, one sold to Pan-Am for use by its Mexican subsidiary, destroyed by a fire in May 1934 and one sold to AB Aerotransport of Sweden, delivered in April 1934. AB Aerotransport purchased a second Delta, but this was a dedicated mailplane which more closely resembled the Gamma, with a slim fuselage carrying its cargo in a compartment ahead of the cockpit. A single aircraft was built for the United States Coast Guard. Designated the Northrop RT-1, this was used as the personal transport of Henry Morgenthau, Jr., the Secretary of the Treasury and as a staff transport.Francillon 1979, p.163. Seven more aircraft were built as executive transports for private owners. Of these, three were purchased by the Spanish Republicans for use in the Spanish Civil War. Two of these aircraft were captured by the Nationalists when the ship carrying them (along with four Vultee V-1s, a Fairchild 91 and a Lockheed Electra) was captured at sea. These two Deltas were used as Transports by Franco's forces, while the third Delta was used by the Republican airline Lineas A√©reas Postales Espa√±olas (LAPE) until the end of the civil war when it was handed over to Franco's air force.Francillon 1979, pp.159‚Äì161. In 1935, Canada selected the Delta for use as a photographic survey aircraft for use by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), to be built by Canadian Vickers under license. One aircraft, the last Delta built by Northrop, was supplied as a part assembled pattern to Canadian Vickers, first flying on 16 August 1936 and being delivered to the RCAF on 1 September that year.Green 1967, p.58. It was followed by a further 19 aircraft built wholly by Canadian Vickers, production continuing until October 1940.Green 1967, p.60. The Northrop Delta was the first completely all-metal, stressed-skin aircraft built in Canada, however it was closely preceded by the Fairchild Super 71, whose stressed skin construction was limited to the fuselage and not the flying surfaces. The Deltas, which were capable of being operated from wheeled, ski or float undercarriages, proved capable survey aircraft, well suited to operations in the North of Canada, but in August 1939, when the outbreak of the Second World War loomed, Canada found itself short of coastal patrol aircraft, and the Deltas were diverted to this role, being fitted with floats and carrying out long anti-submarine missions. The Deltas were less successful as patrol floatplanes, as they were damaged by ocean swell and by salt water corrosion, and they were forced to revert to landplane use after two months. The Delta was withdrawn from operations in late 1941, then being used as instructional airframes in training schools.Green 1967, p.60.

The pilot never aired on television, but it was released in 2003 as a special feature on the H.R. Pufnstuf DVD boxed set (the title is cited as simply \\"Irving\\" on the DVD packaging and menu). A mute version of the pilot was buried in the files of disc 1 of the Rhinomation DVD release of the second season of Beast Wars: Transformers. Plot The show begins with a two-minute opening title sequence introducing viewers to a variety of characters on a circus stage. Next the camera zooms in on a traveling circus wagon, home to an aging circus lion named Irving. Once inside, Irving introduces himself to viewers and begins digging through a scrapbook, relating anecdotes about an ugly ballerina and a rollerskating bear. This segues into the tale of Barker the seal. Barker is doing his circus routine with the horns one day when his mother is taken aback by the intricate jazz music emanating from the horns. Barker decides to make use of his newfound musical abilities, so he runs away from home and meets struggling jazz guitarist Billy McGuffey. Barker returns to the circus with Billy in tow and together, their act is an instant success. The focus returns to Irving, who gives a teaser for the next story, \\"The Dragon and the Dragonfly.\\" The picture fades out (as if to go to commercial) and that's the end.

Cox is CEO of Allan Cox & Associates, which he founded in 1969.  Early life and education  Cox was born in Berwyn, Illinois and raised in nearby Oak Park, Illinois. Cox earned a B.A. in social science and an M.A. in sociology from Northern Illinois University.  Career  Upon completing his graduate work at Northern Illinois University, Cox enrolled in the McCormick Theological Seminary with plans to enter the Presbyterian ministry. When he was halfway through that course of study, he quit and entered advanced studies at the Alfred Adler Institute of Chicago (now Adler University) in downtown Chicago to study Adlerian psychology. Rudolf Dreikurs, a prot√©g√© of Alfred Adler, founded the Alfred Adler Institute of Chicago. Cox studied there part-time from 1963 through 1975, while teaching sociology at Wheaton College for three years and at the same time launching his management consulting career.Chicago Magazine Profile (see below)About Adler University (see below) Allan Cox pioneered application of the theory and practice of the Adlerian school of psychotherapy to business environments and to organizations. =Executive search= Cox became an executive search consultant with Spencer Stuart, then the largest global search firm in existence, and served on its management committee. Two years later, he founded a management consulting firm that bears his name and that at first specialized in executive search. Cox performed executive search as a retained search recruiter. That is, he was paid for the process rather than by contingency. A Chicago Magazine interviewer in 1985 wrote, \\"Because he spends his time writing books about the world of business and conducting executive development seminars, Cox can perform no more than eight or ten executive searches a year - only two or three at any one time - for jobs that pay at least $100,000. His satisfied clients include Coca-Cola, Continental Bank, Playboy, Carnation Company, Esmark (now part of Beatrice Foods), Cannon Mills, Publisher's Clearing House, and American Standard.\\" =Author and professor= Cox authored eleven business books, not including all revised and updated editions, on organizations and management, and also three books of poetry. His books on organizations and management include Confessions of a Corporate Headhunter (1973), which was the first book published on the topic of executive search. Other titles include The Making of the Achiever (1985), which was made into an audiobook by Nightingale-Conant; Inside Corporate America (1986); Your Inner CEO: Unleash the Executive Within (2007); and most recently, The CEO in You (2015); and Your Place at the Table (2017). Cox wrote a series for The New York Times Sunday business section NY Times \\"Scrap Consensus, Try Diversity\\" (see Below)NY Times \\"Focus on Teamwork\\" (see Below)NY Times \\"Even 'Flat' Companies Need Leaders\\" (see Below) and Field Newspaper syndicate (which was operated by Field Enterprises); articles for Chief Executive, Across the Board, [IndustryWeek], Training & Development Journal, Success (magazine), and Advertising Age. From 1986 to 1988 he wrote a weekly column for Los Angeles Times Syndicate entitled ‚ÄúThe Achiever.‚Äù His 1985 book, The Making of the Achiever, was made into an audio program for Nightingale-Conant, and his 1990 book on teamwork‚ÄîStraight Talk for Monday Morning‚Äîled to a four-part video series produced by the Bureau of Business Practice‚ÄîStraight Talk on Teams. Much of Cox‚Äôs writing and consulting work are explicitly grounded in Alfred Adler‚Äôs theories and practices. Adler‚Äôs concepts of ‚Äúsocial interest‚Äù and ‚Äústyle-of-life‚Äù are described in the Foreword that Cox wrote for the book, Leadership by Encouragement, authored by Drs. Don Dinkmeyer and Daniel Eckstein.Leadership by Encouragement This is also true of his chapter, ‚ÄúThe Power of Team,‚Äù which leads off the human resources section of the anthology, The Best of Chief Executive (magazine), compiled and edited by J.P.

(1869‚Äì1944) and extracted from the second movement of his Anthem \\"Goleu Yn Y Glyn\\" (Light in the Valley). First published in 1897 in the periodical \\"Yr Athraw\\" (The Teacher) vol.71 in Tonic Sol - Fa notation and first published in 1900 in the hymnal \\"The Baptist Book of Praise\\".

Ebenezer means \\"Stone of Help\\" in the Bible. The tune is named after Ebenezer Chapel in Rhos near Pontardawe, South Wales which T.J. Willams attended while composing the tune. He was born in Llangiwg, Ynysmeudwy near Pontardawe and lived in Llanelli, South Wales from 1903. He served as organist and choir director at Mount Elim Baptist Chapel Ynysmeudwy near Pontardawe for fifteen years, Zion Baptist Chapel Llanelli (1903‚Äì1911) and Calfaria Baptist Chapel Llanelli (1913‚Äì1931).

Grinter and starring Steve Hawkes, Dana Cullivan, Heather Hughes, and Bob Currier. Plot The film follows Vietnam veteran Herschell (Steve Hawkes) who, whilst riding down the highway on his motorbike, helps a young religious girl called Angel (Heather Hughes), whose car has broken down. She takes Herschell back to her home, where her sister, Anne (Dana Cullivan) and many local friends of hers are smoking pot. Herschell refuses to smoke any, as Angel had warned him about them; however, Anne continues attempting to seduce him. Angel decides that Herschell should stay with them until he gets back on his feet in life. Whilst cleaning the girls' pool, Anne encourages Herschell to smoke a joint; he does, and finds himself addicted. Herschell gets a job at a local turkey farm, where he meets two scientists who are experimenting by testing certain chemicals on turkey meat. Herschell agrees to participate in a test by eating some of the turkey meat; to convince him to agree, the scientists bribe him with more marijuana. After eating the whole turkey, he passes out on the farm. He suffers a seizure, and the two scientists later find him, and, worried about being investigated about the possible death of Herschell, they dump his body in the woodlands. But Herschell is not dead‚Äîhe wakes up to find he has a giant turkey's head in place of his own head. He is also still addicted to drugs, but, instead of smoking marijuana, he now craves the blood of other addicts. He comes to Anne for help, and at first she agrees. However, after Herschell kills three people to appease his habit, Anne finally appeals to two friends to stop Herschell by beheading him with a machete. Just as the turkey-headed Herschell is killed, the action jumps back to Herschell again waking up in the woods‚Äîthe entire sequence in which Herschell has a turkey head was only a hallucination. He is discovered by the owner of the turkey farm, who contacts Angel at the rehab center where she volunteers. Angel comes to collect Herschell and, after urging him to pray to God for assistance, takes him to the center to recover from his addiction. At the film's end, Herschell is reunited with a joyous Anne. Throughout the film, director Brad Grinter periodically appears to offer his commentary on the action. Cast * Steve Hawkes as Herschell * Dana Cullivan as Ann * Heather Hughes as Angel * Bob Currier * Anne Shearin * Linda Past * Debbie Smith * Sandy Kneelen * Domink Grutta * Randy Grinter Release =Home media= The film was released on DVD by Image Entertainment on September 24, 2002. Image re-released the film as a part of its \\"Freak Show Box Set\\" on February 3, 2004. It was last released by Frolic Pictures as a double-feature with The Pyx on May 1, 2018. Reception Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews gave the film a grade C+, writing, \\"Everything about this movie is Ed Wood bad, from the acting, the screenplay and production values. It's so bad a film, that it demands to be seen by those who call themselves weird film addicts or those who just have a perverse need to see a film that's so unbelievable it must be seen to be believed.\\" Bill Gibron from PopMatters listed the film as one of his guilty pleasures, writing, \\"The kinetic, freestyle editing, the endless shots of Grinter babbling like an improvising, smut peddling Criswell, and actors who play dead by wincing and wiggling as all the while effects gore F/X across their face makes Blood Freak a first-rate crazed capon caper.\\" G. Noel Gross from DVD Talk recommended the film, writing, \\"Abandon all hope of comprehension and savor the abject carnage unleashed by this turkey-headed dope fiend.\\" Joseph A. Ziemba from Bleeding Skull! enjoyed the film, writing, \\"Blood Freak is a trash film revelation.

To accomplish its mission the center employs nearly 13,000 civilians.WR-ALC Fact Sheet Organization The 78th Air Base Wing provides support facilities and equipment for all Robins Air Force Base associate units. It is responsible for logistics, medical, civil engineering, security, and morale services for a base population of nearly 40,000 personnel. The 402d Maintenance Wing conducts depot-level management of scheduled maintenance, facilities, software, and avionics for Air Force and U.S. Department of Defense programs globally. Members of the Aerospace Sustainment Directorate (ASD) perform program management for the following: C-130, C-5, F-15, U-2, and Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar Systems (JSTARS) E-8C aircraft; Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS); Intelligence, Information, Command and Control, Equipment and Enhancements (ICE2); RQ-4 Global Hawk; MQ-1 Predator; MQ-9 Reaper; Contractor Field Service Representatives; Special Projects, and all Special Operations Forces/Combat Search and Rescue aircraft. History Construction began on the Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex in mid-1941. During World War II the organization took on a number of roles focusing on aircraft procurement and sustainment. Through the course of the war the center trained more than a quarter of a million maintenance, supply, and logistics personnel who went on to serve in every theater of theater of operations.A Brief History of WR-ALC and Robins AFB During the post-World War II draw-down the number of personnel working at the center was reduced to about 3,900. However, as the Cold War began to take shape with the Berlin Airlift and shortly after with the Korean War the center quickly ramped up its capabilities. Warner Robins personnel focused on refurbishing mothballed B-29 Superfortress aircraft for use in Korea. The center also provided material support to U.S. forces engaged in the Vietnam War. It managed B-57 Canberra, AC-119, and AC-130 aircraft. Additionally, it was responsible for most of the U.S. Air Force's airlift fleet, including the C-123 Provider, C-124 Globemaster II, C-130 Hercules, and C-141 Starlifter. More recently the center directly supported Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm by deploying some of its members to Europe and the Persian Gulf area to assist with aircraft maintenance. Currently the center provides depot maintenance on the Air Force's entire fleet of helicopters and special operations aircraft in addition to both strategic and tactical airlift aircraft and the F-15 Eagle and U-2 Dragon Lady airframes.

He is considered to be the last great bandit of the pre-fascist era.Hess, Mafia & Mafiosi, p. 9 He hailed from Castronovo and was the son of a bandit that had belonged to the notorious band of Angelo Pugliese, better known as \\"Don Peppino il Lombardo\\", credited with introducing kidnapping people for money in Sicily.Lupo, Storia della mafia, p. 194 Outlaw Varsallona became an outlaw in 1893 after he killed a witness in the trial about his brother Luigi Varsallona's murder. His brother, a bandit as well, had been killed in 1892 over a dispute about the booty of his band‚Äôs actions. The witness did his best to provide the defendants with an alibi. Varsallona took justice in its own hands and in an act of vendetta killed the witness.Badolati & Dodaro, Il Mammasantissima, p. 26Lewis, The Honoured Society, p. 47-48 He became a fugitive and his hide-out was in the Cammarata mountains.Caruso, Da cosa nasce cosa. He assembled a band of fellow fugitives which became involved in robberies and cattle rustling roaming the province of Caltanisetta and the neighbouring areas of the provinces of Palermo and Agrigento. Populartity He soon acquired an aureole of popularity to challenge the law and its agents, according to the New York Times. From his hide-out in the mountains, he ‚Äúdominated great territories, imposing ransoms which were regularly paid, administering justice according to their own ideas, and living quite secure, as the shepherds and peasants ‚Äì partly through fear, and partly from satisfaction in that open rebellion against what is the personification of that Government which they have hated for centuries ‚Äì never let them lack ammunition or food and carefully informed them of every move of the police by signals.‚ÄùUnusual Outbreak Of Crime In Italy, The New York Times, September 8, 1907 Modernizing brigandage Varsallona is credited with modernizing brigandage in Sicily. Instead of bands roving the countryside and abducting people, he introduced tribute payments in return for guaranteed safety for the landlords and their caretakers and lease- holders (gabelotto or bailiff), while freelancing bands were suppressed.Lupo, Storia della mafia, p. 195 He also supplied manpower to noble landowners to repress farmers' revolts. Another innovation was to arrange for his men to be mobilized and demobilized according to the circumstances. They went quietly to a planned operation and then afterwards slipped back to their everyday occupations. The future Sicilian Mafia boss, Calogero Vizzini, enrolled in the band when he was still a young and aspiring criminal. In the decades to come he would be considered to be the \\"boss of bosses\\" ‚Äì although such a position does not exist in the loose structure of Cosa Nostra. Capture In 1902, an elaborate search for Varsalone was undertaken by the Carabinieri. During one raid in Cammarata in November, 60 people were arrested, including a Marquis, a Mayor, several doctors and lawyers, but the bandit remained at large.Elaborate Search For A Brigand In Sicily; Sixty Persons, Including a Marquis and a Mayor, Arrested, The New York Times, November 14, 1902 Some 600 persons were jailed charged with hiding Varsalona during several dragnets in the area.Brigandage in Italy (Notes of \\"The Observer\\" In Rome), The New York Times, December 14, 1902 Varsallona‚Äôs band finally fell into a trap set up by the police and stood trial for \\"association to commit a crime\\".

In 2018, the bank was ranked the 11th largest bank in the UAE in terms of asset size. Noor Bank is a full-service Shari‚Äôa-compliant bank, offering a range of products and services - in corporate and personal banking, wealth management, Takaful (Islamic insurance), treasury and trading. It has presence across the country, at multiple locations in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah and Al Ain. In addition to the Board of Directors, Noor Bank is also supervised by a Shari‚Äôa Supervisory Committee, and a team of scholars oversee and ensure Islamic compliance on all legal documentations, financial, products, services and banking matters. History Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum opened Noor Bank to the public on January 7, 2008. The bank‚Äôs products and services are governed by a Shari‚Äôa Board, composed primarily of Islamic scholars from the fields of law and finance. Noor Bank is a subsidiary of Noor Investment Group LLC and a sister company of Noor Takaful. In May 2008, the bank launched the first 24-hour, seven-days-a-week branch in the UAE. In November 2008, the bank opened a 24/7 branch at the Dubai Airport. In February 2009, the bank was ranked in the top ten mandated lead arrangers list by Bloomberg. That year, Noor Bank posted a net profit of US$ 139 million for the period ended December 31, 2008. After reporting an operating loss of US$ 2.5 million in the first half of 2010, the bank realized an operating profit of US$ 56.4 million by the second quarter of 2011. Noor Bank partnered with Emaar Properties in 2013 to provide mortgages to non-UAE residents. In 2013, Noor Bank launched Noor Trade, a division of the bank directed at servicing small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Noor Trade is composed of two divisions, Business Banking and Emerging Corporates. On 7 January 2014, the bank dropped 'Islamic' from its name, becoming 'Noor Bank' as part of a rebranding effort. That same year, the bank reported that its income had tripled. As of 2016, Sheikh Ahmed Bin Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum is the bank's chairman, and the board of directors includes Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem. The Bank was established with an initial paid up capital of AED 3 billion. The Bank is one of only two banks in the UAE to be given special exemption by the UAE Federal Cabinet to continue to operate as a private entity, rather than listing its shares on a public stock exchange immediately upon incorporation as required under UAE Banking Law No. 10 of 1980. The Government of Dubai, members of the Ruling Family of Dubai and a select group of Government of Dubai nominated UAE nationals own 88.3 per cent. of the Bank's shares in aggregate. The remaining shares are owned by a member of Abu Dhabi Ruling Family, the Government of the United Arab Emirates, acting through Emirates Investment Authority (EIA), and an employee stock ownership trust. The Crown Prince of Dubai HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, owns 25.89 per cent. of the Bank. HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum is also the Chairman of the Dubai Executive Council. The Government of Dubai, acting through Investment Corporation of Dubai (ICD), owns 22.85 per cent. of the Bank. ICD, chaired by the Ruler of Dubai, is the principal investment arm of the Government of Dubai and was established in May 2006 by decree (11) of 2006 under a mandate to consolidate and manage the Government of Dubai‚Äôs portfolio of commercial companies and investments. It also provides strategic oversight by developing and implementing investment strategy and corporate governance policies with an objective to maximise stakeholder value, for the long-term benefit of the Emirate. The Government of the United Arab Emirates acting through EIA, owns 4.42 per cent. of the Bank. EIA was established by Emiri decree in November 2007 and is the only Sovereign Wealth Fund of the Federal Government of the United Arab Emirates. Chaired by HH Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, EIA is dedicated to delivering sustained financial gains for the UAE. No shareholder, other than the ones listed above, owns more than 5 per cent of the Bank's shares. In order to recognise and retain key employees, an employee stock ownership trust was introduced in 2013. The employee stock ownership trust constitutes less than 5 per cent. of the Bank's share capital.

The flower was first discovered in 1945 and was first described by Donovan Stewart Correll in his 1950 book, Native Orchids of North America North of Mexico. Description Spiranthes parksii is a slender-stemmed perennial, tall. Leaves are long and thin and found mostly near the ground level, but usually disappear when the flower buds. Flowers petals are round or oval and off-white in color. The flowers typically spiral up the stem. Conspicuously white-tipped bracts occur underneath each flower. The side petals have a green central stripe, and the lip (bottom petal) is distinctly ragged. Habitat and range Navasota lady's tresses is primarily found in the East Central Texas forests, usually along creeks in the Brazos and Navasota River watersheds. In 1982, when the species was listed as endangered, only two populations were believed to exist, both in Brazos County. Since then, biologists have identified the species in Bastrop, Burleson, Fayette, Freestone, Grimes, Jasper, Leon, Madison, Milam, Robertson, and Washington Counties. The population in Jasper County is disjunct and the only one that occurs in the Piney Woods.  Conservation  Navasota lady's tresses was listed as an endangered species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in May 1982. The decline of the plant is mostly due to loss of habitat from human encroachment and activity.

The venue has an indoor hall and an indoor swimming pool. The hall has a seating capacity of 2,300 for sports events and around 5,000 for concerts. Opened on 21 October 1974, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of Zemun being liberated from the Nazis and their puppet state Independent State of Croatia, the hall has hosted various basketball, handball, and volleyball teams. Its initial full official name was Dom sportova, omladine i pionira Pinki (Pinki Hall of Sports, Youth, and Pioneers). It now mostly serves for recreational use. It is the only sports venue in the city of Belgrade not financed by the city government, because Zemun's municipal government headed by the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) in 2000 transformed the venue's controlling entity into a publicly traded company and sold the controlling stake (49%) to Naftna industrija Srbije (NIS) oil company.

He had a distinguished career as a soldier and patron of music. Life Born in Eisenstadt, he studied in Vienna and Leiden and had a strong interest in culture. His father died when he was young, and the stewardship of the Esterh√°zy was taken on by regents. In August 1733, in London, he became a freemason: > On Tuesday last Prince Anthony Esterh√°zy, lately arrived here, and another > german Nobleman, a Relative to the Elector of Mentz, were admitted Free and > Accepted Masons, at the French Lodge, held the first and third Tuesday of > every Month, at the Duke of Lorraine's head in Suffolk Street.

Paul Anton formally assumed the duties of office in 1734.New Grove, cited below As prince Paul Anton continued the historical policy of his family, namely that of supporting the Habsburg monarchy; in particular he supported the Habsburg Empress Maria Theresa of Austria in the War of the Austrian Succession. In this war (1741‚Äì1748), he led a regiment of hussarsFor information on this regiment, see . which he had raised himself.F√ºrst Paul II. Anton at the Esterh√°zy family website Because of his many successes on the battlefield, he was appointed Fieldmarshal-Lieutenant (German: :de:Feldmarschall-Leutnant) in 1747 and was sent after the war as imperial envoy to Naples, where he stayed between 1750 and 1753. At the outbreak of the Seven Years' War in 1756, he fought as a General of the Cavalry and was promoted to Field Marshal in 1758. He retired from military service that year. From then on he was involved in humanitarian and cultural activities. According to the New Grove, Paul Anton could speak French and German, and \\"oversaw the Europeanization of the court at Eisenstadt. He also remodeled the gardens there, developed a large library, sponsored theatrical productions. A cultural project of particular interest was his 1761 project of reorganizing the musical staff at his court. He brought in new players, reassigned his aging Kapellmeister Gregor Werner to cover just church music, and appointed the young Joseph Haydn as Vice-Kapellmeister, in charge of the orchestra. Since this provided Haydn with his own orchestra, with ample opportunities to compose symphonies for it to perform, the appointment was of great consequence for the growing status of the symphony and thus for the history of music. When Paul Anton died in Vienna in 1762 without children, he was succeeded by his brother Nikolaus. Notes References *Geiringer, Karl.

Biography Born in Didsbury, Manchester, England, he went to school at Elm Grove Primary School and then Parrswood High School. He left school to train as an electrician and in 1970 he started playing rhythm guitar with his pals in a four piece rock cover band called Flashback. He later adopted the hippie lifestyle. During the punk era, he, alongside drummer Chris Joyce, played in a band called Fast Breeder and was managed by Alan Erasmus, who later cofounded Factory Records with Tony Wilson. In 1978, the pair, alongside Alberto Y Lost Trios Paranoias bassist Tony Bowers, singer Phil Rainford (replaced after months by Colin Sharp), and former Nosebleeds guitarist Vini Reilly, founded the post-punk band The Durutti Column. However, the five-piece line-up did not last long, and after releasing A Factory Sample, a compilation by various artists which contained two of their songs, Rowbotham, alongside Sharp, Bowers, and Joyce, left Reilly. Rowbotham and the latter two formed The Mothmen. During the early days of The Mothmen, he also rejoined Reilly in Pauline Murray And The Invisible Girls, with then ex-Penetration vocalist Pauline Murray, playing on their eponymous album. With The Mothmen, he released two albums, Pay Attention (On-U Sound, 1981) and One Black Dot (1982). By this time, he had also formed Motivation, along with ex-Buzzcocks bassist Steve Garvey. By 1981 or early 1982, shortly before the release of One Black Dot, he left The Mothmen. After that and Motivation, he played on sessions for Factory Records. On 2 November 1991, Rowbotham's girlfriend found him dead in his flat on Grangethorpe Drive in Burnage. He was lying on the living room floor in a pool of blood, and had been murdered with a plasterer's hammer. As of March 2018, no one has yet been convicted of his murder. In his memory, the Madchester band Happy Mondays wrote a song called \\"Cowboy Dave\\", released on the album Yes Please!, in 1992.

The IWFFA was developed from previous leagues founded by Diane Beruldsen: Brooklyn Women's Flag Football League, New York Women's Flag Football League, Key West Women's Flag Football League. In 1995 Ms. Beruldsen founded the National Women's Flag Football Association, the very first women's national flag football association. Since its inception, the IWFFA has traveled to other countries throughout Europe to introduce the sport and start new teams and leagues. In the fall of 1997, the IWFFA brought flag football to Scandinavia by starting the first women's flag football team in Denmark called the: Copenhagen Mermaids. In 1999 the Oslo Trolls (Norway) was formed. In 2000, the Gothenburg Angels (Sweden), Team Ice (Iceland) was formed and as the IWFFA traveled for six months during its 2000 promotional tour throughout the Nordic Region (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Finland), many teams were formed and thus, the Nordic Region for Women's Flag Football. The IWFFA travels all over the world to promote female flag football. The majority of teams and leagues are in the United States where it holds the largest female flag football tournament: Kelly McGillis Classic (KMC). In 2001, the KMC hosted 49 teams, 9 international and 40 national teams from the USA. It was the largest international flag football competition ever which brought 1,500 flag football players to the island of Key West, Florida, USA.

Jeu de cartes was commissioned in November 1935, although the idea of a card game, especially the game of poker, did not get firmly formed in Stravinsky's mind until after August 1936. The work was written during Stravinsky's neoclassical period. The main character is the deceitful Joker, who fashions himself unbeatable, owing to his chameleon-like ability to become any card. There are also other cards‚ÄîQueens, Aces and several card players portrayed in the ballet. Jeu de cartes shows that even the higher value cards, in much the same way as the people of higher position, may be occasionally defeated by the lower value cards.

It was inspired by the break-up of the Beatles and documents Starr's relationship with his former bandmates, John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison. The lyrics to the verses comment in turn on each of the ex-Beatles' personal lives and the likelihood of each of them making music with Starr again; in the final verse, Starr acknowledges his musical limitations before expressing the hope that all the former Beatles will play together in the future. Commentators have variously described \\"Early 1970\\" as \\"a rough draft of a peace treaty\\" and \\"a disarming open letter\\" from Starr to Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. Starr recorded the song, under its working title \\"When Four Nights Come to Town\\", in London in October 1970, midway through the sessions for Lennon's John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band album. The recording features musical contributions from Harrison and German bass player Klaus Voormann, and some Beatles biographers suggest that Lennon might have participated also.

The song's working title was variously \\"When I Come to Town (Four Nights in Moscow)\\"Madinger & Easter, p. 498. and \\"When Four Nights Come to Town\\", and the lyrics gauge Starr's relationships with his bandmates according to how likely each one was to play music with Starr in the future.Rodriguez, pp. 29‚Äì30.Clayson, p. 220. In the first verse, Starr addresses his strained relationship with McCartney, whose refusal to have his own debut solo album held back in Apple Records' release schedule, to allow for Sentimental Journey and the Beatles' Let It Be album,Clayson, p. 206. led to a confrontation between the two musicians.Doggett, pp. 120, 122. The incident took place at McCartney's St John's Wood home on 31 March 1970 and, according to Beatles biographer Peter Doggett, had a \\"grievous effect\\" on Starr and McCartney's friendship,Doggett, pp. 121‚Äì22. contributing to the latter announcing his departure from the band.Woffinden, pp. 32‚Äì33. In \\"Early 1970\\", Starr's lyrics refer to McCartney's domestic situation, on his Scottish property with wife Linda Eastman and their newborn daughter Mary:O'Dell, pp. 122‚Äì23. In verse two, Starr refers to Lennon and wife Yoko Ono's 1969 bed-ins for peace and, in the line \\"They screamed and they cried, now they're free\\", to their more recent experiences with Arthur Janov's primal therapy treatment. The latter experiences inspired the couple's 1970 solo albums, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band,Clayson, p. 217. both of which feature Starr on drums.Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 171, 183. He also screams the word \\"Cookies!\\" in a guttural manner, similar to Cookie Monster on Sesame Street. Lennon was known to love the Cookie Monster character and frequently would shout the word out of nowhere in a similar matter, including for the song \\"Hold On\\", which Starr played on.https://www.beatlesbible.com/people/john- lennon/songs/hold-on/ The verse ends with Starr's optimistic comment on Lennon: \\"And when he comes to town, I know he's gonna play with me.\\" In the third verse, Starr describes Harrison as \\"a long-haired, cross-legged guitar picker\\"Rodriguez, p. 29. whose \\"long-legged\\" wife, former model Pattie Boyd, is \\"in the garden picking daisies\\" for his vegetarian meals. Author Robert Rodriguez suggests that Harrison's workload following the September 1969 release of the Beatles' Abbey Road album displayed the same \\"workaholic tendencies\\" traditionally associated with McCartney,Rodriguez, p. 1. and a number of these projects involved Starr.Clayson, pp. 202‚Äì05. In contrast to McCartney and Lennon in \\"Early 1970\\", Starr views Harrison as \\"always in town playing for you with me\\", so much so that the guitarist spends little time at his recently purchased Friar Park estate. In the song's autobiographical final verse, Starr refers to his own musical shortcomings:Rodriguez, p. 30. He then concludes the song by declaring, \\"And when I go to town I wanna see all three\\" ‚Äì a statement that Woffinden takes as being an admission by Starr that he \\"clearly needed the support\\" of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison.Woffinden, p. 45. Musically, \\"Early 1970\\" is in the country music genre, which Starr explored more fully on his Beaucoups of Blues album,Spizer, pp. 287, 294. a project that arose from working with Nashville musician Pete Drake on Harrison's All Things Must Pass triple album in June 1970.Clayson, pp. 207‚Äì08. Recording Starr taped the basic track for the song, as \\"When I Come to Town (Four Knights in Moscow)\\", at Abbey Road Studios on 3 October 1970, during a lull in the sessions for John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band.Doggett, p. 145. In their book Eight Arms to Hold You, authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter note the difficulty in ascertaining reliable information on the song's recording; Spizer similarly cites \\"[f]ading memories\\" as a hindrance to identifying the precise line-up of musicians. Starr biographer Alan Clayson suggests that Lennon produced this initial session,Clayson, p. 218. while Doggett writes of Lennon merely participating in the recording, along with Starr and German bassist Klaus Voormann. According to Madinger and Scott Raile, writing in the 2015 book Lennonology, Lennon was at home with Ono and his son Julian at the time. Starr subsequently completed the track with Harrison, who finished his production of the drummer's \\"It Don't Come Easy\\" at this time. In addition to his drum part, Starr is thought to have played rhythm acoustic guitar on \\"Early 1970\\".Castleman & Podrazik, p. 210. According to Voormann's recollection, Starr overdubbed the opening dobro part and, in verse four, brief snatches of the various instruments on which he admits his musical limitations: the three guitar chords he names, a walking bass line, and a piano vamp following the third line of the verse. Harrison played rhythm and lead electric guitar, and a slide guitar part of which Madinger and Easter write: \\"George's distinctive slide solo after his 'section' of the song confirms his solidarity with Ringo, if nothing else.\\" Harrison also joined Starr on piano for the verse-four segment ‚Äì \\"hacking away at the top of the keys\\", in Spizer's words. Although American musician Gary Wright overdubbed piano on \\"It Don't Come Easy\\" that same month,Spizer, pp. 293‚Äì94. no one is credited for \\"Early 1970\\"'s main piano part. Allen Klein, the manager of Starr, Harrison and Lennon, suggested inviting McCartney to participate in the recording of the song, thinking that his involvement would undermine any legal moves McCartney might make to quit the Beatles.Doggett, p. 149. No such collaboration took place, and McCartney filed a suit in London's High Court on 31 December to dissolve the band's business partnership.Badman, p. 19. Release and reception Starr selected \\"Early 1970\\" as the B-side for his first solo single in the UK, the lead side of which was \\"It Don't Come Easy\\". The single was issued on Apple Records as R 5898, on 9 April 1971, with a US release following on 16 April (as Apple 1831).Castleman & Podrazik, p. 100. While noting the \\"instant self-esteem\\" that the single's commercial success brought Starr, Alan Clayson opines that \\"Early 1970\\" would have \\"gone in one ear and out the other\\" had it not been for the song's subject matter.Clayson, pp. 219‚Äì20. Peter Doggett writes of the track having been \\"a rough draft of a peace treaty\\" originally, yet its release took place amid the unpleasantness surrounding the Beatles' lawsuit, making \\"Early 1970\\" \\"seem like a false memory of a mythic past, its Arcadia tangled with weeds\\".Doggett, pp. 145, 163‚Äì64. Writing in 1973 ‚Äì by which time the four ex-Beatles had united against KleinRodriguez, p. 137. ‚Äì Alan Betrock of Phonograph Record reflected on the former bandmates' \\"backward glances\\" since the break-up, and opined: \\"Ringo's little-known B-side 'Early 1970' was probably the sharpest commentary on their whole lot.\\" Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). In a 1976 review for the NME, Bob Woffinden dismissed it as \\"a period curiosity, interesting at the time, but of little substance\\". Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Robert Rodriguez describes the song as \\"utterly charming\\" with \\"a delicious slide guitar part\\", and adds: \\"'Early 1970' was the perfect tonic for beleaguered Beatles fans wondering if the band would ever, if not get back together, at least achieve some civility.\\" Bruce Spizer similarly views the song as a \\"charming delight\\".Spizer, p. 298. =Re- releases= \\"Early 1970\\" received a second commercial release in November 1975, when included on Starr's Apple compilation Blast from Your Past.Madinger & Easter, p. 646. For the 1991 CD reissue of Ringo (1973), the original ten- song album was expanded with the addition of three bonus tracks,Madinger & Easter, pp. 507, 645. one of which was \\"Early 1970\\".

The planning and the unfolding conspiracy was inspired by the Iraqi Regional Branch's successful military coup. The coup was planned by the military committee, rather than the Ba'ath Party's civilian leadership, but Michel Aflaq, the leader of the party, consented to the conspiracy. The leading members of the military committee throughout the planning process and in the immediate aftermath of taking power were Muhammad Umran, Salah Jadid and Hafez al-Assad. The committee enlisted the support of two Nasserists, Rashid al-Qutayni and Muhammad al-Sufi, and the independent Ziad al-Hariri. The coup was originally planned for 7 March, but was postponed one day after the government discovered where the conspirators were planning to assemble. Background =Events leading up to the coup= Modern Syria was first established in 1920 as the Arab Kingdom of Syria under King Faisal. This state was planned to be a new Arab kingdom, and not just Syrian, and the state espoused Arab nationalism and pan-Islamic policies. However the British, who had helped establish the state after World War I, made a secret agreement with France and established the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. The area thereby functioned as one of France's colonies, and the newly established state was viewed unfavorably by most Syrians, with many of them regarding it as a vassal of European imperialism. At this stage, some movements tried to establish a Syrian identity, most notably the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, or became advocates of communism and Islamism. The majority of Syrians continued to see themselves as Arabs rather than Syrians. The mandate was feudal in character, and it rested on a semi-liberal oligarchic social base. This system remained unchanged until the establishment of the United Arab Republic (UAR). This system created a class society reflecting urban-rural living patterns. An estimated three thousand families owned half of the land in Syria. The middle class owned the majority of small to medium properties. Some two-thirds of peasants were landless. Agricultural revenues were highly skewed ‚Äì the top two percent of the population received 50 percent of the income, while the middle class (merchants or middle landowning groups), which was 18 percent of the population, earned 25 percent of agricultural revenues. The bottom 80 percent received the remainder. The landowner‚Äìpeasant alliance was based on class differences, and social antagonism between each other ‚Äì this would lead to the landowner's downfall. The mandate was dissolved in 1946 because of a British ultimatum to France, and Syria became an independent country on 17 April 1946. The same elite that had governed Syria during the mandate continued in power, and they ruled in the same manner. The failure in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War led to the downfall of the traditional elite and the rise of the military in politics. Husni al-Za'im became the first military dictator of Syria in 1949, but in 1950, military officer Adib Shishakli gained power behind the scenes, and by 1953 had established another military dictatorship. The military's introduction to the Syrian political scene destroyed the oligarchy enabling the middle class to participate in Syrian politics. However, while their powers were weakened, the traditional elite retained the majority of the wealth produced. It was in this environment that the ideology of Ba'athism came into being. The Arab Ba'ath Movement was established by Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Din al-Bitar in the 1940s, others who played a notable role in the early stages of the Ba'athist movement were Zaki al-Arsuzi, Wahib al-Ghanim and Jallal al-Sayyid. Akram al-Hawrani founded the Arab Socialist Party (ASP) in 1953 ‚Äì the Ba'ath Party was established through a merger of the ASP and the Arab Ba'ath Party. Of the 150 delegates to the founding congress of the Arab Ba'ath Party in 1947, the majority were either middle-class professionals or intellectuals. By the 1950s the party had managed to acquire an urban middle-class base. However, the Ba'ath Party was not a purely middle-class party, and from the very beginning, it sent party cadres to rural areas to recruit new members and form new party organisations. In 1956, the Ba'ath Party organized the first labour protest in Syrian history. While the Ba'ath Party was strong, its decision to recruit members from across society led to tribalism and clientelism within the party. Party leaders then opted to overlook democratic norms and procedures. The Ba'ath Party faced a significant dilemma: take power through competitive elections or forceful takeover. Even the liberal and democratic-inclined founding leaders were partial to forceful takeover, citing the corrupt electoral process. Before taking control, the Ba'ath Party gambled that it would be allowed to share power with Gamal Abdel Nasser in the United Arab Republic (UAR). The UAR would prove to be Egypt-dominated, and the Ba'ath Party was forced to dissolve itself, but in 1961 the UAR collapsed because of a military coup in Syria. The establishment and the dissolution of the UAR was a catastrophe for the Ba'ath Party as it divided among those who supported the UAR, those who opposed it and those who opposed or supported the traditional leaders of the party. In 1962, Aflaq convened a Ba'ath Party congress and re-established the party. Several branches had not followed orders and had not dissolved during the UAR years. Instead, they had become deeply hostile to pan-Arabist thought and had become radical socialists instead. The military committee, which would launch the 8 March Revolution, shared most of their views. =Economic and social context= Syrian society was feudal in nature, and was dominated by landlords and peasants The 8 March Revolution has often been viewed as a mere military coup, but it had many of the ingredients of national revolts from below. The revolution was led by an anti-oligarchical alliance of a radicalised lower middle class, strategic members of the officer corps, marginalised minorities and a significant number of peasants who were mobilised for agrarian conflict. In an international context, the revolution took place because the state boundaries established by France were artificial and the hostility within the newly established Syria to the creation of Israel. The traditional elite that took power in Syria when the country gained independence had come to power during the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. The external imposition of arbitrary state boundaries on Syria with no corresponding popular acceptance led to discontent. The national struggle was shaped by ideologies such as Arab nationalism, pan-Islamism and Greater Syrianism. The plebeian character of the struggle and the radical ideologies spawned radical solutions to the agrarian problem. The growth of the new middle class in Syria fueled discontent since the traditional elite dominated the agrarian sector ‚Äì the largest sector of the economy ‚Äì and created most of the wealth. The new middle class consisted of capitalists and entrepreneurs who opposed the traditional elite ‚Äì the monopolisation of power by the traditional elite led to the radicalisation of the new middle-class. The military, which in many countries is conservative and elitist, became radicalised in Syria because the military wanted greater power, believing that the traditional elite was unable to defend the country. A significant group of military personnel were recruited from the new middle class or the hinterlands. In Syria, ethnic minorities were often underprivileged, and a specific ethnicity usually belonged to a specific social class. The Alawites, the Druzes and the Isma'ilis for instance, were ethnic groups with low social class who began to embrace a radical form of Arab nationalism, e.g. Ba'athism. Without the peasantry there could not have been a Ba'athist revolution in Syria. The new middle class alone could only produce instability, but together with the peasantry, the revolution became possible. The inequality between urban and rural dwellers, together with capitalist penetration of the agrarian sector and the traditional elites' monopolisation of most large revenue sources, led to the establishment of peasant movements who fought for change or opposed the system. The Syrian branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party was able to recruit youth from radical peasant movements and thus was able to mobilise large sectors of the population. Planning In 1962, the military committee of the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party spent most of its time planning to take power through a conventional military coup. The military committee decided it had to capture al-Kiswah and Qatana, two military camps, seize control of the 70th Armoured Brigade at al-Kiswah, the Military Academy in the city of Homs and the Damascus radio station. While the conspirators of the military committee were all young, the sitting regime had been slowly disintegrating and the traditional elite had lost effective political power. For the coup to be successful, the military committee needed to gain the support of some of the Syrian officer corps. The collapse of the UAR, coupled with mutinies, purges and transfers left the officer corps in complete disarray and open to anti-government agitation. At the time, the officer corps was split into five different factions; the Damascus faction which supported the Syrian Government, supporters of Akram al-Hawrani, a Nasserist faction, a Ba'athist faction and a group of independents. The Damascus faction was the enemy of the military committee because of their support for Nazim al-Kudsi's Government and the Hawranist were considered as rivals because of their stance against pan-Arabism. The Nasserists became allies of the Ba'ath, even while they supported Gamal Abdel Nasser and the reestablishment of the UAR. The military committee's alliance with the Nasserists led to the establishment of secret contact with Colonel Rashid al-Qutayni, the head of the military intelligence, and Colonel Muhammad al-Sufi, the commander of the Homs Brigade. The military committee ordered a group of junior officers to recruit the leading independent Colonel Ziad al-Hariri, the commander of the front facing Israel, to their cause. The group was successful, and they promised al-Hariri that \\"If we succeed, you can become chief of staff. If we fail, you can disown us.\\" Al-Hariri supported the committee because Khalid al-Azm, the Prime Minister of Syria, was planning to demote him. While it planned the coup, the military committee and its members were frowned upon by civilian Ba'athists. The reason for the army‚Äìparty alliance in the first place was to safeguard the party from repression. The military committee did not look favourably on the civilian leadership led by Michel Aflaq, objecting to his dissolution of the Ba'ath Party during the UAR years. While Aflaq needed the military committee to seize power, the committee needed Aflaq to hold on power ‚Äì without Aflaq they would have no support base. At the 5th National Ba'ath Party Congress, held on 8 May 1962, it was decided to reestablish the party and keep Aflaq as Secretary General of the National Command. Muhammad Umran, a leading member of the military committee, was a delegate at the 5th National Congress, and told Aflaq of the military committee's intentions ‚Äì Aflaq consented to the coup, but no agreement was made between him and the committee on how to share power after the coup. The coup Aflaq, the leader of the party's civilian-wing, and Jadid, a senior figure in the planning of the coup d'√©tat On 8 February 1963, the Iraqi Regional Branch, led by Ali Salih al-Sa'di, took power in Iraq by overthrowing Abd al-Karim Qasim. He was a far more formidable opponent than al-Kudsi, and the Iraqi Regional Branch managed to take power through an alliance not only with military officers, but also with segments of the middle class. Qasim's downfall changed the rules of Arab politics ‚Äì the Nasserists had monopolised the Arab nationalist movement since the UAR, but the takeover made the Ba'ath Party a force to be reckoned with. In contrast to the Iraqi regional branch, the Syrian regional branch did not have mass support or a significant support base in the middle class. While Aflaq cautioned the plotters because of the party's lack of support, they failed to share his worries, and planned to launch the coup on 7 March. However, that day the military intelligence raided the apartment where the plotters were planning to assemble. Assad was given the task of reporting to other units that the coup had been postponed to 8 March. On the night of 7‚Äì8 March, tanks and units loyal to the conspiracy began moving on Damascus. Al-Hariri led a brigade from the Syrian front towards Israel, while Ba'athists were able to gain control of a second brigade stationed in Suwayda. Caught in a pincer movement, the commander of the 70th Armoured Brigade, Lieutenant General Abd al-Karim surrendered to the plotters ‚Äì Umran took over as acting commander of the 70th Armoured Brigade. The potentially hostile unit stationed in Qatana, south-west of Damascus, did not intervene ‚Äì probably because Widad Bashir had taken control over communications in the Damascus area. With the forces in al-Kiswah defeated and Qatana neutralised, al-Hariri's forces marched upon Damascus and began to set up road-blocks in the city, while at the same time seizing critical facilities such as the central post office. Captain Salim Hatum, a party officer, seized the radio station. The Ministry of Defence headquarters were seized without a fight, and General Zahr al-Din, the commander-in-chief, was put under arrest. Both al-Kudsi and al-Hawrani were easily tracked down and arrested. Salah Jadid bicycled into the city that morning, and captured the Bureau of Officers' Affairs, which later became his personal fiefdom. Assad led a small group of conspirators to capture the al-Dumayr air base, north-east of Damascus ‚Äì the only unit that resisted the coup. Some of its planes had been ordered to bomb rebel positions. The plan was that Assad would lead a company from al-Hariri's brigade to capture the air base before dawn to prevent air strikes. The surrender of the 70th Armoured Brigade took longer than expected, putting Assad's forces behind schedule. When Assad's forces reached the outskirts of the base, it was broad daylight. Assad sent an emissary to tell the commanders that he would start shelling the base if they did not surrender. They negotiated their surrender even though, according to Assad himself, their forces could have defeated his rebel company in combat. Later that morning, the coupmakers convened at the army headquarters to celebrate. 820 people were reported killed during the takeover and another 20 were executed shortly afterwards. The coup was met by indifference in the population at large. Saber Falhout, a Druze who was later known as \\"the poet of the revolution\\", wrote and announced the first communique of the plotters. The ninth communique reinstated the five members of the military committee in the armed forces. The senior members of the newly established regime were Umran, Jadid and at last, Assad. Immediate aftermath The Syrian Regional Branch has ruled the country uninterrupted since 8 March 1963 The first act of the new rulers of Syria was to establish the twenty-man National Council for the Revolutionary Command (NCRC), composed of twelve Ba'athists and eight Nasserists and independents. On 9 March, the NCRC ordered Salah al-Din al- Bitar, one of the Ba'ath Party founders, to form a government, and to implement the policies of the NCRC. Later, six civilians were given membership in NCRC, three Ba'athists (Aflaq, al-Bitar and Mansur al-Atrash) and three Nasserists. However, this did not change the balance of power, and the officers still controlled the country. From the beginning, the military committee members formed state policies behind the backs of other NCRC members ‚Äì when the civilian leadership found out, al-Atrash said: \\"Why do not these gentlemen speak? May I suggest they appoint a liaison officer to communicate their views to us?\\" From that day, Umran gave the civilians a faint idea of what the committee members were planning. At the beginning, there were no signs of the quarrels that would destroy the military committee. At the time, the members were bound together by their goal of building a prosperous nation. On 9 March the NCRC released Lu'ay al-Atassi from jail, promoted him to the rank of lieutenant general, appointed him commander-in-chief and NCRC chairman, the de facto head of state. Hariri was appointed chief of staff. While Atassi and Hariri held powerful posts, they did not possess enough personal or political power to threaten the NCRC. The Nasserist officers were also given notable offices with Muhammad al-Sufi becoming Minister of Defence and Rashid al-Qutayni becoming deputy chief of staff. However, the Military Committee, which had expanded its membership with five new members, ensured that the Ba'athists controlled the real levers of powers. The committee decided state policies before the sessions of the NCRC, and by doing so became the real seat of power. Umran was first given the command of the 5th Brigade in Homs, but was promoted in June to become commander of the 70th Armoured Brigade. As head of the Bureau of Officers' Affairs, Jadid appointed friends to senior positions, purged his enemies and appointed several Ba'athists to senior positions. Ahmad Suwaydani, one of the new members of the Military Committee, was appointed Head of Military Intelligence and Mazyad Hunaydi became Head of the Military Police. The Military Academy at Homs was put under Ba'athist control‚Äîseveral hundred Ba'athists, including Assad's brother Rifaat al-Assad, were given a crash course in military teaching before being given command. Assad became the de facto head of the Syrian Air Force, a dizzying promotion for a man in his thirties. Considering that the members of the Military Committee were all too young to be perceived as the real leaders of Syria by the populace, the Military Committee appointed Colonel Amin al-Hafiz to the post of Minister of the Interior. =Purges and failed coup of 18 July= Tripartite unity talks among Iraqi Prime Minister Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr (left), Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser (center) and Syrian President Lu'ay al-Atassi (right), 16 April 1963. Relations between Nasser and the Syrian Ba'athists deteriorated weeks later after the purge of Nasserists from the officer corps and Alwan's failed coup. Atassi resigned following the events. Pressure from consistent pro-Nasser demonstrations in northern Syria and Damascus and from pro-union Ba'athist leaders like Jamal al-Atassi, the Nasserists and the Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM), coupled with the weakness of the Ba'athists at the popular level in Syria, led to unification efforts between the new government and the governments of Egypt and Iraq. The latter's anti-UAR government had also been overthrown by pro-UAR officers in 1963. On 17 April a new stage-based unity agreement was reached that would include the three states in a federal union with Nasser as President and Commander-in- Chief of the Armed Forces.Rabinovich, pp. 65‚Äì67. However, between 28 April-2 May, the Ba'athist-dominated Military Committee virtually renounced the agreement when it purged over 50 Nasserist officers from their high-ranking positions in the armed forces, leading to a wide-scale propaganda campaign by Egypt via radio denouncing the Ba'ath (Nasserist-leaning newspapers had been previously shut down.) Mass pro-union rioting in Aleppo, Damascus, Hama and other parts of the country followed. The purges prompted the protest resignations of Nasserist officials, including Defense Minister al-Sufi, Deputy Chief of Staff al-Qutayni, and four other Nasserist cabinet members. Jassem Alwan being tried in a Damascus military court for his failed coup attempt against the Syrian Ba'ath, 1963 Later, on 19 June, Chief of Staff al- Hariri led a high-ranking delegation that included Prime Minister al-Bitar, Aflaq and Education Minister Sami Droubi to Algeria for a state visit. While al-Hariri was away, the Committee used the opportunity to undertake a purge of about 30 elite officers‚Äîmostly political independents‚Äîunder al-Hariri's command. Al-Hariri was ordered to take a direct flight to the Syrian embassy in the United States, where he was reassigned as the embassy's military attache. Instead, he returned to Syria via a flight to Beirut on 23 June to protest the Committee's move against him. Unsuccessful, he left the country for France in a self-imposed exile on 8 July. The Committee's virtual ousting of al-Hariri was to the chagrin of al-Bitar, who viewed al-Hariri as the last military counterweight able to check the Committee's domination over his government. The Nasserists still maintained a relatively high level of strength in the military, despite the purges, and on 18 July, under the leadership of Jassem Alwan and the help of Egyptian intelligence, they attempted to launch a daytime coup against the new government. The Army Headquarters, personally defended by al-Hafiz, and the broadcast station were attacked, and the ensuing battle left hundreds of people dead, including several civilian bystanders. The coup attempt failed and 27 participating officers were arrested and executed. The executions were a rare punitive action used to deal with the participants of a failed coup in Syria, with the typical punishment being exile, imprisonment or reassignment to a foreign diplomatic post. President Lu'ay al-Atassi subsequently resigned, signalling his disapproval of the executions. After evading the authorities for a short period, Alwan and his chief co-conspirators Raef al-Maarri and Muhammad Nabhan were apprehended and brought to military trial, where they were found guilty of treason and sentenced to death.Chronology of Arab Politics. 1.

The failure of Alwan's revolt marked the end of significant Nasserist influence in Syria's military and civilian institutions, and with the pro- Nasser forces largely defeated, the Military Committee became the sole power center of the country. Relations with Egypt immediately soured, with Nasser, still popular with the Syrian masses, issuing broadcasts denouncing the Ba'athists as \\"murderers\\" and \\"fascists\\", and representing the forces of heresy and atheism, a derogatory reference to the party's embrace of strict secularism and the numerous leadership positions held by non-Sunni Muslims. Nasser also announced his withdrawal from the 17 April unity agreement.

Josef Popper was born in the Jewish quarter in Kolin, Austrian Bohemia (now Kol√≠n, Czech Republic). He was the uncle of Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper. Early life Josef was born to an impoverished Jewish family of tradespeople who placed a high value on education. After a highly religious early education he was sent to the German Polytechnikum Prague. Four years later he started at the Imperial Polytechnikum, Vienna, to study Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy. However, despite doing well, the Concordat of 1855 enabled the Vatican to impose restrictions to Jews, and so he could only support himself by taking on low paid menial work. Inventions After graduating from the Vienna Polytechnikum, Popper-Lynkeus worked for two years as an engineer in a private firm. From 1862 ‚Äì 1866, he tutored and occasionally lectured, and from 1867  1897, he privately pursued various inventions. In 1868, he contrived a system of gaskets to prevent the buildup of scale on the inner walls of steam boilers. This and some other inventions prepared the ground for his work in engineering, physics, and social and moral philosophy ‚Äì independently of establishment and closed academic groups. Ideas Popper-Lynkeus's ideas were innovative for his time. In engineering, he thought of the possibility of electric power transmission, the conversion of mechanical energy of waterfalls and rising tides into electrical power (1862). In physics, he thought of the mass-energy relation (1883) and the idea of a quantum of energy (1884), the principle of unavoidable distortion of the parameters of objects under investigation by measuring instruments. In psychology, he thought of the interpretations of dreams based on analysis of the conflict between the social consciousness of an individual and his or her animal instincts (short story Dreaming like Waking, 1889). Several years before Theodor Herzl, in the work Prince Bismarck and anti-Semitism (1886), Popper-Lynkeus came to the conclusion that the Jews could be saved from anti-Semitism only if they possessed their own state. He considered creation of such a state an urgent need, and that the type of regime in the beginning did not matter, that even a monarchy would be satisfactory. The aforementioned short story was included in the collection of philosophical stories under the common title Fantasies of a Realist, which was published in 1899 and ran through twenty editions. Since then, Popper-Lynkeus used the pseudonym Lynkeus ‚Äì after the keen-sighted watchman from the Argonaut's ship, appearing also in Goethe's Faust. Three of the many ideas Popper-Lynkeus suggested in this collection were: * Influence of marching music on the masses; * On the expediency of some punishments; * On the right of every individual to exist. Popper-Lynkeus mentions the great power that music has over the masses. He stated that marching music often serves as a support of tyranny, transforming the masses into a paste anything can be made from. This idea of Popper-Lynkeus is similar to an idea of Leo Tolstoy, who said, \\"Those who want to have more slaves should compose more marching music.\\" In the sphere of justice, Popper-Lynkeus maintained that publicity should be the main punishment for committing a crime, and only recidivists should be isolated. According to Popper-Lynkeus, the right to exist is the primary and natural right of any human being, and for this reason, the state should not be allowed to send an individual to death without his or her consent. He was an advocate of compulsory military service, but provided that only volunteers would be sent to battlefields. Social system Popper-Lynkeus designed his own social system, which ensures that all individuals are provided with goods of primary necessity, and explains it in a series of works beginning from The Right to Live and the Duty to Die (1878) and ending with The Universal Civil Service as a Solution of a Social Problem (1912). According to Popper-Lynkeus, society has a duty to provide its members with goods of prime necessity ‚Äì food, clothes, and housing ‚Äì and also with the services of prime necessity ‚Äì public health care, upbringing, and education. However, every healthy society member in the framework of labor service would participate in activities that do not require higher or secondary special education and that are related to the creation of material foundations of national economy (e.g. mining, forest exploitation, farm work, construction work). He or she would also be engaged in the manufacturing of goods and providing basic services. In Popper-Lynkeus's opinion, a just human society would arise not as a result of a violent social upheaval, but as an outcome of the process of persuasion and common consensus. In this society, every individual in the course of his or her life would go through four social-age stages (the third stage out of them may be omitted): 1) educational (up to age 18); 2) natural-economic (men up to 30 years, women up to 25); 3) financial- economic; 4) pension. Every society member would define the boundary between the last two stages at his or her own discretion. During the second of these stages, all healthy society members take part in labor service and on this ground become entitled to obtain basic necessities in the course of their entire life free of charge. At the third stage, those society members who wish to work may be involved in the financial and economic activity in one of the state or private sectors (in the latter case either as hired employees or as free entrepreneurs). They receive payment for their labor, and this enables them to purchase goods and get access to non-basic services. During the last two of the aforementioned social-age stages, any individual is free. This cannot be said of the first two stages, when people earn their freedom and grow up to become fully aware of it. As Popper-Lynkeus remarked, with scientific and technological advancement, the duration of the second stage would gradually decrease. Simultaneously, the scope of the concept goods and services of primary necessity would expand. Among the conditions for creating a social system, according to Popper-Lynkeus, is the necessity to foster in the rising generation on the first social-age stage such traits as love and respect to other people, love to work and aversion to false needs, and habits of rational use of leisure time. Influence Among the admirers of Popper- Lynkeus were physicists Albert Einstein and Ernst Mach; philosophers Martin Buber and Hugo Bergman; chemist Wilhelm Ostwald; mathematician Richard von Mises; statistician Karl Ballod (KƒÅrlis Balodis); physiologist Theodor Baer; psychologist Sigmund Freud; writers Max Brod, Stefan Zweig, and Arthur Schnitzler; and the founder of the Zionist Revisionist movement, Ze'ev Jabotinsky. Jabotinsky pointed out at the five constituents of the Popper- Lynkeus minimal program, Food, clothes, housing, health services, and education. Calling lack of any of these factors a \\"hole,\\" he said, \\"Human society is similar to the kindergarten. In the kindergarten there are five holes, according to these five constituents. The children playing in the kindergarten are in danger of falling into one of them. What does the Prussian guard do? He erects shields with such inscriptions as 'Do not go to the right!' or 'Do not go to the left!' Following Popper-Lynkeus, I propose to cover up all these holes and give the children opportunity to play freely as they want.\\" On 21 February 1918, on the 80th anniversary of Josef Popper- Lynkeus birth, his followers, physician and psychologist Fritz Wittels and writer Walter Markus, established the organization Universal Food Service in Vienna. For several years, this organization published a bulletin under the same name. It functioned for 20 years and was disbanded at the time of the annexation of Austria into Germany. Josef Popper-Lynkeus died on 22 December 1921. In recognition of his merits and accomplishments, the street in Vienna where he lived during the last years of his life was named after him. On the evening of the 150th anniversary of Josef Popper's birth, a fund for researching his thought and propagation of his ideas was established at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main. In July 2007, the Tel- Aviv‚ÄìJaffa municipality decided to name one of the streets in Jaffa after Popper-Lynkeus.

In sociology, authority is the legitimate power which one person or a group possesses and practices over another. The element of legitimacy is vital to the notion of authority and is the main means by which authority is distinguished from the more general concept of power. Power can be exerted by the use of force or violence. Authority, by contrast, depends on the acceptance by subordinates of the right of those above them to give them orders or directives.Anthony Giddens, Sociology. London: Polity Press, 1997:581Max Weber in \\"Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society: New Translations for the 21st Century\\", translated and edited by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters. pp. 137-138. Types The types of political authority were first defined by Max Weber in his essay \\"Politics as a Vocation\\" and his other writings in 1919-1920. In this essay he emphasized that the political authority that controlled the state can be composed of the following types of authority, or what is called in German, Herrschaft.Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, Palgrave Books 2015, pp. 137-138 Traditional authority: Power legitimized by respect for long-established cultural patterns. Charismatic authority: Power legitimized by extraordinary personal abilities that inspire devotion and obedience. Rational-legal authority: Also known as bureaucratic authority, is when power is legitimized by legally enacted rules and regulations such as governments. Max Weber on authority Max Weber, in his sociological and philosophical work, identified and distinguished three types of legitimate domination (Herrschaft in German, which generally means 'domination' or 'rule'), that have sometimes been rendered in English translation as types of authority, because domination is not seen as a political concept in the first place. Weber defined domination (authority) as the chance of commands being obeyed by a specifiable group of people. Legitimate authority is that which is recognized as legitimate and justified by both the ruler and the ruled. Legitimated rule results in what Weber called the monopoly over the use of coercive violence in a given territory.Max Weber in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, translated and edited by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, Palgrave Books 2015, pp. 136 In the modern world, such authority is typically delegated to police and the court system. Weber divided legitimate authority into three types: *The first type discussed by Weber is legal-rational authority. It is that form of authority which depends for its legitimacy on formal rules and established laws of the state, which are usually written down and are often very complex. The power of the rational-legal authority is mentioned in the constitution. Modern societies depend on legal-rational authority. Government officials are the best example of this form of authority, which is prevalent all over the world. *The second type of authority, traditional authority, derives from long- established customs, habits and social structures. When power passes from one generation to another, it is known as traditional authority. The rule of hereditary monarchs furnishes an obvious example. The Tudor dynasty in England and the ruling families of Mewar in Rajasthan (India) are some examples of traditional authority. * The third form of authority is charismatic authority. Here, the charisma of the individual or the leader plays an important role. Charismatic authority is that authority which is derived from the leader's claims to a higher power or inspiration that is supported by his or her followers. Examples in this regard can be NT Rama Rao, a matinee idol, who went on to become one of the most powerful Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh. History has witnessed several social movements or revolutions against a system of traditional or legal-rational authority started by Charismatic authorities. According to Weber, what distinguishes authority from coercion, force and power on the one hand, and leadership, persuasion and influence on the other hand, is legitimacy. Superiors, he states, feel that they have a right to issue commands; subordinates perceive an obligation to obey. Social scientists agree that authority is but one of several resources available to incumbents in formal positions. For example, a Head of State is dependent upon a similar nesting of authority. His legitimacy must be acknowledged, not just by citizens, but by those who control other valued resources: his immediate staff, his cabinet, military leaders and in the long run, the administration and political apparatus of the entire society. Authority can be created expressly when public entities act publicly, using the same means to communicate the grant of authority to their agents that they use to communicate this to third parties, apparent authority describes the situation when a principal has placed restrictions on an agent that are not known to a third party, and restrictions on government agents are accomplished in the open, through laws and regulations. In this setting, all parties concerned is assumed or supposed to know the laws and regulations of government. Recently the concept of authority has also been discussed as a guiding principle in human-machine interaction design.Flemisch, F., Heesen, M., Hesse, T., Kelsch, J., Schieben, A., & Beller, J. (2011). Towards a Dynamic Balance between Humans and Automation: Authority, Ability, Responsibility and Control in Cooperative Control Situations. Cognition, Technology and Work. Advance online publication. d oi: 10.1007/s10111-011-0191-6  Children and the Three Authority Attributes  Authority and its attributes have been identified as of particular relevance to children as they regard their parents and teachers. The three attributes of authority have been described as status, specialist skills or knowledge, and social position. Children consider the type of command, the characteristics of the authority figure, and the social context when making authority conclusions.Laupa, 1991. Although children regard these three types of authority attributes, they first assess the legitimacy of the authority figure in question using the nature of the commands they give. For example, a teacher that does not appear to have legitimate power from the child‚Äôs perspective (perhaps because she or he cannot control the class well) will not be obeyed. Regarding parenting, authoritative parents who are warm and high in behavioral control but low in psychological control are more likely to be seen as having legitimate authority by the child, and will believe themselves that they have a duty to obey them and internalize their values.Darling, Cumsille & Mart√≠nez, 2008.

It is located in the upper Florida Keys on the island of Upper Matecumbe Key. Geography It is located at , its elevation .Matecumbe, FL Community Profile Matecumbe consists of two islands (keys), Upper Matecumbe Key and Lower Matecumbe Key. The latter is where the settlement of Matecumbe is located, just south of Matecumbe Bight and adjacent to and just north of Matecumbe Harbor. The settlement was the location of one of the stations of the Overseas Railroad. The name Matecumbe refers to a region of area in the Upper Keys. It is the only place name in South Florida which dates from the 16th century and still designates the same or approximate location. The name appears frequently on Spanish maps, as it did in their records. The exact meaning of the name is unknown, but the suggestion that it was derived from the Spanish mata hombre is a weak one. When the term Matecumbe first appeared in use it was in a form very close to its present spelling and pronunciation. As was often the case in Florida, the name was applied interchangeably to the chief and to the tribe. This was one of the first of the Upper Keys to be permanently settled. Early homesteaders were so successful at growing pineapples in the rocky soil that at one time the island yielded the country's largest annual crop. However, foreign competition and the hurricane of 1935 killed the industry. Today, life centers on fishing and tourism, and the island is filled with bait shops, marinas, and charter- fishing boats. Pulitzer Prize-winning author James A. Michener was in his sixties when he began traveling frequently to the Florida Keys. One result of those visits was the novel Matecumbe.

Buddy Cage Interview at American Music Belgium, March 23, 2002 Great Speckled Bird was part of the Festival Express concert tour in 1970.Buddy Cage Interview at IGN Music, July 22, 2004 From 1969 to 1972, Cage also recorded four albums with Anne Murray, and one album with Brewer & Shipley. It was on the Festival Express tour that the New Riders of the Purple Sage became acquainted with Cage. The New Riders were a psychedelic influenced country rock band that had been founded by Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead, along with John Dawson and David Nelson. The New Riders and the Dead would perform concerts together, with Garcia playing pedal steel for the New Riders, then playing electric guitar and singing with the Dead. After the Festival Express Tour, Cage left Great Speckled Bird and joined the group Hog Heaven, who had for years backed singer Tommy James as the Shondells. (He co-wrote one song on the group's album for Roulette Records.) Near the end of 1971, Jerry Garcia left the New Riders, enabling them to headline their own concert tours. Cage was invited to join the band as Garcia's replacement. Cage was the New Riders' pedal steel guitar player from 1971 to 1982, except for a period of about a year in the late 1970s. The New Riders were quite popular. They toured extensively, and released a number of albums. During this same period Cage continued working as a session musician, recording with various musical artists, including David Bromberg and Robert Hunter. In 1974, Bob Dylan asked him to play on recording sessions for the album Blood on the Tracks. In the years after Cage's departure from the New Riders, he continued working with many different bands and musicians, including Solar Circus, Stir Fried, The Brooklyn Cowboys, the Zen Tricksters, Mike Gordon, Midnight Rain and Bone Alley. The New Riders of the Purple Sage, led by John Dawson, but without Buddy Cage or David Nelson, had continued touring and recording albums from 1982 until Dawson's retirement from the music business in 1997. In 2005, Cage and Nelson re-formed the New Riders of the Purple Sage.Greenhaus, Mike. \\"Buddy Cage and the New Riders Ride Again\\" , jambands.com, June 23, 2006Dembinsky, Ryan (June 12, 2009). \\"Interview: Buddy Cage of the New Riders\\", Glide Magazine.

History  This type of locomotive was the first newly developed diesel locomotive built for main line service by the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB). Only 10 examples of the class were built at the beginning of the 1950s, but it formed the basis for all subsequent DB designs in this sector. The locomotives were initially distributed to the locomotive depots (Bahnbetriebswerke) at Frankfurt am Main and Bamberg. In Frankfurt/Main they were used on suburban services from Frankfurt/Main Hbf to Bad Homburg v.d.H√∂he and to Kronberg and also hauled fast-stopping trains (Eilz√ºge) between Frankfurt/Main and Cologne. The Bamberg engines were used on Nuremberg‚Äôs suburban services and on various branch lines around Bamberg. From 1963 all the locos were gathered together at Bamberg and took over passenger and goods train duties on many branch lines in northern Bavaria. The demise of branch lines in the 1970s meant that the DB could get rid of this small class of just 10 engines between 1976 and 1978, because sufficient locomotives of the comparable Class V 100 were available.  Design  A classic feature of these engines was the driver's cab in the centre of the vehicle which could be used in both directions and which jutted out above the engine rooms. In the basic design the V 80 had elements, that were also used on all succeeding diesel locomotive classes: a diesel engine that ran at medium-speed, hydraulic gears, power transmission via the centre axle by means of universal joints. Originally three different motors were fitted with 800 to 1000 PS; later 1,100 PS MTU motors were installed. All were supercharged V12 four-stroke diesel engines.  Italy  Remains of several of the burnt out locos in the museum's locomotive shed, the V80 at the back After being withdrawn in Germany, the locomotives of Class 280 were largely sold to private railways and to track construction firms in Italy. In 1959, Officine Meccaniche Italiane built a prototype diesel-hydraulic locomotive for Consorzio Cooperativo Ferrovie Reggiane. This lone prototype, , later sold to Ferrovie del Sud Est had a similar aspect but shared no common parts.  Preserved  One example, no. V 80 002, which the DB kept as a museum piece, was a victim of the big fire at the Nuremberg Transport Museum on 17 October 2005. Since mid-October 2005 the first V 80 built by Krauss-Maffei has returned to Germany. No. V 80 001 was bought from a collector, who also owned the museum locomotive 212 203, and transferred from Italy back to Germany. It is intended to carry out a refurbishment of the locomotive as quickly as possible, so it can be made available as a museum locomotive. As a replacement for V 80 002 which was burnt out in 2005 the DB Museum was given the last V 80 to be built, no. V 80 005, in June 2008 by its Italian owner in exchange for a Class 216 locomotive.

The painting loosely depicts events narrated in canto eight of Dante's Inferno; a leaden, smoky mist and the blazing City of the Dead form the backdrop against which the poet Dante fearfully endures his crossing of the River Styx. As his barque ploughs through waters heaving with tormented souls, Dante is steadied by Virgil, the learned poet of Classical antiquity. Pictorially, the arrangement of a group of central, upright figures, and the rational arrangement of subsidiary figures in studied poses, all in horizontal planes, complies with the tenets of the cool and reflective Neo-Classicism that had dominated French painting for nearly four decades. The Barque of Dante was completed for the opening of the Salon of 1822, and currently hangs in the Mus√©e du Louvre, Paris.  Themes  G√©ricault's The Raft of the Medusa was a powerful influence for Delacroix. The Barque of Dante was an artistically ambitious work, and although the composition is conventional, the painting in some important respects broke unmistakably free of the French Neo-Classical tradition. The smoke to the rear and the fierce movement of the garment in which the oarsman Phlegyas is wrapped indicate a strong wind, and most of the individuals in the painting are facing into it. The river is choppy and the boat is lifted to the right, a point at which it is twisted toward the viewer. The party is driven to a destination known to be yet more inhospitable, by an oarsman whose sure- footed poise in the storm suggests his familiarity with these wild conditions. The city behind is a gigantic furnace. There is neither comfort nor a place of refuge in the painting's world of rage, insanity and despair. Charles Le Brun's, La Col√®re of 1668. The painting explores the psychological states of the individuals it depicts, and uses compact, dramatic contrasts to highlight their different responses to their respective predicaments. Virgil's detachment from the tumult surrounding him, and his concern for Dante's well- being, is an obvious counterpoint to the latter's fear, anxiety, and physical state of imbalance. The damned are either rapt in a piercing concentration upon some mad and gainless task, or are else apparently in a state of total helplessness and loss. Their lining of the boat takes an up-and-down wave-like form, echoing the choppy water and making the foot of the painting a region of perilous instability. The souls to the far left and right are like grotesque bookends, enclosing the action and adding a claustrophobic touch to the whole. Delacroix wrote that his best painting of a head in this picture is that of the soul reaching with his forearm from the far side into the boat. Both Charles Le Brun's, La Col√®re of 1668, and John Flaxman's line engraving The Fiery Sepulchres, appearing as plate 11 in The Divine Poem of Dante Alighieri, 1807, are likely sources for this head. The theatrical display of bold colours in the figures at the centre of the composition is striking. The red of Dante's cowl resonates alarmingly with the fired mass behind him, and vividly contrasts with the billowing blue about Phlegyas. The author Charles Blanc noted the white linen on Virgil's mantle, describing it as a 'great wake up in the middle of the dark, a flash in the tempest'.Charles Blanc, 'Grammaire des arts du dessin', GBA, xx (1866). Page 382. Adolphe Lo√®ve-Veimars commented on the contrast between the colours used in Dante's head, and in the depiction of the damned, concluding that all this 'leaves the soul with I know not what fell impression'.Adolphe de Lo√´ve Veimars, 'Salon de 1822', Album, June 10, 1822. Page 262.  Water drops on the damned  Juxtaposed white, green, yellow and red pigments. The drops of water running down the bodies of the damned are painted in a manner seldom seen up to and including the early nineteenth century. Four different, unmixed pigments, in discretely applied quantities comprise the image of one drop and its shadow. White is used for highlighting, strokes of yellow and green respectively denote the length of the drop, and the shadow is red. Delacroix's pupil and chief assistant of over a decade, Pierre Andrieu, recorded that Delacroix had told him the inspiration for these drops had come in part from the water drops visible on the nereids in Rubens' The Landing of Marie de' Medici at Marseilles, and that the drops on The Barque of Dante were Delacroix's point of departure as a colourist. Lee Johnson discussing these drops comments that \\"the analytical principle [Delacroix] applies of dividing into pure coloured components an object that to the average eye would appear monochrome or colourless, is of far-reaching significance for the future.\\"Delacroix, Lee Johnson, W.W.Norton & Company, Inc., New York, 1963. Pages 18, 19.  Background  Head of a creature seizing the vessel In a letter to his sister, Madame Henriette de Verninac, written in 1821, Delacroix speaks of his desire to paint for the Salon the following year, and to 'gain a little recognition'. In April 1822 he wrote to his friend Charles Soulier that he had been working hard and non-stop for two and a half months to precisely that end. The Salon opened on April 24, 1822 and Delacroix's painting was exhibited under the title Dante et Virgile conduits par Phl√©gias, traversent le lac qui entoure les murailles de la ville infernale de Dit√©. The intense labour that was required to complete this painting in time left Delacroix weak and in need of recuperation. Critics expressed a range of opinions about The Barque of Dante. One of the judges at the Salon, √âtienne-Jean Del√©cluze, was uncomplimentary, calling the work 'a real daub' (une vraie tartouillade). Another judge, Antoine-Jean Gros, thought highly of it, describing it a 'chastened Rubens'. An anonymous reviewer in Le Miroir expected Delacroix to become a 'distinguished colourist'. One particularly favourable piece of criticism from up-and-coming lawyer Adolphe Thiers received wide circulation in the liberal periodical Le Constitutionnel. Dante et Virgile aux Enfers D'Eug√®ne Delacroix, S√©bastien Allard, Louvre, Paris, 2004, . Page 34. In the summer of 1822, the French State purchased the painting for 2000 Francs, and moved it to the Mus√©e du Luxembourg. Delacroix was delighted on hearing the news, although he feared the piece would be less admired for being viewed at close quarters. Some two year later he revisited the painting, reporting that it gave him much pleasure, but describing it as being insufficiently vigorous; a deficiency he had identified in the painting he was working on at the time, The Massacre at Chios. The painting was moved in 1874eleven years after the death of the artistto its present location, the Mus√©e du Louvre.

While the original plan for the Negro Project included educational outreach into black communities as well as the establishment of black-operated clinical resources, the project that was implemented deviated from this original design and was ultimately unsuccessful. The Negro project lasted three years, beginning in 1939 and ending in 1942.  History of the Negro Project  = Sanger's Vision for the Negro Project = As a result of the National Emergency Council‚Äôs 1938 Report on the Economic Conditions of the South ‚Äì a report which cited the region as the nation‚Äôs primary economic concern ‚Äì national attention shifted towards fixing issues of Southern poverty. Birth control activists, including Margaret Sanger, believed that one way to combat Southern poverty was through increased access to birth control, and Sanger aimed to tackle Southern poverty by addressing black Southern poverty in particular. Drawing upon her previous experience with opening a successful birth control clinic in Harlem, NY, the Harlem Clinic, Sanger conceptualized the Negro Project. The goals of the project, as defined by Sanger in a proposal written to Albert Lasker, an American advertising executive and philanthropist whose $20,000 donation provided much of the funding for the project, were to improve the overall quality of life for Southern blacks by reducing high infant and mother mortality rates, promoting higher education, increasing access to public health clinics, etc. In the proposal of the Negro Project, Sanger delineated two essential components: that of educational outreach and that of clinical access. In order to facilitate educational outreach, Sanger believed it was imperative to recruit the aid of black ministers and physicians. Sanger noted that their primary responsibility would be to tour the South, dispelling misconceptions about birth control and promoting the use of future clinical resources. Additionally, being aware of the general distrust that existed between black patients and white doctors, Sanger believed that their involvement in outreach would be instrumental in ensuring continued use of the clinical resources. According to Sanger, then, only after a successful educational campaign, should black-operated birth control clinics be established and opened for use. The BCFA, Birth Control Federation of America, readily accepted Sanger‚Äôs proposal. = Deviation from Sanger's Plan: The BCFA's Implemented Negro Project = Though initially accepting Sanger‚Äôs plan for the project, committee members of the BCFA later dismissed her ideas, opting out of establishing black-run clinical services and dropping the concept of an educational campaign all together. Instead, the BCFA decided to funnel Lasker‚Äôs $20,000 contribution into pre-existing clinics, clinics which were typically run by white doctors and nurses. Between the years 1940 to 1942, the BCFA funded demonstration clinics in many counties across South Carolina as well as in Nashville, TN. The clinical hubs of the BCFA‚Äôs activities in Nashville were Fisk University, a historically black college, and Bethlehem Center, a black settlement house. The clinics‚Äô daily operations at Fisk University and Bethlehem Center were conducted by black physicians and nurses. In South Carolina, the BCFA employed black nurses to advocate for the use of contraceptives. The BCFA touted its projects in South Carolina and Nashville, TN as a success. In actuality, however, the participation rates among black women were low while the recidivism rate were high. Additionally, the BCFA‚Äôs Negro Project did not lead to the opening of any more clinics, indicating no lasting impact of the project.

He was imprisoned by the Vichy government from August 1940 until he was murdered in 1944. Early life Zay was born in Orl√©ans, in the d√©partment of Loiret, about south of Paris. His father, Leon Zay, descended from a Jewish family from Metz, but was born and died in Orl√©ans, where he was the director of a radical socialist regional newspaper, Le Progr√®s du Loiret. His mother Alice Chartres was a teacher. Zay was educated at the Lyc√©e Pothier in Orl√©ans, and became a lawyer in 1928. He was politically active from his early days, joining the Radical Party aged 21. With his wife, Madeleine Dreux, he had two daughters, Catherine Martin-Zay, and H√©l√®ne Mouchard-Zay (born 1940). Political career In May 1932 he was elected to the French parliament as d√©put√© to represent Loiret, for the Radical Socialist Party. He defeated the incumbent representative of the Popular Democratic Party, Maurice Berger. He became one of the Jeunes Turcs (Young Turks) who wanted to renew the Radical Party, and was instrumental in the party joining the Popular Front in 1935. After the 1936 election, he was the Minister of National Education and Fine Arts from June 1936. While serving in his position, he extended the school leaving age and introduced a common curriculum in elementary schools. In 1938, Jean Zay proposed the creation of an international film event in France, which was planned to debut in Cannes in 1939. Due to the outbreak of the Second World War, the inauguration of the Cannes Film Festival was postponed until 1946.Hayward, Susan (2005). French National Cinema. Psychology Press. p. 142. Second World War He resigned as minister in 1939 to join the French Army on the outbreak of the Second World War, serving as a second lieutenant attached to the headquarters of the Fourth Army . He remained a d√©put√© until 1942, and he was given leave to attend the last session of the French Parliament, held in Bordeaux in June 1940. After the invasion of France by Nazi Germany in 1940, he was one of the passengers aboard the vessel Le Massilia that left from Bordeaux bound for Casablanca on 21 June 1940, with the intention of forming a resistance government in North Africa. He was arrested in August 1940, for desertion, and returned to France where he was held at the military prison in Clermont-Ferrand. A press campaign, organised by Philippe Henriot, the minister of information in the Vichy government, called for his execution for being \\"jewish, freemason and member of the Radical Party\\",Jean Zay (Marcel Ruby, 1994)Paroles de r√©sistants (Jean Debordes, 2003) and pointing to his anti-war poem of March 1924, Le Drapeau (The Flag), as evidence of his lack of patriotism. He was convicted of desertion by a military tribunal in October 1940, and sentenced to loss of military rank and deportation for life. Held in Marseille, his sentence was commuted to one of internment in France, and he was held in the prison in Riom, sharing a cell with Rabbi Edward Gour√©vitch. He was allowed to communicate with friends and family, and did not attempt to escape. He was removed from the prison by three miliciens on 20 June 1944, Henri Millou, Charles Develle and Pierre Cordier, purportedly so he could be transferred to Melun. They murdered him in a wood near an abandoned quarry, at a place called Les Malavaux in the faille du Puits du diable, at Molles in Allier. Post-war rehabilitation Zay's conviction was posthumously annulled by the appeal court in Riom in July 1945. His body was found with those of two others in 1946, under a pile of stones. The three were initially reburied together in Cusset, but Zay's body was exhumed in 1947 and identified through his dental records. The surviving milicien Charles Develle was convicted of Zay's murder in February 1953, and sentenced to forced labour for life, but released in 1955. Zay was buried in Orl√©ans in 1948. A memorial was erected near the site of his death in Molles, and a plaque at his high school in Orl√©ans. The rue Jean Zay in Tr√©laz√© is named after him. A French literary prize, the Prix Jean-Zay, was created and named in his honour in 2005.

Scotland was noted for his work during and after World War II as commandant of the \\"London Cage\\", an MI19 prisoner of war facility that was subject to frequent allegations of torture. He wrote about this period in his 1957 book, The London Cage. Early life and career Scotland was born in England to Scottish parents from Perthshire. His father was a railway engineer. He came from a family of nine children, three girls and six boys. He left school at the age of fourteen, worked as an office boy at a tea merchant's in Mincing Lane, City of London, and then sailed to Australia before returning to England, where he worked in a London grocery business. In his 1957 memoir The London Cage, Scotland wrote, \\"Perhaps because I had a variety of uncles, aunts and other relatives living abroad, my mind was focussed from an early age on the notion of a career overseas, and before I was twenty this compulsive travel urge was again asserting itself.\\" He travelled to South Africa with the intent of joining the British Army, as his brother was serving there and promised to get him in his unit. However, the Boer War had just ended by the time of his arrival. He then worked for an insurance company before returning to the grocery and provisions trade. He lived in the town of Ramonsdrift, at the border between South Africa and German South-West Africa. German forces became his chief customers, and he learned to speak German fluently. At the invitation of a German officer, Scotland joined the German Army as \\"Schottland\\". In The London Cage he says he took part in \\"several battles\\" with the Khoikhoi, then engaged in an uprising against German rulers of South-West Africa. He served in the German army from 1903 to 1907. Upon return to Cape Town, Scotland was appointed General Manager of the government trading post at Ramonsdrift by Dr. L.S. Jameson, premier of the Cape Colony. The appointment made Scotland influential with British, German and Khoikhoi forces, and he became involved in cease-fire talks with the Khoikhoi leader Johannes Christian. Scotland was awarded the Order of the Red Eagle for his services. During that time, Scotland began unofficially reporting German manpower and other information to British intelligence in Cape Town \\"and to General Smuts' agents on their periodic visits to me in my bushland commercial headquarters.\\" Over time, the Germans became suspicious of him, but no action was taken and he continued his work for both sides until 1914, when he was imprisoned by the Germans on suspicion of espionage. He was interned in the prison at Windhoek until 6 July 1915, when the area was captured by British Empire troops. He returned to England upon his release. Following his return he launched an unsuccessful court case in the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice, attempting to recover the salary that had been withheld by his employer, South African Territories (Limited) whilst he was interned. World War I In 1915, Scotland sought to enter intelligence work in England. Initially rebuffed, he was then accepted into the Inns of Court Officers' Training Corps. He was posted to France and received a commission as second lieutenant in July 1916. In France he was assigned to interrogate German prisoners. In The London Cage, Scotland says that he used his fluent German and knowledge of the German Army to cajole information from German prisoners. To determine the manpower needs of the German army, for instance, he ordered German noncommissioned officers at a prisoner of war cage to survey their men's health status and age. The purpose was to determine whether the German Army was being forced to return ill soldiers to duty, or to use young and inexperienced soldiers, because of manpower shortages. In the spring of 1918, Scotland made three secret trips behind German lines in Beverlo, a town in Flanders where porous security allowed transit into German-occupied Belgium. Scotland posed as an overseas German from German South-West Africa. On the recommendation of a German he knew in South Africa, he found employment as a civilian worker for the German Army, and gathered intelligence by chatting with German soldiers. Scotland fled to England when he came under suspicion from a German noncommissioned officer. Scotland left military service in 1919 with the rank of captain, which he describes in The London Cage as the highest rank in the Intelligence Corps. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) on 1 January 1919, in a group of honours awarded \\"for valuable services rendered in connection with military operations in France and Flanders\\". World War II and the 'cages' After the First World War, Scotland returned to South-West Africa and then obtained what he describes in The London Cage as a \\"roving job with a famous commercial enterprise.\\" This brought him to South America, where he worked between 1927 and 1933. While in South America, Scotland says he made \\"discreet inquiries\\" about the large German communities in those countries. Scotland returned to England in 1933, and made several trips to Germany in the ensuing years. During one of his trips to Germany in 1937, Scotland says, he met with Adolf Hitler at a friend's house in Munich, and discussed South-West Africa. In early 1940, Scotland was recalled to duty. He says in The London Cage that he was commissioned a major and was posted to France in March, but official records say he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in April. He was assigned to the British Expeditionary Force in France, where he was assigned to organize prisoner of war interrogation centers, and to instruct officers on treatment and interrogation of prisoners. He found British forces ill-equipped to deal with war prisoners, with the staff assigned to such duties consisting of writers and journalists, some with background in security work but none with training or knowledge of military intelligence. Scotland returned to England in the Dunkirk evacuation a month later, and in July 1940, he was transferred to the Intelligence Corps. Upon his return to England, Scotland was put in charge of the Prisoner of War Interrogation Section (PWIS). A \\"cage\\" for interrogation of prisoners was established in each command area, manned by officers trained by Scotland. The prisoners were sent to prison camps after their interrogation at the cages. Nine cages were established from southern England to Scotland, with the London cage also being \\"an important transit camp.\\" The cages varied in facilities. The Doncaster cage used a portion of the town's racecourse as a camp, while the Catterick and Loughborough cages were in bare fields. The London Cage, located in Kensington, a fashionable part of the city, had space for 60 prisoners, was equipped with five interrogation rooms, and staffed by ten officers serving under Scotland, plus a dozen noncommissioned officers who served as interrogators and interpreters. Security was provided by soldiers from the Guards regiments selected \\"for their height rather than their brains\\". Scotland does not describe in detail the wartime functions of any of the cages, including the eponymous London cage, in his The London Cage memoir. War crimes investigations After the war, the PWIS became known as the War Crimes Investigation Unit (WCIU), and the London Cage became the headquarters for questioning suspected war criminals. Among the Nazi war criminals confined at the London cage was Fritz Knoechlein, who was in charge of the murder of 100 British prisoners who had surrendered at Le Paradis, France in May 1940 after protecting the evacuation from Dunkirk. Knoechlein was convicted and hanged in 1949. In The London Cage Scotland spoke disparagingly of the varying treatment of Nazi war criminals, and the necessity of prompt prosecutions. Scotland participated in the interrogation of Gen. Kurt Meyer, who was accused of participating in a massacre of Canadian troops. Meyer was eventually sentenced to death, although the sentence was not carried out. Scotland observed that Meyer received milder treatment after news of the atrocity had grown \\"cold\\". He said that a Nazi Gauleiter, Jakob Sporrenberg, who was responsible for the deaths of 46,000 Jews in Poland toward the end of the war, was not prosecuted by Poland despite documentary evidence of his crimes, because of Polish dislike of Jews. However Sporrenberg would eventually be convicted and executed in Poland in 1952. Other Nazi war criminals passing through the London Cage after the war included Sepp Dietrich, an SS general accused but never prosecuted for the murder of British prisoners in 1940. He participated in the investigation of the SS and Gestapo men who murdered 41 escaped prisoners from Stalag Luft III in 1944, in the aftermath of what became known as the \\"Great Escape\\". The London Cage closed in 1948. On 14 February 1946 he was awarded the US Bronze Star for his prisoner interrogation work, and enhancing US/UK cooperation. He was formally granted permission to wear this foreign decoration on 25 September 1947. Torture allegations Scotland was accused by a number of prisoners of the London Cage of extracting confessions by torture. Prior to publication of The London Cage, MI5 pointed out that Scotland had detailed repeated breaches of the Geneva convention, and had admitted \\"that prisoners had been forced to kneel while being beaten about the head; forced to stand to attention for up to 26 hours; threatened with execution; or threatened with 'an unnecessary operation'.\\" Publication of the book was delayed for years, and these details were excised. In The London Cage, Scotland vigorously denied that violence was used against prisoners, and that confessions were obtained by seizing upon discrepancies in the accounts of prisoners. \\"We were not so foolish as to imagine that petty violence, nor even violence of a stronger character, was likely to produce the results hoped for in dealing with some of the toughest creatures of the Hitler regime.\\" While denying \\"sadism\\", Scotland said things were done that were \\"mentally just as cruel\\". One \\"cheeky and obstinate\\" prisoner, he said, was forced to strip naked and exercise. This \\"deflated him completely\\" and he began to talk. Prisoners were sometimes forced to stand \\"round the clock\\", and \\"if a prisoner wanted to pee he had to do it there and then, in his clothes. It was surprisingly effective.\\" Scotland refused to allow Red Cross inspections at the London Cage, on the grounds that the prisoners there were neither civilians or criminals within the armed services. In September 1940, Guy Liddell, director of MI5's counterintelligence B Division, said that he had been told by an officer present at the interrogation that Scotland had punched the jaw of a captured German agent at MI5's secret interrogation centre, Camp 020. The agent was Wulf Schmidt, known by the code name \\"Tate.\\" Liddell said in a diary entry that Scotland was \\"hitting TATE in the jaw and I think got one back himself.\\" Liddell said: \\"Apart from the moral aspects of the thing, I am convinced that these Gestapo methods do not pay in the long run.\\" Liddell said that \\"Scotland turned up this morning with a syringe containing some drug or other, which it was thought would induce the prisoner [Tate] to speak.\\" Schmidt subsequently became a double agent against the Germans as part of the Double Cross System of double agents operated by MI5. In 1943, allegations of mistreatment at the London Cage resulted in a formal protest to the Secretary of State for War by MI5 director Maxwell Knight. The allegations were made by Otto Witt, a German anti-Nazi who was interrogated to determine if he was acting on behalf of German intelligence. At his war crimes trial, SS General Fritz Knoechlein claimed that he was tortured, which Scotland dismisses in The London Cage as a \\"lame allegation\\". According to Knoechlein, he was stripped, deprived of sleep, kicked by guards and starved. He said that he was compelled to walk in a tight circle for four hours. After complaining to Scotland, Knoechlein alleges that he was doused in cold water, pushed down stairs, and beaten. He claimed he was forced to stand beside a hot gas stove before being showered with cold water. He claimed that he and another prisoner were forced to run in circles while carrying heavy logs. \\"Since these tortures were the consequences of my personal complaint, any further complaint would have been senseless,\\" Knoechlein wrote. \\"One of the guards who had a somewhat humane feeling advised me not to make any more complaints, otherwise things would turn worse for me.\\" Other prisoners, he alleged, were beaten until they begged to be killed, while some were told that they could be made to disappear. Scotland said in his memoirs that Knoechlein was not interrogated at all at the London Cage because there was sufficient evidence to convict him, and he wanted \\"no confusing documents with the aid of which he might try to wriggle from the net.\\" During his last nights at the cage, Scotland states, Knoechlein \\"began shrieking in a half-crazed fashion, so that the guards at the London Cage were at a loss to know how to control him. At one stage the local police called in to enquire why such a din was emanating from sedate Kensington Palace Gardens.\\" At a trial in 1947 of eighteen Nazis accused in the massacre of fifty Allied prisoners who escaped from Stalag Luft III, the Germans alleged starvation, sleep deprival, \\"third degree\\" interrogation methods, and torture by electric shock. Scotland describes these in his memoir as \\"fantastic allegations.\\" \\"At more than one stage in those fifty days of courtroom wrangling, a stranger to such peculiar affairs might have suspected that the arch-criminal of them all was a British Army intelligence officer known as Colonel Alexander Scotland.\\" Scotland denied the allegations at the trial. In The London Cage he says he was \\"greatly troubled. . . by the constant focus on our supposed shortcomings at The Cage, for it seemed to me that these manufactured tales of cruelty toward our German prisoners were fast becoming the chief item of news, while the brutal fate of those fifty RAF officers was in danger of becoming old history.\\" Later years Scotland's efforts to obtain publication of The London Cage were opposed by British intelligence officials, on the grounds of the Official Secrets Act. In 1955, Special Branch detectives searched his home and seized all three copies of the manuscript, as well as Scotland's notes and records, some of which were official files he had retained at the end of the war. Scotland responded by threatening to publish the book in the United States.

Family and education Russell was the son of R J Russell of Birkenhead. He was educated at St Ann's, Birkenhead and at Liverpool University. He obtained his Licentiate in Dental SurgeryThe Times, 8 July 1899 p16 and qualified in the Royal College of Surgeons of EnglandThe Times, 1 September 1892 p5 He married Ellen Atkinson of Wensleydale in Yorkshire and they had two daughters.Who was Who, OUP 2007 Public career Russell was the chairman of many important committees on Merseyside, including with Sir Archibald Salvidge, the Conservative political organiser, the Merseyside Co-ordination Committee and the Mersey Tunnel Joint Committee. He also served as a Justice of the Peace. Russell was for many years an Alderman of Birkenhead Town Council.Who was Who, OUP 2007 Politics =1923‚Äì1924= Russell contested Eddisbury at the general elections of 1923 and 1924. There was no Labour Party tradition in the constituency, the radical interest such as it was in this predominantly rural area being vested in the Liberals. In a straight fight in 1923 Russell lost by only 196 votes to the sitting Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Harry Barnston.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918‚Äì1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p304 He continued to nurse the constituency between the 1923 and 1924 elections but suffered from being an outsider from an urban area compared with the sitting MP who had strong territorial ties with the constituencyThe Times, 21 October 1924 p8 =By- election candidate= In early 1929 an opportunity arose for Russell with the death of Sir Harry Barnston. Russell was re-adopted as Liberal candidate for the resulting by-election in EddisburyThe Times, 23 February 1929 p10 He had a straight fight against the Conservative candidate Lieutenant-Colonel Roderick George Fenwick-Palmer.The Times, 13 March 1929 In this largely rural constituency, agricultural issues dominated the debates and campaigns with the Liberals promoting the Lloyd George land policy and the Conservatives denouncing it.The Times, 15 March 1929 p18 Russell turned a Tory majority of 1,669 at the previous general election into a Liberal majority of 1,292.The Times 22 March 1929 p16 Eddisbury was one of a series of Liberal by-election successes at this time; Holland with Boston was won the day after Eddisbury and according to two important psephologists the Liberals were doing undeniably well in by-election contests in this Parliament.Chris Cook & John Ramsden, By-elections in British Politics; UCL Press, 1997 pp59-60 =Rural MP= Unsurprisingly for the representative of a rural area, in his subsequent parliamentary career, Russell often took a strong interest in countryside matters, the need to support farming as an industry and the importance of cheap food.The Times, 15 February 1933, p7; 12 July 1933 p7; 8 June 1934 p7 In 1933 Russell sat on the House of Commons committee on surplus foodstuffs which had the aim of making surplus foods available to the unemployed at wholesale prices.The Times, 10 March 1933 p14 =Political character and stance= In many aspects of his politics, Russell tended to be on the conservative wing of his party. He spoke in parliament of the Gladstonian virtues of efficiency, economyThe Times, , 21 December 1929 p6 and retrenchmentThe Times, 11 December 1939 p8 and was in favour of temperance and reduction of licensed drinking hours.The Times, 7 March 1936 p7 One historian has described Russell as \\"....on the surface, the archetypal Liberal of the Gladstonian tradition.\\"David Dutton, Liberal Schism: A History of the National Liberal Party; I B Tauris, 2008 p93 He tended to vote with the Conservatives rather than Labour when the Liberal Parliamentary Party votes were split during the period of the second Labour government (1929‚Äì1931) on educationThe Times, 7 November 1930 p14; 12 November 1930 p16 and taxation.The Times, 2 July 1931 p14 He was a Methodist lay preacherDutton, op cit p93 and strongly disapproved of sweepstakes and betting, working in the House of Commons for further restrictive legislationThe Times, 6 November 1934 p7; 8 February 1943 p6 including proposing a Private Member's Bill to make illegal the Football pools and other forms of pool or parimutuel betting.The Times 29 February 1936 p4 He also strongly opposed secularisation of Sundays. In 1932 he played a leading role in opposing a Bill to allow cinemas to open on Sundays, describing the commercialisation of the Sabbath as an \\"intolerable desecration\\".The Times, 14 April 1932 p12 By 1931 it was becoming clear that the ties of party and whip were loosening for Russell in Parliament and that he was taking up a much more independent approach.The Times, 6 July 1931 p12 Liberal National In 1931 an economic crisis led to the formation of a National Government led by prime minister Ramsay MacDonald supported by a small number of National Labour MPs and initially backed by the Conservative and Liberal parties. However most Liberals had concerns about supporting the National coalition over the long run because of the government's commitment to protectionism and tariffs in opposition to the traditional Liberal policy of Free Trade. Despite these worries, the Liberal Party led by Sir Herbert Samuel agreed to go into the 1931 general election supporting the government. As a result, Russell found himself the representative of the coalition at the election, Conservative opposition to him being withdrawn.The Times, 12 October 1931 p17 and he was returned unopposed. As the initial crisis passed, the Liberal Party became increasingly anxious about the government's stance on Free Trade and worried about the predominance of the Conservatives in the coalition. However a group of Liberal MPs led by Sir John Simon who were concerned to ensure the National Government had a wide cross-party base formed the Liberal National Party to give more open support to MacDonald's administration. Given the background of Russell's opposition to the Labour government, his natural conservatism and his dependence upon Conservative support in his constituency it is not surprising that Russell was one of the group of 22 Simonite MPs who met in 'secret conclave' on the evening of 5 October 1931. The meeting resolved to form itself into a body to give firm support to the prime minister as the head of a national government and for the purpose of fighting a general election. Sir John Simon wrote to the Prime Minister that night to give him the news and the decision was made to call the group Liberal Nationals.Dutton, op cit p40 At the 1935 general election the Eddisbury Tories again accepted Russell as the representative of the National Government and stood aside in his favour. There was talk of his being opposed by an Independent Liberal, William Gibson a Cheshire County Councillor and a former Chairman of Eddisbury Liberal Association but Gibson also withdrew and Russell again found himself returned to Parliament unopposed.F W S Craig, op cit p304 With a General Election expected in the Autumn of 1939, the local Liberals met at Chester and decided to field a candidate against him. However, the election never took place. Death Russell died at Cheshunt in Hertfordshire on 5 February 1943 aged 70The Times, 8 February 1943, p6 Eddisbury by-election, 1943 At the by- election caused by Russell's death the seat was gained for the Common Wealth Party by John Eric Loverseed, the son of former Liberal MP John Frederick Loverseed (1881‚Äì1928).

Both teams showed great defense with the game close at the half tied 10‚Äì10. After a safety and a field goal, Ohio State led 15‚Äì10 with less than five minutes to go. However, Matt Barkley and the Trojans drove down the field to score a touchdown and a two-point conversion to end the game.

The Trojans dominated the Bears, scoring the most points since their season opener against San Jose State. =Notre Dame= The Trojans marched into South Bend ranked #6 in the nation after a 30-3 beating of #24 Cal. The Fighting Irish lived up to their name, staying with highly ranked USC through two quarters, only trailing by 6 points, 13-7. In the third quarter, the Trojans started to run away with the game, outscoring Notre Dame 14-7. Going into the fourth quarter, USC had a commanding lead, 27-14. USC scored another touchdown early in the fourth quarter to go ahead, 34-14. It looked like Notre Dame would get beat badly by their rivals once again. But, it wasn't to be for the Fighting Irish. Instead of losing by double digits to the Trojans again, they rallied and found themselves down 34-27 with 1 second left at the USC 1-yard-line. Jimmy Clauson fired an incomplete pass and USC extended their winning streak over Notre Dame to 8. The freshman Matt Barkley attempted 29 passes, completing 19, on his way to 380 yards and 2 touchdowns. Clauson went 24-43 with a mere 260 yards and 2 touchdowns. Anthony McCoy led the Trojans (5-1) in receiving yards with 5 catches for 153 yards. Notre Dame's (4-2) leading receiver was Golden Tate with 8 catches for 117 yards. =Oregon State= Last year the #1 Trojans went to Corvallis and were upset 27‚Äì21. It was the second straight trip to Corvallis for USC that resulted in defeat. Jacquizz Rodgers ran for 187 yards on 37 carries and two touchdowns in the win last year. Oregon State was the second Pac-10 Conference school to have beaten USC twice during the Pete Carroll era in 2006 and 2008 (Stanford was first with victories in 2001 and 2007 (and would do so again in 2009). The last time Oregon State won against USC in the Coliseum was when Dwight D. Eisenhower was the President of the United States. USC scored first when quarterback Matt Barkley passed to Anthony McCoy for an 8-yard touchdown. The Beavers got on the scoreboard with two field goal kicks from Justin Kahut (both 48 yards). In the second quarter, Matt Barkley completed a pass to Ronald Johnson for a 22 yards touchdown. On second and goal, Barkley rushed for a 1-yard touchdown for the Trojans. Kahut kicked a 33-yard field goal for Oregon State just before the half. In the third quarter, Sean Canfield passed to Jacquizz Rodgers for a 6-yard touchdown for the Beavers on a 3:06-drive that took 8 plays for 61 yards. The Trojans countered with a 7-play drive for 70 yards with Allen Bradford rushing for 2 yards for a touchdown. Canfield narrowed Oregon State's gap by completing a 15-yard scoring pass to Damola Adeniji. USC answered with Allen Bradford scoring a 43-yard touchdown. Oregon State became the first team to score more than 10 points on the Trojans in their last ten home games. =Oregon= Prior to the game, USC had lost three in a row in the state of Oregon, but had won four of the last five against the Ducks. The Trojans lost the game 47‚Äì20, which was the worst defeat suffered by USC since 1997. 1st Quarter * 8:32 USC Jordan Congdon 28 field goal 3‚Äì0 USC * 7:30 Oregon Morgan Flint 32-yard field goal 3‚Äì3 tied * 1:37 Oregon Jeremiah Masoli 3-yard run for Touchdown (Morgan Flint kick) 10‚Äì3 Oregon 2nd Quarter * 10:55 USC Matt Barkley 3-yard pass to Ronald Johnson for Touchdown (Jordan Congdon kick) 10‚Äì10 Tied * 8:39 Oregon Andre Crenshaw 1-yard run for Touchdown (Morgan Flint kick) 17‚Äì10 Oregon * 3:17 USC Matt Barkley 4-yard pass to Damian Williams for Touchdown (Jordan Congdon kick) 17‚Äì17 Tied * 1:49 Oregon Jeremiah Masoli 17-yard pass to Jamere Holland for Touchdown ( Morgan Flint kick) 24‚Äì17 Oregon 3rd Quarter * 11:58 Oregon Morgan Flint 35-yard field goal 27‚Äì17 Oregon * 8:26 USC Jordan Congdon 39 field goal 27‚Äì20 Oregon * 5:50 Oregon LaMichael James 5-yard run for Touchdown (Morgan Flint kick) 34‚Äì20 Oregon * 0:00 Oregon Kenjon Barner 3-yard run for Touchdown (Morgan Flint kick) 41‚Äì20 Oregon 4th Quarter * 8:00 Oregon Morgan Flint 22-yard field goal 44‚Äì20 Oregon * 2:05 Oregon Morgan Flint 23-yard field goal 47‚Äì20 Oregon =Arizona State= =Stanford= Stanford's 55‚Äì21 victory was the highest number of points any team had scored against a USC Trojans football team in the 121-year history of Trojan football. The 34-point loss was the worst defeat USC had suffered since 1966. This was Stanford's third victory against USC in their last five games against each other at the Coliseum (Stanford winning 2001, 2007, and 2009, with USC winning in 2003 and 2005), with USC having defeated every non-Stanford opponent in the Coliseum since 2001, going 47‚Äì2 since Stanford's September 29, 2001 victory in the Coliseum. It was the first defeat in a November game for the Trojans under Coach Pete Carroll's nine-season tenure. For the first time in since Carroll's first season, USC lost more than two games in one season. For the second time in three weekends, Carroll suffered the worst loss of his USC tenure (the other being the Oregon game). This was the largest margin of victory for Stanford in a Stanford-USC game since the two teams' rivalry began in 1918. Harbaugh became the only coach in college football with a winning record against Carroll, going 2‚Äì1 in the three times the two coaches have faced each other. Stanford would eclipse the all-time point spread record it set from the 2007 Stanford vs. Southern California football game, as USC was a 41-point favorite. =UCLA= UCLA‚ÄìUSC rivalry game for the Victory Bell, which the Trojans retained by defeating the Bruins 28‚Äì7. Both teams wore home jerseys, in a tradition that was restarted the previous year, with the Bruins wearing their 1966 throwback powder blue jerseys. The final two minutes of the game proved to be interesting. With the Trojans leading 21‚Äì7 after a touchdown with 1:30 in the fourth quarter, and having possession of the ball after UCLA turned it over on downs, Carroll instructed his quarterback to take a knee. Rick Neuheisel then called a timeout to stop the clock. On second down, the Trojans immediately connected on a 48-yard pass play for their fourth touchdown of the game. USC beat UCLA for the 10th time in 11 years, but the late touchdown pass stirred passions in the crosstown rivalry and lead to a benches-clearing incident. =Arizona= Arizona's defeat of the Trojans gave the Wildcats their first win over USC during the Pete Carroll era. Arizona was also the first non-Stanford team in the Pac-10 to defeat the Trojans in the Coliseum under Carroll (Stanford had defeated Carroll's teams in the Coliseum in 2001, 2007, and 2009). Arizona State is the only Pac-10 team to never beat the Trojans during Carroll's tenure. =Boston College= This marked the first time USC played in the Emerald Bowl. On December 26, 2009 at AT&T; Park in San Francisco California, attended by 40,121; the Trojans squared off against the Boston College Eagles from the Atlantic Coast Conference. This also marked the first time that the Trojans had played in a non-BCS bowl game in seven years. Boston College was making its 11th straight bowl appearance. The Eagles became the first team to play in the Emerald Bowl twice, beating Colorado State 35‚Äì21 in the 2003 San Francisco Bowl (the former name of the Emerald Bowl). This was the third meeting between the two schools and the first in a bowl game. USC had won both games in the series, a 23‚Äì17 victory in Los Angeles in 1987 and a 34‚Äì7 win in Chestnut Hill in 1988. USC freshman quarterback Matt Barkley threw touchdown passes to Stanley Havili on the Trojans first two possessions and added a touchdown run in the fourth quarter. Barkley finished the game with a total of 350 yards passing. Of his 350 yards, Damian Williams accounted for 189 of them on 12 catches. Williams was named the game's MVP for his efforts. Boston College was led by tailback Montel Harris, who rushed for 102 yards and also added a touchdown run. Rankings After the season On January 10, 2010, coach Carroll told his players that he will resign his position with the Trojans and become the new head coach of the Seattle Seahawks. Lane Kiffin, formerly with the Trojans, Oakland Raiders, and Tennessee Volunteers, was hired as the new head coach.

Bourjaily moved several times during his youth. His childhood was spent in Connecticut, Virginia, and New York. Bourjaily graduated from Handley High School in Winchester, Virginia in 1939. After graduating, Bourjaily enrolled in Bowdoin College. With the coming of World War II, Bourjaily became a volunteer ambulance driver from 1942 to 1944. He then served two years in the army from 1944 to 1946. Bourjaily's time in the army was a central theme to many of his later writings. His Arab American themes are explored by literary critic Evelyn Shakir Pretending to Be Arab: Role-Playing in Vance Bourjaily's \\"The Fractional Man,\\" Evelyn Shakir, MELUS (Multi Ethnic Literature of the United States), Vol. 9, No. 1, Varieties of Ethnic Criticism (Spring, 1982), pp. 7-21 Bourjaily graduated from Bowdoin College with a B.A. in 1947. While at Bowdoin, he became a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Theta chapter). After graduating, he lived for a few years in San Francisco, writing feature stories for the San Francisco Chronicle before moving to New York City in 1950. Bourjaily married Bettina Yensen in 1946. The couple had three children. His daughter, Anna, along with the daughter's fifth grade classmate, were killed in a 1964 car accident, in which Bourjaily was driving. Yensen and Bourjaily later divorced. Bourjaily remarried in 1985, to Yasmin Mogul (a former student) and had a son by her.

Carver was a student at the Iowa Writer's Workshop where he became friends with Bourjaily. Career Bourjaily's first novel, entitled The End of My Life, was heavily influenced by Bourjaily's wartime experiences. Critics said that the novel borrowed heavily from the style and tone of Ernest Hemingway. However, the novel was met with praise and was hailed by critic John W. Aldridge as a war novel on the level of Hemingway's Farewell to Arms. Bourjaily's second novel, The Hound of Earth, paints a picture of Cold War America through the eyes of a scientist who helped develop the atomic bomb. His third novel, The Violated, dealt with the themes of violence and alienation. This book was also met with critical praise. Bourjaily spent much of his career in academia. From 1957 to 1980, he worked as a creative writing instructor and a professor at the Iowa Writer's Workshop. Bourjaily also worked at several other academic institutions such as Oregon State University, the University of Arizona, and Louisiana State University. At the latter institution, he was their first director of their MFA Program in Creative Writing. In 1978, Bourjaily served as a judge on for the National Book Award's committee to choose the award for fiction. Bibliography *Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, 2009.

Though not all tachiyaku roles are heroes, the term does not encompass roles such as villains or comic figures, which form their own separate categories. The hero or chief protagonist of a kabuki play is nearly always a tachiyaku role, and the head of a troupe or acting family typically specializes in these roles. The term, which literally means \\"standing role\\", once was used to refer to all actors, to distinguish them from musicians and chanters, who were called .Á´ãÂΩπ (Tachiyaku). Kabuki Jiten (Ê≠åËàû‰ºé‰∫ãÂÖ∏, \\"Kabuki Encyclopedia\\"). 2001‚Äì2003: Japan Arts Council. Accessed 17 January 2009. There are two main types of tachiyaku role: * Aragoto: Most of the great heroes of the kabuki tradition are characters performed in the aragoto style. Their face makeup is white with bold red patterns, and their words and actions are likewise quite bold. It takes great training to create, and sustain, the loud and forceful voice of an aragoto character. The chief example of an aragoto role is that of Kamakura Gongor≈ç Kagemasa in the famous play Shibaraku.Cavaye, Ronald et al. A Guide to the Japanese Stage. Tokyo: Kodansha, 2004. pp59‚Äì60. * Wagoto: Wagoto roles are softer, gentler, characters. A wagoto figure is often a companion to the chief aragoto role in the play, or a romantic character. Abe Kiyoyuki in Narukami Fud≈ç Kitayama Zakura and Yoshitsune in Kanjinch≈ç are examples of wagoto roles. There are also a number of lesser categories of tachiyaku roles, including shinb≈çya (mild-mannered characters who are defined by their suffering great cruelty, usually at the hands of the play's villain) and sabakiyaku (level- headed, wise, and thoughtful characters, often serving as judges or the like). These are lesser roles, very rarely if ever serving as the chief protagonist or hero of a play. While there are a number of onnagata (female role specialists) who are particularly famous, most of the other top actors of both past and present specialize(d) in tachiyaku roles. This includes the lineages of Ichikawa Danj≈´r≈ç, Ichikawa Ebiz≈ç, Nakamura Kanzabur≈ç, Onoe Kikugor≈ç, and many others.

Early life James Hobart Ford was born in Painesville, Ohio, in 1829. His uncle was David Tod, U.S. Minister to Brazil and governor of Ohio during the Civil War. Much of Ford's early life is unclear, but sometime before 1861 he moved from Ohio to Colorado. He married in May 1850 to Arabella Stambaugh, daughter of John F. Stambaugh and Sara Beaver. They had 4 children, David Tod Ford, James R. Ford, John S. Ford and Sara Stambaugh Ford. Civil War =New Mexico= Ford became involved in the Civil War when Confederate forces invaded New Mexico. Colonel Edward Canby called for reinforcements from the nearby Colorado Territory to help in the defense of New Mexico. The people of Colorado responded quicklyAlberts, p. 13. and Ford took command of one company raised in Ca√±on City and was appointed captain on December 21, 1861. This company would be known as \\"Ford's Independent Company\\" even though it received an official designation as Company \\"A\\", 2nd Colorado Volunteer Infantry Regiment. As Ford marched his company towards Fort Union, he absorbed a number of soldiers from the 1st and 4th New Mexico Volunteer Regiments. Upon his arrival at Fort Union, Ford's company was reassigned as Company \\"G\\" of the 4th New Mexico Volunteer Regiment. It is likely Ford and his men never styled themselves Company G, as they continued to function independently of either regiment. Colonel John P. Slough, another Coloradan, arrived at Fort Union and took command of the Union forces there. Slough planned an advance against the approaching Confederate army, assigning Ford and his company to Maj. John M. Chivington's flanking column. In the ensuing Battle of Glorieta Pass, Ford participated in the action near Johnson's Ranch, which captured the Confederate supply train. =Kansas-Missouri= On November 1, 1862, Ford was promoted to major of the 2nd Colorado Infantry. In October 1862 the 2nd Colorado and 3rd Colorado Infantry Regiments were consolidated to form the 2nd Colorado Cavalry and on November 5, 1863, Ford was appointed colonel. For much of the war Colonel Ford was stationed in Missouri operating against bushwackers along the Kansas-Missouri border. =Price's Missouri raid= In October 1864, Confederate General Sterling Price led a raid into Missouri. General Samuel R. Curtis, commander of the Department of Kansas, began assembling Union forces to oppose Price. Colonel Ford was placed in command of the 4th Brigade in James G. Blunt's 1st Division of Curtis' newly formed Army of the Border.Eicher, 2001, p. 239. Ford led his brigade into action at the Battle of Little Blue River. His brigade then held the left flank of the Union Army at the Battle of Westport and was heavily engaged in the fighting along Brush Creek. Blunt used Ford's and Colonel Charles R. Jennison's brigades to lead the Federal assault.Monnett p. 99. After the Confederate defeat at Westport, Ford took part in the Federal pursuit, fighting in the battles of Mine Creek and Newtonia. =Later service and death= On December 12, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Ford for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from December 10, 1864, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1865.Eicher, 2001, p. 745. He commanded the District of the Upper Arkansas for the remainder of the war conducting operations against Native Americans from Fort Larned. Ford was discharged from the Union army on July 19, 1865. Shortly after the end of the war, he returned to Ohio where he died on January 12, 1867, in Akron. Ford County, Kansas was named in his honor.

It was just under 11 kilometres long and ran from Rentwertshausen to R√∂mhild in the south Thuringian region of Grabfeld. Due to its proximity to the Gleichberge mountains, the line was also known as the Gleichbergbahn (Gleichberg railway). It was dismantled in 1973.  History  On 15 December 1874 the Schweinfurt‚ÄìMeiningen railway was opened to rail services by the Royal Bavarian State Railways. It was followed on 25 November 1893 by the 10.7 kilometre long Sekund√§rbahn branch from Rentwertshausen to R√∂mhild. The legal basis for the line was a state treaty between the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, which was concluded on 16 June 1884. The cost of the railway was found by Saxe-Meiningen and the district of R√∂mhild, the construction and operation of the branch was undertaken by the Bavarian state railway. At the beginning of March 1895 Saxe- Meiningen sold the Gleichbergbahn to Bavaria. From 1901, with the establishment of the town basalt works at R√∂mhild the line became the town's life line. Over 140,000 wagons, each carrying 10 tonnes of ballast or gneiss rock, an average of about 18 wagons per day, were transported to Rentwertshausen in the next 26 years. After the Second World War the line, which had been managed since 1931 by the Nuremberg railway division, became part of the Erfurt railway division due to the drawing up of the Inner German Border. Because the main line between M√ºhlfeld and Rentwertshausen was blocked, passenger trains now ran directly from R√∂mhild to Meiningen. Passenger services were withdrawn on 29 September 1968, goods traffic followed in early January 1970. The line was dismantled between 1972 and 1973.  Operations  DRG Class 93 (ex Prussian T 14) and DRG Class 86 locomotives were used, amongst others. In 1944 four pairs of passenger trains ran daily on this line which was timetable route number (KBS) 417 k. The journey time was about half an hour.

Early years  Braucher was born in New York City in 1916. He was graduated from Haverford College with high honors in 1936 and from Harvard Law School in 1939, magna cum laude and salutatorian of his class. He served as editor of the Harvard Law Review, was a finalist in the Ames moot court competition, and winner of the Beale Prize for the best paper on the conflict of laws. From 1939 to 1941 he practiced law in New York City. He entered the United States Army Air Forces during World War II and, while in service, received the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal.  Teaching career  Towards the end of his military service in 1945, Braucher was approached to teach at Columbia University Law School, but Harvard professor Erwin Griswold arranged a better offer from the Harvard Law School. Braucher began teaching at Harvard in January 1946, and was a professor at Harvard Law School from 1949 to 1971, specializing in contracts and business law. While at Harvard, he took a leave of absence and served as Fulbright lecturer at Chuo and Tokyo Universities in 1959. He taught as a visiting professor at the University of Minnesota Law School during the academic year 1968-1969. He was active in the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, serving as Commissioner from Massachusetts from 1954 to 1971, and as vice president of the Conference from 1967 to 1970. He was also active in sections of the American Bar Association. He was chairman of the National Commission on Consumer Finance from 1969 to 1971 and of the National Institute for Consumer Justice. He led the team that wrote a Model Anti-Discrimination Act, and he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment.  Judicial career  In 1971, he was appointed Associate Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court by Governor Francis W. Sargent and served in that capacity until the time of his death. While serving on the court, he continued to teach part-time at Harvard Law School and at Boston University Law School. Justice Braucher's first opinion, published on March 5, 1971, concerned an action in contract involving the applicability of the Uniform Commercial Code and the rights of a judgment creditor.Canter v. Schlager, 358 Mass. 789 (1971). His final opinion, published on August 7, 1981, concerned the consequences of a wrongful dishonor of checks, also under the Uniform Commercial Code.Raymer v.

City Clerk of Lowell,373 Mass. 178 (1977). holding that, absent fraud, people may select and change their names freely. Stating that \\"judge-made rules of law are to be tailored to justice rather than to abstract logic\\", he once urged in dissent that rules concerning the admission of hearsay evidence should be greatly simplified so as to admit hearsay \\"unless the trial judge in his or her sound discretion thinks it fair to exclude it\\".Commonwealth v. White, 370 Mass. 703, 715-716 (1976) (Braucher, J., dissenting). In his dissent in Commonwealth v. Manning,367 Mass. 605, 613-614 (1975). referring to \\"a legal tradition, established by men\\" and in effect urging a \\"rape shield\\" rule as part of the common law, he wrote forcefully against the use of reputation evidence to impeach the testimony of female victims of sex crimes. Law Reform Work While teaching at Harvard Law School, Braucher served as the Reporter for the American Law Institute's Restatement Second of Contracts. When Braucher joined the Supreme Judicial Court in 1971, he was succeeded on the Contracts project by Professor E. Allan Farnsworth of Columbia Law School. Published in 1981, the Restatement Second of Contracts is the quintessential guide to the modern common law of contracts. It covers fundamental principles, providing a complete, coherent overview of contract law.

Biography Dr. Yang was born in Guyuan, a village in the Ningxia Muslim Hui Autonomous Region, an area which blends Muslim culture with that of the Han Chinese. This background, combined with traumatic experiences in the Great Famine during Maozedong's Cultural Revolution, made him cognizant of distinctive patterns of health behaviors under this culture norms. In turn, this laid the foundation for the main focus of his career, tobacco control. Smoking in the People's Republic of China represents an enormous public health problem. Many Chinese universities are developing training programs for medical students to improve capacity for tobacco control advocacy. Since 2007, Yang has been directing the first program aiming at promoting all forms of tobacco control in Chinese universities. Projects comprising this program are sponsored by the Bloomberg Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Use. The first goal of the project is to conduct tobacco control advocacy capacity training among medical students and the second goal is ban smoking on university campuses nationwide. Currently, the project currently covers all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China which involves nearly 100 universities from more than 70 cities. A total of about 150,000 medical students capable of tobacco control advocacy had been trained through this project. All participating universities have adopted smoking-free campus policies, with a third of them expected to achieve the goals set by the project. The outcomes of this research project have been reported by the WHO, selected in the University's Research Highlights at the 120th anniversary of Zhejiang University, and was introduced under the title of \\"Using Cultural Understanding to Stub out Killer Habit\\" in Nature.https://www.nature.com/nature/supplements/collections/npgpublications/zhejiang- university/medicine.pdf Yang is a leader in this initiative, and produces numerous publications in major journals with many international collaborators.

Bible translations into Chinese began with unpublished manuscripts by individual Roman Catholic priests in the sixteenth century and individual Protestant missionaries in the early nineteenth century. The first complete translation to be published was that of Joshua Marshman in 1813, followed by that of Robert Morrison in 1823. A group of Protestant missionaries in Hong Kong in 1843 started a collaborative translation. The New Testament of their so-called \\"Delegates Version\\" was published in 1850 and the Old Testament in 1853. A translation of the Old Testament by Karl Gutzlaff, first published in 1840, was widely distributed and was used by the leaders of the Taiping Rebellion as the basis of their theological study. The second half of the century saw the publication of Chinese Bibles in regional languages using romanization rather than Chinese characters, the first works printed in the regional language. The Classical Chinese of the Delegates Version could not be understood when read aloud, and towards the end of the century the national missionary body started a revision which used vernacular Chinese. The resulting Union Version, published in 1919, became the standard translation for Protestants and was adapted and published in different forms, including Braille. A Chinese New Version was published in 1992 and a Revised Chinese Union Version in the early twenty-first century. The Studium Biblicum Version, now the standard Chinese Bible for Catholics, was started in the 1930s and published in 1968. Starting in the 1850s, there have been three Russian Orthodox translations.

Turkey was a 2004 European Court of Human Rights case brought against Turkey by a medical student challenging a Turkish law which bans wearing the Islamic headscarf at universities and other educational and state institutions. The Court upheld the Turkish law by 16 votes to 1. ≈ûahin (born in Istanbul in 1973) came from a traditional family of practising Muslims and considered it her religious duty to wear the Islamic headscarf. After studying in Vienna, in 1998 she was a fifth-year student at the faculty of medicine of the University of Istanbul. On 23 February of that year the Vice-Chancellor of the University issued a circular directing that students with beards and students wearing the Islamic headscarf would be refused admission to lectures, courses and tutorials. In March ≈ûahin was denied access to a written examination on one of the subjects she was studying because she was wearing the Islamic headscarf. Subsequently, the university authorities refused, on the same grounds, to allow her to enrol her in a course, or to admit her to various lectures and a written examination. The university also issued her with a warning for contravening the university's rules on dress and suspended her from the university for a term for taking part in an unauthorised assembly that had gathered to protest against them. All the disciplinary penalties imposed on the applicant were revoked under an amnesty law. Before the European Court of Human Rights ≈ûahin claimed that the measures taken against her by the University of Istanbul violated Articles 9 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights ‚Äî respectively the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and the prohibition of discrimination ‚Äî stating that the prohibition on wearing the headscarf forced students to choose between education and religion and discriminated between believers and non-believers. She also relied on Articles 8 (the right to privacy) and 10 (freedom of expression). Talvikki Hoopes argues that the ECHR's decision to uphold the law shows how freedom of religion has been limited by the ECHR's interpretation of Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights.Hoopes, 719.

The purpose of the anthology, as described in the editors' note, is to increase \\"American access to world literature in translation\\". The editors wrote: :\\"This book was born in conscientious objection to the use of 'axis of evil' rhetoric and to the OFAC's apparent fear of 'free trade' in ideas and literature [...]. Our intention has never been to present a naive apology for tyrannical regimes nor to recommend any particular political solution to the problems they present both internationally and for their own people [...]. Rather, we aim simply to stimulate international conversation through literature, with all its complexity and nuanced insights into the ideas, beliefs, daily lives and articles of reference of people in other cultures, who are thinking and writing in languages other than English.\\" The editors selected works, all published in the second half of the 20th or early 21st century, by authors living in, or originating from, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Syria, Libya, Sudan and Cuba. A brief overview of the contemporary literature of each country is provided, to set the writings in their specific national context. Writers and works included * (Iranian literature)  Houshang Moradi-Kermani: \\"The Vice-Principal\\" (short story, 1979)  Tirdad Zolghadr: excerpt from the novella A Little Less Conversation (2006)This is the only work originally written in English.

[...] As a means of redressing this, I reckon this book should be on the reading list of every school in the US and Britain. [...] As well as poetry, universal themes such as coming-of-age are poignant and easy to appreciate - whether in the Iranian Houshang Moradi-Kermani's story about a bright young pupil tackling his philistine teacher, or the Syrian Hanna Mina's tale of a poor boy earning his first wage by stencilling letters on sacks of grain. There was a greater cultural barrier with the heavily stylised, propagandistic offerings from North Korea. A story by Lim Hwa-won describes how, pretty much as a direct result of imperialistic foreign influence, a beautiful young Russian woman ends up a one-legged prostitute. As a westerner, it's hard to take it seriously. But as a means of understanding the pervasive oppression of the North Korean regime, it's an intriguing insight. All of the extracts testify to struggle of one sort or another writing under oppressive regimes, coming to terms with exile, or indirectly just trying to provide a clear translation of a work from an alien culture. It's now worth struggling to make sure this kind of book is widely read.\\"\\"Literature from the Axis of Evil\\" (review), Ceri Radford, The Daily Telegraph, February 9, 2007 Chandrahas Choudhury of The Indian Express also provided a positive review: :\\"In a world where groups, nations, and ‚Äî we are sometimes told, and are tempted to believe ‚Äî even entire religions are locked in irresoluble conflict, it is sometimes easier to dissolve our sense of the individual and place instead a collective stamp over peoples and territories. Literature from the ‚ÄúAxis of Evil‚Äù seeks to combat this tendency in a way that only literature, which privileges individual experience and presents specific yet sharable human dilemmas, can.\\"\\"Before War Comes\\", Chandrahas Choudhury, The Indian Express, November 25, 2006 See also * Axis of Evil * Lullabies from the Axis of Evil * Holidays in the Axis of Evil Notes and references External links * Official website of Words Without Borders * \\"Literature and Lullabies from the 'Axis of Evil'\\", National Public Radio, October 12, 2006 2006 books American anthologies ","title":"Literature from the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;"},{"id":"21135824","text":"aka A Slope in the Sun is a 1958 black-and-white Japanese film drama directed by Tomotaka Tasaka.

It is a form of voluntary IOU or promissory note between people in love that contains a promise from one of the partners in a relationship to engage in romantic activities at a time in the future. The love coupon contains a relevant artistic image or drawing, a romantic promise and sometimes redeeming conditions like date of expiration. At the core a love coupon is a love note that uses the coupon metaphor but it can also be seen as a very specialized form of greeting card. The promise made through the love coupon can range from romantic fantasies to taking care of domestic chores. Samples of romantic promises may include an evening of dancing, night of kisses and cuddles, evening of romance, romantic weekend getaway, boat ride for two, BBQ party, stroll on the beach or a romantic day trip, just to name a few. Motivation Love coupons are seen as a romantic way to pamper one's lover or to reinforce and heat up a relationship. They are usually given as gifts on Valentine's Day, birthdays or anniversary days. They are meant to signify that one is deeply caring about his partner's wishes. A love coupon can be also seen as a sign of trust between partners. The receiver of the love coupon may choose to redeem it at a time of his choice providing no restrictions apply. Sometimes it is more effective to make a promise using a love coupon than to discuss and talk about it with your partner. Forms Love coupons can be found in many forms: as printed cards, printed books of love coupons and in digital format. Many web sites dedicated to subjects as Valentine's Day, love and romance offer various forms of love coupons for download or as attachments for romantic email messages. They can also be handmade from coloured paper, cut into heart-shape. Another popular variant uses the scratchcard metaphor. Created as scratch-off lottery tickets they are sold and marketed as romantic gifts for lovers. Usually all tickets are winners, but like lottery cards one has to find the winning item or combination. The winnings range from romance, love and sex and the gift giver has to fulfill them. Aside from love coupon, there are several other types of coupon that serve diverse purposes. Delivery Love coupons can be delivered individually or as books of coupons. They can be sent by traditional mail, in digital format as email attachments, handed in person at the right moment or placed as surprises in places where the receiver will stumble upon them. Love coupons can be bought in form of printed coupon books or can be downloaded and printed from various web sites. Some of these sites offer free customizable love coupons for download and print. Educational use A variant of the love coupon concept can be used by parents as an educational and relationship building tool. Parents can use this kind of coupon to get over communication barriers with their children and to assure the children of their love. Such a coupon can promise time for activities together, uninterrupted time for discussions or it can send a message hard to communicate in person. Use as promotional material Various companies started to use love coupons as promotional materials for their products and brands. For example, Jones Soda Co. introduced in 2006 a Valentines Pack containing among others a book of \\"Love Coupons\\".

The method is based on dermoscopy. In trichoscopy hair and scalp structures may be visualized at many-fold magnification. Currently magnifications ranging from 10-fold to 70-fold are most popular in research and clinical practice. The method was developed by groups of dermatologists directed by: Lidia Rudnicka in Poland, Antonella Tosti and Giuseppe Micali in Italy and Shigeki Inui in Japan. In 2004 Francesco Lacarrubba and coworkers first described videodermoscopic features of alopecia areata (micro-exclamation hairs, yellow hyperkeratotic hair follicle openings, and black cadaverized hairs. In 2005 Malgorzata Olszewska and Lidia Rudnicka first used videodermoscopy for evaluation of disease severity in androgenic alopecia and for monitoring treatment efficacy. Characteristic images of female androgenic alopecia included hair shaft heterogeneity and increased percentage of thin (below 30 micrometers) hairs at the vertex. The Polish group then developed criteria to diagnose female androgenic alopecia based solely on videodermoscopy images. In 2006 Elizabeth K Ross and coworkers specified videodermoscopy features of different acquired hair and scalp diseases. In 2008 Adriana Rakowska and coworkers first showed usefulness of trichoscopy in diagnosing children with congenital hair shaft abnormalities. It was shown that this method is especially helpful in diagnosing monilethrix, Netherton syndrome and other pediatric diseases. In 2008 the first atlas containing trichoscopy images was published by Antonella Tosti. The term \\"trichoscopy\\" was first introduced in 2006 by Lidia Rudnicka and Malgorzata Olszewska. In 2011 Shigeki Inui published a trichoscopy algorithm, which allows differential diagnosis of most common hair and scalp diseases (including alopecia areata, androgenic alopecia, telogen effluvium and cicatricial alopecia) based on trichoscopy. The \\"Atlas of Trichoscopy\\"(2013) is the first book to systematize scientific knowledge about trichoscopy.Rudnicka L, Olszewska M, Rakowska A.

(born 12 October 1940) is a Catholic Archbishop. He was the Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations in Geneva until 13 February 2016. Early life He was born in Casoni di Mussolente, Italy. On 31 May 1965 he was ordained as priest of the Congregation of the Missionaries of St. Charles. He earned his Ph.D. in sociology from Fordham University. He co-founded the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank based in New York, and wrote a book on the historic legacy of New York's Italian parishes. On 27 June 1989 Pope John Paul II appointed him Secretary of the Pontifical Council for Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant Peoples. He was named titular Archbishop of Cercina and Apostolic Nuncio to Eritrea and Ethiopia on 27 June 1996, consecrated on 17 August 1996, and transferred to the titular see of Acelum. In addition to those responsibilities, he was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Djibouti on 23 December 2000. Geneva role On 10 June 2003, Tomasi was appointed Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations in Geneva. He was widely criticised in September 2009 following a speech in which he praised the Church's record on child sex abuse in comparison with that of other organisations by arguing that \\"Of all priests involved in the abuses, 80 to 90 percent belong to this sexual orientation minority which is sexually engaged with adolescent boys between the ages of 11 and 17\\" and \\"As the Catholic church has been busy cleaning its own house, it would be good if other institutions and authorities, where the major part of abuses are reported, could do the same and inform the media about it.\\" Tomasi \\"encouraged passage of an international protocol that would give children a direct line of communication to local and international authorities when they are victims of violence or their rights are violated.... Tomasi...said the measure \\"will become a significant instrument of the human rights system.\\" The document would add to the protections provided in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Speaking on 8 June 2011 at the U.N. International Labor Conference in Geneva, Archbishop Tomasi urged that all involved in \\"the burgeoning and mercurial economic system\\" work to foster fundamental principles that ensure respect for the common good and protection of the most vulnerable. In 2014 the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child issued a report described as \\"a scathing indictment of the Vatican‚Äôs handling of child sexual abuse cases involving clerics, releasing a report that included criticism of church teachings on homosexuality, gender equality and abortion\\" which was seen as an indictment of the Catholic Church's handling of child sexual abuse cases involving clerics, going beyond how the church managed abuse allegations to include criticism of its teachings on homosexuality, gender equality and abortion. Archbishop Tomasi appeared before a U.N. committee in Geneva. Vatican officials said they were still studying the findings, but responded angrily to what they described as recommendations that were ideologically biased. Fr Thomas Rosica said that the U.N. report wrongly looked at Catholicism as a single organisation. Tomasi said that he suspected pro-gay rights NGOs had influenced the committee and \\"reinforced an ideological line\\" in the UN. No matter how sophisticated autonomous weapons systems are, they can never comply with international human rights law. \\"Meaningful human involvement is absolutely essential in decisions affecting the life and death of human beings,\\" Archbishop Tomasi, told experts meeting 13‚Äì16 May to discuss lethal autonomous weapons systems such as drones. Archbishop Tomasi said it was essential \\"to recognise that autonomous weapon systems can never replace the human capacity for moral reasoning, including in the context of war.\\" \\"The development of autonomous weapon systems will ultimately lead to widespread proliferation,\\" he said, and \\"the development of complex autonomous weapon systems which remove the human actor from lethal decision-making is short-sighted and may irreversibly alter the nature of warfare in a less humane direction, leading to consequences we cannot possibly foresee, but that will in any case increase the dehumanisation of warfare.\\" Speaking to Vatican Radio in August 2014 Archbishop Tomasi commented that \\"Maybe military action is necessary at this moment\\" in Iraq. He told Vatican Radio that \\"what seems to be particularly important in the letter of the Holy Father to Ban Ki-moon is the expressions that he uses: the tragic situation 'compels' the international community. There is a moral imperative, so to (speak), a necessity to act.\\" He added that the UN charter notes that at times \\"dialogue, negotiations, fail and large numbers of people find themselves at risk: at risk of genocide, at risk of having their fundamental, their basic human rights violated. In this case, when every other means has been attempted, article 42 of the Charter of the United Nations becomes possible justification for not only imposing sanctions of economic nature on the state or the group or the region that violates the basic human rights of people, but also to use force. All the force that is necessary to stop this evil and this tragedy.\\" In 2015 Archbishop Tomasi said jihadists were committing \\"genocide\\" and must be stopped. He said: \\"What's needed is a co-ordinated and well- thought-out coalition to do everything possible to achieve a political settlement without violence. But if that's not possible, then the use of force will be necessary.\\" He added: \\"We have to stop this kind of genocide. Otherwise we'll be crying out in the future about why we didn't so something, why we allowed such a terrible tragedy to happen.\\" Tomasi retired upon the announcement of the appointment of his successor in Geneva on 13 February 2016.

Company information The company, headquartered in the Bunkyo, Tokyo ward of Tokyo, was founded in 1981 under the name , making it one of Japan's oldest adult video firms. The Samm label's name was taken from S&M; and that genre dominated the company's videos in the early 1980s but the direction changed in the mid-1980s under the influence of three directors, Kaoru Toyoda, Ryutaro Kanno and Yukihiko Shimamura. In 1984 the Miss Christine label was created for videos with single featured actresses. The Tiffany label came later and was made popular by actress Hikaru Hoshino. Among early AV actresses who performed for h.m.p. were Keiko Nakazawa who appeared for the Samm label with the video Pakkeeji Zenmen o Hy≈çji released in 1986, Rena Murakami, who debuted on the company's Miss Christine label in March 1988, and AV Idol Yumika Hayashi who made her debut with the Miss Christine video Shigamitsuku 18-sai: oj≈çsama wa shitanai in June 1989.

In the controversial venture frowned upon by Sony, h.m.p. offered adult videos for UMD media, the proprietary disc format used in the Sony PlayStation Portable (PSP). By early 2006, according to company spokesperson Yumiko Okazaki, sales in Japan \\"weren't bad\\" but were far less than the same titles on DVD or VHS. She said the company would release another set in 2006. They were also offered overseas by JList.com whose founder, Peter Payne, estimated sales of UMD discs at about 500 a month. The provocative h.m.p. advertising campaign for the PSP discs touted the advantages of portable porn. The discs featured such h.m.p. superstars as Risa Coda and Hikaru Koto and in addition to two hours of video, many contained adult minigames playable on the PSP. The last of the discs, labeled with ID codes HOUM-00001 to HOUM-00013, was released April 21, 2006. h.m.p. labels h.m.p. has produced videos under a number of labels including the basic h.m.p. label which uses production codes beginning in HODV or HRDV.

It had two tracks and two side platforms, and was located along Tilson Place between Virginia Avenue and St. Mary's Avenue. History As part of a grade crossing elimination project on the South Beach Branch, the grade crossing at St. Mary's Avenue was eliminated, and the station was rebuilt in the fall of 1937. This structure remained in place until well after the branch's abandonment in 1953. There was an overpass at the new station connecting the two platforms. At Clifton Avenue, there was a pedestrian underpass which ran underground beneath the tracks that was built in 1937. This underpass was frequently used by students from Public School 13. The two buildings of P.S. 13 were later on replaced with one building, which stands on the South Beach Branch right-of- way. This station was abandoned when the SIRT discontinued passenger service on the South Beach Branch to Wentworth Avenue at midnight on March 31, 1953 because of city-operated bus competition. Previously, south of the station at Hylan Boulevard, there was an overpass, that has been filled in since the line was abandoned. The Virginia Avenue trestle was demolished in 1999. There is also discussion of rebuilding a station on the SIR Main Line, which would bridge the longest gap between two stations (Grasmere and Clifton). This proposed station could be named Rosebank.

It has been used by several recent presidents for various campaign related Whistle Stop Tours. History Georgia 300, as it is called, is a classic looking heavyweight observation car from the golden era of rail travel that was built by the Pullman Standard Co. shops in 1930. Sporting a Packard blue with silver striping livery, the train car operated as a lounge car named the General Polk on the New Orleans-New York Crescent Limited (operated by the L&N;, West Point Route, Southern, and PennsylvaniaSouthern Railway, Ties (company magazine), July‚ÄìAugust 1972: The Southern Crescent), and was later purchased by the Georgia Railroad and reconfigured to Office Car 300. The Georgia Railroad used the car in trips to venues like The Masters Tournament and the Kentucky Derby. It ran until its retirement in 1982 after being made redundant as surplus due to the merger between Georgia Railroad and Family Lines. =Private ownership= Heard, who owns a rail yard in Orange Park, Florida, purchased the car in 1985 and made a series of refurbishments in 1986, 1989, 1995, 2000 and 2008. The car has a dining room, an observation lounge, one master bedroom, two additional bedrooms, two bathrooms with showers, a section lounge, crew quarters, and kitchen. It is Amtrak compliant and compatible to be used on most scheduled Amtrak trains as well as other private venues. The car is a constant work-in-progress with carpets and fabrics constantly being improved. During 2006‚Äì2008, the interior and exterior of the car were completely repainted, along with the addition of new monogrammed linens and bed-coverings in the bedrooms and a recovering of the couch in the observation lounge. Use by US Presidents Barack Obama aboard the Georgia 300 The Georgia 300 has hosted/carried Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama. In 2004, presidential candidates John F. Kerry and running mate Sen. John Edwards, traveled aboard the car from St. Louis to Kingman, Ariz., following the Democratic Convention in Boston. =George H.W. Bush= The Georgia 300 was used as a support car during George H.W. Bush campaign to be president in 1992. This use is thought to have prompted further use of the car by other presidents. =Bill Clinton= The car again was used by Bill Clinton for his 21st Century Express train for the 1996 campaign season, in a nod to his 1992 campaign with a bus. The 13-car train used the Georgia 300 along with other Amtrak, private, and host railroad CSX equipment and engines. =Barack Obama= Barack Obama utilized the Georgia 300 twice; first in April 2008 for a trip between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, Pa; and secondly before his 2009 inauguration on a whistle stop to Washington DC, along a similar route to that used by Abraham Lincoln. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) prevented private planes, news helicopters, balloonists and others from flying anywhere near the airspace above the train route. These rolling NOTAM flight restrictions prevented general aviation from flying near stations and above the linear route of sections of the Northeast Corridor railroad line \\"for Special Security Reasons\\". The train used consisted of two Amtrak GE Genesis locomotives, numbers 44 and 120, several Amfleet coaches and cafes, and the Georgia 300 at the rear.
