He served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the American Civil War, and he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. He drew maps of Israel, Japan and China. He authored poetry and a memoir. Early life Fontaine was born on October 10, 1829 in Washington County, Texas, near Gay Hill. He had a half brother, Reverend P. H. Fontaine, who became a Methodist minister. At the age of 10, Fontaine ran away from school in Austin and was captured by the Comanche; he was released four years later. He attended school in North Carolina. Career Fontaine joined the United States Navy and served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1846‚Äì1848, including the Siege of Veracruz. Fontaine first worked as a surveyor for the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad. He explored the Amazon River with William Lewis Herndon as well as Israel (then known as Palestine), where he helped draw maps. He drew maps of Russia and sketches of the Great Wall of China. He traveled to Japan with Matthew C. Perry, and he \\"was instrumental in ridding the seas of the Malay pirates.\\" His autobiography states he participated in the Crimean War. Fontaine joined the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War of 1861‚Äì1865. He served under generals Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee. He became a Major on July 28, 1863. He took part in the Battle of Mine Run and the Battle of Bloody Angle. He was a dispatch bearer at the Siege of Vicksburg. His autobiography states that he was responsible for sinking the famed cannon \\"Whistling Dick\\" in the Mississippi River to prevent it falling into Union hands. He said that he was wounded 67 times during the war. In an 1892 letter, he said that he had been with the 2nd Virginia Cavalry, Company I. An article in America's Civil War says that he was a spy with the Mississippi infantry. During the Reconstruction era, he joined the Ku Klux Klan chapter in Hinds County and Madison County. An essay he wrote about the Klan was also published in The Ku Klux Klan or Invisible Empire by Mrs S. E. F. Rose. He is quoted as writing, \\"In the courts of this invisible, silent, and mighty empire, there were no hung juries, no laws delayed, no reversals, on senseless technicalities by any Supreme Court, because from its Court there was no appeal, and punishment was sure and swift, because there was no executive to pardon.\\" Fontaine authored several books. He composed poems, like Oenore, Only a Soldier or Dying Prisoner in Camp Chase, and claimed to have written All Quiet Along the Potomac Tonight. He published his memoir, My Life and My Lectures. Another book was about the Ku Klux Klan: The Cause and the Effect of the Ku Klux Klan in the South. Personal life and death Fontaine married Miss Brickell; they had three sons and three daughters. They resided in Lyon, Mississippi. Fontaine died on October 1, 1921 in Lyon, Mississippi, at 92.

He is accused of murdering thirty people in various municipalities and cities in Colombia, including Tenerife, Sabanalarga, Aguachica, Santa Marta, Valledupar and Puerto Wilches. Modus operandi Ram√≠rez chose motorists between 19 and 30 years of age. None measured more than 1.70 metres tall or weighed more than 60 kilos. This was done in order to make them submit easily. His tactic was simple and effective. He took advantage of his charisma and loquacity to generate trust. He asked to be taken on a motorcycle taxi to a carefully chosen place, on the outskirts of the cities where he acted. Taking advantage of the fact that he was in the back of the vehicle and after talking with the driver all the way, when they stopped he held the driver by the throat and suffocated them, taking care of them to not die, until they lost consciousness. The vast majority of people were killed by suffocation or torture, according to examinations of forensics experts. Also he kept several personal objects from victims, like wallets, cards, mobiles, helmets, etc. Ram√≠rez only confessed to the murder of a person known as John Jairo Amador de la Rosa, after authorities found the body wrapped up in ropes. It is believed that the murderer was only dedicated to stealing motorcycles in various municipalities, but according to several specialists, Ram√≠rez acted in an antisocial way, similar to a psychopath. Arrest and trial He was captured in 2012. He was ultimately found guilty of several murders and sentenced to 57 years in prison, later lowered to 34 years for \\"acceptance of charges\\". Luis Gregorio Ram√≠rez Maestro will be released from prison in the year 2032 when he has been in prison for 20 years, due to the reductions of sentences in the Colombian justice system of three fifths of the sentence.

With the twelve jury members not being able to agree on a verdict by the end of the day's proceedings, they were locked up for the night. They returned to court the following morning and told Mein they had still not agreed on a verdict with the foreman stating that some jury members had wanted \\"to make a law for themselves\\", alluding to their preference to see Barry convicted of manslaughter rather than murder. Mein responded by telling the jury that if they did, they were acting corruptly and were being dishonourable and disgraceful. Mein gave the jury one more opportunity to deliberate and reach a verdict for the offence of which Barry had been charged with. The jury then deliberated for another ten minutes before returning to the courtroom. When the jury was asked whether they had reached a verdict, the foreman said that they had. When asked if they had found the prisoner guilty or not guilty, the foreman said: \\"Guilty - with a strong recommendation to mercy on account of the previous good character which he had, and the strong provocation which he had from his wife\\" Mein said he \\"emphatically concurred\\" with the jury's verdict of guilty, but said while the recommendation of mercy would be conveyed to the authorities, the matter would lie entirely with the Executive Council of Queensland. Mein warned Barry not to raise false hope of a reprieve before sentencing him to be hanged by the neck until he was dead. Petition for reprieve Despite the brutality of his crime, Barry managed to garner some sympathy from some members of the Rockhampton community and the jury at his trial, supposedly motivated by his good standing in the community and a claim that his wife had allegedly been unfaithful. Some believed her act of the \\"greatest possible immorality\\" had provoked Barry and because of his \\"excitable temperament\\", he was \\"driven\\" to murder his wife in \\"sheer desperation\\".(2 June 1890) Editorial: The Barry Case - The Execution Takes Place, page 3, The Daily Northern Argus.

McDonough and a prison officer accompanied Barry to the foot of the scaffold where Barry knelt and recited several prayers. Barry and McDonough then walked up to the executioner on the scaffold. The executioner instructed Barry where to stand and as he took his position and the noose was being adjusted, he exclaimed: \\"Jesus, have mercy on my soul\\" which he continued to repeat until the bolt was drawn when he died instantly.

The game is based on fictional events that occurred during the Renaissance. The game is available in English, French, German, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Slovak, Russian, Turkish, Italian, Polish, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Hindi and Malay. In 2019, Blue Brain Games has released a sequel The House of Da Vinci 2.  Plot  The story is set up in Florence, Italy during the Renaissance. The player is the Leonardo Da Vinci‚Äôs most promising apprentice. Leonardo has disappeared. The player starts searching for the truth in his house. However, Leonardo's workshop is full of puzzles, inventions, escape mechanisms and objects hidden in all corners of decorated rooms. The players have to solve series of puzzles in different rooms in order to find whether Da Vinci has left any message for him. Gameplay Apart from complex puzzles that are physics based, the player gains access to two lenses with supernatural abilities. With one, he can see hidden codes and with the other he can see what had happened in the past. The player occasionally gets to see letters from his master Da Vinci and also from the antagonists. The player gets closer to finding the truth after completion of every level.  Development  Blue Brain Games is an indie team of graphic artists and developers, all of whom are people interested in both 3D puzzle games and the renaissance genius Leonardo Da Vinci. The House of Da Vinci was successfully funded on Kickstarter in late 2016. 2,391 adventure game enthusiasts backed the game.  Reception  Merlina McGovern of adventuregamers.com rated the game 3.5 out of 5 wrote that \\"Although The House of Da Vinci is slightly marred by persnickety mechanics and the occasionally frustrating puzzle, exploring the mind of a genius by reverse engineering his inventions will pull you into a gorgeous Renaissance world and keep you challenged throughout.\\" AppUnwrapper', in their review wrote, \\"If you're a fan of The Room series by Fireproof Games and can't wait for the fourth one to release, Blue Brain Games' The House of Da Vinci is the closest thing you can get to the real thing.\\" Reviewing the iOS version, Emily Sowden of PocketGamer said \\"The House of Da Vinci has two major areas to focus on. One: the unavoidable fact that it's essentially The Room in a different package. Two: the unavoidable fact that it's actually a decent game.\\" Maria Alexander of Droidgamer rated the game 9/10. The game was rated 9 for aesthetics, 9.2 for gameplay, 8.7 for innovation and 9.1 for value. \\"The House of Da Vinci is a massive, gorgeous, cleverly designed puzzler that gives The Room, its main inspiration, a pretty good run for its money.\\", she said.  Sequel  On December 4, 2019, Blue Brain Games released a sequel, The House of Da Vinci 2, for iOS. A Google Play Store version was released on February 18, 2020, with a Steam version on May 29, 2020.

The organization reformed as a political party on 20 July 2019. Goals The Formosa Alliance was established on 7 April 2018. Its founding leader was , at the time also chairman of Formosa Television. Other members included Chen Shui-bian, Huang Kuo-chang, Lee Teng-hui, Yu Shyi-kun, and the Taiwan Solidarity Union, as well as several overseas Taiwanese organizations. The organization intended to hold a referendum on independence on 6 April 2019, though this did not occur. Other goals included advocating a change in the island's name from the Republic of China to Taiwan, and to apply for membership in the United Nations. The alliance's first full meeting was held on 16 June 2018. In April 2019, the Formosa Alliance announced a split between it and the Democratic Progressive Party, as well as a new color scheme emphasizing turquoise, a representation of the land of Taiwan and the ocean. The alliance rebranded as a political party, and expanded its platform. Alongside support for the independence referendum and admittance to the United Nations, the Formosa Alliance sought to draft a new constitution, introduce a new national anthem, adopt a new flag, and normalize diplomatic relations with other nations. Compared with the Democratic Progressive Party, from which it split, the Formosa Alliance is more socially conservative. On 20 July 2019, the Formosa Alliance was reconstituted as a political party, with Presbyterian Church in Taiwan minister as its first chairman. Lo named as the party's deputy chairman. Party officials stated that it would not nominate a candidate to contest the 2020 Taiwan presidential election, but that it would field ten candidates in the concurrent 2020 Taiwan legislative election. On 10 September 2019, Formosa Alliance executive committee member Ou Chong-jing stated that he would obtain registration forms for the 2020 presidential election from the Central Election Commission. Ou told Taiwan News that the Formosa Alliance had planned to back his legislative campaign in New Taipei, but subsequently announced that a presidential candidate would be named without a primary. Ou then acquired the petition required of independent presidential candidacies, without the party's support, though he stated that he would wait until the deadline to register presidential bids, 17 September 2019, for the Formosa Alliance's decision. On 17 September 2019, Annette Lu announced that she and Peng Pai-hsien, via petition, would form the Formosa Alliance ticket for the presidential election, though Lu remained a member of the Democratic Progressive Party. Lu and Peng ended their campaign on 2 November 2019.

P. xanthostoma is a member of the genus Prochyliza, which contains eleven species. The adult flies are found through North America and are brown-bodied, with orange and black coloring. Mating occurs on animal carcasses and male perform mating rituals; females engage in ejaculate feeding. The waltzing fly is known for its exaggerated sexual dimorphism and has thus become a prominent model for sexual dimorphism and larval behavior. These organisms are known as cheese skippers because when startled, the larvae (which often infest cured meats and cheese) can leap several inches into the air. P. xanthostoma is an important model organism for sexual selection, larval behavior, and adult reproductive success and survivability.  Description  The adult waltzing flies are narrow, brown-bodied with legs that are orange medial to the body and black lateral to the body. Waltzing flies also have a slip of silver underneath their eyes. The wings are brownish-yellow and the body length ranges from 4 mm to 6 mm. Waltzing flies have elongated antennae, head, and forelegs. Elongated bodies in P. xanthostoma males are sexually selected for. Unsurprisingly, the degree by which elongated bodies in the male P. xanthostoma is selected for depends on degree of exaggeration of the trait (condition dependence). P. xanthostoma males have a mean head length and width of 124 mm and 84 mm.P. xanthostoma females have a mean head length and width of 104 mm and 104 mm. P. xanthostoma males have mean antenna lengths and foretibia lengths of 98 mm and 104 mm, whereas P. xanthostoma females have mean antenna lengths and foretibia lengths of 61 mm and 95 mm. = Condition Dependence = Both male and female P. xanthostoma are easily identifiable by their elongated head and thorax. The degree by which the head is elongated is more condition dependent for male than female P. xanthostoma. The degree of elongation of the head in males persists even when controlling for body size. How condition dependence varies between different traits has not yet been elucidated, however it may vary based on the form of selection or the cost of expressing the trait. Also, evidence does not suggest that the evolution of condition dependence was catalyzed by sexual selection. = Environmental Effects on Body Shape = The specific environmental condition varied in studies investigating environmental dependence on body shape was larval diet. Genetic variation at the loci located on chromosomes are correlated to environmental variation in resource abundance and male P. xanthostoma body shape. The degree of elongation of the head in males persists even when controlling for body size in high-condition (high quality larval diet) males. Changes in environmental factors failed to explain condition dependence on female P. xanthostoma flies.  Distribution and Habitat  The waltzing flies are distributed throughout North America, mostly near the carcasses where they lay their eggs, during the spring, summer, and fall.  Life history  The natural larval substrate is carcasses, but waltzing fly larvae are also found in cheeses and cured meats, which makes them a pest. The waltzing fly sex ratio is strongly biased towards females. Males that survive to adulthood must therefore compete with other males in combat to mate with females in a polygynous mating system. thumb  Food resources  Waltzing fly larvae are found in carrion, especially moose carrion, and this is their natural substrate. However, the larvae are now also found in animal products that humans eat, such as cheese and meats‚Äîthus the name \\"cheese skipper.\\" Adult waltzing flies eat primarily carrion, but will also consume fungi, cheese, and many other foods. Laboratory experiments on P. xanthostoma approximate cheese fly diets by feeding them lean ground beef that had aged for several days.  Mating  Mating occurs during the spring in sun spots on moose carcasses. Females with unfertilized ovules lie in sunny spots and males attempt to woo the females while fighting amongst each other for access. A male waltzing fly will try to attract a female by dancing side-to-side in front of her and lifting the front portion of his body upwards. If the female accepts him as a mate, she raises her forelegs and he touches his forelegs to hers. The male waltzing fly would then propel himself onto the female's back and rubs the female's abdomen. Then, he places his ejaculate into the female's ovule, after which the female ingests the ejaculate. The ejaculate contains sperm and fluids from accessory glands. The evolutionary benefit of the female ingesting the male's ejaculate is unclear, though studies found female waltzing flies that ingested ejaculate has had higher fitness than flies that were prevented from ingesting ejaculate. Males may benefit from ejaculate feeding by decreasing the number of eggs females have available for other mates, thereby increasing his paternity. The male, however, makes no observed attempt to urge the female to ingest his ejaculate. Overall, mating typically occurs for 4 to 6 minutes in total. Afterwards, females oviposit, the larvae grow on the carcass. Females typically only mate once. = Ejaculate feeding = The time until oviposition, probability of oviposition, and chance of survival are all affected by whether or not female waltzing flies feed on male ejaculate during mating. The ejaculate feeding behavior leads to oviposition occurring more quickly compared to when the female waltzing flies did not ingest the ejaculate. Female waltzing flies that fed on ejaculate also had higher survival than flies that did not feed on ejaculate. Ejaculate feeding has been suggested as originating from sexual conflict. Waltzing fly females typically only mate once, and the sperm may have evolved to ensure the waltzing fly male's paternity by preventing multiple mating. There are several possible reasons why lack of female re-mating may be a form of sexual conflict, including substances in the ejaculate that decrease the chance of a female's re-mating, evolutionary response to male coercion, and manipulation. Females decrease re-mating rate by exhibiting resistance behaviors such as moving or flying away when a male is attempting to copulate. Researchers therefore hypothesize there is antagonistic coevolution between the ejaculate in male waltzing flies and the female re-mating rate. =Sexual dimorphism=  Sexually dimorphic traits in Males  In waltzing flies, sexual dimorphism primarily seen is exaggerated elongation of male appendages. Male head capsules, forelegs, and antennae are long and narrow, which helps increase success in male-to-male combat as well as in courting female waltzing flies for mating. Female P. xanthostoma have been observed to prefer male P.xanthostoma with more a more elongated body, which suggests a more elongated body in male P.xanthostoma could be a sign of good genes.Though longer bodies in male. P. xanthostoma are sexually selected for, elongated bodies are considered a nonsexual trait since male P. xanthostoma do not use their bodies to directly compete sexually with other males. Furthermore, maintaining large body sizes is costly for male P. xanthostoma flies to maintain, which gives further evidence that the trait is a sexual trait.There is an evolutionary trade-off related to head length; elaborately long heads are sexually selected for in waltzing fly males (females prefer them) whereas elongated heads are selected against in the combat between males. In male P. xanthostoma, these sexually selected for traits may improve male P. xanthostoma reproductive success but decrease overall fitness. Some sexually selected traits are more costly to male P. xanthostoma than others. For example, elongated heads in male P. xanthostoma may be more detrimental than elongated antenna.  Sexually dimorphic traits in females  Female P. xanthostoma flies that were fed a high quality diet exhibited shorter antennae with respect to their body size relative to female P. xanthostoma flies that were fed a low quality diet. = Male combat = Combat between males involves two males standing up on their hind legs and swinging at each other with their heads and antennae after a period of display that is likely used to determine which fly larger than the other. These battles can last up to two minutes, and the winner earns the right to court females.  Genetics  = Genetic Effects on Body Shape = Genetic variation at loci on the chromosomes of P. xanthostoma flies are correlated with efficiency of the acquisition of resources as well as male body shape. More specifically, genetically, head length and width in males are negatively correlated to condition (high or low). However, genetic factors failed to explain condition dependence in females.  Interactions with humans  Cheese flies are common house pests in North America, infesting cheeses and meats with their larvae.

Three historically black universities are located near here: Fisk University, Meharry Medical College and Tennessee State University. In the 1940s-1960s, it attracted many rock and roll as well as rhythm and blues artists. It was a center for the Nashville sit-ins in the 1960s, but the construction of Interstate 40 across the street led to its economic decline. History In the Antebellum era, the street was a footpath running \\"from the Hadley plantation on the west to the Cumberland River on the east\\". It later was improved as a road for wagons and horses. During the American Civil War, it was straddled by Fort Gilliam, a Union Army camp, and a \\"large campus of runaway slaves were opened in the area.\\" The street was named in honor of U.S President Thomas Jefferson. After the war, Fisk University was established here and Fort Gilliam became the site of its main building, Jubilee Hall, constructed in 1872. The campus of Tennessee State University was built across Hadley Park, on the western tip of Jefferson Street. By the 1930s, the Meharry Medical College was relocated west of Fisk University from its original location in South Nashville. The street was surrounded by three historically black universities. By the 1920s‚Äì1930s, the street became a popular neighborhood among the black middle class, and many churches, such as Mount Zion Baptist Church, Pleasant Green Baptist Missionary Church and Jefferson Street Missionary Baptist Church, were built here. In the 1940s‚Äì1960s, the street's entertainment venues were a center for rock'n'roll as well as rhythm and blues. Artists including Jimi Hendrix, Etta James, Ray Charles, Little Richard, Otis Redding and Billy Cox played in clubs such as the Del Morocco, the New Era Club, Maceo's, Club Baron or Club Stealaway. During the Civil Rights era, the street became a center for organizing the Nashville sit-ins. While the protests took place elsewhere (including in Downtown Nashville), activists planned their protests on Jefferson Street, and they were supported by \\"Jefferson Street business owners and residents.\\" In the late 1960s, Interstate 40 was built across Jefferson Street, which broke up the black community and resulted in its economic decline. In the 1950s, the interstate had been projected to be built near the campus of Vanderbilt University, then a whites-only university, but city officials changed their minds in the 1960s. As a result, many African-American residents were displaced and moved to the Bordeaux area in North Nashville. By the 2000s, residents attempted to \\"revitalize\\" the Jefferson Street community. In 2017, it was decided that the music history of Jefferson Street would be chronicled in the National Museum of African American Music due to open in 2019. The museum will be located on 5th and Broadway, near the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, far from Jefferson Street. In March 2017, the Muslim American Cultural Center, a new mosque, opened on the street. In May 2019, media coverage suggested African- American property owners were being pressured into selling their buildings to developers, who reported them for coding violations if they refused to sell.

Troops led personally by Mobutu secured a strategic bridge near the town of Kamanyola.Young and Turner 170 In 1993 it consisted of the 11th Infantry Brigade, the 12th Infantry Brigade, and the 14th Infantry Brigade.See Michela Wrong, The Emperor Mobutu, Transition‚ÄîIssues 81 & 82 (Volume 9, Number 1 and 2), 2000, pp. 92‚Äì112. After the Shaba I incursion, the division, at the time considered the army's best formation, and considered the president's own, was assigned permanently to Shaba. Zairian senior military officials, dissatisfied by the North Korean efforts, even asked in December 1975 that the U.S. to take over the Kamanyola Division, saying that \\"the North Koreans had left the Kamanyola poorly trained and without spares for the equipment they had provided.\\" (1976KINSHASA00091_b) As part of a second invasion by the former Katangan gendarmerie, known as Shaba II in May‚ÄìJune 1978, was only dispersed with the despatch of the French 2e r√©giment √©tranger de parachutistes and a battalion of the Belgian Paracommando Regiment. Kamanyola Division units collapsed almost immediately. French units fought the Battle of Kolwezi to recapture the town from the FLNC. The U.S. provided logistical assistance. In 1988 the CIA described the Kamanyola Division as located in Shaba and consisting of 4,100 personnel, with the 14th Brigade the only combat ready formation.Central Intelligence Agency, 'Zaire: The Military Under Mobutu (Deleted)', document created 1/11/1988, accessible via Freedom of Information Act Electronic Reading Room, http://www.foia.cia.gov/.

A taxonomic revision of the genus published in 2013 listed 25 species, which exhibit a disjunct distribution. There are 22 species of the genus described from Australia, with single species also being found in each of New Caledonia, Bolivia, and North America.Lord and McHugh, Abstract, p.1  Taxonomy  The genus Deretaphrus was erected by Edward Newman in 1842, when he described four new species of beetle from specimens that had been collected in Port Phillip, Australia, which was then part of New South Wales. Of these four species, the first listed, D. fossus, became the type of the genus.Lord and McHugh, p. 6 The other species initially assigned to the genus, D. puteus, D. illusus and D. vittatus, were subsequently moved out of Deretaphrus, initially to the genus Bothrideres.Lord and McHugh, p. 10  Life cycle  = Larva = The beetles in this genus have ectoparasitic larvae, the first instar being a mobile planidium, which is adapted to locate suitable hosts. Later instars have a more typical beetle-grub morphology and are typically found under tree bark, feeding on cerambycid and buprestid woodboring beetle grubs. The final larval instar spins a silken cocoon in which to pupate: an unusual character among beetles. Which part of the larva secretes the silk has not been determined, and it could come from the mouth or from anal glands.Lord and McHugh, pp. 11‚Äì12; where the planidium is referred to as a triungulin. = Adult = Adults are most often found under tree bark, or on its outer surface at night, but have also been collected at light traps. Examination of their gut contents suggests that their diet consists of plant material.  Distribution  Species of the genus Deretaphrus are principally found in Australia. In 1872 George Henry Horn described D. oregonensis from North America. Appended to his formal description is a note describing his initial disbelief that the first specimen of the species that he had been sent was actually, as claimed, from California. > A specimen was received several years since from California, but from a > source whence Australian species had been sent, and little credit was > therefore given to the authenticity of the locality, especially as all the > known species were Australian. Lately, however, another has been attained > free from any suspicion of error, and I have therefore ventured to name it. By the time he made his description, Horn was aware that John Lawrence LeConte and Thomas de Grey, 6th Baron Walsingham were in possession of specimens of D. oregonensis that had undoubtedly been collected in America. The species has since been found in a number of states to the west of the Rockies, and in British Columbia, ranging from the Pacific Northwest to California. In 1903 Antoine Henri Grouvelle described D. interruptus from New Caledonia. A South American species was added to the genus in 2013 when Lord and McHugh described D. boliviensis, on the basis of a single specimen that had been collected in Bolivia.Lord and McHugh, p. 21‚Äì22 Lord and McHugh describe this disjunct distribution as \\"very odd\\", and suggest that D. boliviensis may have a wider distribution in South and Central America.Lord and McHugh, pp. 12‚Äì13  Species list  The following were treated as species by Nathan P. Lord and Joseph V. McHugh in their 2013 revision of the genus: * D. aequaliceps Blackburn, 1903 * D. alveolens Carter and Zeck, 1937 * D. analis Lea, 1898 * D. antennatus Lord and McHugh, 2013 * D. boliviensis Lord and McHugh, 2013 * D. bucculentus Elston, 1923 * D. carinatus Lord and McHugh, 2013 * D. erichsoni Newman, 1855 * D. fossus Newman, 1842 * D. gracilis Blackburn, 1903 * D. hoplites Lord and McHugh, 2013 * D. ignarus Pascoe, 1862 * D. incultus Carter and Zeck, 1937 * D. interruptus Grouvelle, 1903 * D. iridescens Blackburn, 1903 * D. lateropunctatus Lord and McHugh, 2013 * D. ocularis Lord and McHugh, 2013 * D. oregonensis Horn, 1872 * D. parviceps Lea, 1898 * D. piceus (Germar, 1848) * D. puncticollis Lea, 1898 * D. rodmani Lord and McHugh, 2013 * D. viduatus Pascoe, 1862 * D. wollastoni Newman, 1855 * D. xanthorrhoeae Lea, 1898 Lord and McHugh list three morphotypes, all from Australia, that could not be determined according to the above list, but were not described as new species for lack of sufficient material.

Samsen or spelled Sam Sen (, ) is a road and neighbourhood in Bangkok considered to be one of Bangkok's oldest. Samsen road starts from Bang Lamphu intersection in the area of Bang Lamphu within Phra Nakhon district and wends northeast to Dusit district as far as it ends at Kiakkai intersection, covering 4.6 km (2.8 mi). It runs parallel to east Chao Phraya river all the route.  History  Samsen began in Ayutthaya period (1351‚Äì1767) in the reign of King Narai (1633‚Äì88). Portuguese came to live and work in the kingdom and the king allowed them to settle in Samsen. At that time, this area was a paddy field and canal by Khlong Samsen (Samsen canal), which is believed to be a natural canal. The Portuguese founded Immaculate Conception Church in around 1674, the oldest church in Thailand. In the reigns of King Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Rama I) and King Nangklao (Rama III) of Rattanakosin kingdom, Christians Khmers and Annamese (Vietnamese) who escaped crackdowns in their country migrated to Siam (now Thailand). They were allowed by the king to settle in the area nearby Portuguese's church in Samsen. The area became known as \\"Ban Khmer\\" (‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏°‡∏£) and \\"Ban Yuan\\" (‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏ç‡∏ß‡∏ô). Samsen has at least two Thai temples, which date to the Ayutthaya period or earlier, including Wat Rachathiwat and Wat Thewarat Kunchorn. In the past, the area of Samsen to Pak Kret in Nonthaburi used to be a place where abundance of toli shad (Tenualosa toli) was found. They will swim from the sea to spawn in freshwater sources on the Chao Phraya river in Bangkok area to the north. Therefore they are fished in large numbers and causing to be in an endangered state at present.Jaruthanin, Kittipong and Chavalit, Vidthayanon, ‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏à‡∏∑‡∏î‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏î ‡πë‡πê ‡∏ä‡∏ô‡∏¥‡∏î‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢ (The Top - Ten Endangered Freshwater Fishes of Thailand), Aquarium Biz , Vol. 2 Issue 16 (October 2011)  Etymology  \\"Samsen\\" has no specific meaning in Thai. It may have derived from Pali or from Bahasa Melayu. Legendarily a floating Buddha image required up to three hundred thousand people to raise it from the water. \\"Samsen\\" is similar to \\"Sam Saen\\", which means three hundred thousand. This Buddha is a Buddha image in stopping the rainstorm attitude that is enshrined in front of Samsen Police Station today, namely Luang Por Phuttha Samsen, or known in short as Luang Por Samsen. Two related sub-districts are Samsen Nai in Phaya Thai and Samsen Nok in Huai Khwang districts. They are connected to Khlong Samsen rather than the road.  Road  Although it is short, Samsen road runs through historic and important places such as Bang Khun Phrom Palace and Bank of Thailand with Thewawes Palace, Thewet Bridge, Immaculate Conception Church, Saint Francis Xavier Church, Saint Gabriel's College, Vajira Hospital, Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University, Sukhothai Palace, National Library and Royal Pier, Thavasuki, Wat Bot Samsen, Boon Rawd Brewery Headquarters and Sappaya-Sapasathan, the new Parliament House. The road also a location of five piers for Chao Phraya Express Boat: Thewet (N15), Payap (N18), Irrigation Dept. (N19), Kheaw Khai Ka (N20), and Kiak Kai (N21). In addition, at the point that it intersects with Ratchawithi road (Sang Hi intersection) near the Krungthon Bridge (Sang Hi Bridge) on Ratchawithi road is also the location of the San Chao Mae Thapthim Samsen, a Chinese shrine of Shui Wei Sheng Niang, goddess of the sea according to the belief of Hainanese since ancient times, similar to Mazu. It is considered to be her oldest shrine in Bangkok, believed to have been built since the reign of King Nangklao.

It is located adjacent to the walls of the Contra-Aquincum Fortress and the Elisabeth Bridge. Its earliest features date back to the Romanesque period. In 1046 Bishop St. Gell√©rt was buried there. The 14th century Hungarian King Sigismund, supported the Gothic reconstructed style. During the reign of King Matthias, two new side ships were added. It was used as a mosque in Turkish times and its memory is a miracle (imaf√ºlke) in the south-eastern wall of the sanctuary. After a fire in 1723, between 1725 and 1739, it was restored in baroque style, under the direction of the master builder Gy√∂rgy Pauer J√°nos (1692-1752). In 1828, Istv√°n Kults√°r , the great theater organizer of the era of Enlightenment, was placed in the church's vault for eternal rest. In 1839, it was built with stalls selling the buttresses, which were dismantled in 1932. Then they found the Gothic windows and the twin bed. The church was restored several times: between 1805-1808 J√°nos Hild, Imre Steindl in 1889 and L√°szlo Ger≈ë, after 1945. The painting of the church interior was renovated in 1976‚Äì77. In 2010, in the parlor of the sanctuary behind the sanctuary, an Anjou-era throne of Virgin Mary was found, surprisingly intact. The exterior of the church was neglected until the facade was renovated in 2011 after the renovation of the park before it, according to Hungarian architect Mez≈ës Tam√°s. During the archaeological excavations carried out between 2014 and 2016, the camp commander's room was accessed and a sub-church was built. After the renovation, on August 15, 2016, the church was handed over to the faithful and visitors by Dr. P√©ter Erd≈ë. When the Elisabeth Bridge was being rebuilt after destruction during World War Two, the Communist government of Hungary sought to demolish the church, but through the Church's astute negotiation with Hungary's Communist government, the ecclesial authorities managed to save this historic treasure.

She managed to kill four people and poisoned three others who managed to survive. All of the victims were close to her, including family members and neighbours.  Biography  When she moved to Catalonia she first lived in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, on Riera Blanca Street, where she was known as \\"la bizca\\". This was a modest neighbourhood of workers, where she was considered a troubled woman, but without a criminal record. According to neighbours, she was prone to insults and street fights, and had debts in some shops in the area; she was greedy and seemingly illiterate according to what she declared to police. In 1991 Margarita moved with her husband, Luis Navarro, and their children Sonia and Javi to their in-laws' floor, partly because they had been discouraged but also to take care of her husband's father. Margarita and Carmen Nuez, her mother-in-law, did not get along because apparently the latter was a woman of authority and great character. In 1992, the father-in-law died and Carmen was hospitalized five times in the Clinical Hospital where she proclaimed her daughter-in-law is poisoning her. However, the performing analyzers gave a negative results. Currently, since 2016 she lives in the La Maurina neighbourhood of Terrassa.  Sentence  Margarita S√°nchez Guti√©rrez was sentenced to 34 years in prison for three crimes of injury, another three for robbery with violence and one crime for falsehood. She was acquitted of the murders when no cases of death due to cyanide were detected and because Margarita's intention was to drug and rob her relatives, not to kill them, according to the justice.

Today it is run by a non-profit organization, the Verein der Freunde der Sternwarte Regensburg e.V.. The observatory is accessible for visitors on Friday evenings.History of the observatory (German), visited 4 May 2018 History =1774 to 1902= Placidustower The precursor of the currently existing observatory was founded in 1774 at the Saint Emmeram's Abbey. Prince- Abbot Frobenius Forster dedicated two towers of the abbey which were prepared for astronomical and meteorological observations in the years 1774 and 1775.Bayerischer Anzeiger, 18 June 1938, page 8: Am Anfang war das Astrolabium When the abbey was dissolved in 1812, the observatory was moved into a tower in the city wall. This tower was named Placidustower after Placidus Heinrich, one of its first users and a monk of the Order of Saint Benedict. Placidus Heinrich introduced astronomy as a subject at the Lyzeum in Regensburg, a university dedicated to Philosophy and Theology. The remaining instruments are now part of the historical collection at the University of Regensburg. =1902 to 1968= Dome with refracting telescope made by Reinfelder. Due to the construction of a new road, the Placidustower was torn down in 1902.Wilhelm Schenz, 1930: Das erste Jahrhundert des Lyzeum Albertinum Regensburg (1810-1910), page 189 The government of Bavaria assigned 20,000 Mark to build a new observatory.Wilde, Sandra. \\"... denn ohne Observatorium giebt es keine Observationen\\": Astronomen und Sternwarten in Regensburg, 1773-1923. 1999.; page 125 Two new floors and a dome on top of the roof were constructed on top of an existing building used by the Lyzeum. The dome was produced by Heyde, a company located in Dresden. The construction was started in 1902 and finished in 1905. The dome received a refracting telescope build by Reinfelder. In the year 1919 physicist Professor Karl Stoeckl was appointed to the Lyzeum in Regensburg. In November 1919, a local newspaper announced a public talk about the Milky Way for the first Thursday in the new year.Regensburger Anzeiger, 10 November 1919 Since then Karl Stoeckl regularly opened the observatory to the public. In 1923 the Lyzeum was converted to a Philosophisch-theologische Hochschule (German for philosophical-theological college).

After the closure of the Philosophisch-theologische Hochschule in the year 1968, the observatory was sustained as a part of the Regensburg University of Applied Sciences through the efforts made by Prof. Dr. Bernhard He√ü and Alois Menath. In 1976 a non-profit club, the Verein der Freunde der Sternwarte Regensburg e.V., was founded and is running the observatory until today. In 1982 the observatory was renovated. During the renovation, the telescope from 1905 was permanently damaged and replaced by an apochromat build by Lichtenknecker.
