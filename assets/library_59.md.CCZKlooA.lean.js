It is an immunologic test routinely performed by clinical laboratories on the blood of people awaiting organ transplantation. In this test recipient cells are exposed to random cells of donor population and estimation risk of acute rejection. The PRA score is expressed as a percentage between 0% and 100%. It represents the proportion of the population to which the person being tested will react via pre-existing antibodies against human cell surface antigens, which include human leukocyte antigenHLA] and other polymorphic antigen systems. A PRA score greater than 6 is in danger, and over 20 requires a desensitization process, but its intensity varies. These antibodies target the surface antigens of target cells, such as HLAs. In other words, it is a test of the degree of alloimmunity in a graft recipient and thus a test that quantifies the risk of transplant rejection. Each population has a different demographic prevalence of particular antigens, so the PRA test panel constituents differ from country to country. A traditional PRA test is performed using a panel of lymphocytes from potential donor population. Since late 1990s, a purified HLA antigen panel has been used to replace a cell panel for the PRA test, based on the assumption that HLA is the major target antigen system of alloantibody reaction. However, the non-HLA antibody effect on the PRA test has been ignored. (ref:Human leukocyte antigen antibodies for monitoring transplant patients. Surg Today. 2005;35(8):605-12.) A high PRA value usually means that the individual is primed to react immunologically against a large proportion of the population. Individuals with a high PRA value are often termed \\"sensitized\\", which indicates that they have been exposed to \\"foreign\\" (or \\"non-self\\") proteins in the past and have developed antibodies to them. These antibodies develop following previous transplants, blood transfusions and pregnancy. Transplanting organs into recipients who are \\"sensitized\\" to the organs significantly increases the risk of rejection, resulting in higher immunosuppressant requirement and shorter transplant survival. People with high PRA scores therefore wait longer for an organ to which they have no pre- existing antibodies. Extensive efforts have been made to identify treatment regimes to reduce PRA in sensitized transplant candidates. In certain circumstances, plasma exchange, intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab and other \\"antibody-directed\\" immune therapies may be employed, but this is an area in which active investigation continues.

InfoSpace briefly became one of the largest internet companies in the American Northwest, before the crash of the dot-com bubble and a series of lawsuits involving Jain. In 2010 Jain co-founded Moon Express where he is the Executive Chairman, and in 2016 founded Viome, where he is the CEO. Early life Naveen Jain was born in 1959 to a Jain family. He grew up in New Delhi and in villages in Uttar Pradesh, India. Jain moved to Roorkee, where in 1979 he earned an engineering degree from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. He moved to the United States of America that same year. He looked up to business people who made their own fortune, especially Bill Gates. Early career Jain's first job out of college in 1983 was at Burroughs (now known as Unisys) in New Jersey as part of a business-exchange program. He moved to Silicon Valley for its warmer climate and worked for \\"a bunch of startups\\" before joining Microsoft in 1989. Jain worked on OS/2, then MS-DOS, Windows NT, and Windows 95. He was awarded three patents related to Windows 95 and became best known for his work as a program manager. Jain joined the management team for Microsoft Network, prior to its launch. According to Red Herring, he became restless after eight years at the company and said he didn't feel a single person could make a difference at a large company like Microsoft. Naveen Jain was working on the launch of Microsoft Networks (MSN), when Netscape Communications raised $2.2 billion in an initial public offering in 1995. NetScape's IPO was considered the start of the dot-com bubble, because it showed that Internet companies can have large IPOs without making a profit first. Naveen quit Microsoft to start InfoSpace that year, with the aim of having his own initial public offering as quickly as possible. InfoSpace =Growth= Jain founded InfoSpace in March 1996 with six employees, mostly from Microsoft, and began developing e-mail and telephone directories. InfoSpace provided content and services, such as phone directories, maps, games and information on the stock market, to websites and mobile device manufacturers. The company grew at low cost without funding using co-branding strategies. It went public on December 15, 1998. The company raised $75 million in the offering.A Fine IPO for InfoSpace from Wired Jain's net worth grew to $8 billion. He began purchasing expensive homes and yachts. Jain owned 47 percent of InfoSpace's stock. Many lawsuits from partners and employees alleged he used promises of stock options to attract talent and business partners, but then fired employees or broke off relations without providing the promised shares. An investigation by the board found evidence that Jain may have failed to fulfill his contractual promises for stock options to seven former employees and eight business partners. Many of these cases involved employees or consultants that said they were offered deals where they could buy shares for 1 to 10 cents each, but shortly afterwards Jain tried to change the deal or fired them over a dispute without the promised stock-based compensation. Jain alleged the deals were set up such that their shares wouldn't vest until they've been an employee for a year. =Crash and fallout= As the dot-com bubble ended in March 2000, InfoSpace's stock fell from $138 to $1.56 by July 2001. In March 2000, even as the stock price declined, Jain said InfoSpace would one day have a greater market-share than Microsoft, Intel and Cisco combined. Early the following year he sold $80 million of his own shares at an even lower price. Jain led a merger with Go2Net that was purchased with the shares. Shortly afterwards the founder of Go2Net quit and the company was reduced in size. After the merger, Go2Net CEO Russell Horowitz became president of Infospace.InfoSpace to buy Go2Net to expand content delivery Also, in 2000, InfoSpace used a controversial accounting method to report $46 million in profits when in fact it had lost $282 million. Company executives skirted SEC trading restrictions to sell large blocks of their personal stock. Jain resumed the role of CEO in 2001. As revenues decreased, Jain indicated to investor analysts that revenues were expected to go up, even though all indicators showed a continued decline. In 2001, InfoSpace said its revenues would go up to $360 million, then laid off 250 staff shortly afterwards. Jain and many other executives sold their shares in the company, just as the stock increased in response to investor analysts repeating Jain's positive outlook on revenues. The company then used misleading accounting practices to make it appear as though it was still growing. For example, it invested money in a company run by Jain's brother, with an agreement that his brother would also spend money on InfoSpace, a practice that was referred to as \\"buying revenues\\". A shareholder filed a lawsuit against InfoSpace and many of its executives, including Jain, in 2001. The shareholder alleged Jain misled shareholders about the company's financials, then profited by selling his own shares at their peak. This led to a series of additional lawsuits and the board dismissed Jain from his CEO position in 2002 in response. Jain was forced out by InfoSpace's board as chairman and CEO in December 2002. In 2003 Jain was ordered to pay $247 million for violations in \\"short-swing trading rules\\", whereby he bought and sold stocks within six months as an employee with insider knowledge. In appeals court the Securities and Exchange Commission submitted a brief taking Jain's side, which led to a settlement for $105 million. Jain said his stock purchasing was a mistake due to bad advice from his legal and financial advisors. Following the settlement, Jain sued his stock management company and lawyers for alleged negligence in their handling of the case, but lower courts and the Supreme Court dismissed his case. In March 2003, InfoSpace sued Jain and others for allegedly misappropriating trade secrets from InfoSpace to start Intelius and for violating their non-compete agreement. A court found no evidence that Intelius and Infospace competed with one another and the case was dismissed. In December 2004, an $83 million settlement was reached between InfoSpace and Jain, which would result in dismissal of all the cases, including the one from the shareholder, with prejudice. Post-InfoSpace =Intelius= In 2003, Jain co-founded Intelius. The company collected and sold background information on individuals. It grew to $18.1 million in revenues by 2004 and $88.5 million in 2007 with $22.5 million in profits. It filed an initial public offering in 2008. The site was the subject of many consumer complaints concerning post-transaction marketing practices, where consumers were led to believe they were answering a short survey for $10 cash back, but were actually signed up for a $20-per-month subscription. He re- formed the company under the name Inome in 2012. In 2015 the company was sold, with Jain retaining a 25 percent interest, and a new CEO was appointed. =TalentWise= Jain also founded Talentwise, a spin-off from Intelius, which was sold in 2016. =Moon Express= Jain co-founded Moon Express in August 2010 and is its chairman. The company is building machine-operated spacecraft to mine materials like gold, cobalt, platinum, and Helium-3 (nuclear energy fuel) from the moon. It will also prospect for water on the moon's south pole, which could be used to create rocket fuel for missions to Mars and beyond. Jain claims his target for Moon Express is to found human colonies on the moon by 2022. =Bluedot= Jain is founder and CEO of Bluedot. Started in 2015, Bluedot licenses research from United States Department of Energy national labs for commercialization. Jain is founder and CEO of Bluedot's spinoff Viome (founded in 2016). Viome provides nutritional genomics testing and analysis services, especially of the gut flora, and provides dietary advice. =Other activities= He is also on the board of Kairos Society, a non-profit network of undergraduate entrepreneurs, founded by his son. He is also on the board of the Xprize Foundation and Singularity University. In collaboration with his wife, the Anu and Naveen Jain Women‚Äôs Safety Xprize was launched in October 2016 and was intended to run until June 2018, with a goal of awarding $1 million to a team who creates an affordable device that can quickly, automatically, and quietly send an emergency alert to responders. He also collects meteorites. His collection, which by 2012 had cost him $5 million, consists of 'witnessed falls'; meteorites that observers have seen moving through the atmosphere. Family Jain married in 1988 and moved with his family to Seattle. He has three children.

First broadcast in January 2003, the station is operated by SYN Media under a youth license, with programming presented entirely by volunteers aged 12‚Äì25 years old. The station broadcasts from studios on the campus of RMIT University, with additional content syndicated from other community radio stations in Australia. Between 2014 and 2019, SYN Media operated a secondary station ‚Äì SYN Nation ‚Äì broadcast on DAB+ digital radio in Melbourne. On 16 April 2019, SYN Media announced the two stations would merge to create a single station, broadcasting on 90.7FM and DAB+ digital radio. The newly merged SYN commenced broadcasting on 22 April 2019. History SYN first launched at 12pm on 28 January 2003 as SYN FM, following a successful application to the then-Australian Broadcasting Authority for a community radio FM license in 2001. This followed the amalgamation of 3TD at Thornbury Darebin College and the Student Radio Association based at RMIT University into SYN Media in 2000. In May 2004, the Australian Broadcasting Authority removed a power restriction on the station's signal, which was in place to avoid interference from the ABNT television service broadcasting from Launceston, Tasmania on VHF channel 3. The restriction also applied to 89.9 LightFM and the then-unallocated smoothfm 91.5. On 14 April 2011, the station launched on DAB+ digital radio, alongside fellow community broadcasters 3CR, 3KND, 3MBS, 3RRR, 3ZZZ, 89.9 LightFM, PBS 106.7FM and Vision Australia Radio. This saw the station rebrand as SYN Radio. On 7 May 2013, the station ceased transmitting on both FM and DAB+ for 24 hours in protest of funding cuts to the community radio sector in the 2013 Australian federal budget. This formed part of a larger call to action \\"Commit to Community Radio\\" by industry body the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia, as well as the Community Broadcasting Foundation. On 1 April 2014, the station ceased broadcasting on DAB+ digital radio, and was replaced with a digital radio-only sister station SYN Nation. Following an organisation-wide rebrand, SYN Radio was rebranded as SYN 90.7, emphasising content made by young people in Melbourne. On 22 April 2019 the station was again rebranded as SYN, as the station became available on DAB+ digital radio once again. Today, SYN operates on a schedule updated with new presenters ‚Äì all under the age of 26 ‚Äì and programming every 12 weeks, across two tiers of programming: flagship shows and seasonal shows. Flagship shows operate year round in fixed timeslots under the management of an executive producer, a role rotated yearly, while seasonal shows air for up to six months at a time, and cover a variety of topics and music. Programming =Current flagships= *Get Cereal (Breakfast programme) *The Sports Desk (Sports talk) *Panorama (Current affairs) *The Naughty Rude Show (Sex and relationships) *In Joke Tonight (Comedy) Music flagships *The Hoist (Australian music) *New & Approved (New music) *Sunday Sweets (\\"Sweet 16\\" and feature albums) Genre flagships *Asian Pop Nation (Asian pop music) *Hip Hop Night (Hip hop music) *Moshpit (Punk and heavy metal music) Access flagships *Amplify (under-18 drive programme) *The Awkward Stage (under-18 on-air training programme) *Schools on Air (high school students, managed by SYN Media Learning) *Raise the Platform (disability advocacy) =Regional syndication= In addition to programming produced in Melbourne, a number of shows presented by young people across Australia are syndicated on SYN as part of the SYN Nation project. Current affiliates include 2BOB, Gippsland FM, Woroni Radio, Wangki Radio and Radio Fremantle.

Initially, the ESIS project was to link databases of the European Space Agency together with centres of excellence that included the Centre de Donn√©es astronomiques de Strasbourg and its SIMBAD service, the European Southern Observatory and the Canadian Astronomical Data Centre (CADC), as well as the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory for Space Physics data The European Space Information System (ESIS) P.

The main astronomical missions that influenced ESIS at the time were the Hubble Space Telescope, EXOSAT and IUE, while Space Physics was mainly focused on the Cluster mission. Having been a pioneer project in its days, many of the original concepts used then (such as catalogue browsing, searching in an area of the sky) were later embedded in other astronomical data services worldwide. ESIS provided the building blocks and the prototypes to what is today being implemented in the Virtual Observatory projects, such as the Astrophysical Virtual Observatory. The greatest success of ESIS was the transfer of its Catalogue Browser to the CDS, which later became better known as the VizieR Catalogue Service.Transfer of ESIS to scientific institutes S.G.

Commonly referred to as SYN, the organisation produces new and independent media that is made by and for young people in Melbourne. Founded in 2000, today volunteers ‚Äì all aged 12‚Äì25 years of age ‚Äì produce a radio station broadcast on FM radio and DAB+ digital radio, as well as content for television, print and online. A 2006 McNair listener survey showed a similar age group, 15‚Äì24, as the largest age group listening to community radio in Australia. History SYN Media formed on 13 June 2000 as Student Youth Network Inc. as a merger of two student radio projects ‚Äì 3TD, based at Thornbury-Darebin College, and RMIT University's Student Radio Association. A merger was to take place between 3TD, SRA, La Trobe University's SUB FM, Swinburne University's 3SSR, Monash University's 3MU and Deakin's BAS Radio as the Melbourne Student Radio consortium. However, talks broke down due to disagreements around giving high school students access to the station in less desirable timeslots and less board access, leading SRA general manager Jesse Nonneman to approach 3TD managers Colin Thompson and Paul Van Eeden about splitting away from the consortium. The new organisation would be known as SAY-FM ‚Äì Student And Youth FM ‚Äì however, this was changed to SYN before the group's first meeting. With the aim of promoting young people as \\"creators not just consumers of media\\", funding was ensured through the Victorian Education Department, with the financial backing of then-Education Minister Mary Delahunty, and support from state minister Justin Madden and federal minister Martin Ferguson. In 2001, the organisation secured one of four community radio licenses broadcasting to the Greater Melbourne area, alongside 3KND, JOY 94.9 and Triple Seven (now 89.9 LightFM), and on 28 January 2003 SYN FM launched, broadcasting on 90.7FM. Also in 2003 was the organisation's first expansion into television. SYN TV would be the first programme in Australia to simulcast on radio (via SYN FM), television (via Channel 31) and stream online. Hosted entirely by under-18s, the programme would later be spun into two shows ‚Äì the music-based 1700 on C31, and the under-18 focused Objection (now Amplify) on SYN 90.7. From February 2004, the organisation also operated the Pecado zine. The zine closed in December 2006. In 2010, the organisation launched a revamped website, and in 2011 expanded its radio signal onto DAB+ digital radio. On 1 April 2014, SYN Nation was launched, exclusive to the DAB+ platform, featuring nationally focused content from partner community radio stations in Byron Bay, New South Wales, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Hobart, Tasmania, Gippsland and Warrnambool, Victoria, and Fitzroy Crossing and Fremantle, Western Australia. On 16 April 2019, SYN Media announced that SYN Nation would merge with SYN 90.7 to create a single station, broadcasting on 90.7FM and DAB+ digital radio in Melbourne. The newly merged SYN commenced broadcasting on 22 April 2019. Productions SYN has three major production departments: SYN Radio, SYN TV, and SYN Online. =Radio= The organisation operates a radio station: SYN, broadcasting content created by young people aged 12‚Äì26 at SYN in Melbourne, as well as in various regional hubs partnered with community radio stations in Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania and Western Australia. =TV= As well as radio, SYN also produces television for Melbourne's community television broadcaster C31. At SYN TV's height in 2010, it produced up to 15 hours of content per week. Launched in 2003, SYN TV's current flagship production for C31 is 1700, a live, hour-long youth music show airing weekdays. It features music videos, interviews, reviews and music related discussion. In late 2008, SYN launched Get Cereal TV, a morning television alternative aimed at the youth of Melbourne. The show aired daily between 07:30 and 08:30 mornings on Channel 31. It was cancelled by SYN at the end of 2010 to allow the station to create alternative television programming. 2010 saw the premiere of The Wrap, a weekly live-to-air news entertainment programme that on Friday nights on C31 Melbourne. It ended after 3 seasons on air. In early 2013, SYN launched The Cut, a weekly show based on arts and culture around Melbourne. It is SYN's only pre-recorded television show currently on air. =Online= Online, SYN publishes programme blogs and a weekly e-newsletter. The website also features \\"SYNcasts\\" of some of SYN's radio shows as well as various SYNcast-only programmes. Contribution to community broadcasting SYN is one of the largest youth projects in Australia and the world, and has up to 1500 volunteers. It defines its aim as \\"to implement a national culture of young people broadcasting for themselves\\". In order to achieve this outcome, the station rotates on-air presenters frequently (approximately every three months) and all crew and executive positions annually. SYN does this to allow more than 1200 young people to gain direct media experience annually. Around 2500 students have also incorporated SYN's training and education programmes into their studies. SYN has contributed greatly to community radio both in Australia and worldwide. For example, one spinoff project, the Bentokit Project, is a FLOSS and cross- platform radio broadcasting suite for community stations licensed under the GPL. On 25 November 2011, a book was released entitled Life of SYN written by Ellie Rennie. In it, Rennie follows key SYN staff and volunteers \\"as they build Australia's most unusual media empire against enormous odds. Over the course of the book, social networking becomes the most popular use of the internet and traditional media institutions are forced to acknowledge the rise of amateur content. In response, SYN rethinks its approach to the online environment, kills its print publication, deals with the introduction of digital broadcasting and teaches schoolteachers about a new kind of literacy. In just two years dozens of careers are launched, the SYN radio audience doubles and they get told off for swearing.\\" Slogan SYN has had several different slogans. The most recent slogan is \\"Click, Switch, Watch\\" and was intended to reflect SYN's three media platforms ‚Äì online, radio and television. Past slogans include \\"Creators not Consumers\\", \\"We May Be Young But We Know Our Shit\\" and \\"Where the Kids Push the Buttons\\". The circle logo was developed in the mid 1990s by Caroline Worsley. The launch creative, featuring an evolution narrative, was originally designed by Olivia Fowler studying a diploma of graphic design at Holmesglen TAFE, her iconic baby in the ear, representing the birth of a radio station was developed into series of posters by Jeremy Wortsman. Notable alumni Former SYN presenters include Australian media personalities Hamish and Andy, Ryan Shelton, The Barefoot Investor Scott Pape, triple j presenters Zan Rowe, Bridget Hustwaite and Nat Tencic.

Most criticisms were concerning some gameplay inconsistencies, such as the defensive mechanics, and the unrealistic player tendencies, as well as the game's lack of improvements, with some seeing the lack of meaningful changes as a step back from NBA 2K7, and visuals, which some saw as \\"awful\\" and \\"ugly\\". Some saw the visuals as \\"gorgeous\\" however. Gameplay NBA 2K8 is a basketball simulation game which strives to emulate the National Basketball Association and the sport of basketball in general. Players mostly play NBA basketball games in a variety of game modes, with real teams and players or created players. One of the new additions to the game is the Slam Dunk Contest game mode.

Over the course of my first dozen games, I was in love. But as the season wore on, the issues began piling up to a point that it became a source of frustration. The Lock-on D gaff is inexcusable and the lackluster defensive AI allows decent players to tear it up on offense. Jason Williams should not be dropping 30 points a game. Yet he won the MVP in year two of my franchise. Still, any hoops fan should give NBA 2K8 a look. It's certainly the best basketball game on any system this year. The Association is a solid franchise mode and, if [Virtual Concepts] can iron out its AI and gameplay issues, next year's model could be something very special.\\" 1UP.com's Todd Zuniga commended the aesthetics, depth, game modes, and online features of the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, but disliked certain gameplay imperfections that he deemed small and annoying, such as the unrealistic defensive abilities of big men when they are defending quick players. Aaron Thomas of GameSpot praised the same console versions for having a large amount of content, the CPU, and the new additions to the game. In his review for Game Revolution, Chris Andrien wrote of the same console versions: \\"At the end of the day, NBA 2K8 is a pretty fun jaunt.\\" He spoke well of the sound effects, but hated the \\"goofy\\" commentary. He liked the addition of NBA legends such as Larry Bird, but disliked certain other gameplay additions, including the \\"unrealistic\\" lock-on defense. Lastly, Andrien praised the realistic visuals and animations, but criticized the \\"wonky\\" artificial intelligence. GameTrailers complimented the same console versions' dunk contest game mode, praised the \\"incredible online\\" play, called the post play \\"the best in the biz\\", said the shooting felt \\"just right\\", and enjoyed the animations. However, the review cited several \\"quirks\\", such as AI issues, players unrealistically missing shots or attempting shots that wouldn't realistically be used, statistical problems, removed features, and the lock-on defense mechanic, as downsides. Lastly, the review also heavily criticized the designs of the players and the menus, calling them \\"awful\\" and \\"butchered\\", as well as the \\"repetitive\\" commentary, but did enjoy the soundtrack and said the amount of animations \\"makes a huge difference\\".

Todt was born in Berlin in 1810 or 1811, and studied sculpture under Ludwig Wilhelm Wichmann from around 1830 until 1836. In 1849 he emigrated to South Australia, possibly because of an involvement in the revolutions of the time. In 1851 he got caught up in the Victorian gold rush, but by 1854 had settled in Melbourne where he returned to sculpture. That year he exhibited what has become his most famous work. This was The gold diggers, a sculpture depicting two gold diggers, one standing and one sitting, in their working clothes. Described at the time as \\"nothing short of genius of a high order\\", it is now held by the National Gallery of Victoria, and has recently been described in the following terms: The gold diggers was exhibited at the Victorian Exhibition, attracting for Todt a number of commissions, including a Madonna and Child for the Roman Catholic Cathedral in Melbourne. By 1856 Todt was considered one of the leading artists in Melbourne, although this mantle was shortly afterwards claimed by Charles Summers. During the 1860s, Todt made coloured, life-sized fruits and vegetables for display at the International Exhibitions at London in 1862 and at Dublin in 1865. He also created relief maps of Victoria and painted a portrait of premier of Victoria Richard Heales. Todt undertook his last major work in the early 1880s. This was the illustration of Ferdinand von Mueller's Eucalyptographia: a descriptive atlas of the Eucalypts of Australia and the adjoining islands. In 1882, during the preparation of the work, von Mueller named Eucalyptus todtiana (Coastal Blackbutt) in honour of Todt, stating Two years later, the work was published, with Todt's contribution being over seventy lithographed illustrations. He died in Melbourne on 10 July 1900.

Rocket Jockey is a part of the Winston Science Fiction set, a series of juvenile novels which have become famous for their influence on young science fiction readers and their exceptional cover illustrations by award-winning artists. Plot introduction The Armstrong Classic is a rocket race throughout the inhabited solar system and has become the driving force for the advancement of rocket and space technologies. It is extremely dangerous, and there are always fatalities, but it is regarded as the trial that proves the merit of a prospective spaceman. It is said that \\"only a fool would enter such a race, and only a genius or a Martian could win\\". In a twist of fate, a young man, Jerry Blaine is kicked out of the Space Institute at his brother's request to help him get ready for the 18th Armstrong Classic. When his brother is injured in a fueling accident, Jerry must take over command of the Last Hope and try to win the Classic for earth. Plot summary Jerry Blaine, a young man studying at the Space Institute, is kicked out just after his second year exams at the request of his brother, Dick, in order to help him get his ship, the Last Hope ready for the 18th Armstrong Classic. Jerry is initially bitter, but realizes that how he conducts himself in the classic will go a long way toward proving himself as a spaceman, and eventually being readmitted to the institute. The Last Hope is a refitted asteroid mining ship using the Jerry and Dick's father's experimental fuel which is supposed to be a radical improvement upon existing technologies. Their parents were both killed in the first test of the fuel however, and it is only now, years later, that improvements in materials and engine design will allow the fuel to be tested again safely. Just before liftoff, Dick is injured when fuel splashes in his face, temporarily blinding him. Jerry is forced to take control of the Last Hope while his brother is incapacitated below decks. The qualification run to the moon is begun, and Jerry is racing against 10 other ships from earth for the right to represent their home planet in the classic proper. Jerry manages to win, but only after he witnesses the first fatality of the classic; a fellow earth pilot pushes his engines too hard and his ship overheats and is destroyed. After some political wrangling on the Moon that puts Jerry officially in charge of the Last Hope despite his brother's seeming recovery, they head out to touch on the 4 Galilean moons, Mars, and Venus. Heading for Mars first they make good time and land with high spirits. The Martians are not happy to see them, however. There has always been a bitter rivalry between the two worlds, and Mars has a reputation for winning the classic at all costs and through any means, scrupulous or otherwise. When they try to refuel the Last Hope they discover their shipment of fuel has somehow disappeared from the warehouse in which it was stored. A long drawn out search finally locates the missing fuel in a pile of garbage that was ready for destruction. Jerry, Dick, and Tod all believe that Mars was intentionally responsible for the delay of 18 hours searching for the fuel. They take off from Mars and head towards Jupiter. Halfway however, Jerry discovers that Dick has not fully recovered from his injuries. He becomes sick and delirious, and they are forced to turn back to Mars to get Dick the medical care he needs. By the time the Last Hope leaves Mars for the second time, they are nearly 100 hours behind schedule, and their carefully planned course is now useless. En route to Jupiter for the second time the Last Hope loses power due to a blockage of the rocket tube. Losing more time, they coast while making repairs. Unfortunately, they coast so far, they no longer have the distance necessary to decelerate to rendezvous with the Jovian moons. Jerry is forced into a nearly suicidal braking maneuver into the Jovian atmosphere known as the \\"Dead Man's Orbit\\". Despite Jerry's vague recollections, such a feat had never before been accomplished, and he receives admiration and applause upon arrival on Io. After visiting the other 3 Jovian moons and experiencing an unfriendly reception on Ganymede, considered by many to be a puppet of Mars, the Last Hope set course back to the inner planets: Venus, Mercury, and Earth. While approaching the asteroid belt, they intercept a distress call, and come to the aid of what appears to be the Martian racers. After rendering assistance and parting ways, Jerry realizes his asteroid chart has been stolen. He must now navigate the belt by memory and luck. After some close calls and an actual impact with a small pebble, the Last Hope makes it through the belt relatively unscathed. Because of the delay with the decoy Mars racer, they are no longer in a position to rendezvous with Venus. Mercury is now their best stop.

One of these launches failed. On February 19, 1976, the attempted launch of a DMSP satellite from Vandenberg's SLC-10W went awry when SECO occurred 5 seconds early. Although the second stage separated and fired properly, the satellite was left in an unusable orbit from which it decayed only one hour after launch. Investigation into the mishap found that the Thor had been loaded an insufficient amount of RJ-1 (a higher grade of kerosene fuel that offered enhanced performance over standard RP-1) for the mission. The amount of LOX on Thor boosters was always the same on every launch, but the amount of kerosene could vary depending on the engine, as different LR-79 engines had slightly different performance levels, and so factory acceptance data was used to determine the fuel load needed for a particular unit. The particular engine used in Thor 182 had thus been loaded with kerosene according to the data sheet provided by Rocketdyne, however the information contained a typo which led to ground crews loading too little propellant for it. However, the postflight investigation also found that, even if the correct propellant load had been carried, the mission would have still failed because the Thor did not have sufficient performance to loft the DMSP into the required orbit. As the DMSP program evolved, the satellites gradually became heavier and more complex. Program planners, aware of this, selected an LR-79 engine which had particularly high performance, but it still turned out to not be enough for the mission. The failure was thus ultimately attributed to poor mission planning.http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1287/1  Burner 2  The Burner 2 used with the Thor-Burner was the first solid fuel upper-stage vehicle used for general space applications that had full control and guidance capability. The first Burner II flight was on 1966-09-15.

It has about 1,500 inhabitants. It lies approximately south east from Poliƒçka. Administrative parts Village of Hamry is an administrative part of Bystr√©. History The first written mention about the town dates back to year 1200. The Czech Chronicle by Wenceslaus Hajek (which cannot be taken as a credible source though) mentions a village which in 1021 should have been situated in place called U kostel√≠ƒçka (about one kilometer to the west from the present town). The name of the town is derived from Bystr√Ω, a stream flowing through the town. After the original settlement was burnt out, a new market village Bystr√© was built up on the Trstenice trail (mentioned in 1349). The village was shaped as a horseshoe and the first owner of the village Bystr√© were the Lords of Moko≈°√≠n. Since 1213 the village belonged to Svojanov manor. Bystr√© received the town right during the reign of Charles IV. In the later period the city gained a number of privileges, such as toll collection right and the right for a weekly market. Jan Bezdru≈æick√Ω z Kolovrat became the town owner in the 16th century. Under his rule, a local fort was constructed. Jan died in 1604 and was buried in a tomb in the local church. The following owners, lords of Martinice, started mining of iron ore in Hamry (currently a part of the municipality of Bystr√©). During the Thirty Years' War the city was devastated. In 1624 Albrecht von Wallenstein passed through the town. Leopold of Valderode bought the manor of Bystr√© in 1686. In 1707 the manor was sold again, this time in an auction. The new owner (Jakub Hanibal, the count of Hohenems) let built the town hall. During the rule of his son, Franz Rudolph, the construction of a new church started and spa Balda was founded in the neighborhood. As the counts of Hohenems died out in 1869, Bystr√© manor was passed to Emperor Franz Joseph I who owned it until the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918. Symbols ;Coat of arms A legend says that in the period when Bystr√© formed a part of Svojanov manor the tax revenues from Bystr√© and surrounding villages were taken away to Svojanov. The money was carried by a collector ‚Äì most probably by one of the town councilors. Once, the collector was attacked by a bear during his journey through the forest between Hartmanice and Svojanov. The collector succeeded to kill the bear with a spear. This event became the symbol of the town, being depicted on the coat of arms and the city seal. ;Flag The flag has dark red background with two wavy stripes ‚Äì a black and a golden one. These stripes symbolize two streams (Zlat√Ω and Bystersk√Ω) between which Bystr√© was founded. The flag was introduced in 1998. In popular culture Vojtƒõch Jasn√Ω's movie All My Compatriots was in 1968 filmed in Bystr√© and its surroundings. Also the filming of a stand-alone sequel N√°vrat ztracen√©ho r√°je partially took place in Bystr√© in 1999.

Solids in such systems have very high surface area. This type of titration is used to study the zeta potential of these surfaces under different conditions. Details of zeta potential definition and measuring techniques can be found in the International Standard International Standard ISO 13099-1, 2012, \\"Colloidal systems ‚Äì Methods for Zeta potential determination- Part 1: Electroacoustic and Electrokinetic phenomena\\". Zeta potential titrations of concentrated alumina and rutile dispersions Iso- electric Point The iso-electric point is one such property. The iso-electric point is the pH value at which the zeta potential is approximately zero. At a pH near the iso-electric point (¬± 2 pH units), colloids are usually unstable; the particles tend to coagulate or flocculate. Such titrations use acids or bases as titration reagents. Tables of iso-electric points for different materials are available. The attached figure illustrates results of such titrations for concentrated dispersions of alumina (4% v/v) and rutile (7% v/v). It is seen that iso-electric point of alumina is around pH 9.3, whereas for rutile it is around pH 4. Alumina is unstable in the pH range from 7 to 11. Rutile is unstable in the pH range from 2 to 6. Surfactants and Stabilization Another purpose of this titration is determination of the optimum dose of surfactant for achieving stabilization or flocculation of a heterogeneous system. Measurement In a zeta-potential titration, the Zeta potential is the indicator. Measurement of the zeta potential can be performed using microelectrophoresis, or electrophoretic light scattering, or electroacoustic phenomena. The last method makes possible to perform titrations in concentrated systems, with no dilution. References Further reading * Kosmulski M. (2009). Surface Charging and Points of Zero Charge.

Plot Min, a young Korean boy, moves to Japan with his father, who is a potter. One day at a local shrine, Min meets Nanae, a beautiful local girl and aspiring painter. He falls in love at first sight. She is a student at his new school, and their friendship develops despite their cultural and language differences. However, Min's grandmother suddenly falls ill, and Min returns to Korea without having a chance to explain to Nanae. While he is gone, Nanae is forced to move away to protect her and her sister from their mother's violent boyfriend. Before Min and Nanae separate, Nanae gives Min an amulet pouch with a letter inside. She tells him to open it later, and so he doesn't open it before he goes to see his grandmother. Min's grandmother notices it in his pocket and assumes that it is a present for her from Japan; not wanting to disappoint his grandmother, Min gives away the amulet pouch. When Min's grandmother eventually recovers, he returns to Japan only to find that Nanae is gone. Two years later a friend of Min finds Nanae drawing in a park. Nanae explains the reason she disappeared, and learns that Min returned to Korea because he felt there was no reason to stay. A few months later Nanae and Min stumble upon each other at an art show in Korea. However, Min is still bruised from being left without news and reacts harshly at the reunion. Later Min's grandmother discovers the letter inside the amulet pouch and gives it to him. The letter says that Nanae wants to be with Min forever but cannot because she has to go, but asks him to meet her at the first snow on Deoksugung street in Seoul. Min travels to Kyoto and finds diary entries from Nanae, saying that she has been waiting for him in vain there for several years. He leaves back to Seoul, but when at the airport in Seoul notices snowflakes starting to fall.

The Park is located in the foothills of the Sneeuberge, or Snow Mountains, with an elevation of between 740 and 1480-metres above sea level. Following an extensive process of negotiation and discussion between government, conservation groups, and concerned stakeholders, Marthinus van Schalkwyk, Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, announced the intention to proclaim South Africa's 22nd National Park in the area surrounding Graaff-Reinet. This was made possible by the World Wide Fund for Nature in South Africa (WWF-SA), which donated the 14500 hectare Karoo Nature Reserve to be the centrepiece of the project. A public consultation process was followed to decide on the new name for the park, culminating in the choice of Camdeboo National Park.

When it reaches the coast, the river turns and flows northwards, being joined by the Waimate Creek before discharging into the Wainono Lagoon in Studholme, a locality to the east of the town of Waimate. However, a culvert known as the Waihao Box has been cut into the gravel berm that separates the river from the Pacific Ocean to provide permanent sea access.Central South Island Tourism, The Strawberry Trail, accessed 23 October 2007.

Operational history After shakedown along the California coast, Goshen departed Long Beach 4 February 1945 for additional combat and amphibious training in the Hawaiian Islands. Embarking over 1,400 troops and officers at Honolulu, she departed there for duty in the Western Pacific. Goshen made brief stops at Ulithi and Eniwetok before proceeding to the Okinawa area where the bitter campaign to secure that Japanese-held fortress was already underway. =Okinawa= The transport arrived off Hagushi beaches Okinawa on 17 April and immediately commenced disembarking troops and unloading cargo. Goshen completed her task 5 days later and sailed for Saipan arriving there on the 27th. After loading mail and passengers at Saipan, Russell, Florida, and New Hebrides Islands, she sailed for the United States 18 May, arriving in San Francisco 3 June. =After hostilities= Goshen made another cruise to the Western Pacific in July carrying troops and cargo for the final month of the war.

On 10 December she steamed out of Sasebo with over 1,400 America bound Marines, finally arriving San Diego on the 28th. In late January 1946 Goshen departed the West Coast arriving at Lynnhaven Roads, Virginia on 12 February. She decommissioned at Norfolk 20 April and was delivered to WSA 2 May 1946. Goshen received one battle star for World War II service. Commercial service Goshen was sold in 1947 to American Mail Lines Ltd., re-registered in Portland, Oregon, and renamed Canada Mail.

Synopsis The short centers on a baby that is half human, half duck that becomes fascinated with a box of matches with the image of a swan imprinted on it that an adult left on the kitchen counter. As his toys watch, he breaks out of his crib and manages to discover his wings, which had been taken away from him at birth, from a cupboard. The baby grabs the matches and lights one, only for one of his wings to catch fire, plunging him into a sink full of water. His toys then spring into action in an attempt to rescue him, some destroying themselves in the process of trying to get to him. The baby manages to pull the plug, draining the water and inadvertently sending some of his toys down the drain. The baby is then shown motionless at the bottom of the sink except for a single hand twitch. A toy falls next to him and it's left ambiguous as to whether he survived the ordeal.

A polespear (hand spear or gidgee) is an underwater tool used in spearfishing, consisting of a pole, a spear tip, and a rubber loop. Polespears are often mistakenly called Hawaiian slings, but the tools differ. A Hawaiian sling is akin to a slingshot or an underwater bow and arrow, since the spear and the propelling device are separate, while a polespear has the sling (rubber loop) attached to the spear. Description The pole is usually between four feet and ten feet long and made of fiberglass, carbon fibre, aluminum, graphite, or wood. Longer versions often break down into two or more pieces that screw together. The tip is either threaded to accept different kinds of spear tips or already has a fixed tip attached. The most popular spear tip on polespears are the paralyzer (often called a three-prong), and the Tahitian shaft (a single pivoting barb). Some more serious hunters will equip the polespear with a slip-tip (tip removes from the end and tethers to a fixed point). At the butt end of the spear is an elastic loop, usually made of surgical tubing or a band of rubber (a bicycle inner tube, for example). The spear is operated by placing the rubber loop in the crook of the thumb, then reaching up the spear shaft to stretch the elastic band and grabbing the polespear to hold the band in tension. On flimsy spears, it's useful to twist the spear as the band stretches to keep the spear from bending. Shooting the spear involves releasing the grasp of the hand but still using the hand to guide the spear like a barrel to a gun. The firing distance of a polespear can be divided into two ranges. First, there is the overall distance of the stretch or the 'travel range'. This second range is the distance that most are interested in as it is more relevant to penetrating fish. For this reason, it is called the 'penetrating range.' Not all the travel of the spear being fired has the 'punch' to penetrate through fish. Depending on the polespear's attributes such as mass, drag, band strength, band stretch, etc., the penetrating range can be from a scant few inches to several feet. Other factors may include fish orientation, fish width, density, skin composition, etc. One would need to take all the attributes into account before firing a polespear towards a target. For example, the band pull on a 10-foot polespear may stretch up to 6-feet of the polespear. It actually requires about 8-feet of polespear, measured from the rear, to do this because the stretch doesn't start till the band begins to provide tension (typically, about 2-feet loop length on a 10-footer). However, the penetrating range may only be half of the pull. This equals about 3' for a 10 footer. Some fish, however, are thicker/denser and may require much closer shots. The more mass a polespear contains, the more band power it will require to move the same speed as a polespear with less mass. However, some fiberglass or extremely lightweight polespears will have so little mass that there is little velocity or 'punch' behind them when it hits a fish. A hybrid polespear combines aluminum with a more flexible material such as a fiberglass rod. These polespears offer rigidity for loading, but still some flexibility in the front end to absorb the lateral movements of a fish once it is attached to the end.

Butler sold updates of Brown's recruitment via website for $9.99 a month or $59 a year and sought contributions that he says were used to take players on a tour of colleges each summer. At one point, Butler announced Brown was considering entering the Canadian Football League (CFL), but Brown backed down from that claim. As a result of Butler's handling, the National Collegiate Athletic Association‚Äôs amateurism certification staff launched an investigation to determine whether anything had been done that would jeopardize Brown's amateur status. The NCAA's investigation eventually cleared Brown to play before the start of his freshman season. On February 22, 2008, Brown chose to follow his brother and verbally committed to the University of Miami. However, Brown did not sign a letter of intent on National Signing Day 2009, but instead planned to announce his decision on March 16, naming five other \\"finalists\\" despite his oral commitment to Miami: LSU, Tennessee, Oregon, USC, and Kansas State.

Citing an anonymous source, the Associated Press reported the University of Miami would not reissue a national letter of intent to Brown to replace the one that expired Wednesday, February 18. Brown's advisor Brian Butler told AP he was unaware scholarship offers have an expiration date, but reiterated that Brown would not sign until March 16.

On March 16, 2009, Brown announced at a press conference at the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame in Wichita, Kansas, that he would attend the University of Tennessee. \\"I feel that's the school that's gonna prepare me the best to go to the next level,\\" Brown said at the press conference.

His amateur status was under investigation by the NCAA prior to the season, but Brown was cleared only a few days later. Brown spent the season as a backup to senior Montario Hardesty. Brown finished the season with 460 yards rushing, second on the team behind Hardesty. He also had three rushing touchdowns. On the first day of Tennessee's 2010 spring practice, after Lane Kiffin left the Volunteers for USC, Brown announced his decision to leave the program. Volunteers' coach Derek Dooley said that Brown would remain enrolled at Tennessee for the rest of the spring semester but did not indicate if he would then transfer.

His music has been played on national radio stations such as BBC Radio 1, Kiss 100, BBC Asian Network, and BBC Radio 1Xtra. Currently, Ghetts is signed to independent record label Disrupt, and released his debut studio album, Rebel with a Cause, on 9 March 2014. Known for his hard hitting lyrics and intricate rhyme schemes, he is associated and has toured internationally with such acts as Kano and was a member of NASTY Crew. Musical career Ghetts was a member of grime collective NASTY Crew, however he left, saying that things had gone \\"pear shaped\\" due to the number of people in the group. He later went on to create the grime collective The Movement, including Devlin, Wretch 32, Scorcher, Mercston, Lightning, and DJ Unique. Ghetts has made a number of well-known songs within the UK grime scene. In 2008, Ghetts was nominated for a BET Award for Best International Act: UK along with Chipmunk, Giggs, and Skepta. In the end, Giggs took home the award. =2005: 2000 & Life= After being released from prison in 2003, at the age of nineteen years, Ghetto put out his first release, 2000 & Life in 2005. The mixtape contains 24 tracks and numerous collaborations. 2000 & Life is widely regarded as pioneering within the context of grime music.Online Mixtape Review: Ghetto ‚Äì 2000 & Life: RWD Magazine Initially after his release from prison, Ghetto was using the artist name \\"Freedom\\", however the name \\"wasn't catching on\\". His friends used to say he was \\"ghetto\\" and did \\"ghetto things\\", which began to catch on. Stormin, a fellow Plaistow-based MC, released a song called \\"Day By Day\\" which contained the lyric, \\"Back in the day me and my bredrin Ghetto\\". Following the release, he took on the name \\"Ghetto\\". Ghetto featured on Kano's album Home Sweet Home. In 2004, they filmed the video for \\"Typical Me\\" together, and Ghetto accompanied Kano on touring with Mike Skinner. =2007: Ghetto Gospel= In 2007, Ghetto released his second pre-album mixtape Ghetto Gospel. The mixtape was a departure from his previous release, 2000 & Life, being more mellow and featuring tracks about his female relationships: girlfriends, sister, and mother. In interviews, he has stated that the mixtape's calmer tone is to \\"prove people wrong\\", as he does not want to be typecast as an aggressive and angry rapper. Ghetto Gospel was considered Ghetts' breakthrough of that year and era, with \\"Top 3 Selected\\" becoming an underground hit in its own right. He personally names this mixtape as his best body of work in many interviews. The album is titled Ghetto Gospel to demonstrate that Ghetts has put his soul into creating it. On 27 October 2007, Ghetts performed with Kano at the BBC Electric Proms, performing alongside a violinist. Hypothetically, Ghetto Gospel was Ghetts' debut album in which he mislabelled it as a mixtape; due to a recent interview with Link Up TV where he described Ghetto Gospel being his first studio album, but became unsure as to what to label it due to industry influences and a lack of resources at that time to have called it a full LP. This means his debut album Rebel with a Cause (2014) is his second studio album. =2008: Freedom of Speech, Boy Better Know beef= On 10 March 2008, Ghetto released Freedom of Speech. It is predominantly a solo mixtape, and features no other producers aside Lewi White and Smasher (the pair responsible for \\"Back in Da Day\\"). Many grime fans say that Freedom of Speech is considered Ghetto's best body of work, especially with how dark and aggressive this mixtape was. Unknown to many, he also had \\"beef\\" with Boy Better Know (3 members from the crew that he had clashed previously in consecutive years) and two of the mixtape's songs were centered on each member of the crew. This type of promotion was what helped him increase record sales in famous retail stores. Some of the mixtape's content was banned from legal radio at the time, however, some of the songs' one-liners have go on to become famous trademarks in grime events. It includes collaborations with Smasher, Griminal, Brutal, Chipmunk, and Devlin. Ghetto stated that the mixtape is more akin to 2000 & Life than Ghetto Gospel. Ten years later, Freedom of Speech is still widely considered as a classic grime mixtape and most of the one-liners still get used for reloads in famous grime events such as Eskimo Dance. =2010: The Calm Before the Storm= On 12 July 2010, Ghetto release his fourth mixtape under the alias Ghetts, entitled The Calm Before the Storm. This was a highly- anticipated release fusing the best elements of UK hip-hop and grime into this pre-album massacre. Ghetts immediately gives the people what they want; pure Grime bangers with Ghetts' ridiculous word play and flow in full effect. The opening track \\"Intro\\" provides a trademark murky riddim which Ghetts unleashes ‚Äì schooling listeners on everything from collabos to his take on Grime guys dominating the charts with watered down material. Pure 140bpm vibes make up CBTS, with production provided by the likes of Z Dot, Rude Kid, and Nocturnal as well as bringing along a number of guests including fellow east Londoners Griminal, Devlin, and Maxsta among others to help out. On 13 March Ghetts won an OMA (Official Mixtape Award)for his mixtape, The Calm Before The Storm. He is also featured on a track called \\"On A Mission\\" with Dot Rotten and Opium on Mumzy Stranger's mixtape No Stranger To This. =2011‚Äì2012: Non-album projects= Ghetto's \\"Sing For Me (Electro Remix)\\"; produced by Rude Kid had attention from the mainstream market. The single was signed by All Around the World Productions, who specialise in electronic dance music and were home to acts such as N-Dubz and Cascada. On 21 February 2011, Grime Daily uploaded the official video of a song titled \\"Who's on the Panel\\".

He released the single \\"On A Level\\" in late 2011. The official remix features Scorcher, Kano, and Wretch 32. =2010‚Äì2014: Rebel with a Cause= Ghetts' long-awaited debut album Rebel with a Cause was released on 10 March 2014 on the independent label Disrupt. The album campaign started with a spoken word video \\"Definition of a rebel\\", followed by the non-album single \\"The Cypher\\" which was released on 28 July 2013 and features all personas and elements of Ghetts' personality. The track peaked at number 9 in the iTunes hip-hop charts. The album's lead single \\"Rebel\\" became available to download when you pre-order the album from 2 February onwards. On 19 September, US singer Chris Brown co-signed East London MC Ghetts and shared the video for his track \\"Feel Inside\\" declaring \\"What Ya'll Think?'. Ghetts had reportedly recorded more than 150 songs for the album (with some footage of his demos found on YouTube). Release dates for Rebel with a Cause dated back from 2010; reportedly, it was meant to have been released after his mixtape The Calm Before The Storm. Unknown to many, the album was originally called The Justifications of J. Clarke, but in a 2010 interview with SBTV, he stated that he wasn't ready to have made an album of that manner. =2018: Ghetto Gospel: The New Testament= On 30 August 2018, Ghetts officially announced the follow-up to his 2007 release Ghetto Gospel, titled Ghetto Gospel: The New Testament, was due for release on 14 September 2018. Along with the album announcement, Ghetts shared the first single from the album, \\"Black Rose\\" featuring Kojey Radical. The album featured artists including President T, Wretch 32, Donae'o, Jordy, Suspect, Little Simz, Stefflon Don, Chip, Kojey Radical, and many more.

Founded in 1922, the club was elected to play in the Midland League, and competed in this league for seven seasons before being elected to the Football League as members of the Third Division North in 1929. York reached the second tier of English football with promotion to the Second Division in 1974, but were relegated two years later. York became the first team to reach 100 points in a Football League season after winning the 1983‚Äì84 Fourth Division championship with 101 points, which remains to be the club's only league title. The club was relegated to the Football Conference following the 2003‚Äì04 season, but returned to the Football League with victory in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final. The York City Clubman of the Year award is voted for annually by the club's supporters to name a player who throughout the season has met the three criteria of sportsmanship, effort on the field of play and ability. Fans vote by either handing a voting form to the club or by e-mailing the club. As a mark of respect, the trophy is named the Billy Fenton Memorial Trophy, after player Billy Fenton, who died suddenly in 1973. The award is presented before the final home match of the season by Fenton's widow, Margot Fenton. However, the presentation of the award took place at an awards night in 2011, while the following year it was presented after the final home game of the season. From 2014 to 2015, an awards night was held at York Racecourse to present the award. In 2016, the award was presented before the final home match of the season. Since the inaugural award was made to Phil Burrows in 1974, 37 different players have won the award. Eight of these players have won the award for at least a second time, the most recent being Sean Newton. Daniel Parslow is the only player to have received the award on three occasions, winning it in 2009, 2011 and 2013. Gordon Staniforth was the first to win the trophy in consecutive seasons, a feat since emulated by John MacPhail, Barry Jones and Alan Fettis. Three winners of the award have represented their country at senior international level, of whom Jon McCarthy and Alan Fettis went on to become Clubman of the Year for a second time. Chris Brass, the winner of the 2003 award, went on to manage the club from 2003 to 2004. The current incumbent of the award is Sean Newton, who was the 2018‚Äì19 recipient. Key * denotes a divisional change due to promotion or relegation. * denotes a player registered with York City in the 2018‚Äì19 season. *Player (X) denotes the number of times a player has won the award. Winners Gordon Staniforth was the first player to win the award twice, receiving it in the 1977‚Äì78 and 1978‚Äì79 seasons. Steve Tutill made 366 appearances in 12 seasons with York. Scott Kerr (left) won the award for 2011‚Äì12, a season which culminated in York's return to the Football League. {  style=text-align:center - !Season !Level !Name !Position !Nationality !Apps !Goals !class=unsortableNotes - !scope=row style=text-align:center1973‚Äì74 3 align=leftalign=leftalign=left54 3 - !scope=row style=text-align:center1974‚Äì75 2 align=leftalign=leftalign=left45 2 - !scope=row style=text- align:center1975‚Äì76 2 align=leftalign=leftalign=left38 8 - !scope=row style=text-align:center1976‚Äì77 3 align=leftalign=leftalign=left52 13 - !scope=row style=text-align:center1977‚Äì78 4 align=leftalign=leftalign=left50 13 - !scope=row style=text- align:center1978‚Äì79 4 align=left (2) align=leftalign=left52 19 - !scope=row style=text-align:center1979‚Äì80 4 align=leftalign=leftalign=left51 9 - !scope=row style=text-align:center1980‚Äì81 4 align=leftalign=leftalign=left51 0 - !scope=row style=text- align:center1981‚Äì82 4 align=leftalign=leftalign=left49 25 - !scope=row style=text-align:center1982‚Äì83 4 align=leftalign=leftalign=left52 9 - !scope=row style=text-align:center1983‚Äì84 4 align=leftalign=leftalign=left52 10 - !scope=row style=text- align:center1984‚Äì85 3 align=left (2) align=leftalign=left55 9 - !scope=row style=text-align:center1985‚Äì86 3 align=leftalign=leftalign=left46 1 - !scope=row style=text-align:center1986‚Äì87 3 align=left (2) align=leftalign=left52 25 - !scope=row style=text- align:center1987‚Äì88 3 align=leftalign=leftalign=left43 18 - !scope=row style=text-align:center1988‚Äì89 4 align=leftalign=leftalign=left47 11 - !scope=row style=text-align:center1989‚Äì90 4 align=leftalign=leftalign=left53 0 - !scope=row style=text- align:center1990‚Äì91 4 align=leftalign=leftalign=left50 0 - !scope=row style=text-align:center1991‚Äì92 4 align=leftalign=leftalign=left49 9 - !scope=row style=text-align:center1992‚Äì93 4 align=leftalign=leftalign=left48 1 - !scope=row style=text- align:center1993‚Äì94 3 align=leftalign=leftalign=left49 25 - !scope=row style=text-align:center1994‚Äì95 3 align=left (2) align=leftalign=left50 10 - !scope=row style=text-align:center1995‚Äì96 3 align=leftalign=leftalign=left57 1 - !scope=row style=text- align:center1996‚Äì97 3 align=leftalign=leftalign=left57 1 - !scope=row style=text-align:center1997‚Äì98 3 align=leftalign=leftalign=left47 5 - !scope=row style=text-align:center1998‚Äì99 3 align=leftalign=leftalign=left51 2 - !scope=row style=text- align:center1999‚Äì2000 4 align=left (2) align=leftalign=left40 1 - !scope=row style=text-align:center2000‚Äì01 4 align=leftalign=leftalign=left51 0 - !scope=row style=text-align:center2001‚Äì02 4 align=left (2) align=leftalign=left52 0 - !scope=row style=text- align:center2002‚Äì03 4 align=leftalign=leftalign=left44 1 - !scope=row style=text-align:center2003‚Äì04 4 align=leftalign=leftalign=left45 4 - !scope=row style=text-align:center2004‚Äì05 5 align=leftalign=leftalign=left44 2 - !scope=row style=text- align:center2005‚Äì06 5 align=leftalign=leftalign=left45 18 - !scope=row style=text-align:center2006‚Äì07 5 align=leftalign=leftalign=left49 3 - !scope=row style=text-align:center2007‚Äì08 5 align=leftalign=leftalign=left56 1 - !scope=row style=text- align:center2008‚Äì09 5 align=leftalign=leftalign=left57 0 - !scope=row style=text-align:center2009‚Äì10 5 align=leftalign=leftalign=left55 0 - !scope=row style=text-align:center2010‚Äì11 5 align=left (2) align=leftalign=left47 1 - !scope=row style=text- align:center2011‚Äì12 5 align=leftalign=leftalign=left42 1 - !scope=row style=text-align:center2012‚Äì13 4 align=left (3) align=leftalign=left50 1 - !scope=row style=text-align:center2013‚Äì14 4 align=leftalign=leftalign=left46 0 - !scope=row style=text- align:center2014‚Äì15 4 align=leftalign=leftalign=left49 6 - !scope=row style=text-align:center2015‚Äì16 4 align=leftalign=leftalign=left40 2 - !scope=row style=text-align:center2016‚Äì17 5 align=leftalign=leftalign=left35 3 - !scope=row style=text- align:center2017‚Äì18 6 align=leftalign=leftalign=left32 25 - !scope=row style=text-align:center2018‚Äì19 6 align=left (2) align=leftalign=left37 6 } Wins by playing position {  style=text-align:center - !Position!!Players!!Wins - !scope=row45 - !scope=row1621 - !scope=row1011 - !scope=row79 } Wins by nationality {  style=text-align:center - !Nationality!!Players!!Wins - !scope=row2932 - !scope=row35 - !scope=row13 - !scope=row12 - !scope=row12 - !scope=row11 - !scope=row11 } Notes References General   Specific Clubman of the Year York City Clubman of the Year York City F.C.

Nothing more is heard of the estate until about 1509, when William Canwyke paid a relief of 40s. for certain land in Stevenage called ' Broxborne' which he had received from Petronilla, his mother. In 1510 Samuel and Clemence Canwyke sold the 'manor' to William Lytton of Knebworth, who died seised of it in 1517. Eventually, the whole estate returned to the male line of the Lyttons and descended in the same manner as Knebworth. It is mentioned in 1811 after which its identity was probably lost among the other lands held by the Lyttons in Stevenage. Cannocks Wood in the southwest of the parish perhaps preserves its name.

It triggers autophagy via inhibition of the Akt/mTOR pathway and induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in A549 cells through JNK-dependent p53 Ser15 phosphorylation. Promotes autophagic cell death in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells and inhibits Akt/mTOR signaling. Induces intracellular ROS generation in a PI 5-kinase- dependent manner. * Plumbagin is also reported to have targeted anticancer activity against BRCA1 defective cancers.

The ensemble consists of 26 professional string musicians who perform four concert programs a year at both the Rogers Center for the Arts in North Andover, Massachusetts and New England Conservatory's Jordan Hall in Boston, Massachusetts. It is led by conductor and music director, Federico Cortese, and performs music from the 17th century to the present. History The New England String Ensemble began its inaugural concert season in 1994 under the guidance of founding music director, Christophe Chagnard, a native of Paris and resident of Seattle, who commuted to Boston for four years to help build the orchestra. Mr. Chagnard is also co-founder and music director of Seattle's award-winning Northwest Sinfonietta. The inaugural performance, A Musical Journey into Night, in September 1994 at Endicott College in Beverly, Massachusetts received international attention, including pieces in the New York Times and newspapers in Seattle, Paris and Tel Aviv as well as a feature by Paul Harvey, for its life-imitating-art triumph over a thunderstorm-induced power failure. In its fifth season, the 1998-99 season, the New England String Ensemble featured four finalists in its search for a local music director from which vocalist and conductor, Susan Davenny Wyner, was chosen to lead the orchestra into its sixth season, 1999-2000\\\\. That sixth season also featured a move into Cambridge, Massachusetts, with a series at the First Church Congregational at the invitation of keyboard artist Peter Sykes. A gradual migration into the Sanders Theatre at Harvard University and then to the Jordan Hall at the New England Conservatory in Boston completed the progression. Under the direction of Ms. Wyner, the artistic success of the New England String Ensemble was evidenced locally by growing audiences, high critical acclaim, and performance invitations, such as an invitation to the Bank of America Celebrity Series in 2004-05\\\\. National recognition included a Koussevitzky commission, one of seven in the United State awarded in 2003-04\\\\. Ms. Wyner resigned her position in April 2005 to pursue opera. In July 2005, Federico Cortese was engaged as conductor for the 2005-06 season and named music director in 2006. From the moment of his debut as assistant conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1998, stepping in at short notice to conduct Beethoven Symphony No. 9 in place of an ailing Seiji Ozawa, Cortese's work with the Boston Symphony Orchestra was widely praised. His other appointments include music director and associate conductor of the Spoleto Festival in Italy; assistant conductor to Daniele Gatti at the Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome; and assistant conductor to Robert Spano at the Brooklyn Philharmonic. Additionally, he has served as music director of the Greater Boston Youth Symphony Orchestras since 1999. Mission and educational programs The mission of New England String Ensemble is to \\"engage, educate, and inspire with passionate string orchestra performances and innovative community programs.\\"http://www.newenglandstringensemble.org/ Initially starting with a String Competition in 1996, the New England String Ensemble's educational programs have expanded to support four community initiatives for students in grades K-12 that provide a progression from beginning to advanced students. The programs include: *String Fever  a program for elementary age students that introduces them to string instruments and classical music. *Kids to Concerts ‚Äì middle school string players are invited to attend a New England String Ensemble concert free of charge and to participate in the pre-concert talk led by music director Federico Cortese and a post-concert reception to meet the musicians. *New England Musical Heritage Initiative ‚Äì this program unites composers, high school string players, and local historians as they explore and celebrate the rich diversity of New England culture and history. *String and Flute Competitions ‚Äì competition for advanced string and flute students (18 and under) from the New England area.

He was a tribune of the plebs in 62 BC, a praetor in 60 BC, a consul in 57 BC and the governor of Hispania Citerior in 56 BC. Metellus Nepos was a lieutenant (legate) of Pompey in the campaign against the pirates in the Mediterranean in 67 BC and, like his brother Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer, in the Third Mithridatic War (73‚Äì63 BC) against Mithridates VI of Pontus and Tigranes the Great of Armenia. In the war against the pirates he was assigned the command of Lycia and Pamphylia (both on the south coast of modern Turkey).Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Mithridatic War, 14.94 Josephus mentioned that in 65 BC Pompey sent Metellus and Lollius to capture Damascus, in Syria.Josephus, Jewish Antiquities, 14.1.4 It is generally assumed that this refers to Metellus Nepos. In 63 BC, Metellus Nepos was elected one of the ten tribunes of the plebs for 62 BC, along with Cato the Younger. Inaugurated on 10 December 63 BC, he began a vitriolic campaign against Cicero, whom he accused before the people of having illegally executed some of the accomplices of Catiline without trial during the Catilinarian Conspiracy. Metellus Nepos, together with his colleague Bestia and Julius Caesar, a praetor at the time, prevented Cicero from making a speech on the last day of his consulship, 29 December 63 BC, restricting him to the customary oath on giving up office. Cicero instead pronounced an oath of his own, \\"swearing that in very truth he had saved his country and maintained her supremacy,\\" which the people confirmed.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, the Life of Cicero, 32.1-3Cicero, Epistulae ad Familiares, 5.2 Metellus Nepos proposed a bill which provided for Pompey, recently victorious in the war against Mithridates, to be recalled to Rome with his army to restore order. The proposal was strongly opposed by Cato the Younger, who was a staunch optimate. The dispute came close to violence, and Metellus Nepos armed some of his men. According to Plutarch, the senate announced the intention to issue a final decree to remove Nepos from his office but Cato the Younger opposed it, but he does not mention whether the decree was enforced or not.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The life of Cato the Younger, 27-29.1-2 Metellus Nepos went to Asia to inform Pompey about the events, even though, as a plebeian tribune, he had no right to be absent from the city.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 37.43 Tatum maintains that Metellus Nepos leaving the city even though plebeian tribunes were not allowed to do so was 'a gesture demonstrating the senate's violation of the tribunate.' Tatum, J. W., The final Crisis (69-44), in A p. 198 Julius Caesar also proposed a measure to recall Pompey to Rome for the same reason. Caesar was suspended from his office by a final decree of the senate.Suetonius, The Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Julius Caesar, 16 In the end, both men dropped their proposals. When Metellus Nepos was a praetor in 60 BC, he passed a law which abolished import duties in Rome and Italy. The senate was angry and wished to erase his name for the law and replace it with another one, but, for whatever reason, this was not carried out.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 37.51.3-4 In 57 BC, when Metellus Nepos was one of the consuls, Pompey sponsored a vote to recall Cicero to Rome from his exile. The other consul, Publius Cornelius Lentulus Spinther, supported this cause in the senate partly as a favour to Pompey and partly because he bore a grudge against Publius Clodius Pulcher, the man who had had Cicero expelled. Metellus Nepos supported Clodius, setting up a factional struggle. Knowing that the people were in favour of Cicero's return, Clodius had some gladiators attack the public assembly during the vote to recall Cicero, and the measure was not passed. The opposing faction hit back with their own gladiators. Pressured by Spinther and Pompey, Nepos changed his mind, and Spinther then presented a motion for Cicero's return, which the senate decreed. Both consuls then proposed the motion to the people, who passed it.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 39.6 Cicero wrote him a letter prompted by his making a speech which was favourable to him in the senate and said that he had conquered himself and lay aside his enmity for the sake of the Republic. He also said that if he helped him he would be at his service.Cicero, Epistulae ad Familiares, 5.4 In 56 BC Metellus Nepos was Governor (proconsul) of Hispania Citerior, dominating La Coru√±a, where the Vaccaei had defeated his father.

It is a Grade II listed building. Built in 1141 by Sir Hugh de Hatton, the estate was occupied for some 400 years by Wroxall Priory, a Benedictine monastery of nuns, until the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII in 1536. In 1544 the King granted the estate to Robert Burgoyne of Sutton, Bedfordshire(d 1545) who had been one of the King's Commissioners for the Dissolution. His son Robert (d 1613), High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1597, built a manor house in Elizabethan style adjacent to the priory ruins. The Burgoyne family (later Burgoyne baronets) occupied the manor until 1713 when they sold it together with , to Sir Christopher Wren. Wren used the house as his country retreat, and it was occupied from time to time by members of his family, including his great-great-grandson Christopher Roberts Wren, High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1820. Later descendants sold the estate in 1861 to James Dugdale, High Sheriff of Warwickshire 1868, who demolished the old manor house and replaced it with an imposing mansion, thereafter to be known as Wroxall Abbey, in the Victorian Gothic style. The Lady Chapel adjacent to the Hall, now a church dedicated to St Leonard, and popularly known as Wren's Cathedral, is a Grade I listed building. It is a cathedral of the Free Methodist Church and is used for regular services and weddings. The nearby ruins of the 12th century abbey are Grade II* listed. The house was let and was occupied as a girls' school from 1936 to 1995. In 1995 the estate was purchased by the Quinn family, who leased it to a commercial company in 2001. The present lessees have converted the estate into a hotel.

It was sponsored by Nabisco and originally aired December 6, 1995 on CBS. The special was based on a 1963 book of the same name, by Robert Barry. In 2005, Mr. Willowby's Christmas Tree was adapted into a children's theater stage production by the Way Off Broadway Dinner Theatre. Plot The special begins with the song ‚ÄúThe Perfect Tree,‚Äù which features both Mr. Willowby (Robert Downey Jr.) singing about his desire to find the perfect Christmas tree and, within Willowby‚Äôs house, a father mouse singing that he will go out to get a tree for his family (his two children, Beverly and Ned, decide to come with him). After the song is finished, Willowby asks his butler, Baxter (Leslie Nielsen) where his tree is. The special then follows the family of mice out in the woods looking for a tree. Eventually, the father mouse spots ‚Äúthe perfect tree,‚Äù but it is far too large to fit into their tiny living quarters, so the family climbs the tree so that he can chop off the very top. Right when they reach the top, however, Willowby‚Äôs lumberjacks arrive at the scene and cut the entire tree down (as they sing the song ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Lumberjacks‚Äù). The family of mice hold on to the tree as it is brought to Willowby‚Äôs house. The tree is set up in the house, and Willowby notices it is slightly too tall. He has Baxter cut off the very top, and then tells him to bring up the top part of the tree (which the mouse family is in) to one of his staff, Swedish maid Miss Adelaide (Channing), whom Willowby describes as being a very lonely person who doesn‚Äôt even come down for Christmas. However, this is part of Mr. Willowby's hidden agenda of getting Baxter and Adelaide to admit their secret love for each other. Baxter does so, and while he is meeting with Adelaide, she describes her family‚Äôs traditions at Christmas time. While they are talking, a romantic interest between the two of them is insinuated. At one point, Baxter notices the father mouse on the floor, but Adelaide says it is Christmastime and thus would be wrong to kill the mouse at this time. She places the mouse up on a banister, and he returns to the top of the tree with his children. After Baxter leaves, Adelaide notices that the tree in her room is slightly too tall, so she cuts off the top and throws it out the window (with the mouse family in it). Before the father mouse can cut off the top, a bear picks up the tree and brings it home to her den and family to use as his own Christmas tree. The bears engage in their Christmas festivities, and eventually notice that the tree is too tall. They cut off the top (which once again has the mice in it) and throw it outside. The family of mice laugh at all they‚Äôve been through that evening, only to then be picked up (along with the remnants of the tree) by an owl. Meanwhile back at the manor, Mr. Willowby is piling gifts around the tree, but notices he doesn't hear Baxter anywhere. To his great satisfaction, he quickly finds the butler standing in the snow underneath Miss Adelaide's window, listening to her sing. The owls set up the tree in their own den, and then engage in an angelic chorus (the mouse family speculates that they never knew owls could be so musical). Eventually, they too notice that the tree they have is too tall, and so they cut off the top and throw it (along with the mice) outside. The father mouse then raises his axe to cut off a tree from the remnants that have been thrown outside, but then realizes that the tree as it is actually the perfect size for his own home. He and the other mice return to the manor. But Baxter catches Beverly by the tail, grousing over the possible mouse infestation. Fortunately at that moment, Willowby‚Äôs Christmas Ball is about to begin, and as the guests arrive, he hears Miss Adelaide leaving her room. Knowing how she would feel, he releases Beverly and tells her to \\"Hurry home for Christmas.\\" The mice race into their den with the tree, cheering that their Christmas can begin. Meanwhile, Mr. Willowby's Christmas party is in full swing. Adelaide comes down this time, and begins to dance with Baxter. With Mr. Willowby joining their dance for a moment, he turns to gaze upon the tree, and launches into a final rendition of \\"The Perfect Tree\\". The show ends with our narrarator Kermit The Frog leaving the darkened manor at party's end, wishing the audience Happy Holidays and good night. As the credits roll, Ned and Beverly begin relating their adventure to their mother while father dozes by the fireplace.

It was powered by the river Teme, with a blast furnace, a finery forge and latterly a rolling mill for blackplate (to be tinned into tinplate). It was probably built for Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester in the 1590s, but reverted to the Crown on his attainder, and was then let to Sir Henry Wallop. However, he evidently sublet it to working ironmasters. By 1623, it was run by Francis Walker, and continued to be operated by his descendants until the bankruptcy of Job Walker in 1695. They were also concerned in a number of other ironworks in southern and central Shropshire. About 1695, the ironworks, consisting of a blast furnace and a forge, was acquired by Richard Knight (1659-1745). He and then his sons gradually expanded their activities, acquiring ironworks in the valley of the River Stour. Richard Knight retired in about 1733, after which the works were managed by his son Ralph Knight for a family partnership with his brother Edward (1699-1780). After his death, the works passed to Edward, who ran them in partnership with his sons John (1740-1795) and James, managed by the latter. Their interest in the works ceased on Edward's death in 1778. Richard Knight had two other sons another Richard Knight (1693-1765) and Thomas Knight (1697-1764), the latter being the father of Richard Payne Knight MP (1750-1824) and Thomas Andrew Knight FRS (1759-1838). John Knight was father of Thomas Knight (1775-1853), who was active in publishing on mathematics, notably in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London (seven papers, something of a record for an otherwise quiet period). None of these descendants were directly concerned in the iron industry. However, because of the settlement of inheritance within the Knight family, Richard Payne Knight had a pecuniary interest that influenced the development of the family's ironworks; decisions were made in the interests of securing income that might not always have secured the iron industry. The works were put into repair in 1782 and run by William Downing of Pembridge with a various partners, passing to ultimately Samuel George. The 1782 lease expired in 1815. This coincided with a depression in the iron industry at the end of the Napoleonic War. This seems to mark its closure. The furnace had probably closed in the 1790s, when Samuel George built at furnace at Knowbury close to Titterstone Clee. From about 1740, in addition to the furnace and forge, there was a rolling mill further downstream, which produced blackplate, which was sent to a tinmill at Mitton (now in Stourport) to be made into tinplate. The name of a nearby wood suggests that tinplate may have been produced at Bringewood. However, this can only have been after period of the Knights' occupation of the works, as the surviving accounts (for 1733‚Äì78) show only blackplate being produced. Wood (for charcoal) came from the nearby chases of Bringewood, Mocktree and Darvel. Though the possibility of mining locally is mentioned in some leases, it is probable that the main source of ore was Titterstone Clee Hill. Pig iron, bar iron and blackplate, made in the works were carried by land to Bewdley for sale, so far as not sold locally. Bringewood bar iron enjoyed a high reputation as being tough.

He was ordered to be killed by the then president in 1975, and in 2000, four men were given 30-year jail sentences in connection with the killing. Orlando Mart√≠nez has become a symbol of freedom of expression in the Dominican Republic. Personal Orlando Mart√≠nez was born in Las Matas de Farf√°n in the Dominican Republic, in 1944. His father Luis Mariano Martinez and mother Adriana Howley had five boys, including Orlando, and his brothers were B√©lgica, T√∫cides (deceased), Nelson, and Sergio. He was educated at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Santo Domingo, which was close to where he was killed. His mother persisted in pushing for the reopening of her son's case after his assassination. Career Orlando Mart√≠nez was the editor of Revista Ahora and a columnist for the daily paper El Nacional. His column, \\"Microscope,\\" in the paper was one of the most widely read items of the period because it consistently brought to light crimes and corruption within the ruling Balaguer regime and the military. One of the last articles he wrote defended the rights of the artist Silvano Lora (1934-2003). Death Orlando Mart√≠nez had written articles critical of the president. He was assassinated in Santo Domingo de Guzm√°n on 17 March 1975 while President Joaqu√≠n Balaguer was in office. He was shot on the street called Jos√© Contreras near the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Santo Domingo. The murder weapon was a .38-caliber revolver that was identified as belonging to Mariano Cabrera Duran, who was later extradited from the United States to the Dominican Republic. Investigation Former President Joaquin Balaguer always claimed to have known who carried out the killing of Orlando Mart√≠nez but refused to tell the judicial authorities. He opted to not tell who they were and just wrote a \\"blank page\\" in his autobiography, Memories of a Courtesan in the Era of Trujillo, supposedly leaving for posterity the knowledge of who the killers were. Despite some initial arrests and a reward for information offered by Balaguer the case remained in limbo until President Leonel Fernandez, elected in 1996, ordered the case reopened. In 1998, Mariano Cabrera Duran, owner of a small Bronx Liquor store, was arrested by federal marshals and returned to the Dominican Republic. Duran was connected to the murder weapon that was used to kill Mart√≠nez. The orders for the assassination came from Gen. Isidoro Mart√≠nez, who died of cancer in 2001 (check). Those tried and convicted for carrying out the killing were retired Gen. Antonio Pou Castro, ex-Sergeant Mariano Duran and the two paramilitaries, Rafael Lluberes Ricart and Luis Emilio De la Rosa Veras. In 2000, the four men were given 30-year jail sentences in connection with the killing and Rafael Lluberes Ricart had been identified as the one who shot Mart√≠nez. The convicted had all been identified in 1975 in connection with the assassination. Context Orlando Mart√≠nez's assassination was not the only murder case due to political affiliation during the Balaguer 12-year regime. The journalist Jos√© Enrique Piera Puig was killed five years before Mart√≠nez was murdered. The murders of Am√≠n Abel Hasb√∫n, leftist-leader Otto Morales, and Maximiliano Gomez were all cases that occurred during this time. Throughout Balaguer's rule, it is estimated that he ordered the murders of more than 2,000 workers, students, and intellectuals combined. Impact Thirty years after Orlando Mart√≠nez's death, journalists from the Dominican Republic continue to write about him. He was known for his strong stances against the ruling regime and after his murder, he became a symbol of freedom of expression in the Dominican Republic. Reactions President Leonel Fernandez reopened the case in 1996 after he was elected.

Animals assigned to this family were most abundant during the Paleocene, but extant from the late Cretaceous to the early Eocene (). Like most early mammals, their actual relationships are very difficult to resolve. No Paleocene fossil has been unambiguously assigned to any living order of placental mammals, and many genera resemble each other: generalized robust, not very agile animals with long tails and all-purpose chewing teeth, living in warm closed-canopy forests with many niches left vacant by the K-T extinction. Arctocyonids were early defined as a family of creodonts (early predators), then reassigned to the condylarths (primitive plant-eaters, now understood as a wastebasket taxon). More recently, these animals have been thought to be the ancestors of the orders Mesonychia and Cetartiodactyla, although some morphological studies have suggested that Arctocyonidae is also a wastebasket taxon for basal ungulates, and is in fact polyphyletic. As of 2015, the largest cladistic study of Paleocene mammals to date supports the idea that the animals in this group are not related, with Arctocyon and Loxolophus sister to pantodonts+periptychids, Goniacodon and Eoconodon sister to carnivores+mesonychids, most other genera allied with creodonts and palaeoryctidans, and Protungulatum not a placental mammal at all. If this analysis holds true, then any \\"Arctocyonid\\" characteristics are the result of coincidence (selection by the observer of characteristics shared by many early Tertiary mammals) or convergence (similar habits in life).  Characteristics  Arctocyonid skulls had large canines and relatively sharp teeth and were thus superficially similar to those of modern carnivores. However, large canines appear as tools for display, intraspecific fighting, and self-defense in many genera that are not predatory (baboons, hippos, antlerless deer), and generalized mammal teeth often have relatively sharp elements. Arctocyanid teeth were not specialized for slicing meat; these animals were probably omnivorous and definitely the least herbivorous of the condylarths. Arctocyonid teeth show much individual variation and, because many members of this family are only known from fossil teeth, the taxonomy of the genera is highly unstable. Genera assigned to this group had relatively short limbs lacking the specializations associated with ungulates (e.g. reduced side digits, fused bones, and hoofs), and long, heavy tails. Their primitive anatomy makes it unlikely that they were able to run down prey, but with their powerful proportions, claws, and long canines, some genera may have been able to overpower smaller animals in surprise attacks.  Evolutionary variation  Genera assigned to the arctocyonids were the most common mammals in Europe during the Paleocene. Archaic arctocyanids, such as Prolatidens, have been found in the early Paleocene layers in Hainin, Belgium. The family was expanded to include a wide variety of genera, including Arctocyon (known as/similar to Claenodon in North America), Arctocyonides, Landenodon, and Mentoclaenodon, found in the late Paleocene layers of Cernay, France.Agusti 2002, pp 11-13 A near-complete skeleton of the North American Chriacus, which in recent analysis nests with the palaeoryctidans near the origin of pangolins, has been found in Wyoming. This small raccoon-like animal had powerful limb muscles and a long, robust, and maybe prehensile tail. Capable of both balancing in a tree and digging, it was adapted to both an arboreal and a terrestrial life. Arctocyon primaevus skull Larger animals assigned to arctocyonids spent most of their time on the forest floor, but were probably still able to climb trees. Some genera may have partly taken the role of large predators in Paleocene faunas together with groups now considered related, such as the triisodontids and mesonychids, two families traditionally classified as condylarths, but now assigned to the \\"predatory ungulate\\" order Mesonychia (which has been defined as a sister group to carnivores). Large arctocyonids include: Arctocyon, formerly considered diagnostic for the characteristics of the family, and most recently defined as a relative of periptychids and pantodonts. This robust, bear-sized animal was a plantigrade ungulate with short limbs; its feet had claws and it had a long tail. It had a long skull equipped with a large sagittal crest and large canines, especially the lower ones. It had low-crowned, bunodont molars (i.e. teeth with rounded cusps) similar to modern bears, and it is assumed that they had a similar omnivorous diet. The related subfamily Arctocyonides were smaller and more slender. Mentoclaenodon was, judging from the scarce material available on the genus, larger than the other two large genera and tended to develop long canines similar to early big cats.

It is located in the city of Bhadravathi, India. It was started as the Mysore Iron Works on 18 January 1923 by Sir M Visvesvaraya. It is now a steel plant under the jurisdiction of the Steel Authority of India Limited. History The Iron Works were started by Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar, the king of Mysore, under the guidance of his Diwan, Sir M Visvesvaraya. The main objective was to tap the rich iron ore deposits near Kemmanagundi in the Baba Budangiri hills and manufacture pig iron and other products.H. Chittaranjan (2005), p148 A preliminary investigation of setting up an iron and steel factory at Bhadravathi was done in 1915-1916. This investigation was done by a New York based firm who explored the possibility of manufacturing pig iron with the use of charcoal fuel.K. Abhishankar (1975), p186 The years 1918-1922 were spent in setting up the factory. To start with, a wood distillation plant for manufacturing charcoal and blast furnace for smelting iron were set up in the factory. Agencies were established in Madras, Ahmedabad and Karachi and a sales office was opened in Bombay.K. Abhishankar(1975), p187 A cast iron pipe plant, open hearth furnace, rolling mills and a cement plant were later added and the name of the factory was changed to The Mysore Iron and Steel Works. In 1939, the Shimoga-Talguppa railway line was laid, using wood from the Malnad forests were transported to this plant, to be used as a fuel in its furnaces. In 1952, two electric pig-iron surfaces were installed in the company, thereby making VISL the first iron and steel company in India to use electricity in the smelting of iron ore.K. Abhishankar (1975), p188 In 1962, the name was changed to The Mysore Iron and Steel Limited and the factory was converted into a Government company jointly owned by the Government of India and the Government of Karnataka with an equity share ratio of 40:60 respectively. The year 1962 also saw the establishment of a new steel plant which could produce steel using the relatively new L D Process. In order to honour its founder, the company was renamed as Visvesvaraya Iron and Steel Limited in 1975. In 1989, it was taken over by the Steel Authority of India as a subsidiary entity and in 1998, VISL was merged into SAIL. Financials In the initial years, pig-iron was the main product manufactured here and its production was increased from 4,817 tonnes in 1923 to 20,321 tonnes in 1935. But the increased production could not be turned into a profit-making business and except for the years 1928 and 1929, the company encountered losses during this period. However, the company recovered in the coming years, making a turnover of Rs. 173.13 lakhs and a profit of Rs. 32.21 lakhs in the year 1951. In 1962, the company had a sales turnover of Rs. 638.09 lakhs, earning a profit of Rs. 48.3 lakhs. However, by the year 1970, the company had run into losses, only to recover in the year 1972 to make a profit of Rs. 24.13 lakhs. Mounting losses made SAIL to think of disinvesting VISL and there was also a proposal that it could be taken over by the Indian Defence Ministry since it needed alloy steel, of which VISL was a major producer. However, it remained under SAIL control and encountered a turn around in November 2004 when it started making profits and it has continued to be profitable since then. Raw materials For the first two years (1923‚Äì24), the iron ore required by the company was supplied from the limonite deposits at Chattanahalli near Kumsi.K. Abhishankar (1975), p181 From 1924 onwards, mining operations were started at Kemmanagundi and these yielded good quality of iron ore (58-60% iron content). Limestone, which is used as a flux in the steel making process and dolomite which is used as a refractory material were mined from Bhadigunda mines, near Bhadravathi. Quartz, used in the manufacture of ferrosilicon and pig iron was mined from Bilikalbetta mines, fire clay used in the manufacture of refractories was mined at Shankaragudda hills and black clay used in the manufacture of cement was mined from Umblebylu fields near Bhadravathi. Concerns On 31 July 2003, ten workers in the factory died due to a blast which occurred when leaking water accidentally got mixed with hot molten steel. This questioned the safety measures employed in the plant. It is also alleged that despite employing pollution treatment plants, the effluents discharged from the company is polluting the Bhadra river.

It is owned by Pembrokeshire County Council and just over from the larger Fishguard Harbour station. Following its closure in 1964 (1980 for Motorail), it reopened on 14 May 2012 following investment from Network Rail and Pembrokeshire County Council. History The overgrown and derelict state of the station (2007) =Construction of the line= The station was the planned terminus of the Rosebush and Fishguard Railway. Complications meant that, despite work having begun at Rosebush in 1878, the line was not completed by 1898 when the company (now called the North Pembrokeshire and Fishguard Railway) was purchased by the Great Western Railway Company. It is likely that this takeover was prompted by the North Pembrokeshire & Fishguard Railway's plans for a harbour at Goodwick to attract Irish traffic (the GWR had a major such port at Neyland) and/or their ambitious plan to link this new harbour to Carmarthen with their own line to break the GWR's monopoly of rail lines into west Wales. =Early years= Goodwick station opened on 1 August 1899 under GWR ownership. The station was called Goodwick until 1 May 1904 when it was renamed Fishguard and Goodwick. It was a terminus until the GWR opened their extension to Fishguard Harbour in 1906 and moved their Irish ferry operation there from Neyland. =Closure and subsequent usage= The station was closed on 6 April 1964 by British Railways, when local trains between Fishguard and Clarbeston Road were withdrawn. After closure to normal passenger trains the station remained in use for workmen's trains to the RNAD Trecwn, until these services were withdrawn on 1 August 1964. From 18 June 1965 the station became the terminus of a seasonal motorail service from London, the end loading dock behind the former main (Up side) platform being used for unloading the cars. Early photographs show the station building to be shorter than it is today, with the extension carried out along with refurbishment for motorail traffic. Motorail kept the station in use each summer season until the regular service ended on 19 September 1980 and the occasional peak service on 16 September 1982. The station was used temporarily in June 1982, when the railway lines at Fishguard Harbour were moved and re-laid. InterCity 125 services ran through the site of station until the early 1990s but services ceased in 1994.Intercity Magazine Network Map 1993 Retrieved 5 December 2012 Reopening The new Fishguard and Goodwick Railway station under construction (2012) Reopening Fishguard and Goodwick as a rail/bus interchange had been considered by Pembrokeshire County Council for some years. For this reason it purchased the (disused) station site. This was sometime before an increased service frequency on the Fishguard line was secured, and no visible progress was made towards reopening until the announcement of extra trains. In March 2011, it was announced that Welsh Assembly Government subsidy would be provided to allow an increase in train frequency on the Fishguard line from two trains per day to seven from 12 September 2011 for three years. This prompted a search for funding to reopen Fishguard & Goodwick railway station; funding was successfully found and it was announced that the station was to reopen in March 2012. The reopening work cost ¬£325,000, including realignment of the track by Network Rail by the end of 2011 and laying of tarmac over part of the station yard to provide a car park (with further tarmac over the rest of the station yard, to enlarge the car park, a future possibility). Another aspect of the work was demolition of the station building, which took place in August 2011 between the announcement of extra services and their launch (on 12 September). Since the station is within the Goodwick Conservation Area, this demolition violated policy 80 of the Joint Unitary Development Plan for Pembrokeshire, but went ahead anyway as the building was in a dangerous condition with very little in a state that could possibly have been salvaged. The work to reopen the station was a joint operation between Pembrokeshire County Council and Network Rail. In March 2012, Network Rail announced that the station would reopen on 14 May 2012 and would be served by the seven trains each way per day which currently run through the station. The station duly reopened on 14 May 2012. It was adopted under Arriva's adopt-a-station scheme by the local community group POINT. Services In the current (winter 2018) timetable, there are seven daily (Mon-Sat) departures each way on a very irregular schedule (particularly in the afternoon, where there are no departures either way for more than six hours). Six of the services run to at least , with one through train to Manchester Piccadilly one to and one to Swansea. The other departure runs to , where it connects into a Milford Haven to Manchester Piccadilly train. On Sundays, there are three trains each way, run primarily to serve the ferry to/from Rosslare. Two of these run to Swansea and the other to Cardiff Central.

It was released in 1977, during the most popular days of the Turkish historic films. The film is about the life of a Turkic warrior named Olcayto, portrayed by C√ºneyt Arkƒ±n, who is the son of a Kyrgyz chief in Central Asia. When he was a small boy, Chinese troops attack their tribe and kill Olcayto's father. After this event, he decides to take revenge from Chinese warlords. Later, he would find a chance to do so when Chinese form an alliance with a Sheikh from South Asia, who uses all his efforts to kill Olcayto because of the love affair between his daughter and Olcayto. One of the main motives of the film is the \\"Bozkƒ±r Yasasƒ±\\" (Law of the Steppe). During many key scenes of the film, characters act according to this notion which praises the success of a warrior. This also gives the film a nationalistic flavour which can be considered as an \\"essential\\" point of the genre. Writer Erdoƒüan T√ºna≈ü possibly got his inspiration from Karaoƒülan, the popular character of Suat Yalaz. Both Olcayto and Karaoƒülan are from Central Asia, they are talented warriors, they have noble black horses and they both use swords which have grey wolf figures on their handles. Another important detail of the film is that C√ºneyt Arkƒ±n's partner in it is Aytekin Akkaya, the same actor who also stars in the Turkish cult film D√ºnyayƒ± Kurtaran Adam with Arkƒ±n.

Publication history Doughboy first appeared in Captain America #209 (May 1977), created by Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography Doughboy is an artificially created life-form created by Arnim Zola as his servant at Castle Zola in Weisshorn Mountain, Switzerland. Doughboy is a non-humanoid bioform who normally assumes an enormous pie-shaped form with a face consisting of eyes, a mouth, and sometimes a nose, long rubbery arms with only two fingers each, and stalk-like legs with two toes each. His body resembles dough both in appearance and in consistency. Doughboy was employed by Arnim Zola against Captain America in Zola's first encounter with the Captain.Captain America and the Falcon #209-210 Years later, Zola merged Doughboy with Primus, who took control of Doughboy and conspired with Baron Zemo against Captain America.Captain America #277-279 Several years later, Doughboy was separated from Primus, and was again serving Zola. Doughboy fought and defeated Crossbones when they entered Zola's castle.Captain America #383 Doughboy later used his shape-shifting powers to mimic an Avengers quinjet during Zola's rescue of the Red Skull and Skeleton Crew.Captain America #393 Doughboy next captured Captain America and the Eric Masterson version of Thor at Skullhouse, and took them to the bottom of Devil's Lake on Zola's order. Doughboy was split open and smashed into bits by Masterson.Captain America #395-396 Doughboy later fought the Thunderbolts when they invaded Zola's base in China.Thunderbolts: International Incident Powers and abilities Doughboy is a genetically-engineered bioform created by Arnim Zola. Doughboy is mentally impaired, but possesses a high degree of superhuman strength, durability, and agility. Doughboy possesses an extremely malleable body, enabling him to alter his shape at will. He can alter the color and even the hardness of his body, and once even effectively duplicated the appearance of an Avengers quinjet. He can stretch, deform, expand, compress, and flatten all or part of his body at will. Within certain limits he can use his body to enclose and muffle an explosion and absorb the impact of bullets or other projectiles without harm to himself. His body is highly adhesive and is as viscous as tar. Hence, his body can trap and absorb persons or objects as if it were made of quicksand. Although Doughboy can be injured, his wounds close immediately without bleeding. Doughboy can shed excess body mass at will and apparently can add to his body mass by absorption of organic matter. The Eric Masterson Thor once battered Doughboy to pieces, but it is believed that he was able to reform himself. Doughboy is capable of self- levitation, allowing flight and subsonic speeds. Doughboy is not sentient; hence, while he can understand and follow his master's commands, he has no creative intelligence and virtually no will of his own. He is apparently incapable of speech. In other media =Television= * Doughboy appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episodes \\"Living Legend\\" and \\"Acts of Vengeance\\", with his vocal effects provided by Grant Moninger. * Doughboy appears in the Avengers Assemble episodes \\"The Once and Future Kang\\" and \\"Dimension Z\\". A giant Doughboy monster emerges from New York Harbor, where it is quickly taken down by the New Avengers and contained. Jane Foster admits she accidentally released the creature from another dimension when she attempted to locate the Avengers' whereabouts in space-time. At the time when Ant-Man was rescuing Captain America, Black Widow, and Hawkeye from Dimension Z, one of the lines of defense in the fight against Arnim Zola was a group of Doughboys. When Ant-Man and Hawkeye managed to defeat Arnim Zola, the Doughboys dissolved.

It was established in 1990 by Craig Balsam and Cliff Chenfeld. Based in New York City (with additional offices in Los Angeles and Nashville), Razor & Tie releases are distributed by Universal Music Group. Razor & Tie initially focused on compilation albums and re- issues. Directly marketed through television spots, the label had early success with 70s, 80s and 90s-themed albums, beginning with Those Fabulous 70s in 1990. A retail label was launched in 1995 to release new albums from established and developing artists, including Dar Williams, Graham Parker and Marshall Crenshaw. Razor & Tie continued to expand their rock signings, and by 2016, with releases by artists including The Pretty Reckless, Starset, All That Remains and Red Sun Rising it had become a leader in the genre. In 2001, Balsam and Chenfeld created Kidz Bop, a series of albums with young singers covering pop hits. As of 2016, Kidz Bop had sold more than 16 million albums, 22 of which debuted in the Top 10 on the Billboard charts, Kidz Bop holds the title for the most Top 10 debuts of any artist this century. Releases on Razor & Tie have cumulatively exceeded sales of 45 million physical and digital albums, singles, videos and DVDs. A music publishing division was founded in 2007, and in 2014 Razor & Tie launched Washington Square Records, an alternative leaning label. In 2015 Concord Bicycle acquired an undisclosed percentage of Razor & Tie, which now operates as New Razor & Tie Enterprises LLC, a joint venture. Concord fully acquired Razor & Tie on January 17, 2018. As of May 2018, Razor & Tie operates as an imprint of Concord Music's Fearless Records label.  Craig Balsam Craig Balsam is an American businessman, film producer, co-Founder and Co-CEO of Razor & Tie, an American entertainment company. Balsam grew up in Millburn, New Jersey, graduated from Emory College and earned his law degree from New York University where he met fellow student Cliff Chenfeld. After practicing law for several years, Balsam and Chenfeld left their law jobs in 1990 and formed Razor & Tie, an independent record label. The label initially focused on compilation albums (Monster Ballads) and reissues and has since become one of the leading rock labels in the country with artists such as The Pretty Reckless, Starset, All That Remains, The Sword and Red Sun Rising. In recent years the company has added Washington Square, an alternative leaning imprint and a music publishing company. Razor & Tie Publishing is responsible for No. 1 hits including ‚ÄúHome‚Äù by Phillip Phillips, ‚ÄúGod Gave Me You‚Äù by Blake Shelton, ‚ÄúWhiskey In My Water‚Äù by Tyler Farr, ‚ÄúWe Went‚Äù by Randy Houser and ‚ÄúAlone With You‚Äù by Jake Owen. In 2001, Balsam and Chenfeld launched Kidz Bop, a series of audio releases of kids singing pop hits that are appropriate for children. The franchise has sold more than 16 million albums and become the leading kids‚Äô audio brand in the country. Kidz Bop has expanded significantly to include a national tour, merchandise, music videos and a channel on Sirius XM. Balsam has been the executive producer of a number of films including Joan Baez: How Sweet The Sound and The Last Five Years and theatrical productions including Small Mouth Sounds. History =1990-1995: Beginnings, compilation albums, reissues= Razor & Tie was founded by Craig Balsam and Cliff Chenfeld, who met while in law school at NYU. Musicians as well as music fans, they played and wrote songs together while pursuing their degrees and continued to collaborate after they had begun working as lawyers. Following several years of practicing separately at large, corporate firms, Balsam and Chenfeld began to explore the idea of releasing records from the 70s. \\"We really didn‚Äôt enjoy practicing law as much as we enjoyed music. So we began to think about ways we could maybe change our careers,\\" Chenfeld said in 2010. In 1990, they founded Razor & Tie, naming the company after a song they had written while working as lawyers. In late 1990, working out of Chenfeld's apartment, Razor & Tie released their first record, Those Fabulous 70s, a compilation of AM radio hits. It was sold through a late-night television spot presented by The '70s Preservation Society, fictitious entity that Balsam and Chenfeld had created to market the album. Through the commercial‚Äîwhich featured a \\"leisure-suited fellow with a tie so wide you could land a helicopter on it\\"‚Äîthe album sold in excess of 100,000 copies. Those Fabulous 70s was followed by a successful series of genre- specific 70s records and 80s compilations, and in 1994 alone Razor & Tie sold more than a million albums. Living in the 90s, released in 1995, was the label's bestselling album of the period; its success helped to establish Razor & Tie as the largest direct response music company in the United States. Razor & Tie's early business model also focused on reissues. With less overhead than larger record companies and an ability to focus on niche marketing, the company licensed titles from major labels which, at the time, would not have otherwise been released on CD. \\"It was great because we were allowed to get into a lot of music that we loved, and it was a business scale that worked very well for us. At the time, if we sold twenty thousand copies of something we could make that work, and sometimes, we‚Äôd sell one hundred or two hundred and we‚Äôd make that work,\\" Chenfeld said. The first album Razor & Tie reissued was The Up Escalator by Graham Parker and the Rumour. It was followed by a series of reissues with added bonus material and comprehensive career retrospectives from artists a wide range of artists including Glen Campbell, King Curtis, Joe Meek and Merle Haggard. =1995-2000: Retail label, Dar Williams, Monsters releases= In 1995, with an office in Greenwich Village, Razor & Tie launched a new music division. They released new albums by established artists such as Marshall Crenshaw, Joan Baez, and Graham Parker, which allowed Razor & Tie to focus on broadening audiences rather than developing new ones. (Parker had recorded for seven major labels. \\"The idea of having advertisements say Graham Parker's 'minor label debut' was appealing to me,\\" he said.) The first new artist signed to Razor & Tie was Dar Williams, who released her debut album The Honesty Room in February, 1995. A single from the album, \\"When I Was a Boy\\" received significant radio play, and the album went on to become one of the best selling independent folk albums of the year. Williams toured with labelmate Baez, who covered one of Williams' songs. In a 1995 interview with Billboard, Williams noted the similarities in their careers. \\"There were parallels in choosing a less flashy label over a more flashy label,\\" she said. \\"Vanguard (Baez' first label) chose to do things more pared down and acoustic, which is what the label I chose is allowing me to do.\\" Each of Williams' first five Razor & Tie releases sold more than 100,000 albums. Razor & Tie also had significant success with Cledus T. Judd, the \\"Weird Al Yankovic of Country Music.\\" He released four albums on the label between 1995 and 1999, including I Stoled This Record, which was certified gold, and Did I Shave My Back for This? which hit the top 20 on the country music charts. In 1997 Razor & Tie released the 2-CD set, Monsters of Rock, a compilation of hits by 1980s glam metal bands. Released in December through an \\"appropriately over the top, tongue-in-cheek\\" two minute television spot, an abbreviated version was launched at retail the following June. Before the end of the year, it had sold 150,000 copies through direct channels and was certified gold through traditional sales. Monsters of Rock was followed in 1998 by Monster Ballads, an \\"aerosol-enhanced\\" compilation. With a December TV spot and a June retail debut, it was certified platinum in early 2000. Razor & Tie created Razor & Tie Media in 1997 to provide media buying for its own releases as well as releases from other record companies. In 1999, the label signed a distribution deal with BMG, which was transferred to Sony Music when BMG and Sony merged in 2003. =2000-2010: Kidz Bop, DVD and video releases, Razor & Tie Music Publishing= In 2000 Balsam and Chenfeld created Kidz Bop, a series of records of kids singing pop hits that are appropriate for children. The first compilation, a 2-CD set, was released in October 2001. Sixteen of the 17 Kidz Bop albums that came out over the next ten years debuted at #1 on the Billboard Kids charts. In 2009, Balsam and Chenfeld decided to expand Kidz Bop by establishing Kidz Bop Kids, who perform the songs both on record and on The Kidz Bop tour. The franchise now includes a radio channel on Sirius XM. Other successful Razor & Tie titles in the early 2000s included the DVD release of Biggie & Tupac and Darren's Dance Moves, a how-to dance video by choreographer Darrin Henson. Available only as a video and DVD, it charted at #1 in its category, and \\"seeped into the mainstream culture.\\" It ultimately surpassed 1.5 million in sales. 2003's Deja Entendu by Brand New, signed through a joint venture with Triple Crown Records, was certified gold; one of Rolling Stone's \\"Top 40 Emo Records of All Time,\\" it \\"redefined the genre.\\" By the end of the decade, Razor & Tie had begun phasing out the compilation albums and was primarily focused on new albums by established and developing artists. Through a label deal with Prosthetic, they signed All That Remains, whose six Razor & Tie albums had cumulative sales of more than one million. In 2005, Razor & Tie began distributing the releases of Sh-K- Boom/Ghostlight Records, the Broadway cast recording label. Best-selling releases from Sh-K- Boom/Ghostlight have included the original cast recordings of Book of Mormon, Beautiful, In The Heights, Next To Normal, and Legally Blonde. In 2007, the company founded Razor & Tie Music Publishing (RTMP). Self-administered in North America, it was aligned with a global team of sub- publishers throughout the rest of the world. =2010-present: Rock Dominance, Concord Bicycle Music Group, Washington Square Records, RTMP #1s, Analog Spark= In 2010, Razor & Tie established a joint venture imprint, Artery/Razor & Tie, with the Artery Foundation, a Sacramento-based management company.It released records by artists including Attila and Chelsea Grin. The joint venture concluded in 2014. In 2012, Razor & Tie Music Publishing appeared for the second consecutive quarter in the Top 10 Billboard Country Publishers airplay chart. They had three #1 Country hits in less than twelve months with ‚ÄúGod Gave Me You,\\" performed by Blake Shelton and written by singer/songwriter Dave Barnes, ‚ÄúAlone With You‚Äù performed by Jake Owen and co- written by Catt Gravitt and Shelton's ‚ÄúOver,\\" co-written by David Elliott. Among other successful songs, \\"We Went,\\" co-written by RTMP songwriter John King went to #1, and Greg Holden‚Äôs song ‚ÄúHome‚Äù (as performed by American Idol Winner Phillip Phillips) hit #1 on ten Billboard charts. As of 2016, the song was five times platinum. ‚ÄúWhiskey In My Water,\\" performed by Tyler Farr and co-written with Phillip LaRue, also hit #1. In 2014, RTMP relocated its Nashville headquarters to a converted warehouse space In the SoBro neighborhood near Cannery Row. It houses several recording studios, writer and listening rooms, a rehearsal space, and a performance area. With hit records from The Pretty Reckless, All That Remains, and Starset, Razor & Tie was the most successful independent rock label of the year, and the second strongest rock label overall in 2014. That same year, the company launched Washington Square Records. An alternative leaning label, Washington Square has since released records by artists including MOTHXR, Austin Plaine, Soren Bryce, My Jerusalem, and The Low Anthem. Analog Spark, an audiophile imprint focused on the reissue of classic, critically acclaimed albums on 180-gram vinyl and SACD was established in February 2015. Analog Spark's first releases included titles from Glenn Gould and Dave Brubeck as well as the original cast recordings of My Fair Lady and West Side Story. In 2015, Billboard published its inaugural \\"Greatest Of All Time\\" rankings, a comprehensive collection of the best-selling songs, albums and artists in music history. With 22 Top 10 debuts since 2001, Kidz Bop was #4 on the \\"Most Billboard 200 Top 10 Albums\\" list, just behind The Rolling Stones, Barbra Streisand, The Beatles and Bob Dylan. Kidz Bop held the fourth-highest tally of any artist in history and the most Top 10 debuts of any artist since 2000. After 25 years of operating independently, in September 2015, Concord Bicycle Music acquired a \\"significant\\" percentage of Razor & Tie to form Razor & Tie Enterprises, LLC. Under the new venture, Concord Bicycle will administer Razor & Tie Music Publishing, support the expansion of the Kidz Bop franchise, and provide other strategic resources. Balsam and Chenfeld remain the company's co-CEOs. In April 2018, RT Industries, a new label created by Razor & Tie's founders, acquired the catalogues of several Warner Music Group artists, including Fat Joe and Sheena Easton.

He co-founded the Old Town School of Folk Music in Chicago, Illinois. As a performer, he has recorded for several labels, including Folkways Records. He was a member of the folk group The Weavers in the early 1960s, and appeared at the first Newport Folk Festival in 1959. He was the house musician ‚Äì playing guitar and other folk instruments ‚Äì for Chicago's Gate of Horn, the nation's first folk music nightclub. After many years of teaching, playing and singing in California he married a third time, and with his wife relocated to Atlanta, where he performs on jazz guitar and co-founded the Frank Hamilton School in 2015. Early days  Hamilton was an only child. His father, Frank Strawn Hamilton, died before his son's birth; he had been a California socialist philosopher, genius street-corner orator, and mentor to Jack London. His mother, Judith Bley Strawn Hamilton, then married Phil Street, who had been a good friend of Hamilton's father; he encouraged his step-son's song-writing. That marriage ended when Frank was 12, and he never saw Street again. Classical music was what Hamilton, aka Strawn- Hamilton, first heard: he listened as his mother taught classical piano in their Los Angeles home. His mother ‚Äì who changed her name from Gladys Antoinette to Judith after seeing the actress Judith Anderson perform ‚Äì supplemented her income as a dance accompanist. As a teenager Hamilton developed an interest in the labor movement, playing jazz trombone with Local 47 at Club 47, and also with the Los Angeles City College jazz band. He was especially influenced by Louis Armstrong and Charlie Parker, and starting learning guitar, studying jazz guitar with Sam Surace. He began learning and collecting folk songs, with a special interest in the music of the American South; he spent much of the late 1940s and early 1950s traveling there, performing in bars and on street corners. He returned to Los Angeles in 1953, and with Jack Elliott and Guy Carawan formed The Dusty Road Boys, who toured the Midwest. At Will Geer's artist colony in Topanga, California. he played with Woody Guthrie; he also met Bess Lomax Hawes there, absorbing her teaching methods. Chicago Old Town School of Folk Music In 1956, at the Gate of Horn folksong nightclub in Oak Park, Illinois, Hamilton met Win Stracke, who took an interest in his teaching career. In Dawn Greening's dining room in Oak Park, Hamilton began teaching a group of 15 instrumentalists. In 1957 Hamilton, Stracke and Greening recruited teachers and an organizer, rented a space, and founded the Old Town School of Folk Music. Hamilton taught guitar and banjo and served as unofficial dean. Several hundred prospective students, performers, and educators attended the first session, and famous singers and folklorists ‚Äì without compensation ‚Äì began performing during the Second Half. Among them were Pete Seeger, Odetta, Studs Terkel, Doc Watson, Mahalia Jackson, Bill Monroe, the Weavers, and Jean Ritchie. Second Half, which follows the class lessons, is essential to the Old Town School method: both teachers and students sing and play together at their own level, and especially talented men and women are invited to perform. The School continues to promote the spontaneity, playful joyousness, improvisation, personal relationships, and progressive ideals which are hallmarks of Hamilton's teaching. Atlanta years After decades of living in California, in 1985 Hamilton married Mary Susan Doyle Smith; she became a supportive stepmother to his son Evan from an earlier marriage. Mary worked for Delta Airlines, and Hamilton relocated with her to Atlanta. She accompanied him on guitar, banjo, ukulele, and autoharp, and she also taught guitar. The occasion for the founding of the Frank Hamilton Folk School was Mary's sudden death in 2014. Bob Bakert, a friend of Frank's, volunteered to serve as Master of Ceremonies for the memorial concert for her, at Steve's Live Music in Sandy Springs. Concerned for Frank's well-being, and having heard of his interest in starting a second folk music school in Atlanta, Bakert suggested helping him achieve that goal; Hamilton responded positively. Together, they co-founded Frank Hamilton School in the fall of 2015 in Atlanta, but the school soon outgrew its first location; this had also occurred in Chicago. Under the leadership of Hamilton and Shelley Satonin-Hershkovits, the school now meets in eight-week sessions at the Oakhurst Baptist Church in Decatur.

Apart from football, Rewera, a member of the WCKS society, had other departments as well ‚Äì volleyball, boxing, ice hockey, cycling, track and field. All home games were held at a municipal stadium in Potocki Park, funded by the local savings bank. Among the activists of Rewera, was the father of Maryla Rodowicz, one of the most popular Polish singers. The club was founded in 1908, when the city of Stanis≈Çaw√≥w (Stanyslaviv) belonged to the Austrian province of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. The name of the city comes from the nickname of Polish magnate Stanis≈Çaw Potocki, whose son, Andrzej Potocki, founded the city of Stanis≈Çaw√≥w. \\"Rewera\\" is a variation of a Latin proverb \\"re vera\\", which means \\"in fact\\". The football team of Rewera never managed to qualify to the elite Polish Football League, however, it was a regular champion of the Stanis≈Çaw√≥w regional A-Class (see: Lower Level Football Leagues in Interwar Poland).

He was praetor in 71 BC. He succeeded Gaius Verres as governor of Sicily in 70 BC. He died in office as consul in 68 BC. His co-consul was Quintus Marcius Rex.  Family  The Caecilii Metelli were an illustrious family of the Roman republic. They were politically conservative, although members of the plebeian gens Caecilia. Lucius' grandfather was Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus. He was praetor in 148 BC, consul in 143 BC, and censor in 131 BC. He was given the command in Macedonia, where he defeated Andriscus, a pretender to the throne. He received a triumph and the cognomen 'Macedonicus' for his victory. He was an opponent of Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus.Salazar, Christine F. Brill's New Pauly: Encyclopedia of the Ancient World Vol 2. Boston: Brill Leiden. 2003. 874-879. Lucius' father was Gaius Caecilius Metellus Caprarius, Macedonicus' youngest son. Caprarius fought under Scipio Aemilianus in Numantia. He was praetor in 117 BC, consul in 113 BC, and fought as proconsul in Thrace in 112 BC. He triumphed for his victory in Thrace in 111 BC. He was censor in 102 BC. Lucius had two brothers. One was Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus. Creticus was praetor in 74 BC, consul in 69 BC, and pontifex from 73 until his death in the late 50s BC. He was given the proconsular command against Crete during his consulship. He subjugated the island and triumphed for his victory in 62 BC. He was an opponent of Pompey. Lucius' other brother was Marcus Caecilius Metellus. He was praetor and president of the extortion court in 69 BC. Lucius' sister, Caecilia Metella, was married to Gaius Verres. Verres was governor of Sicily from 73 to 71 BC and the defendant on trial in Cicero's speech Against Verres I.  Role in Verres' trial  In Cicero's Against Verres, Cicero is the prosecuting attorney on behalf of the island of Sicily. They were prosecuting Verres for moral corruption, bribery, theft, and killing Roman citizens without a trial, something forbidden by Roman law. The trial took place in late 70 BC. Lucius's family supported Verres, and were well- positioned to support him: Lucius was Governor of Sicily when the trial took place, his elder brother, Creticus, was to be consul in 69 BC along with fellow Verres supporter Quintus Hortensius Hortalus, and Marcus, the youngest brother, was to be president of the extortion court in 69 BC. Because of this, Verres unsuccessfully tried to put off the trial until 69 BC, when the Caecilii Metelli and Hortensius would have the power to gain his acquittal.

Adulthood is a sequel to the 2006 film Kidulthood, which Clarke also wrote, and depicts Peel's experiences after he is released from jail. It grossed ¬£1,203,319 at the UK Box Office during its opening weekend, finishing fourth behind The Incredible Hulk, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and Sex and the City. After starring in the film, Adam Deacon decided to write and star in his own urban film, Anuvahood. The final film of the trilogy, Brotherhood, also by Clarke, was released in 2016. Plot Six years after being jailed for killing Trevor ‚ÄúTrife‚Äù, Sam Peel is released from prison. During the course of the film, it is revealed that Sam has changed dramatically and is not the person he was six years ago. He has learnt from his mistakes and is still haunted by his crime. Sam is later on a bus and witnesses two occupants give their seat up to a woman. He also sees another man staring at him. Later, when he visits Trife's grave at Oak Park cemetery, the man he saw earlier sits next to him. He says his name is Jehvon and starts a conversation with him. Later in the conversation, the man brings up the murder and attacks Sam. He turns out to be Trife's cousin, and he wounds Sam. Sam is later able to gain control of the fight and beats him into submission. Trife's cousin informs him that he will not survive the day, as many people want him dead ‚Äì and will stop at nothing, not even harming his family. Sam, troubled by these claims, goes to his house and breaks in. No one is home, so Sam bandages up his wound. He then has a flashback to his prison days which reveals he helped a high ranking prison mate escape an attack from Trife's uncle, Curtis. Sam then goes into a room, goes through the drawers and picks up a gun which he discards, then leaves. As Sam later visits Claire and asks for information regarding his mother, he says he won't hurt her, however Claire says she hasn't seen his mother in over a year, and also tells him that Mooney is at university, and that that's all she knows. Then Claire's partner Hayden arrives, and attacks Sam when he realises who he is, berating him for all the emotional damage he caused Claire six years ago. Sam then visits Mooney and asks for information regarding anyone who might hurt his family. He says he has changed, however Mooney reveals that he should be wary of Jay as he has changed for the worse. He also tells him that Sam inspired him to study Law, so he can make sure people like him do not go free in 6 years. Sam then speaks to Becky's cousin Lexi, hoping that she might have some information. The scene then shifts to Omen, with Dabs and Henry robbing a car in broad daylight. They take what they have stolen to Ike's house to sell and are given money by Ike, who leaves to sort out some business. It is revealed that his partner is Andreas, whose face was cut in the first film by Trife. Ike tells a customer that even Andreas had to learn the hard way. Andreas remarks that he got what he deserved, as he tested Curtis's patience and suffered the consequences. Ike burns his customer's arm and beats him up to teach him a lesson for making money behind his back on his gear. Jay is later seen selling drugs to customers. When a rich one tests him, Jay robs him and his fianc√©e and humiliates him. He receives a call from Jehvon informing him that Sam is out, so he lets the rich man and his fianc√©e go. He goes to Ike's house, seeking help about Sam, so Ike gives him a gun. Then Andreas suggests hiring some of the teenagers to kill Sam. Dabs is called into the room and eventually agrees to do it for ¬£6,000. Jay makes it clear that the others must not see Sam's face when the murder happens. Dabs tells Henry about the plan. Not willing to kill a man, Henry tells Dabs not to go through with it. A scuffle happens and Dabs hits Henry over the head with a brick. Later, Dabs and Blammy meet Omen and tell him about the job. Omen agrees after Dabs lies and says that the target was the one who hurt Henry. Sam and Lexi meet and Sam learns that she was gang raped years ago, which led her into drug addiction because as they are having sex she pushes him away. As he gets up she sees various scars on his back and it is revealed they were given to him by Trife's uncle as revenge and when Lexi touches them he leaves in anger. Jay meets with Mooney and his girlfriend Kayla in a caf√© and tells Robert that he could have prevented Trife's death, convincing him to help Jay track down Sam. Shortly afterwards, Robert tells Jay that he needs to move on. Later, the teenage hit- men see Sam walking through a park and tackle him to the ground. With Sam's face to the floor, Dabs tells Omen to stab him, but Omen insists on seeing his face first. It is then revealed that Omen is Sam's brother. He refuses to kill his own brother, and realises that Dabs knew who it was. Sam is about to kill Dabs, but has a flashback to the murder and relents, just punching Dabs and leaving with the two teenagers. Meanwhile, Jay goes round to Lexi's flat and we find out he is her dealer, and that Lexi was setting up Sam by bringing him back to her flat. Sam phones the man he spoke to outside the prison and asks for the favour the man promised him earlier in the film. Sam walks down a street and mugs a couple at gunpoint, but apologises for doing it. He uses the stolen phone to call the police about an armed robbery, telling them the criminal is going into the house he is about to enter. Using the items he stole, he goes into Ike's house pretending to want to sell them. Meanwhile, Sam's contact phones Curtis and tells him where Sam is. While Sam is holding them all at gun point, the armed police show up and arrest Ike, Andreas, and Curtis, but Sam escapes. On the way home, Sam is attacked by Jay. Jay holds him at gunpoint and a fight ensues. Sam realises that Jay is just like he was six years ago and cannot bring himself to commit murder. Safe in the knowledge that Jay is not really dangerous, he leaves the fight. As all this happens, Sam, having nowhere to go, wanders aimlessly through the streets. He finds that Lexi has left a message on his phone asking him to spend time with her, and makes his way to her flat. He struggles to get there due to all the injuries he received during the past day, though he manages to make it to Lexi's flat, and the two smile as he enters.

Some years later she had a successful career as the singer-songwriter Dory Previn. In 1957, Dory Langdon (n√©e Dorothy Langan) was a lyricist and songwriter who had recently started work for MGM in Hollywood. There, she was paired with various writing collaborators, including Andr√© Previn. Although at that point she had had relatively little success in placing her songs in movies, Verve Records signed her up for an album as a singer, accompanied by Previn on piano and Kenny Burrell on guitar. The album, which was recorded in early 1958,Verve Records Catalog: Popular 2100 series featured songs she had written with Previn and other composers. They were witty and romantic in style, typical of the period. The following year Dory Langdon and Andr√© Previn married; they divorced in 1970. Dory Previn, as she was then known, went on to establish herself in a radically different and acclaimed style, as a confessional singer-songwriter with unorthodox subject matter including her dysfunctional childhood and her divorce. The Leprechauns Are Upon Me was reissued as Dory and Andr√© Previn in the early 1980s, in the wake of her success.

The game invites the player into an exploration of a Utopian city of Adrianopolis through the eyes of Wallis, an officer who is investigating the murder of a citizen in a neighboring \\"Rogue State\\" in Odessa. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot The game is set in a fully 3D rendered environment, where the player controls Wallis, with a point-and-click interaction system. The game is non-linear in that it allows complete freedom of movement and exploration both in terms of the game itself and the narrative; a player's actions will dynamically affect the ending, giving the game an RPG element. In addition, the game reacts dynamically to the player's actions; the sequence that locations and events are unlocked are based on those actions and can vary depending on the order in which they were unlocked. Culpa Innata features an in-game diary to track a player's progress. The game also features a proprietary logic engine that allows 10,000 condition links between the events in Culpa Innata, creating a different experience for every player. The game also features a day/night cycle; certain events and characters appear only during a specific time of day. Plot Culpa Innata takes place in the year 2047 in the elitist, utopian city of Adrianopolis, part of a capitalist one world government called World Union, composed of most of the major First World countries, where disease and felonies have been nearly eliminated. World Union's value system is similar to the society established in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, creating a certain level of societal expectations based on numerical indices pre-defined in the system that only take into account how much a person accumulates. Like Brave New World, the society is also extremely hedonistic, marriage (or \\"nuptial contracts\\" as they are called by the World Union) are obsolete, and relationships are entirely consistent of sexual interest, with multiple liaisons and even emotionless promiscuity, all of these are regarded as healthy relationships. Elements of Objectivism are included with the concept of pro-selfish attitudes, with citizens rated in numerical terms of skillfulness called an HDI (Human Development Index). The story is centered on protagonist World Union Peace Officer Phoenix Wallis, who is investigating the murder of a fellow World Union citizen in a neighboring \\"Rogue State\\" in Odessa, Russia. The game features multiple endings, based on the choices and actions of the player. Development and release The game, according to the developer, was inspired by Alev Alatlƒ±'s novel Schr√∂dinger's Cat. Reception On Metacritic, the game has an average rating of 66 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/culpa-innata Just Adventure gave the game its highest possible score, A+ and GamePlasma gave it a high 8 out of 10. IGN, on the other hand, gave the game a score of 4.0 out of 10 (\\"Poor\\"). Sequel A sequel, titled Culpa Innata 2: Chaos Rising, has been announced in August 2008. Citing financial difficulties, the developer announced in early 2013 that the sequel will be released as a book instead.

These disorders can be characterized in several different ways: * By the component(s) of the immune system affected * By whether the immune system is overactive or underactive * By whether the condition is congenital or acquired According to the International Union of Immunological Societies, more than 150 primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) have been characterized. However, the number of acquired immunodeficiencies exceeds the number of PIDs. It has been suggested that most people have at least one primary immunodeficiency. Due to redundancies in the immune system, though, many of these are never detected. Autoimmune diseases An autoimmune disease is a condition arising from an abnormal immune response to a normal body part. There are at least 80 types of autoimmune diseases. Nearly any body part can be involved. Common symptoms include low-grade fever and feeling tired. Often symptoms come and go. =List of some autoimmune disorders= *Lupus *Scleroderma *Certain types of hemolytic anemia *Vasculitis *Type 1 diabetes *Graves' disease *Rheumatoid arthritis *Multiple sclerosis (although it is thought to be an immune-mediated process) *Goodpasture syndrome *Pernicious anemia *Some types of myopathy * Lyme disease (Late) Immunodeficiencies Primary immune deficiency diseases are those caused by inherited genetic mutations. Secondary or acquired immune deficiencies are caused by something outside the body such as a virus or immune suppressing drugs. Primary immune diseases are at risk to an increased susceptibility to, and often recurrent ear infections, pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis or skin infections. Immunodeficient patients may less frequently develop abscesses of their internal organs, autoimmune or rheumatologic and gastrointestinal problems. ; Primary immune deficiencies * Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) * DiGeorge syndrome * Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (also known as Job's Syndrome) * Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID): B-cell levels are normal in circulation but with decreased production of IgG throughout the years, so it is the only primary immune disorder that presents onset in the late teens years. * Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD): a deficiency in NADPH oxidase enzyme, which causes failure to generate oxygen radicals. Classical recurrent infection from catalase positive bacteria and fungi. * Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome (WAS) * Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) * Hyper IgM syndrome: X-linked disorder that causes a deficiency in the production of CD40 ligand on activated T-cells.

He served under Scipio Aemilianus in Numantia around 133 BC. He was praetor in 117 BC. His proconsulship in Thrace in 112‚Äì111 BC earned him a triumph. He was censor in 102 BC with his cousin, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus.  Family  The Caecilii Metelli were an extremely prominent family in the late Roman Republic. They were conservative aristocrats, though members of the plebeian gens Caecilia. Caprarius was the youngest son of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus. Macedonicus was praetor in 148 BC and consul in 143 BC. He received the command in Macedonia, where he defeated a pretender to the throne named Andriscus. He received a triumph and the cognomen 'Macedonicus' for this victory. He was censor in 131 BC. Macedonicus was a conservative aristocrat and opposed Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus,Salazar, Christine F. Brill's New Pauly: Encyclopedia of the Ancient World Vol 2. Boston: Brill Leiden. 2003. 874-879. who went around the Senate and based their power on the people. Denarius coined by him in 125 BC. Caprarius' eldest brother was Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus. He went to Thessaly to obtain grain as aedile around 130 BC. He was praetor by 126 BC and consul in 123 BC. Balearicus was given the command to defeat the inhabitants of the Balearic Islands, who practiced piracy. He was victorious and triumphed in 121 BC, receiving the cognomen 'Balearicus'. He was censor in 120 BC. Caprarius' second brother was Lucius Caecilius Metellus Diadematus. He was given the cognomen 'Diadematus' because of the bandage he wore on a head wound. He was consul in 117 BC, and promoted infrastructural improvement in Italy. A conservative aristocrat like his father, he probably opposed Gaius Gracchus. The third brother was Marcus Caecilius Metellus. He was mint master in 127 BC, praetor by 118 BC, and consul in 115 BC. Marcus was given the proconsular command in Corsica and Sardinia from 114 BC to 111 BC, and triumphed for his victory there. Caprarius had two sisters, both named Caecilia Metella. One married Gaius Servilius Vatia, who was praetor in 114 BC. The other married Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio, who was consul in 111 BC. Caprarius had three sons. One was Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus, who was praetor in 74 BC and consul in 69 BC. He was pontifex from 73 BC until his death. Creticus was given the proconsular command against the island of Crete, which was aiding Mithridates and infested with pirates. He defeated the island and triumphed for it in 62 BC, receiving the cognomen 'Creticus'. Another son was Lucius Caecilius Metellus. He was praetor in 71 BC. He succeeded Gaius Verres as governor of Sicily in 70 BC. He died in office as consul in 68 BC. Marcus Caecilius Metellus was Caprarius' third son. He was praetor and president of the extortion court in 69 BC. Caprarius' daughter, Caecilia Metella, was the wife of Gaius Verres. Verres was the governor of Sicily from 73 BC to 71 BC. He was also the defendant on trial in Cicero's speech Against Verres.  Position as Censor  Caprarius was censor in 102 BC with his cousin, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus. The purpose of the censors was to monitor the roll of the Senate and remove people from it when necessary. The office of censor was not held every year as others, such as the office of consul, were. Numidicus was the son of Lucius Caecilius Metellus Calvus. Numidicus was possibly mint master in 117 or 116 BC, he was praetor by 112 BC, and he was consul in 109 BC. Both Caprarius and Numidicus were conservative aristocrats, in keeping with their family history. In their censorship, Numidicus tried unsuccessfully to expel Lucius Appuleius Saturninus and Gaius Servilius Glaucia from the Senate. Saturninus was a popularis, a politician that drew his power from the people. He was of plebeian stock. He was removed from his position as quaestor in 105 or 104 BC for being an opponent of the Senate. He proposed a law to reduce grain prices that received the support of Glaucia. Glaucia was from a patrician family, but he, like Saturninus, was a popularis. Both had the support of Gaius Marius. Glaucia collaborated with Saturninus against the Senate as tribune in 101 BC and his praetorship in 100 BC. Glaucia and Saturninus conspired to make Glaucia consul and Saturninus tribune in 99 BC. They used violence in an attempt to reach their goal, and Saturninus murdered Glaucia's competitor for the consulship. Glaucia and Saturninus were imprisoned in the Curia by Marius at the Senate's behest. They were both murdered by an angry mob. To get revenge for the attempted expulsion from the Senate, Saturninus tried to force Numidicus to swear acceptance of a law that gave land to Marius' veterans. Numidicus refused and went into exile. Caprarius fought for Numidicus' return in 99 BC. See also * Caecilia (gens)  References  Sources *Broughton, T. Robert. Magistrates of the Roman Republic Vol. 1.

The pieces of metal to be welded are set apart at a predetermined distance based on material thickness, material composition, and desired properties of the finished weld. Current is applied to the metal, and the gap between the two pieces creates resistance and produces the arc required to melt the metal. Once the pieces of metal reach the proper temperature, they are pressed together, effectively forge welding them together.  Parameters  Flash welding and grinding of a new link in the hanging chain in Ramn√§s, Sweden According to a study published in Materials and Design, several parameters affect the final product. Flash time is the time that the arc is present. Upset time is the amount of time that the two pieces are pressed together. Flash time needs to be long enough to sufficiently heat the metal before it is pressed together. However, if it is too long, too much of the base metal begins to melt away. The upset time is critical in creating the desired mechanical properties of the finished weld. During the upset, any impurities in the base metal are pressed out creating a perfect weld. If the upset time is too short, some of the impurities may remain in the base metal creating a defective weld. The upset time is also crucial in the strength of the finished weld because it is during the upset that coalescence occurs between the two pieces of metal. If the upset time is too short, the two pieces of metal may not completely bond. Very often flash butt welding is controlled by distance rather than time such that the flashing would occur for a pre-determined length, say 5 mm, before the upsetting cycle starts. Upsetting may then also be controlled by distance. A parameter would be set to apply the upsetting force until a certain distance has been upset. It is generally the upsetting distance that is more important than the upsetting time. At the end of upsetting there is commonly a 'hold time' during which the joint is held still to allow the joint to cool and the two pieces of metal to completely bond.  Applications  Flash welding machine of Network Rail Railroads use flash welding to join sections of mainline rail together to create Long Welded Rail (LWR) in a factory setting or continuous welded rail (CWR) in track, which is much smoother than mechanically-joined rail because there are no gaps between the sections of rail. This smoother rail reduces the wear on the rails themselves, effectively reducing the frequency of inspections and maintenance. Continuous welded rail is particularly used on high-speed rail lines because of the smoothness of the rail head. Flash welding is also beneficial because it allows dissimilar metals, including non ferrous metals, to be joined. This allows switches and crossings, which are generally composed of high manganese steel, to be effectively welded to carbon steel rail with the use of a stainless steel insert, while keeping the desired mechanical properties of both the rails and the crossings intact. The ability of this single process to weld many different metals, with simple parameter adjustments, makes it very versatile. Flash welding is also used in the metal building industry to increase the length of the angle iron used to fabricate joists. The aluminum industry uses flash welding to join aluminum, steel, and copper in various current-carrying conductors called busbars. The steel is used for strength, the copper is used for conductivity, and the aluminum is used for its combination of cost and conductivity.http://www.jbmincorporated.com/product-gallery/flash-welding/  See also  * Rail lengths  References  Category:Welding ","title":"Flash welding"},{"id":"13875480","text":"was a Japanese travel writer and visual producer.

The inhabitants are almost exclusively Pashtuns. The Razmak subdivision of North Waziristan is divided into three Tehsils: Razmak, Dossali, and Garyum. Dossali is a low-lying area with a warm and dry climate. Garyum is a hilly and cold area. Razmak Tehsil is the coldest and wettest of the three Tehsils because of its higher elevation. It is pleasant in summers, but snow clad in the winters. Razmak town is the main settlement of the Razmak subdivision. The height above sea level of Razmak town is 2010 m. Razmak is known as \\"Mini London\\" due to its beauty and potential to become a major tourist destination if the security situation of Waziristan improves. The famous Pashtun tribal leader Mirzali Khan (Faqir of Ipi) was based in Gurwek, but also hided for a long time in Razmak. Gurwek is a remote village in Waziristan on the border with Afghanistan. History Stories about Haji Mirzali Khan (Faqir of Ipi) are part of the folklore of the area. He was a tribal leader of Waziristan who rebelled against the British Raj, and started a guerilla warfare against the British. His movement was based in Gurwek, a remote village in Waziristan on the border with Afghanistan. It is said that the troops were after him and when they fired at him, their bullets melted midway and fell on ground. This is said to be the origin of the many grey hard pebbles lying on the hills of Razmak where Mirzali Khan was hiding. After the creation of Pakistan in August 1947, Mirzali Khan and his followers refused to recognise Pakistan, and launched a campaign against Pakistan. He continued their guerilla warfare against the new nation's government.The Faqir of Ipi of North Waziristan. The Express Tribune. November 15, 2010. In 1950, he announced the creation of Pashtunistan as an independent nation. A Pashtun tribal jirga, held in Razmak, appointed Mirzali Khan as the President of the National Assembly for Pashtunistan.The legendary guerilla Faqir of Ipi unremembered on his 115th anniversary. The Express Tribune. April 18, 2016. However, later on Faqir Ipi, while addressing a gathering at Razmak, said that the Government of Afghanistan had misled him and deceived him in the name of Islam. He instructed his supporters that if the Government of Afghanistan made any future plan against Pakistan in his name, they should never support it. People The population is migratory and owns land also in other parts of the North Waziristan Agency where they migrate when it gets too cold. The main tribes that inhabit Razmak subdivision are Toori Khel, Boora Khel and Dirdooni. The dynamics of the society are governed by oligarchy. The elders of the tribes and families are the unelected leaders. The main elders of the area are Noor Baqi Jan, Zuman Alikhel, Nawaz Shakhimar in Toori khel, Shahzada and Saudal in boorakel, Hakeem Jan in Dirdooni. =Torikhel= The Torikhel clan lives in the mountains of Razmak. Used to climbing hills on foot, they are tough and hardy fighters. The Torikhel are further divided into Khushali, Alikhel, and Shogi subtribes. The Khushali is the bigger tribe among the Torikhel subtribes. The Khushali are further divided into nine subtribes. As per Nikat, the traditional tribal distribution, every thing in Razmak Tehsil is distributed equally among these tribes. Cadet College Razmak is also located here. =Boorakhel= Boorakhel are involved in trade and business, many of them drive trucks and buses down in the rest of Pakistan. They have apple orchards on the hills of Razmak. Their hospitality is very well known in Wazir Tribe. = Dossali = Well Educated people . Mandey Khel (MDK)' Mandey Khell is a part of Tehsil Dossali , Their hospitality is very well known in Wazir Tribe. They are peaceful people who usually cooperate with the government and follow strict tribal discipline. =Dirdooni= Dattakhel tehsil is occupied by the Dirdooni subtribe. They are peaceful people who usually cooperate with the government and follow strict tribal discipline. =Mahsud= The Mahsud live in the southern part of Razmak near Shuidar Ghar, as well as in the adjoining South Waziristan.

Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980), is a United States Supreme Court decision dealing with the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Factual background  Herschel Roberts was charged with forgery of a check and with possession of stolen credit cards. At the preliminary hearing, defense counsel called the victims' daughter to the stand and tried to elicit from her an admission that she provided the defendant with the checks and the credit card but failed to inform the defendant that she did not have permission to use them. Counsel was unable to elicit this admission nor did the prosecutor cross-examine the witness. The daughter was subpoenaed five times but never appeared for trial. At trial, the defendant testified that the daughter had given him her parents' checkbook and credit cards with the understanding he could use them. The State, on rebuttal, offered the transcript of the daughter's testimony pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. Section 2945.49 (1975) which permits the use of preliminary examination testimony of a witness who ‚Äúcannot for any reason be produced at trial.‚Äù The defense objected asserting that use of the transcript violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution (incorporated to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution). The trial court admitted the transcript and the defendant was convicted. The Supreme Court of Ohio overturned the conviction. That court held that the daughter's absence at trial and the lack of cross-examination at the preliminary hearing violated the Confrontation Clause. Opinion of the Court The Supreme Court held that the daughter's statement did not violate the Confrontation Clause. They reasoned that out-of-court statements can be admissible if they bear an adequate ‚Äúindicia of reliability,‚Äù even if the declarant is not available to testify in court. They found that one could infer reliability in cases where the evidences falls ‚Äúwithin a firmly rooted hearsay exception,‚Äù but even in other cases, if ‚Äúparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness‚Äù can be shown, the evidence would be admitted. Subsequent history Ohio v. Roberts is no longer controlling authority. The Supreme Court later ruled, in Crawford v. Washington, that because the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution specifies the right to confrontation, an ‚Äúindicia of reliability‚Äù was not an adequate substitute for cross-examination. But the Court's recent decision in Michigan v. Bryant may signal a \\"resurrection\\" of Roberts, as the Court based its decision on reliability of the out-of-court statement, rather than on the Defendant's opportunity to confront the witness bearing testimony against him.

Shepherd's huts often had iron wheels and corrugated iron tops. Sometimes the sides were also made of corrugated iron. Use of shepherd's huts by farmers reached a peak in the late 19th century and dwindled in the 20th century with the advent of mechanised farm machinery and electric power reaching even remote farms. Their use persisted in some northern counties in the United Kingdom, particularly Westmoreland and Northumberland, where the terrain of the uplands supports little else but sheep farming. There have been numerous different materials used to construct shepherd's huts and after World War One, when metal was in short supply the chassis were often built with wood and the sides built with interlocking planks of larch or spruce. Sometimes the roof covering would be constructed from felt and tar and insulated with lambswool. Cast iron wheels were frequently recycled from other farm machinery. There are now very few examples of the later 20th century shepherd's huts in the county of Westmorland which became Cumbria in 1974. > The shepherd's hut was a kitchen, dining room, bedroom, sitting room and > storeroom all rolled into one.

He was praetor in 74 BC and pontifex from 73 BC until his death. He was consul in 69 BC along with Quintus Hortensius Hortalus.  Family  The Caecilii Metelli were very prominent and conservative members of the Roman nobility in the Republican period, though they were members of the plebeian gens Caecilia. Their greatest influence was from the second century BC onwards.Salazar, Christine F. Brill's New Pauly: Encyclopedia of the Ancient World Vol. 2. Boston: Brill Leiden. 2003. 874-879. The name Metellus possibly means 'mercenary'. A saying attributed to Naevius stated that \\"it is fated for the Metelli to become consuls at Rome,\\"Grant, Michael. Cicero: Selected Works. London: Penguin Books. 1960. 45. and it seems to be true: Creticus' brother, father, grandfather, three uncles, great grandfather, and great great grandfather were all consuls. Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus was Creticus' grandfather. He was praetor in 148 BC, and was granted command in Macedonia the following year. There, he defeated Andriscus, a pretender to the throne, for which he received a triumph and the cognomen 'Macedonicus'. He was consul in 143 BC and censor in 131 BC. Macedonicus, as a conservative aristocrat, opposed Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus. Each of his four sons became consul. Creticus' father was Gaius Caecilius Metellus Caprarius, the youngest son of Macedonicus. In 133 BC he served under Scipio Aemilianus in Numantia. Caprarius was praetor in 117 BC, consul in 113 BC, and fought as proconsul in Thrace in 112 BC. He received a triumph for his victory in Thrace in 111 BC. He was censor in 102 BC. Creticus had two brothers. One was Lucius Caecilius Metellus. He was praetor in 71 BC and governor of Sicily in 70 BC. He died in office as consul in 68 BC. The other was Marcus Caecilius Metellus, praetor. In 69 BC he presided over the quaestio de repetundis, a standing tribunal of senatorial iudices (juror-judges) for investigating and deciding cases of extortion. Creticus' sister, Caecilia Metella, was the wife of Gaius Verres, who was governor of Sicily from 73 BC to 71 BC. Creticus' daughter was also named Caecilia Metella. She married Marcus Licinius Crassus who was a son of Marcus Crassus, a member of the \\"First Triumvirate\\". Caecilia Metella's tomb still survives on the Via Appia. Creticus' son Quintus Caecilius Metellus was a Tribune of the Plebs.  Career  = Role in Verres's trial = In Cicero's speech Against Verres, delivered in late 70 BC, Cicero, the attorney prosecuting on behalf of the province of Sicily, denounces Gaius Verres, the defendant on trial, in the extortion court. Verres was the Governor of Sicily from 73-71 BC, and the Sicilians charged him with being morally corrupt and flagrant with bribery, as well as having stolen 40 million sesterces worth of money and items from Sicily. They also charged him with having killed Roman citizens without trial, something forbidden by Roman law. Metellus and Quintus Hortensius Hortalus were to be the two consuls for the coming year. They were both friends of Verres, as well as strong supporters; Hortensius acted as his defence lawyer. In addition, Metellus's brothers were well-placed to influence the trial: Marcus was to be president of the extortion court in the coming year, and Lucius was already in Verres's old position as Governor of Sicily. The defence planned to delay the trial until the following year, when the Metellus brothers and Hortensius would be able to influence the court's decision. Confident of victory, Metellus sent for the Sicilian witnesses and told them that Verres would come to no harm due to the positions held by himself and his brothers. Because of this, Cicero accuses Metellus of being corrupt to the point that he would \\"throw duty and dignity to the winds\\"Grant, Michael. Cicero: Selected Works. London: Penguin Books. 1960. 47. without even having a real connection to Verres. Cicero goes on to suggest twice that Metellus won his office due to Verres's bribery rather than by fate (relating the proverb), and tries to turn Metellus against Verres by stating that Verres proclaimed it so himself. = The conflict with Crete = According to Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, Crete was aiding Mithridates, king of Pontus, by supplying him with mercenaries in the first century BC. Mithridates was then at war with Rome, and was proving to be a very difficult opponent. The Cretans also contributed to and were in alliance with the pirates of the Mediterranean.livius.org Pirates were a terrible problem in the Mediterranean at that time; they added the risk of kidnapping to sailing, pilfered grain from shipments to Rome, and attacked ports. Marcus Antonius Creticus, father of Marc Antony, sent legates to Crete concerning their involvement with Mithridates and the pirates; the Cretans dismissed the matter, and a war began. In an attempt at a peace treaty, the Romans demanded the surrender of Lasthenes, Crete's commander against the Romans, along with all of the Romans the Cretans held prisoner, all of their pirate ships, three hundred hostages, and four thousand talents of silver. The island of Crete refused to meet these terms. After his consulship, Metellus was given the proconsular command against the pirates on Crete; his co-consul, Hortensius, had refused it. Metellus captured several cities and made great progress before the island appealed to Pompey the Great. They did this in 67 BC, when Pompey had control over the Mediterranean to eliminate piracy under the Lex Gabinia. The Cretans offered to surrender to Pompey, perhaps believing he would be less harsh than Metellus. Pompey ignored Metellus's command over the island and accepted the Cretan's surrender. Pompey ordered Metellus to leave the island with his troops, but Metellus refused. Metellus then defeated the Cretans and made the island a Roman province. Because of Metellus's refusal to leave Crete when Pompey ordered it, Pompey and his allies prevented his triumph until 62 BC.Hornblower, Simon and Antony Spawforth. The Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd Edition New York: Oxford University Press. 1966. 269. Upon celebrating his triumph, Metellus received the cognomen 'Creticus', the Latin word for 'Cretan'. As revenge for the opposition to his triumph, Metellus used his influence to prevent the ratification in the senate of Pompey's reorganization of the east until 60 BC. Metellus remained a prominent member of Pompey's opposition until his death in the late 50s BC. = Gaul = According to Cicero in his letters to Atticus, Creticus was an ambassador sent to Gaul in the hopes of preventing the Gallic states from joining the Aedui in 60 BC. He was sent along with Lucius Flaccus and Lentulus.  Other references  In his speech Post Reditum in Senatu ('in the senate after his return'), Cicero, having been exiled for executing Roman citizens without a trial during the Catilinarian Conspiracy, celebrated his return to Rome. He was aided in this, albeit reluctantly, by the consul Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos, a relative of Creticus. Cicero praises Nepos for being truly noble and naturally excellent in disposition,Yonge, C.D. Post Reditum in Senatu. London: Henry G. Bohn. 1856. although he claims them to be enemies. Cicero goes on to praise the Metelli as a group for being exemplary citizens. In Juvenal's eighth satire, he speaks about virtue alone making one truly noble, rather than an inherited name. He uses a few cognomens to illustrate his point, including that of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus. See also * Caecilia (gens)  References   Sources  * Grant, Michael. Cicero: Selected Works.

The archepiscopal see is Dijon Cathedral, which is located in the city of Dijon. The diocese comprises the entire department of C√¥te-d'Or, in the Region of Bourgogne. Originally established as the Diocese of Dijon in 1731, and suffragan to the Archdiocese of Lyon, the diocese was elevated to the rank of archdiocese in 2002. The most significant jurisdiction change occurred after the Concordat of 1801, when the diocese annexed the department of Haute-Marne. In 1821, a Papal Bull re-established the Diocese of Langres.Sautereau, pp. 5-8. Gabriel Chow, GCatholic.org: \\"Metropolitan Archdiocese of Dijon, France\\", retrieved: 2016-12-28. The current archbishop is Roland Minnerath, appointed in 2004. History Church of Saint Michel, Dijon =Myths= Between the years 506 and 540, it was revealed to Gregory, Bishop of Langres, an ancestor of Gregory of Tours, that a tomb which the piety of the peasants led them to visit contained the remains of St. Benignus. He had a large basilica erected over it, and soon travellers from Italy brought him the acts of this saint's martyrdom. These acts are part of a collection of documents according to which Burgundy was evangelized in the 2nd century by St. Benignus, an Asiatic priest and the disciple of St. Polycarp, assisted by two ecclesiastics, Andochius and Thyrsus. The good work is said to have prospered at Autun, where it received valuable support from the youthful Symphorianus; at Saulieu where Andochius and Thyrsus had established themselves; at Langres where the three brothers, Speusippus, Eleusippus, and Meleusippus, were baptized, and finally at Dijon. In the meantime the persecution of Marcus Aurelius broke out, and St. Benignus and his companions were put to death. The doubts first raised by Boulliau and Tillemont in the 17th century concerning the authenticity of these acts seem justified by the conclusions of G. Van Hooff and Louis Duchesne, according to which the Acts of St. Benignus and the martyrdom of the three brothers of Langres, on which the aforesaid traditions are based, are apocryphal and copied from Cappadocian legends. Animated polemics arose among the scholars of France on the apostolate of St. Benignus.Paul Lejay, \\"Saint-B√©nigne de Dijon,\\" =Langres and Dijon= Under the Merovingians and Carolingians, most of the bishops of Langres resided at Dijon, e.g. St. Urbanus (5th century),Duchesne, p. 186, no. 6, who points out that his biography was written in the tenth century, and that nothing is actually known about Urbanus. His cult was local. St. Gregory,Duchesne, p. 186, no. 16. and St. Tetricus (6th century),Duchesne, p. 186-187, no. 17. who were buried there. When, in 1016, Lambert, Bishop of Langres, ceded the seigniory and county of Dijon to King Robert of France, the Bishops of Langres made Langres their place of residence. =Diocese= In 1731, Pope Clement XII made Dijon a bishopric. When it was formed, the diocese was composed of 164 parishes divided among seven regional Deanships. 155 of these parishes had been part of the Diocese of Langres, and 19 others had come from the Diocese of Besan√ßon. The seven Deanships were supervised by the two archdeacons.Sautereau, pp. 5-6. The Abbey of Saint-Etienne of Dijon (5th century) long had a Chapter of Canons Regular who observed the Rule of St. Augustine; the Chapter was altered to one of secular canons by Pope Paul V in 1611, and Pope Clement XI made its church the cathedral of Dijon; during the Revolution the Cathedral was transformed into a forage storehouse. The abbatial church of Saint-B√©nigne became the cathedral of Dijon early in the 19th century. From the 1730s the Chapter was composed of six dignities and twelve Canons. The city of Dijon had some 30,000 inhabitants, and was divided into seven parishes. There were two colleges for the education of the young. There were eight houses of male religious, and eight monasteries of men.Ritzler, VI, p. 197, note 1. =Revolution= The diocese of Dijon was abolished during the French Revolution by the Legislative Assembly, under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790). Its territory was subsumed into the new diocese, called 'C√¥te-d-Or ', which was part of the Metropolitanate called the 'Metropole de l'Est' (which included eight new 'd√©partements'). The Civil Constitution mandated that bishops be elected by the citizens of each 'd√©partement', which immediately raised the most severe canonical questions, since the electors did not need to be Catholics and the approval of the Pope was not only not required, but actually forbidden. Erection of new dioceses and transfer of bishops, moreover, was not canonically in the competence of civil authorities or of the Church in France. The result was schism between the 'Constitutional Church' and the Roman Catholic Church. The legitimate bishop of Dijon, Ren√© de M√©rinville, refused to take the oath, and therefore the episcopal seat was declared vacant. He was in fact one of the thirty bishops who subscribed to the Exposition des principes, sur la Constitution civile du Clerg√© (30 October 1790). He emigrated to Germany and took up residence at Karlsruhe.Sautereau, p. 17. On 15 February 1791 the electors of 'C√¥te-d-Or' were assembled, and elected the former Jesuit Jean-Baptise Volfius, whose brother was a member of the Constituent Assembly, as their President; they then proceeded to elect him as their bishop.Pisani, p. 246. Volfius travelled to Paris for his consecration, which was carried out on 13 March by Jean-Baptiste Gobel, the titular Bishop of Lydda, who had just been installed as Constitutional Bishop of Paris. Volfius, and all the Constitutional Bishops, were required to resign in May 1801 by First Consul Bonaparte, who was negotiating a treaty with Pope Pius VII, the Concordat of 1801 (15 July 1801). Once the Concordat went into effect, Pius VII was able to issue the appropriate bulls to restore many of the dioceses and to regulate their boundaries, most of which corresponded closely to the new 'd√©partements'. The Bull Qui Christi Domini created the Diocese of Dijon out of the two 'd√©partements' of 'C√¥te-d-Or and Haute-Marne. (Latin, with French translation) The diocese of Langres was reestablished in principle in 1817, but difficulties between the King and the Pope postponed the implementation of Langres until 1823.Soci√©t√© bibliographique (France) (1907), L'√©piscopat fran√ßais..., p. 221. =Separation of Church and State= Pope Pius X's request in 1904 for the resignation of Monseigneur Le Nordez, Bishop of Dijon since 1899, was one of the incidents which led to the Law of Separation of 1905 and the rupture of relations between France and the Holy See.

The Gothic style, although less used, characterizes the churches of Notre-Dame de Dijon (1252‚Äì1334), Notre-Dame de Semur, and l'Abbaye Saint-Seine; it was also the style of the Sainte-Chapelle of Dijon, which is no longer in existence. Under the dukes of Burgundy, at the close of the 14th and beginning of the 15th century, Burgundian art flourished in a surprising degree. The Chartreuse de Champmol, on which Philip the Bold had Claus Sluter, the sculptor, at work from 1389 to 1406, and which was the acme of artistic excellence, was almost totally destroyed during the Revolution; however, two superb traces of it may still be seen, namely the Puits des proph√®tes and the portal of the church. The Beaune hospital (1443) is a fine specimen of the Gothic style, and the church of Saint-Michel in Dijon (1497) has 16th- and 17th-century porches covered with fantastic bas-reliefs. The Abbeys of C√Æteaux, Fontenay, and Flavigny (where in the 19th century P√®re Lacordaire installed a Dominican novitiate) were all within the territory of Dijon. Saints The following saints are specially honoured: *Saint Sequanus (Saint Seine), b. at Mesmont, C√¥te-d'Or, d. 580, founder of the monastery of R√©om√© around which sprang up the town of Saint-Seine-l'Abbaye *St. William (961-1031), a native of Novara, Abbot of Saint B√©nigne at Dijon in 990, and reformer of the Benedictine Order in the 11th century; *St. Robert of Molesme, joint founder with St. Alberic and Stephen Harding of the monastery of C√Æteaux in 1098 *St. Stephen Harding, who died in 1134, third Abbot of C√Æteaux, under whose administration the monasteries of La Fert√© Abbey, Pontigny, Clairvaux, and Morimond were established *St. Bernard of Clairvaux (1090‚Äì1153) *St. Jane Frances de Chantal (1572‚Äì1641), b. at Dijon, who, having heard St. Francis de Sales's Lenten discourses at Dijon in 1604, conceived a friendship for him *the Venerable B√©nigne Joly, canon of Saint-Etienne de Dijon (17th century) *the Venerable Sister Marguerite of the Blessed Sacrament (1619‚Äì48), surnamed the \\"little saint of Beaune\\", noted for having visions of the Infant Jesus, in consequence of which the pious association known as the Family of the Holy Child Jesus was organized and later raised by Pope Pius IX to the dignity of an archconfraternity. Among the famous persons of Dijon the Seneschal Philippe Pot (1428‚Äì94) is remembered for his exploits against the Turks in 1452 and his deliverance from his captors. The illustrious Bossuet was a native of Dijon. Hubert Languet, the Protestant publicist (1518‚Äì81), was born at Vitteaux.

The two countries' historic relationship has its roots in the Russo-Persian War of 1826 to 1828 between the Russian Empire and Qajar Persia after which Eastern Armenia was ceded to Russia. Moreover, Russia was viewed as a protector of the Christian subjects in the Ottoman Empire, including the Armenians. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Armenia has shared Russia's approach aimed at strengthening the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Armenia and Russia are both members of a military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), along with four other ex- Soviet countries, a relationship that Armenia finds essential to its security. Among the contracts and the agreements, which determine intergovernmental relations ‚Äì a treaty of friendship, collaboration and mutual aid of 29 August 1997 are a number of the documents, which regulate bases of Russian military units and liaisons in the Republic of Armenia. Armenia became a full member of the Eurasian Economic Union on 2 January 2015.  Background  Vladimir Putin in Armenia, 2001. The significant part of the territory currently belonging to Armenia was incorporated into the Russian Empire pursuant to the 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay signed between Russia and Persia following the Russo-Persian War (1826‚Äì28). After the 1917 Russian Revolution, Armenia gained short-lived independence as the First Republic of Armenia. By 1920, the state was incorporated into the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, a founding member of the Soviet Union that was formally constituted in 1922. In 1936, the Transcaucasian state was dissolved, leaving its constituent states, including the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, as full Union republics. The modern Armenia became independent in 1991 as a consequence of the dissolution of the Soviet Union due to the failed coup that happened in August. Armenia boycotted the union-wide preservation vote earlier that year. The Russian Federation, the successor state of the Soviet Union, is believed to have been instrumental in achieving victory by Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988‚Äì1994). In 2013, the deputy prime-minister of Azerbaijan Ali S. Hasanov said, \\"We need to become much stronger so that if we become involved in combat in Nagorno-Karabakh we can stand up to Russian troops, because that is who we will have to face. Did Armenia occupy our territories?

Faced with the choice of either joining the Russia-led Customs Union or signing the Association Agreement with the European Union, Armenia eventually chose the former option. The decision on Armenia's accession to the Customs Union was announced by the president of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan on 3 September 2013. On 2 December 2013, Russian president Vladimir Putin arrived to Armenia on an official visit. The heads of the two states discussed Armenia's accession to the Customs Union and signed 12 agreements on enhancing cooperation in a number of key spheres such as security, economy, energy and others. Russia also reduced the gas price for Armenia from 270 to 189 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters and enlarged the existing Russian military bases in Armenia. Armenia became a full member of the Eurasian Economic Union from January 2, 2015, whereupon cooperation and integration with Russia reached a new level. = Gyumri murders = On 12 January 2015, Valery Permyakov, a Russian soldier from the 102nd military base in Gyumri, murdered an Armenian family of seven during the night.

It falls within Tharaka-Nithi County and the former Eastern Province. Between 1992 and 2009, Chuka was the capital of Tharaka Nithi District (split off from Meru District). Tharaka Nithi District was further split into Meru South and Tharaka Districts with Chuka remaining the Capital of Meru South. Later, Meru South and Tharaka were amalgamated into Tharaka-Nithi County. Chuka people The people of the area are Gichuka speaking, a dialect of Kimeru language. Chuka Town is chiefly occupied by the Chuka people, one of the nine Meru dialect Speakers. They dwell on the south- eastern slopes of Mt. Kenya, and cover the area between the Thuci River in the south, and the Nithi River in the north. It is a common tradition with the Chuka that they have always been in the forests of Mt. Kenya hence they moved down to their present abode. Other versions of the Chuka migratory tradition say that they came out from Mbwa with the other Meru. The Chuka are believed to have sprung from the Tharaka, another of the meru subtribes. They have also a form of blood-brotherhood with the Igembe and the Tigania of the northern meru dialects. On the other hand, there are some customs, as, for instance, the method of circumcision, by which the Chuka are similar to the Embu. The Chuka are primarily Meru who, having climbed the first slopes of Mt. Kenya, clearing the forest for cultivation (even at present the fields of the Chuka are on the lower section of their country), mixed with the aboriginal inhabitants of the forest and established some kind of contact with the Embu. These aboriginal forest inhabitants seem to have been the Gumba, now only remembered by some traditions and described as very small people. It seems certain that they were a pygmy race. http://orvillejenkins.com/profiles/meru.html Some even say that the Chuka may have come from the Coast about A.D. 1300. Their exodus was provoked by an invasion from Somalia, which drove away the people living round Shungwaya, north of Malindi. Of the former Meru District, the Chuka were those who have suffered most the impact and violence of Mau Mau rebellion. During the Emergency, they were the only Meru to be forcibly settled into villages of the Kikuyu and Embu pattern. Later, they were allowed to return to their fields, as before. Population The population of Chuka, is 19,347+ according to the GeoNames geographical database. Politics Chuka and the surrounding area politics were dominated by the Democratic Party that was led by former Kenya President Mwai Kibaki from 1992 to 2002. When NARC was formed in 2002, the population shifted their allegiance to NARC. If follow then that the local residents shifted to PNU in the contested 2007 elections and overwhelmingly voted for the PNU candidate - Mwai Kibaki. In the four elections that Kibaki contested, the area overwhelmingly supported him. The Chuka people largely practice Christianity with a small minority as Muslims and traditional religions. According to Zaphania Samuel Mumbere, a scholar and an authority in the Chukan's customs, traditions and ways of life, the Chuka people were a close knit society that kept the spirit of the community alive by oral narrations and practices that were passed down generations. Chuka is part of Chuka Igambang'ombe sub-county . In 2013 the residents shifted to Jubilee party headed by Kenyatta and Ruto. Academics A group of medium literate people form Chuka. Colleges have recently blossomed in Chuka and its vicinity with Chuka University being the major new development, headed by Prof. Njoka. While holders of PhD degree were few or none 2 decades ago, in the last 10 years Chuka has had a major development in terms of PhD holders with notable figures such as Prof Micheni J. Ntiba. Notably some are serving as Heads of Government Institutions, VCs, PS's and University Principals among others.

Powell Davies, Dictionary of Unitarian & Universalist Biography A prolific author of theological books and sermon collections, he came to national prominence in the U.S. through his liberal activism advocating civil rights for African-Americans and women and ethical stands against post-war nuclear proliferationSeptember 6, 2010, Bill Geerhart, Atomic Cake Sermon (blog post), Conelrad Adjacent: Atomic Secrets, Missing Persons and General Cold War Strangeness and the methods employed by the American government during the era of McCarthyism. Biography Born in Birkenhead, England (near Liverpool) to Welsh parents, Davies was raised a Methodist. After working briefly as a clerk for a shipping company, he moved to London as secretary to a strike leader who had been elected Labour MP. In London, he met George Bernard Shaw, who urged him to go into politics; instead, he chose to attend Richmond Theological College, a Methodist seminary affiliated with the University of London, and to join the Methodist ministry. While studying, he met Muriel Hannah (1906-2009), the daughter of his family's Methodist minister, and they were married in 1927. Davies served as minister at the Becontree Methodist Central Hall in Illford, a London suburb, 1925‚Äì28, before moving to America. He headed three churches in Maine: in Goodwin's Mills and Clark's Mills, (commuting to Boston University for classes), and, from 1929, the Pine Street Methodist Church in Portland. In Portland, he worked as a used car salesman for a week in order to investigate the question of whether or not it was possible to be a businessman and adhere to \\"Christian\\" honesty and integrity; he then wrote a strong critique of prevailing business practices. Davies was minister at the Unitarian Church in Summit from 1933 through 1944. Also in Portland, Davies was exposed to Unitarian ideas by Vincent Silliman, minister at the First Parish Unitarian Church there. In 1933 Davies became a Unitarian, joining the American Unitarian Association (AUA), and became minister of the Community Church of Summit, New Jersey which had allied itself with the Community Church movement. He reaffiliated the church to the Unitarian denomination, with the new name Unitarian Church in Summit, and at the same time calling for an opening up of the denomination. While preferring non-violence, he moved his position from appeasement of Germany in 1938 to interventionist in 1939. He thenceforth advocated Unitarian activism in world questions, and became a leader in the reform movement, Unitarian Advance. His first book was American Destiny (1942), in which he advanced the idea that American \\"faith in [individual] freedom is the only faith which can unite the world.\\" Citing the Boston minister, William Ellery Channing (1780-1842), who had called Unitarianism the \\"universal church\\", Davies became increasingly active in denominational affairs. He joined the New York City Council of Churches, where he met and befriended the Unitarian activist minister John Haynes Holmes (1879-1964), and became acquainted with Margaret Sanger (1879-1966), the founder of Planned Parenthood. In 1944 Davies was appointed minister of All Souls Church, Unitarian in Washington, D.C., a church which he led to national prominence through his activist and principled ethical stands. He advocated the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 and, while generally against Communism, decried the methods and hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). He championed integration in Washington and elsewhere. He actively spearheaded the creation of Unitarian churches in the area, organizing in 1950 what is now known as the Greater Washington Association of Unitarian Universalist Churches (GWA) and serving as its Chair, 1950-57. Davies used his pulpit to champion liberal causes and was a friend and confidant to some of Washington's most powerful people. Justice Hugo Black considered him a very good friend and it is fair to say that his ideas were influential in liberal political circles. Davies received an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from the Meadville Lombard Theological School in 1947 and an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree from Howard University in 1955. Dedicated to his work, Davies ignored his physicians' advice to restrict his movements after he was operated on in 1953 for thrombophlebitis in his leg. He continued his routine schedule as much as discomfort and pain would permit. On September 26, 1957 a blood clot traveled to his lung where it caused fatal hemorrhaging. A memorial service was held for Davies two days later at All Souls. Three sitting Supreme Court Justices‚ÄîHugo Black, Harold Burton, and William O. Douglas‚Äîhonored him by attending the service. Following his death, some of his papers were bequeathed to Harvard Divinity School, however, the majority of Davies' papers reside at Meadville Lombard Theological School.

Service life for this battery in flashlight service is short, since flashlights required a lower but continuous long duration current. Photoflash cells were in production during the flashbulb era, and were slowly phased out as alkaline cells came into general usage. The photoflash cell was produced as a 1.5 volt size D, C Size and AA Size. The cathode (the material packed between the carbon rod and zinc shell) of a zinc- carbon cell is generally made of powdered carbon black (or acetylene black), manganese dioxide and electrolyte. The MnO2 to carbon ratios vary between 10:1 and 3:1 for general purpose cells. A 1:1 mixture is used for photoflash batteries. This allows a high current output with intermittent use, perfect for photoflash use. These cells have reduced capacity compared to those with a higher content of MnO2.David Linden, Thomas B. Reddy (ed). Handbook Of Batteries, 3rd Edition. McGraw-Hill, New York, 2002 Chapter 8. Another common type of photoflash battery is a higher-voltage series assembly of cells, often totalling 22.5 volts, used in battery‚Äìcapacitor flash units. The battery slowly charges a capacitor, which then is discharged through a flashbulb to provide the heavy pulse of current to set off the bulb. . Higher voltage photoflash batteries are also made to fire reusable xenon flash tubes. These tubes require a high voltage. Eveready battery manufactured a 240 volt battery for such use, the Eveready 491 (NEDA 729). Also offered by Eveready was a model 497 battery capable of 510 volts, with a tap at 180 volts.

In the wild, it can be found in tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide. It has narrow, linear leaves that range in colour from a pale-green to reddish up to 3 feet (1 m) long and up to 0.75 inches broad. V. spiralis is monoecious with flowers carried on long spiral stalks that break away from the plant and float on the water's surface. Seeds have not been observed germinating in aquaria. Instead, it most often propagates by runners which can lead to dense stands. Vallisneria spiralis was already being used as an aquarium plant in 1856, as shown in this illustration from that time. One form of this plant has been described: V. spiralis f. tortifolia, which has also been elevated to the species level by some taxonomists under the name V. tortissima. The form has tightly twisted leaves. Along with this form, many other trade names have been developed for small variations on the species. Their taxonomic status is uncertain. Invasive species The species is an effective invader due to its efficient dispersal, vegetative reproduction, high biomass production, and popularity in the aquarium trade. V. spiralis is an \\"unwanted organism\\" in New Zealand. It is listed on the National Pest Plant Accord prohibiting it from sale and commercial propagation and distribution. Since 2013 V.spiralis is listed as naturalized alien in Iceland, where it was recorded in geothermal ponds.

The academy trains West Virginia troopers for the State Police force and all newly hired municipal, university police officers, sheriff deputies, motor carrier enforcement and conservation officers from across the state. It is the only law enforcement training school in West Virginia. The State Police Academy, founded by (Ret.) Captain Charles Ray, held its first training class in 1953. The school sits on of land. Campus The academy has four 50-seat audiovisual instruction rooms for classes, a library, a cafeteria for trainees and their staff, a gymnasium, a computer lab and dormitories (barracks). It also has an outdoor firing range that is equipped for rifle training at a distance of up to . The main compound consists of three buildings. \\"A\\" building has two floors that house the male barracks, the director/commandant's office, the assistant director's office and various utility rooms as well as a computer lab. \\"B\\" building holds additional offices for the academy staff, and the female barracks on the second floor.

On the second floor of \\"C\\" building are staff rooms and additional barracks for in service or \\"sit in\\" students. The old gymnasium is located in the old hangar building which is closest to \\"C\\" building. There is also an obstacle course near the hangar. A new gymnasium building was completed in March 2012. The 12,000 square-foot facility now includes a basketball court, a weigh training and cardio rooms, a running track and a mixed-martial arts training area.State Journal: WV State Police Academy gets room to grow. http://www.statejournal.com/story/17794302/wv-state-police-academy-gets-room- to-grow The campus does not have an Emergency Vehicle Operation Course (EVOC) area for cadets and basic class officers to practice in simulation of car chases, pursuits and speed driving. Trainees must currently take driving courses on a parking lot and at a nearby local airport runway. However, in December 2008, the academy purchased a $108,000 driving simulator that will be used by students to further enhance training.Associated Press via Herald Dispatch: State Police to train students with simulator. http://www.herald- dispatch.com/news/briefs/x1671881680/WVa-State-Police-to-train-students-with- simulator/ The academy also houses the West Virginia State Police K-9 unit and the Professional Development Center (P.D.C.) which serves as an in-service learning facility for all law enforcement officers. Cadet training The West Virginia State Police Academy trains its own cadets accepted by the State Police after a five-phase hiring process. Those cadets stay on academy grounds Monday through Friday during the 25-week training period. They can leave the campus on week-ends but are required to come back on Sunday nights to get ready for the following week. Cadets are promoted to the rank of \\"Trooper\\" after successfully completing training. To be accepted into the academy for cadet training, State Police recruits must be able to perform at least 27 push-ups per minute, 29 sit-ups per minute and be able to run in no more than 14:52 seconds during the initial physical test. These requirements are set by the West Virginia State Police and exceed state standards. Applicants must also pass all the remaining phases during the hiring process. Additional phases include a written exam, an oral interview, a background investigation, a drug screening, a psychological and medical evaluation and a final interviewCadet employment brochure. http://www.wvstatepolice.com/employ/brochure.pdf Training for cadets usually occur once a year. Basic class training Like cadets, all of the state's municipal, university police officers, county sheriff deputies, Natural Resources Police Officers, and Motor Carrier Enforcement hirees observe the same academy rules and policies. Their curriculum although shorter is similar in intensity. It retains a paramilitary environment and style of training. Basic class students currently train for 16 weeks. To be accepted for basic class training in addition to their individual department hiring standards, students must be able to perform 18 properly executed push-ups per minute, 27 properly executed sit-ups per minute and run in a maximum time limit of 15:20 seconds. These are requirements established by the West Virginia Law Enforcement Professional Standards Committee. Basic class training sessions are spread throughout the year with individual departments paying a fee for tuition as well as their respective attendee‚Äôs salary during training. Academy traditions The academy has many traditions that students who attend and often civilians who visit the academy are expected to honor. For example, in each of the main buildings on the academy grounds there is a large tile replica of the West Virginia State Police patch directly in front of the entrance doors. It is difficult not to step on the patches due to their proximity to those doors. Those who step on the patches are sometimes scolded by academy staff members. Students are frequently punished for stepping on it as this is seen as a sign of disrespect. Students are required to clean the patches as part of a cleaning detail in addition to other assigned tasks. Since the academy operates in a paramilitary nature, students are expected to salute ranking officers of the State Police and any other ranking law enforcement officer at the academy. Students often practice marching exercises as well as chanting, running and marching cadences. The West Virginia State Police Academy is often referred to as \\"the hill\\" by its alumni.

Academic and professional background  Ulrich S. Schubert studied chemistry at the Universities of Frankfurt am Main and Bayreuth, with a stay abroad in Richmond, Virginia, US. He received his doctorate in Bayreuth including a research stay in Tampa, Florida (supervisors C. D. Eisenbach and George R. Newkome), and had a post-doc stay in Strasbourg with Jean-Marie Lehn (Nobel Laureate for Chemistry 1987). He did his habilitation at the Technical University of Munich (mentor O. Nuyken). His research focuses on macro- and supramolecular chemistry, which produces new materials with potential applications in life sciences such as medicine and nanotechnology as well as energy renewal and energy storage. Already during his habilitation in 1999, Schubert took up an associate professorship (C3) at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich at the Center for NanoScience. The following year he received a Heisenberg scholarship from the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) and worked at the Technical University of Munich. From 2000 to 2007, Schubert held the professorship for Macromolecular Chemistry and Nanosciences at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). From 2003 to 2014 he was Scientific Chairman of the HTE division at the Dutch Polymer Institute (Dutch Polymer Institute) and from 2005 on member of the board of directors of the \\"Cooperate Research\\" division.

Schubert is the founder and chairman of the board of the Cultural and Social Foundation International Young Orchestra Academy (Internationale Junge Orchesterakademie, IJOA). In addition to international understanding and the promotion of young talent in the professional music field, the foundation's goal is to support children suffering from cancer and other serious illnesses by donating concerts and selling a benefit CD. In 1994, together with Andreas G√∂ldel, August Everding and Sir Charles Mackerras, he founded the Cultural and Social Foundation International Young Orchestra Academy (IJOA), which brings together some 120 musicians from 35 nations every year. Between 1995 and 2019 Schubert organized 700 benefit concerts in Bavaria, Saxony, Thuringia, North Rhine-Westphalia and the Slovak Republic and produced 24 CD recordings (eleven of which were recorded with the radio station BR Klassik). This enabled EUR 1.5 Mio to be donated to children suffering from cancer. The patrons of the event included the Minister President Michael Kretschmer and Dr. Markus S√∂der, Federal President Horst K√∂hler and EU Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso. Ulrich S. Schubert received his musical training as a clarinetist in Frankfurt, Richmond and Tampa (both USA). Chamber music courses led him to the Abegg-Trio, Hagen-Quartett, Amadeus-Quartett, Jan Doormann and Francois Benda. He has given concerts in Europe and the USA. Since May 2019 he is a member of the Jena City Council (non-party and non-attached).  Selected publications  * T. Hagemann, M. Strumpf, E. Schr√∂ter, C. Stolze, M. Grube, I. Nischang, M. D.

Napier began in his father's works at Camlachie and built the boiler for Henry Bell's Comet in 1812. Subsequently, he took over the foundry and established a reputation as one of the best builders of marine engines in Scotland. In 1821 Napier moved to Lancefield Quay on the north bank of the Clyde and Camlachie was taken over by his cousin Robert Napier. At Lancefield Napier began to construct complete ships, including in 1827 the Aglaia. This was one of the world's first iron steam-ships,David Napier, Gazetteer for Scotland built to ply on Loch Eck as part of a \\"new route\\" to Inveraray which opened around 1835. The route included construction of a Clyde pier at Kilmun, and a road for a steam coach to take passengers to the loch steamer. \\"Aglaia\\" in fact had only an iron bottom, and wooden sides above water. She was afterwards called the \\"James Gallacher\\", and plied on the Clyde. Her dimensions were as follows: Length, 62' 8\\"; breadth, 13' 0\\"; depth, 4' 6\\"; gross tonnage, 49 36/94 tons.Charles F.T. Young: The Fouling and Corrosion of Iron Ships: Their Causes and Means of Prevention, with Mode of Application to the Existing Iron-Clads. The London Drawing Association, London, 1867. pp 36-49. The world's first iron steamer was the paddle steamer Aaron Manby of 1821. Napier was widely discredited after a series of boiler explosions between 1835 and 1838. Two of these involved the same steamer, the Victoria of Hull, which twice suffered boiler explosions on the Thames in 1838. On the second occasion, 14 June 1838, nine men were killed and a lengthy inquest saw heavy criticism of Napier's boilers and his conduct after the first accident of 16 March 1838. In 1839 Napier acquired a shipyard on the River Thames at Millwall, London, which is commemorated in the modern Napier Avenue. The yard was run by two of his sons, while Napier himself continued with experiments in improving the steamboat. In 1854 the yard was sold to Messrs J Scott Russell and used for building the Great Eastern.

In 40 years, Lifewater has served 2.5 million people in 40 countries. Currently Lifewater is headquartered in San Luis Obispo, California, with field offices in Uganda, Ethiopia, and Cambodia. History The name of the most wonderful thing in the world is water. Without water, there would be no life on earth, and even our beautiful world would be completely different. The whole living world and human civilization are dependent on water.] Lifewater was founded by William A. Ashe in 1977. Owner of a water pump business, the Ashe family started taking trips to Mexico to promote water and sanitation to those in need in the 1960s. Over time, these small family trips grew to include other water professionals as volunteers. As a result of the success of these trips, William \\"Bill\\" Ashe officially established the Lifewater name in 1977. Bill Ashe attended a Billy Graham conference in Amsterdam in 1983 and received over 2,000 requests for safe water from pastors and evangelists in over 100 countries. In 1984 Lifewater became a registered California non-profit corporation and in 1986 was granted tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status by the IRS. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Lifewater used volunteers to serve thousands of communities around the world with safe water, adding improved sanitation and hygiene practices to its list of essential services as their necessity became more apparent. As Bill Ashe transitioned the organization from volunteers to professional staff, Lifewater collaborated with other organizations to advance the cause of WASH (Water, Sanitation, Hygiene) for the poor, developing training curricula that brought Christian witness to WASH development efforts.  Service Areas and Populations  Lifewater aims to serve vulnerable children and families that live in remote, rural, and underserved regions of East Africa and Southeast Asia. The organization focuses efforts on particular regions, or groups of communities, over a longer period of time. Current projects are taking place in Ethiopia, Uganda, and Cambodia. Previously they worked on projects in over 40 countries around the world. In 2017, Lifewater served over 85,000 people and completed 118 village water projects. Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Lack of safe water and water-borne diseases result in the deaths of millions each year. Many of these death are children under 5. When safe water is not available close to home, school, or work, children are at risk and miss out on their education, adults miss out on work and productive labor, large portions of household income are spent on medical care, and the cycle of poverty continues. Even when safe water is available, people can spend hours every day retrieving it at great distances. However, the best solution is not access to safe water alone. Research shows that combining safe water with sanitation and hygiene does much more to decrease the disease burden in a community. Moreover, these interventions can also be very low-cost and done in a way that requires no outside assistance. Strategy Lifewater uses a strategy it calls \\"Vision of a Healthy Village\\", which it describes as \\"a holistic approach that goes beyond building wells\\" that is \\"rooted in a deep belief in the dignity and capability of those whom we serve.\\" The strategy combines WASH, Sustainability, and Gospel Impact. The Vision of a Healthy Village strategy mobilizes all the stakeholders in a community to create positive changes, including households, schools, religious institutions, and local government. To establish safe water, Lifewater uses technology that is appropriate to the area and sustainable for the community. Local teams are trained to use shallow and deep drilling rigs to reach water under the surface. Drilled wells are capped with a hand pump. In some cases, spring caps, rain catchment, or cisterns are more appropriate. Local water committees are trained and to care for the water source, collect user fees to save for needed repairs, and carry out frequent maintenance. To improve sanitation, Lifewater uses the Community-Led Total Sanitation program to show communities the importance of good sanitation, and help communities achieve open defecation free (ODF) status. Households must build their own ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrine, and larger latrine blocks are built at schools. To improve hygiene, Lifewater teaches about the importance of handwashing with soap, keeping water safe, keeping households free of waste, and drying dishes in clean areas.  2017 Year in Review  2017 was a historic year for Lifewater International. The organization launched three new field offices in Ethiopia (2) and Cambodia (1) plus the completion of 118 village water projects, making the biggest impact the organization has had 40 years of service. In 2017 Lifewater served 85,968 individuals, created 3,783 healthy homes and trained 136 water committees during the year. Finances In 2017, Lifewater international received $3.8 million in donations, an increase of 36% over the previous year. The organization reports that 46% of its revenues are from donations by individuals, 43% by foundation grants, 4% from churches, and 5% from corporate gifts. Lifewater spent $2.6 million on the programs and services it delivers, about 73% of its expenses. Fundraising makes up 10% of the expenses and 17% is spent on administrative resources. Lifewater is certified by the Evangelical Council of Financial Accountability (ECFA) and has an overall rating of 88.83/100 compared to the 85 it received in 2016 on Charity Navigator, America's largest and most utilized independent evaluator of charities.

I drove to out to Milltown from Finglas where I lived, but the place was locked up and there was no one there, so I had to climb over the wall, break in the door, grab my boots and climb out over the wall again. I stripped off in Dalymount and after a few minutes Theo Foley, who had been doubtful from the start, went down injured, and I was sent on and played very well.\\" Keogh shared his testimonial with Pat Courtney in May 1967 .

The program is anchored by Maria Hinojosa. History According to founding Executive Producer Maria Emilia Martin, Latino USA was born following several failed attempts by NPR to create Latino- oriented programming for public radio. The program originated at KUT in Austin, Texas. KUT approached the Center for Mexican-American Studies at the University of Texas at Austin for a partnership in the production of the series. Dr. Gil Cardenas, director of the Center for Mexican-American Studies, co-wrote a grant proposal with KUT-FM to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) that eventually led to the creation of Latino USA, which premiered in April 1993. Originally launched by University of Texas in Austin and the Ford Foundation in 1992, it was a cutting-edge experiment to create an English-language Latino-centered public radio program.KUT.org , The Futuro Media Group to Produce NPR‚Äôs Latino USA In 1992, Maria Emilia Martin left her position as editor at NPR in Washington, D.C. to become Latino USAs founding Executive Producer. She brought Maria Hinojosa on board as the program anchor, a post she still holds. In 2000, responsibility for the administration of Latino USA was transferred from the Center for Mexican American Studies at the University of Texas at Austin, to KUT-FM, based at UT's College of Communication. In 2002, Maria Emilia Martin left her position as Executive Producer and was replaced by Hinojosa. In 2006, Hinojosa had the title \\"Managing Editor\\" added. In 2010, Futuro Media Group, a production company founded by Hinojosa, assumed full developmental and production responsibilities for Latino USA, including content, research and reporting. In 2012, the show transitioned from its half-hour format to its current one-hour format, overseen in turn by senior producers Carolina Gonz√°lez, A.C. Valdez, and Daisy Rosario. Today Today, Latino USA is a public radio show with a dedicated focus on America‚Äôs Latino community. It is the longest-running Latino-focused program on the radio and the foremost voice in public media providing insight into the experience of Latinos throughout the United States. It is ranked among the top 10 in 5 of the top 25 national markets. Awards Latino USA has won multiple journalism awards, most recently the 2010 Radio Impact Award from the Third Coast International Audio Festival. It has also received The Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award; the Radio-Television News Directors Association's Edward R. Murrow Award; The Scripps Howard Foundation's National Journalism Award; The Gabriel Award; The Gracie Allen Award; and numerous awards from the National Federation of Community Broadcasters.

The station was the limit of regular train operations from Bo'ness, however the track continues to the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway at Manuel Junction and is used for the transfer of rolling stock to/from the National Rail network. The section to Manuel was due to open to regular passenger traffic in 2009, however this did not happen until 2010. There is a station building. which houses a shop, a cafe, and the access the Birkhill Fireclay Mine. The parts of the building were recovered from Monifieth railway station and were originally rebuilt in 1988 by Central Regional Council as their display at the Glasgow Garden Festival. When this closed the building was relocated to Birkhill. There was no station here until the Scottish Railway Preservation Society took over the branch line. The summit of the line, located to the south of the station, was regraded and lowered to avoid the new platform being on an excessive gradient, and the station was opened to passengers in 1989. History There was no station at Birkhill in its working days but there was a loop, just north of the present station, a water column and a short siding off to the clay mine. Track layout The track layout at Birkhill features a simple passing loop with two- lever ground frames at either end to control the points. The single platform was recently extended along with track realignment to accommodate 7-coach trains. The construction of a Caledonian Railway style signal box with as many as 20 levers, a water column for steam locomotives and a second platform has been proposed, however no date has been set for completion.

(1981): \\"Ceremonies of the Pawnee. Part II. The South Bands\\". Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology, No. 27. Washington. He seems to wear a government medal on his breast. Petalesharo (c. 1797 ‚Äì c. 1836) was a Skidi Pawnee chief or brave who rescued an \\"Ietan\\" girl, that is Comanche girl,Thurman, Melburn D.: \\"The Timing of the Skidi-Pawnee Morning Star Sacrafice.[sic]\\" Ethnohistory, Vol. 30 (1983), No. 3, pp. 155-163. from a ritual human sacrifice around 1817 (in present-day Nebraska) and earned publicity for his act in national newspapers. In 1821, he was one of numerous Great Plains tribal chiefs to go to Washington, D.C. as part of the O'Fallon Delegation where they met President James Monroe. History As was their traditional practice, the Skidi Pawnee had captured an enemy girl to sacrifice her as part of the spring equinox Morning Star ceremony. They would care well for her before the sacrifice in the weeks or months beforehand.Ralph Linton, \\"The origin of the Pawnee Morning Star Sacrifice\\", American Anthropologist (New Series) Vol 28, No 3 (July 1926), pp. 457‚Äì466 Petalesharo‚Äôs father Knife Chief (Lachelasharo) opposed the ceremony, but the tribe ignored his concerns. The ritual had a long tradition and the people believed that their crops and hunting would suffer if the Morning Star did not receive a human sacrificial offering. The Comanche girl was tied to a pyre and prepared for execution when Petalesharo approached the warriors gathered for the ritual. Announcing that his father, also a chief, disapproved of the ceremony, he released the woman and led her away. Petalesharo gave the freed woman a horse and provisions, then sent her home to rejoin her tribe.Daily National Intelligencer, November 22, 1821. Missionaries working in the area heard the story of Petalesharo's bravery. Another version has two members of the 1820 Long Expedition, Edwin James and Robert R. Bell, as the carriers of the news. Thereby they corrected an 1818 newspaper story of a Comanche woman fleeing on a stolen horse and leaving her newborn child to be sacrificed instead. James gives the time for the deed of Petalesharo as 1817, while Bell states it took place \\"about five years since\\", ca. 1815. (Because no \\"Morning Star\\" was visible in the East in April 1817 and neither in April 1818, it has been suggested that the incident took place in 1816, when the planet Venus rose in the eastern morning sky.) The Comanche girl was not the only person whom Petalesharo rescued from ritual sacrifice. In 1818, he prevented the sacrifice of a young boy under similar conditions. With the help of fur trader Alexander Papin, staying among the Pawnee, the Spanish boy came to live in the family of fur trader Manuel Lisa in St. Louis.Jones, Dorothy V.: \\"John Dougherty and the Pawnee Rite of Human Sacrifice: April, 1827.\\" Missouri Historical Review, Vol. 63 (1969), pp. 293-316. =The news reach the major papers= The 1817 story circulated around the United States, appearing in newspapers that provided a romanticized version of the rescue. Petalesharo's story first appeared in The Washington Daily National Intelligencer on November 22, 1821. In the winter of 1821, the New York Commercial Advertiser published an eleven-stanza poem, \\"The Pawnee Brave.\\" The poem became popular and was read and recited in parlors of sentimental New Yorkers.James D. Horan, The McKenny-Hall Portrait Gallery of American Indians, p. 238. =Petalesharo in Washington City= Petalesharo was part of a delegation of Native American chiefs who traveled to Washington D.C. in 1821 on a trip organized by the superintendent of Indian affairs, Thomas L. McKenney, and Indian Agent Benjamin O'Fallon (it was sometimes called the O'Fallon Delegation). The U.S. officials intended to impress the Natives with the power and wealth of the white man and ideally persuade them to end their warfare against American settlers.James D. Horan, The McKenny-Hall Portrait Gallery of American Indians, p. 45. Native Americans who participated in this delegation performed traditional dances, which drew a reported six to ten thousand on-lookers. Many businesses and Congress closed for the day to allow staff to attend the performances.Daily National Intelligencer, March 7, 1822. During the visit to Washington, news of Petalesharo's rescue became a popular topic of discussion. At Miss White's Select Female Seminary, the young students begged to attend the Native American dance performance. Afterward, they raised funds to have a medal created for Petalesharo, to commemorate his brave act. Made of silver, the medal had images depicting his rescue, together with the inscription, \\"bravest of the brave\\". McKenney accompanied Petalesharo to the home of one of the students' parents. There the young women presented the medal to him. Petalesharo made a short speech, saying, \\"I did not know the act was so good. It came from my heart. I was ignorant of its value. I now know how good it was. You make me know by giving me this medal.\\"James D. Horan, The McKenny-Hall Portrait Gallery of American Indians, p. 238 The BIA commissioned Charles Bird King to paint portraits of Petalesharo and others in the delegation, including Young Omahaw, War Eagle, Little Missouri and Pawnees. Petalesharo was further painted by John Neagle,Ewers, John C. (1988): Indian Life on the Upper Missouri. Norman and London. and he is also shown in the 1822 Samuel F.B. Morse painting, The Old House of Representatives,http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and- Publications/Statuary-Hall/Old-Hall/Old-House-Chamber/ now held by the Corcoran Gallery of Art. During the trip, Petalesharo met author James Fenimore Cooper, who was believed to be inspired to write his novel, The Prairie.Viola, Herman J. (1981): Diplomats in Buckskin. A History of Indian Delegations in Washington City. Washington. =Later= Indian agents had warned the Pawnees against continuing their sacrifices, seemingly starting with Superintendent William Clark in 1811. In 1827, some Pawnees, with the help of Indian agent John Dougherty, attempted to rescue a young Cheyenne girl who had been taken in a raid. During the effort, a Skidi Pawnee shot and killed the girl with arrows as she was being lifted onto a horse.Thurman, Melburn D.: \\"The Skidi Pawnee Morning Star Sacrifice of 1827.\\" Nebraska History, 1970, pp. 268-280. This authentic event is the basis for a story of an assumed Morning Star rite and an actually never attempted rescue in 1833.Thurman, Meldrum D.: \\"A Case of Historical Mythology: The Skidi Pawnee Morning Star Sacrifice of 1833.\\" Plains Anthropologist, Vol. 50 (1970), pp. 309-311. The last historic reference to Petalesharo is in 1825, when he and his father signed a treaty at Fort Atkinson, on the west bank of the Missouri River before his death in 1836 in a battle with \\"Cheyenne\\" near the Platte river in Nebraska. The medal given by the student girls in Washington was excavated in 1883 from a gravesite in Howard County, Nebraska. A young farm boy, Olando Thompson, dug up the medal at the former site of a Skidi village. By the 1920s, the American Numismatic Society in New York had purchased the medal for its collection.Nebraska History and Record of Pioneer Days, Vol. II, No. 2, April‚ÄìJune, 1919, P.5. Earlier sources often confused Petalesharo, Skidi Brave, with two other 19th-century Pawnee with the same name. The second Petalesharo who also accompanied the 1821 delegation to Washington was mistaken for the name Peskelechaco, a Kitkehahki Chief. The third Petalesharo is, in fact, the second notable Petalesharo in Pawnee Treaties...his accurate title is Petalesharo II, the head chief of the Grand Pawnees in the 1860s. Petalesharo is honored by the United States Navy. The large harbor tug, , was named after him.

The air turborocket is a form of combined-cycle jet engine. The basic layout includes a gas generator, which produces high pressure gas, that drives a turbine/compressor assembly which compresses atmospheric air into a combustion chamber. This mixture is then combusted before leaving the device through a nozzle and creating thrust. There are many different types of air turborockets. The various types generally differ in how the gas generator section of the engine functions. Air turborockets are often referred to as turboramjets, turboramjet rockets, turborocket expanders, and many others. As there is no consensus on which names apply to which specific concepts, various sources may use the same name for two different concepts.Heiser and Pratt, p. 457 Benefits The benefit of this setup is increased specific impulse over that of a rocket. For the same carried mass of propellant as a rocket motor, the overall output of the air turborocket is much higher. In addition, it provides thrust throughout a much wider speed range than a ramjet, yet is much cheaper and easier to control than a gas turbine engine. The air turborocket fills a niche (in terms of cost, reliability, ruggedness, and duration of thrust) between the solid- fuel rocket motor and gas turbine engine for missile applications. Types =Turborocket= A turborocket is a type of aircraft engine combining elements of a jet engine and a rocket. It typically comprises a multi-stage fan driven by a turbine, which is driven by the hot gases exhausting from a series of small rocket-like motors mounted around the turbine inlet. The turbine exhaust gases mix with the fan discharge air, and combust with the air from the compressor before exhausting through a convergent-divergent propelling nozzle. Background Once a jet engine goes high enough in an atmosphere, there is insufficient oxygen to burn the jet fuel. The idea behind a turborocket is to supplement the atmospheric oxygen with an onboard supply. This allows operation at a much higher altitude than a normal engine would allow. The turborocket design offers a mixture of benefits with drawbacks. It is not a true rocket, so it cannot operate in space. Cooling the engine is not a problem because the burner and its hot exhaust gases are located behind the turbine blades. =Air turboramjet= Original schematic of a turboramjet design Recreated schematic of an air turboramjet, featuring; 1. compressor, 2. gearbox, 3. hydrogen and oxygen lines, 4. gas generator, 5. turbine, 6. ram burner fuel injector, 7. main combustor, 8. nozzle The air turboramjet engine is a combined cycle engine that merges aspects of turbojet and ramjet engines. The turboramjet is a hybrid engine that essentially consists of a turbojet mounted inside a ramjet. The turbojet core is mounted inside a duct that contains a combustion chamber downstream of the turbojet nozzle. The turboramjet can be run in turbojet mode at takeoff and during low-speed flight but then switch to ramjet mode to accelerate to high Mach numbers. The operation of the engine is controlled using bypass flaps located just downstream of the diffuser. During low-speed flight, controllable flaps close the bypass duct and force air directly into the compressor section of the turbojet. During high-speed flight, the flaps block the flow into the turbojet, and the engine operates like a ramjet using the aft combustion chamber to produce thrust. The engine would start out operating as a turbojet during takeoff and while climbing to altitude. Upon reaching high subsonic speed, the portion of the engine downstream of the turbojet would be used as an afterburner to accelerate the plane above the speed of sound. At lower speeds, air passes through an inlet and is then compressed by an axial compressor. That compressor is driven by a turbine, which is powered by hot, high-pressure gas from a combustion chamber.Heiser and Pratt, pp. 457‚Äì8. These initial aspects are very similar to how a turbojet operates, however, there are several differences. The first is that the combustor in the turboramjet is often separate from the main airflow. Instead of combining air from the compressor with fuel to combust, the turboramjet combustor may use hydrogen and oxygen, carried on the aircraft, as its fuel for the combustor.Kerrebrock, pp. 443‚Äì4. The air compressed by the compressor bypasses the combustor and turbine section of the engine, where it is mixed with the turbine exhaust. The turbine exhaust can be designed to be fuel-rich (i.e., the combustor does not burn all the fuel) which, when mixed with the compressed air, creates a hot fuel-air mixture which is ready to burn again. More fuel is injected into this air where it is again combusted. The exhaust is ejected through a propelling nozzle, generating thrust.Heiser and Pratt, p. 458. = Conditions for usage of turboramjet = The turboramjet engine is used when space is constrained, as it takes up less space than separate ramjet and turbojet engines. Since a ramjet must already be traveling at high speeds before it will start working, a ramjet-powered aircraft is incapable of taking off from a runway under its own power; that is the advantage of the turbojet, which is a member of the gas turbine family of engines. A turbojet does not rely purely on the motion of the engine to compress the incoming air flow; instead, the turbojet contains some additional rotating machinery that compresses incoming air and allows the engine to function during takeoff and at slow speeds. For flow between Mach 3 and 3.5 during cruise flight, speeds at which the turbojet could not function because of the temperature limitations of its turbine blades, this design provides the ability to operate from zero speed to over Mach 3 using the best features of both the turbojet and ramjet combined into a single engine. Air turborocket vs. standard rocket motor In applications which stay relatively in the atmosphere and require longer durations of lower thrust over a specific speed range the air turborocket can have a weight advantage over the standard solid fuel rocket motor. In terms of volumetric requirements, the rocket motor has the advantage due to the lack of inlet ducts and other air management devices.

Drasdo was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, England. He began rock climbing just after World War II and became a founding member of a loose association of young climbers from the area who came to be known as \\"the Bradford Lads\\". Active throughout the United Kingdom, particularly the gritstone edges of Yorkshire and Derbyshire, the fells of the English Lake District, and the mountains of North Wales. Harold climbed regularly in the late 1940s and 1950s with most of the leading northern rock climbers of the day including Joe Brown and members of the famous Rock and Ice Club. Another regular partner throughout his active career was his brother, Neville Drasdo, who became a formidable climber during this period in his own right and whose activities included an ascent with Joe Brown of one of the hardest British routes of its day, \\"Hardd\\" (now graded E2 5c) on Carreg Hyll Drem in Snowdonia. Harold and Neville Drasdo were the first climbers to explore Poisoned Glen in Donegal, Ireland, and during an intensive period established several hard first ascents. In 2000, the Drasdo brothers celebrated 50 years of new routing, a half-century that began with \\"Cravat\\" (graded VS 4c) on Neckband Crag, Langdale, in 1950 and culminated with \\"Two Against Nature\\" (graded S 4a) on Craig Ddu, Moel Siabod. As a guidebook writer, Harold Drasdo wrote the first Fell & Rock Climbing Club guide to the Eastern crags of the Lake District in 1957. In 1971 he became the first climber to write both English and Welsh guide books when he wrote the Climbers' Club guide to Lliwedd. As a consistent explorer of undeveloped crags in England, Wales and Ireland, he has established many first ascents, including \\"North Crag Eliminate\\" (E1 5b) on Castle Rock of Triermain, \\"Grendal\\" (VS 4b) in Deepdale, \\"Anarchist\\" (HS 4b) on Raven Crag, \\"Ulysses\\" (VS) in Donegal, \\"Automedon\\" (VS 4c) and \\"Heart of Darkness\\" (VS 4c) on Arenig Fawr, and \\"Traditional Route\\" (S) on Craig Rhaeadr Ewynnol. Harold was an outdoor education instructor who worked in Derbyshire and North Wales which culminated with a twenty-year period as Chief Instructor of the Towers Outdoor Education Centre, Capel Curig, North Wales. Apart from his guidebooks, he published Education and The outdoor Centres (1972); The Mountain Spirit (1979); and his autobiography, The Ordinary Route (1997). A frequent essayist and reviewer, Harold's published works are included in journals and magazines. Politically he has been a lifelong anarchist and environmentalist who has frequently defended the natural environment in both actions and print. Harold lives in North Wales and still active in mountain activities. Harold Drasdo died after a short illness, in Bangor, North Wales on 3 September 2015.

A part of the Indiana Department of Corrections, it is the largest state prison for women in Indiana with approximately 1,200 women.Rockville Correctional Facility Although it is classified as a medium-security prison, it has inmates of all security levels. History The facility was originally the Rockville Air Force Station, a radar base established by the U.S. Air Force in the beginning of the 1950s, only to be deserted ten years later. It was resurrected by the Department of Correction as a juvenile male correctional facility in 1970. The facility went through many changes after that: from a prison for older juveniles, to a co-ed prison for adolescent males and adult females, then finally to a prison for adult females in 1992.\\"Rockville Correctional Facility Board of Correction,\\" June 19, 2002 Before 1992, Indiana had only one women's prison, the Indiana Women's Prison, which was located in downtown Indianapolis and, therefore, unable to expand. Thus, the Department of Correction converted Rockville into a women's prison to serve the growing female population. Buildings and grounds In 1995 the Indiana General Assembly approved a plan to rebuild Rockville completely. Following that decision, 23 structures were demolished, five were upgraded, 13 new buildings were built and the entire facility's infrastructure was replaced. The facility's campus is located on and now has 22 buildings and two employee residences. Dorm 1 was constructed in 1985 for juveniles and now houses the CLIFF Unit. The other four dorms are almost identical in size and configuration. Dorm 2 was constructed in 1993 and now serves as the Intake Unit for the Indiana Department of Correction female offenders. The remaining dorms were completed in 1997. The Town of Rockville provides the prison's water and sewage services. Programs Rockville's on- site school, Parkeview School, has a GED program as well as courses in culinary arts, building trades, computer literacy, horticulture, home maintenance and business technology. Oakland City University, Indiana State University and Ivy Tech all offer university courses for degrees. In addition, Oakland City University offers vocational training in Computer Assisted Drafting.IDOC: Home Rockville has several noteworthy programs for inmates. The Hope Center offers parenting classes for inmate mothers and allows them to practice their skills and establish a positive relationship with their children. The ICAAN Assistance Dog program allows inmates to train pups until they are fifteen months old. The inmates give the pups basic obedience training and teach them to do things such as opening doors, turning off lights, and carrying phones. Inmate population Of the 1,205 inmates at Rockville, 67% are white, 29% are black, 2% are Hispanic and the remaining 2% are American Indian, Asian/Pacific and unknown. The average age of the women at intake is 33 and the average current age is 35. Nearly one-third of the women are there for substance abuse. The majority of the women at Rockville are serving sentences of two to ten years with less than 1% indeterminate life or life without parole. Only 5% are in prison for murder.\\"Current Offenders Housed at Rockville Correctional Facility,\\" Indiana Department of Correction, September 26, 2007 Notable inmates *Paula Cooper #864800 is perhaps Rockville's most famous inmate, who was convicted in 1985 of killing a Sunday school teacher, Ruth Pelke, when Cooper was only fifteen years old.

Foster and others organized a campaign to commute Cooper's death sentence. Two million people signed petitions to Indiana governor Robert D. Orr, and one million people signed petitions to the United Nations. In 1987, Governor Orr also received a well-publicized appeal from Pope John Paul II.

Allenby Square, a name commemorating Field Marshal Edmund Allenby who commanded the British forces which captured Palestine in the First World War, has been bestowed at different times on two different squares in Jerusalem. This divergent naming was connected both to prestige struggles within the British forces entering Jerusalem in late 1917, leading to what became known as \\"the multiple surrenders\\", and to later vicissitudes of the struggle between Israelis and Arabs for control of the city. The multiple surrenders The British Army advanced along the Jaffa-Jerusalem Highway and approached Jerusalem. During the night between 8‚Äì9 December 1917, the Ottoman Army withdrew, sparing Jerusalem what might have been a bloody and destructive battle. On the following day the Palestinian Mayor of Jerusalem, Hussein Salim Al Husseiny, set out to tender the city's formal surrender to the British. Near the Shaare Tzedek Hospital, at what was then the sparsely populated western outskirts of Jerusalem, he met with a couple of British kitchen sergeants, and - not familiar with British military rank insignia - tendered the capitulation to them. However, the officer in charge was displeased with this informal ceremony, and held a second surrender ceremony on the same windswept hill, with his own participation; a higher officer demanded and got a third one, still in the same location; and finally, Field Marshal Allenby insisted on still a fourth and final one, held this time at a different location - just outside the Jaffa Gate of the Old City, which Allenby then ceremoniously entered, making the point of dismounting and entering on foot out of respect for its religious significance. The Mayor of Jerusalem was not present at the final surrender, having caught pneumonia from too much standing on the exposed hill in the cold mountain winter. Allenby visited him in the hospital. Due to these manoeuvres, there were two competing Days of the Surrender of Jerusalem (9 and 11 December) and two locations: the hill where the original ceremony took place, and the Jaffa Gate where Allenby's ceremony was held. These discrepancies left still-tangible traces on the map of Jerusalem. The monument The 1920 Allenby monument. In 1920, a British war memorial was erected on the hill where the first surrender ceremony took place. The three- metre high rectangular monument, similar in style to other British WWI memorials, usually designated as cenotaphs, was designed by Ernest Wallcousins.\\"The Building News and Engineering Journal\\", vol. CXVIII, 27 February 1920, p. 154 and illustration. Quote: \\"Cenotaph to be erected at Jerusalem. Mr. E. Wallcousins, Architect.\\" It bore the date of 9 December (the actual surrender day, rather than 11, the date of the ceremonial surrender), with the text: > Near this spot, the Holy City was surrendered to the 60th London Division, > 9th December 1917. > Erected by their comrades to those officers, NCOs and men who fell in > fighting for Jerusalem.Yad Ben-Zvi publication, pp 126-27Zahi Shaked, The > British Battle of Jerusalem (1917) - The Monument on the hill where the > surrender took place (video) The monument carries reliefs on all four sides schematically depicting medieval knights resting their arms on long swords, a reference to the comparison made at the time by many Britons between the 1917 conquest of Palestine and the Crusades. An equestrian statue of Allenby was planned to stand on top of the memorial, but was never actually installed. The first Allenby Square, now IDF Square IDF Square (Kikar Tzahal). The hill where the first surrender took place was at that time on the western edge of Jerusalem, a few kilometres west of the walls of the Old City. Allenby though held his ceremony at the square right next to Jaffa Gate, which was then named \\"Allenby Square.\\" Throughout the years of British rule in Mandatory Palestine, Allenby Square was in the midst of a bustling thoroughfare. However, with the outbreak of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the square became part of the battlefield, separating first the Jewish and Arab militias from each other, and later the newly formed Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from the Jordanian Arab Legion. The 1949 Armistice Agreements placed Allenby Square partially within the no- man's-land (City Line (Jerusalem)), and it remained such until the conquest and annexation of East Jerusalem and in 1967. In 1967 the Israeli authorities decided to change the name of the square to \\"IDF Square\\" (◊õ◊õ◊® ◊¶◊î\\"◊ú, Kikar Tzahal), which is its name up to the present. The second Allenby Square in Romema During the British period, the 1920 monument, in the midst of an empty field, became gradually surrounded by the houses of the Romema neighborhood. After the creation of Israel, the Jerusalem Municipality surrounded it by an elliptical fence and planted some bushes; however, it was not officially declared a city square or given a name, and the area became increasingly neglected. Allenby, whose memory is regarded with some favour in official Israel, was deprived in 1967 of \\"his\\" square, and the authorities decided to bestow the name on this neglected area around the monument - though some commentators objected, stating that Allenby's staged surrender ceremony had not taken place at that spot. Nevertheless, the name was bestowed on the Romema square. It remained, however, rather neglected: only in 1994 did the municipality make the effort, after many protests by neighbours, to establish a proper playground for the Romema children, right next to the memorial. It was further refurbished, with new paving and lighting, when the new Jerusalem Central Bus Station was created nearby.

They are usually induced from Ca2+ signaling, although recent research has questioned the role of Ca2+ in gliotransmitters and may require a revision of the relevance of gliotransmitters in neuronal signalling in general. While gliotransmitters can be released from any glial cell, including oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia, they are primarily released from astrocytes. Astrocytes rely on gap junctions for coupling, and are star-like in shape, which allows them to come into contact with many other synapses in various regions of the brain. Their structure also makes them capable of bidirectional signaling. It is estimated that astrocytes can make contact with over 100,000 synapses, allowing them to play an essential role in synaptic transmission. While gliotransmission primarily occurs between astrocytes and neurons, gliotransmission is not limited to these two cell types. Besides the central nervous system, gliotransmission also occurs among motor nerve terminals and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. Another occurrence of gliotransmission takes place between glial cells in the retina, called M√ºller cells, and retinal neurons.  Function  The word ‚Äúglia‚Äù illustrates the original belief among scientists that these cells play a passive role in neural signaling, being responsible only for neuronal structure and support within the brain. Glial cells cannot produce action potentials and therefore were not suspected as playing an important and active communicative role in the central nervous system, because synaptic transmission between neurons is initiated with an action potential. However, research shows that these cells express excitability with changes in the intracellular concentrations of Ca2+. Gliotransmission occurs because of the ability of glial cells to induce excitability with variations in Ca2+ concentrations. Changes in the concentration of Ca2+ correlate with currents from NMDA receptor-mediated neurons which are measured in neighboring neurons of the ventrobasal (VB) thalamus. Because glial cells greatly outnumber neurons in the brain, accounting for over 70% of all cells in the central nervous system, gliotransmitters released by astrocytes have the potential to be very influential and important within the central nervous system, as well as within other neural systems throughout the body. These cells do not simply carry out functions of structural support, but can also take part in cell-to-cell communication with neurons, microglia, and other astrocytes by receiving inputs, organizing information, and sending out chemical signals. The Ca2+ signal from the astrocyte may also participate in controlling blood flow in the brain. Gliotransmitters have been shown to control synapse development and regulate synaptic function, and their release can lead to paracrine actions on astrocytes as well as the regulation of neurotransmission. The definition of a gliotransmitter is not only defined by its presence in glial cells, but is determined by other factors, including its metabolic pathway. Also, the function of gliotransmitters varies according to their type, and each gliotransmitter has a specific target receptor and action. Glial cells are important in hormonal and neuroendocrine function in the central nervous system and have an active role in sleep, cognition, synaptic function and plasticity, and promote remyelination and regeneration of injured nervous tissue. Other functions include the regulation of neurosecretory neurons and the release of hormones.  Types of gliotransmitters  The major types of gliotransmitters released from astrocytes include glutamate and ATP. Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter within the central nervous system that can also be defined as a gliotransmitter due to its ability to increase cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations in astrocytes. Its main target receptors include Kainate receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and especially N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). NMDARs are glutamatergic receptors that play an important role in synaptic plasticity. Other functions of this gliotransmitter include synchronous depolarization, increasing the frequency of postsynaptic currents, and also increasing the likelihood of release and frequency of AMPA-receptor-dependent postsynaptic currents NMDARs are controlled by a voltage-gated channel receptor that is blocked by magnesium. Calcium can enter through NMDAR channels due to the cell's depolarization, which removes the magnesium block, and therefore activating these receptors. ATP is a gliotransmitter that is released from astrocytes and restrains neuronal activity. ATP targets P2X receptors, P2Y, and A1 receptors. ATP has several functions as a gliotransmitter, including insertion of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic terminal, paracrine activity through calcium waves in astrocytes, and suppression of synaptic transmission. Neuronal activity is controlled in the retina by the molecule's ability to hyperpolarize the neuron by converting from ATP to adenosine. ATP plays a role in facilitating neuroinflammation and remyelination by entering into the cell's extracellular space upon injury to activate purinergic receptors, which increase the production of gliotransmitters. The mechanism of ATP release from astrocytes is not well understood. Although it is unclear whether or not ATP-mediated gliotransmission is calcium-dependent, it is believed that ATP release is partly dependent on Ca2+ and SNARE proteins and involves multiple pathways, with exocytosis being the suggested method of release. Other less common gliotransmitters include: * homocysteic acid, an endogenous N-methyl-(D)-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) agonist * taurine * atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) * tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) * GABA15.  Cell-to-cell communication  While neurotransmission is defined as information exchange between neurons, gliotransmission does not simply occur between astrocytes, but also between astrocytes, neurons and microglia. Between astrocytes, a ‚ÄúCa[2+] wave‚Äù of activity can be initiated, even when they are not in contact with each other, stimulating release of gliotransmitters. Gliotransmission can also occur between two types of glial cells: astrocytes and microglia. Calcium waves within the intracellular matrix of the astrocyte can cause a response in microglia with the presence of ATP in the extracellular matrix. One study demonstrated that a mechanical stimulation caused astrocytes to release ATP, which in turn caused a delayed calcium response in microglia, suggesting that astrocyte-to-microglia communication could be mediated by ATP. Communication between astrocytes and neurons is very important in neuronal function. The ‚Äútripartite synapse‚Äù is that most common example of intercellular communication between astrocytes and neurons, and involves the pre- and postsynaptic terminals of two neurons and one astrocyte. Astrocytes have the ability to modulate neuronal activity, either exciting or inhibiting synaptic transmission, depending on the type of gliotransmitter released, specifically glutamate, which typically has excitatory influence on neurons, or ATP, which has shown to typically inhibit certain presynaptic functions of neurons.  Tripartite synapse  The fact that the release of gliotransmitters via elevations in calcium causes synaptic transmission leads to the idea of the ‚Äútripartite synapse.‚Äù The tripartite synapse involves the localization of astrocytes and synapses and is a concept of synaptic physiology in which there are three parts of a synapse: the presynaptic terminal, the postsynaptic terminal, and an astrocyte in between them. One model of the tripartite synapse shows the presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals lying adjacent to each other, which the astrocyte is wrapped around the postsynaptic terminal. However, localization and spatial distribution of the three elements of the tripartite synapse vary in different regions of the brain. Potassium channels between the astrocyte and the presynaptic terminal make it possible to release K+ ions and avoid accumulation after neuronal activity. Also, the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic vesicles activates metabotropic receptors on the astrocyte, which then causes the astrocyte's release of gliotransmitters from the cell. The astrocyte is bidirectional, meaning that it can communicate and exchange information with both pre- and postsynaptic elements. Communication is primarily controlled by the change in Ca2+ concentrations, causing excitability within the astrocyte. The capability of a human to respond to change in both the external and internal environment is increased due to the hormonal regulation of the tripartite synapse.  Roles in Health and Disease  It is believed that an increase in gliotransmission may contribute to epilepsy, while a decrease may contribute to schizophrenia. Also, counting the number of astrocytes has proven to be useful; patients with depression are shown to have a lower astrocyte cell count. Further research and understanding of the correlation between gliotransmission and neurological disorders could lead to new targets for therapeutic treatment in the brain. Studies have also shown that increased and decreased stimulation of NMDARs, which is controlled by astrocytes, play a role in various neurodegenerative disorders. These include Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases as well as schizophrenia, stroke, and epilepsy. It is believed that certain disorders, particularly schizophrenia and epilepsy, may be partially caused by varying levels of gliotransmission and calcium excitability. One theory, called the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, suggests that glutamate deficiency, which leads to the dysfunction of NMDARs at the presynaptic terminal, is believed to cause symptoms of schizophrenia. According to research, this hypofunctionality of NMDARs has been shown to be caused by lower amounts of gliotransmission facilitated by D-serine. More recently, it has been shown that D-serine and serine racemase occur almost exclusively in neurons, which do not support a role of D-serine as a gliotransmitter. The fact that cycloserine, which acts as an agonist for the NMDAR's binding site, is used in the treatment for patients with schizophrenia further supports the glutamate hypothesis. In the case of epilepsy, it is known that glutamate plays a role in synchronous depolarizations. This has led researchers to believe that excitation of epileptic discharges may be caused by the glutamate-mediated gliotransmission. Although that some studies show that the all excitations caused by gliotransmission lead to epileptic discharges, but it could possibly increase the intensity of length of epileptiform activity. The 5 first mentioned transmitters are primarily excitatory and can thus lead to neural apoptosis through excitotoxicity when expressed at large amounts. From neurodegenerative diseases, there is evidence at least for Alzheimer's disease that point to increased glial activation and amount (both glia and astrocyte) which accompanies simultaneous decrease in the number of neurons. Excess quantities of the gliotransmitter TNF, documented in the cerebrospinal fluid in Alzheimer's disease, are hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder, perhaps by dysregulating synaptic mechanisms which are modulated by TNF.

It incorporated the world's fastest autofocus system (according to the company and when coupled to a xi series lens), had a maximum shutter speed of 1/12000 of a second and a 14-zone metering system. The 9xi had been improved in many areas over the previous flagships, the 9000 and 8000i, including: * A rugged construction with better moisture and dust sealing. * Nearly the same shooting speed as the 9000, but without the additional heavy and bulky motor pack. * An improved shutter speed from 1/8000 of a second (8000i) or 1/4000 (9000) to 1/12000 of a second due to carbon-reinforced shutter blades. * A pentaprism where information was projected directly in the image using transparent LCD technology. * Compatibility with xi zoom lenses having a \\"power zoom function\\", allowing for extra functionality. * An improved synchronization time for the new set of flashguns launched. * A more contemporary, arguably even futuristic, design. * Many more improvements. Design The Minolta 9xi was a bold design compared to its rivals and predecessors. It had smoothed contours completely unlike the previous 9-class camera the Minolta 9000, and unlike many competing cameras. Buttons were largely hidden, or placed directly by the fingers controlling them. This led to unusually clean aesthetics and an uncluttered appearance. Technology The Minolta 9xi is, to this day, still impressive in terms of technological ability. Nearly 5 frames per second without an external motor or battery pack was uncommon for its day, coupled with the four-sensor autofocus system that could continuously track not only horizontally but vertically and diagonally‚Äîeven when an object came towards the camera. The autofocus system could focus at light levels of ‚àí1 ev and up to 19 ev (at ISO 100). It also used a 14-segment light metering system, variations of it being used for many years in most Minolta cameras. It featured a 1/300 of a second x-sync flash synchronization with stepless shutter speeds from 1/12000 of a second to 30sec in Program and Aperture Priority mode.Minolta Maxxum Dynax Instruction Manual A mechanical shutter this fast is still uncommon more than 25 years later. The 9xi had many other abilities, many perhaps hidden at first sight. The camera could, without any external backs like the Minolta 9000 or cards like the Minolta 8000i, bracket 3 exposures each one 1/2 a stop different (each way). It could control a wireless flash system, if Minolta's 5400xi flash or the special \\"wireless flash controller\\" was used, at speeds of 1/60 of a second (1/30 in ratio); this was remarkable technology at the time. The 9xi was also capable of detecting if the photographer had their eye placed against the viewfinder; it was named \\"eye-start\\", and in essence, enabled the camera to start checking exposure and focus when the user either had their hand on the grip and/or when they looked through the viewfinder. This, in theory, allowed users to take a photo more quickly. Criticism The 9xi was and is criticized for many design choices. One was that it used the \\"creative cards\\" system, cards adding cost and being impractical for the camera's intended market. These cards worked in the same way as the 8000i's had and gave the photographer more \\"creative techniques\\" when inserted into the camera. However, some functions (the \\"custom functions\\" card being the main offender) were clearly already present in the camera, and only accessible by buying the card‚Äîthis was seen as an attempt to \\"milk\\" the market. Another problem was the cameras' lack of built-in flash. This was an attempt by Minolta to appeal to more professionally inclined photographers, but it also negated the camera's built-in support for the wireless flash system (a main selling point) as an additional accessory was needed‚Äîunlike on the \\"less professional\\" 7xi. The camera was also criticized for its heavily \\"computerized\\" interface, with few buttons and many vital functions only accessible behind the card door. It featured an interface with a few single buttons toggling between several crucial functions, and then using the front and back wheels to set options. While theoretically very fast to operate if properly learned, it was completely different from interfaces used on cameras before, and it has never been used since. Also, the physical interface included some arguably strange design choices, like having a large \\"Program reset\\" button as one of the few actual buttons (the target market hardly interested in that specific feature) as well as one small button deeply sunk into the body, hard to access for many users and of dubious utility. The 9xi used both the older Minolta AF lenses and the xi-series lenses. Some of the new xi lenses had a new \\"powerzoom\\" function where the zoom ring electronically zoomed the lens via a motor. This allowed for a few extra functions, such as auto-zoom and zooming effects while exposing; in practice, however, it was slower to use, drained camera batteries and prevented pre-xi camera bodies from accepting the lenses because they did not have the ability to power the zoom. The xi-series lenses was not a success, and power-zooming lenses largely disappeared from the camera market until the function reappeared in lenses marketed to videographers with modern video-shooting SLRs. The display system, while innovative with its projected information directly in the image, unfortunately, made the viewfinder darker due to the LCD overlay. The LCD elements were not lit, so it was impossible to see the LCD overlay‚Äîincluding focus areas‚Äîin the dark. Lastly, the 9xi lacked a real vertical grip, only having a \\"battery grip\\" extending the handgrip slightly while adding support for AA batteries. This grip completely lacked controls of any kind, even a shutter release button. The xi series is largely seen as a bold but failed attempt to take SLR photography in a different direction. For the following cameras, the si series, Minolta went for a much more traditional approach, culminating in their last \\"single-digit series\\" film cameras where most everything was controlled by an unusual number of separate buttons‚Äîthe antithesis of the xi series. This later design was continued in the Konica Minolta and Sony era.

The main aim of the charity is to supply short collections of poems for patients in National Health Service General Practice waiting rooms to read while waiting to see their doctor. The aim is to promote poetry, and to make the paient's wait more pleasant. The service is free to the waiting rooms and general practice managers, and is supported by grants and donations. The poems are presented as A4 sized three-fold cards typically reproducing between six and eight poems. Batches of cards are printed and distributed to waiting rooms four times a year. Patients are invited to take the cards away with them. An additional service provided by the charity is 'PiTWR for Hospitals'. This provides larger print-runs of the poetry cards for distribution in hospitals. These are adapted to display the hospitals own message and sponsorship details. A key consideration for the charity is the selection of poems. Guidelines for the selection of poems have been devised with this in mind, and with help from a consultant psychiatrist as well as from poets. To quote the Editor \\"In a patient centred health service, poetry arts in health too needs to be patient centred. The readers are patients ‚Äì the worried well and the worried sick. The poems selected draw from the springs of well-being. In time of trouble, a measure of comfort is welcome\\". The selection of poems is therefore different from, for example, the poetry that patients may themselves write as writing therapy. Poems selected for inclusion in PiTWR collections are a mix of contemporary work and poems from the canon of English poetry. Translations of poems from other traditions are also included. The essential is that they all contain positive images of hope, home, security, safe journey and arrival, beauty and transcendence, love and loving. The approach is indeed more akin to bibliotherapy rather than art therapy. Submissions from poets are encouraged, and a set of guidelines is provided to indicate the sort of poetry that meets the need of the charity. In addition to the selection, production and distribution of the poetry cards the charity also undertakes research into the cost effectiveness of the scheme, and supports related arts in health initiatives. Recent work focusses on the extension of the scheme to support the production of special editions tailored for distribution in hospitals, rather than general practice waiting rooms. Collaborative work with other arts in health or literature based organisations, such as The Reader (magazine) is actively pursued. Organisation Poems in the Waiting Room, Registered Charity (No. 1099033), is incorporated as a company limited by guarantee (04836215) and is managed by the trustee body and executive committee, providing professional advice in literary and executive editing, production and distribution of the poetry cards. The executive committee has been expanded since the retirement and death of the founder, Michael Lee, formerly Executive Chairman. The Chair is now held by Serge Lourie who took over on the retirement of Wendy French; Edmund Simon Lee is Honorary Chief Executive; Helen Lee is Honorary Secretary and became Editor on the retirement of Isobel Montgomery Campbell; Ciorsdan Glass is Executive Editor; Elizabeth Mary Anne Patience Consultant Analytical Psychologist; Michael Sheridan Stone is Director of PitWR Worldwide.

It was originally serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen King in Japan in 1970 and was published in English translation in 2007. The story follows a neglected and abused boy, Shogo, who does not have any feelings of love. Through a series of visions spanning the past and future, Shogo explores the meaning of love between man and woman. Plot is a boy whose single mother never knew his father as he was born after a series of affairs. An unintended child, his mother beat him whenever he witnesses love and tenderness. This leads to Shogo killing various animals upon seeing their love. Because of this, Shogo is taken to a mental institute. After a shock therapy, Shogo has an out-of-body experience and he meets the goddess of love, who subjugates him to experience love across different time periods for the rest of eternity, dying repeatedly until he can one day understand the true meaning of love. In his first experience, Shogo is in Nazi Germany as a German stormtrooper, when he falls in love with the Jewish Elise. Shogo helps her to escape, but she shoots him when she discovers her parents were killed. Wounded, Shogo is able to shoot and kill the soldiers who beat Elise. They then die side by side as they declare their love for one another. When he wakes up on the clinic, Shogo is hypnotized, and has a vision of an idyllic island he inhabits with a photographer named Naomi, after their plane crashes. After some time, a ship full of poachers approaches the island, but a conflict with the animals ensues and Naomi is killed by a stray bullet. Shogo and the animals perish after the believed-to-be-dormant volcano erupts. Back in the real world, Shogo is accused of murdering a nymphomaniac patient and escapes the institute. His speed running from the police is witnessed by , so she takes him to train to be a marathon runner. While he is training alone, Hiromi's former fianc√© appears and pushes Shogo down a cliff, and he apparently dies but is rescued by Hiromi. Unconscious, Shogo has a vision of a dystopic future in which humans are subjugated by the race of clones called Synthians. He is sent to assassinate the queen of the Synthians, Queen Sigma, who physically resembles Hiromi, but falls for her instead. Gradually the queen begins to love him too, but after several mishaps involving her clones, Shogo is killed by a clone of himself created by the general of the Synthians (who resembles Hiromi's fianc√©). Upon returning to the real world, he witness a double suicide by a couple whose love was not permitted by their families. When he discovers Hiromi is a physician who is trying to \\"cure\\" him, Shogo tries to commit suicide, but Hiromi stops him, falling over the edge. Shogo rescues Hiromi, and, as they acknowledge their love for one another, she dies in his arms. The police, along with the institute's doctor, find Shogo and attempt to inform him that the nymphomaniac's death was her own fault. However, Shogo tells the doctor that he finally knows what love is and that life has no meaning without Hiromi. Shogo dumps Hiromi's body in a canister of oil and provokes the police into shooting him, which kills him instantly. After this, Shogo is brought back before Athena, who tells him that he must continue to endure pain and suffering whenever he finds love for the rest of eternity. Production Sex education for children was a taboo in Japan in the late 1960s, but this changed suddenly in the early 1970s. Apollo's Song was created during a period where manga was increasingly portraying sexual stories and imagery, and was Tezuka's exploration of love and sex in manga form. This period in Japan was also marked by violent student riots and incidents involving student activists, and Tezuka reportedly later said that Shogo's depressed character reflected the dark mood and instability in society at the time.

It is a result of snow, ice, water, loose material and the texture of the road surface on the traction produced by the wheels of a vehicle. Road slipperiness can be measured either in terms of the friction between a freely-spinning wheel and the ground, or the braking distance of a braking vehicle, and is related to the coefficient of friction between the tyre and the road surface. Public works agencies spend a sizeable portion of their budget measuring and reducing road slipperiness. Even a small increase in slipperiness of a section of road can increase the accident rate of the section of road tenfold. Maintenance activities affecting slipperiness include drainage repair, snow removal and street sweeping. More intensive measures may include grinding or milling a surface that has worn smooth, a surface treatment such as a chipseal, or overlaying a new layer of asphalt. A specific road safety problem is split friction or Œº (mu) - split; when the friction significantly differs between the left and the right wheelpath. The road may then not be perceived as hazardous when accelerating, cruising or even braking softly, but in a case of hard braking, the difference in friction will cause the vehicle to start to rotate towards the side offering higher grip. Split friction may cause jack- knifing of articulated trucks, while trucks with towed trailers may experience trailer swing phenomena. Split friction may be caused by an improper road spot repair that results in high variance of texture (roads) and colour (thin ice on newly paved black spots thaws faster than ice on old greyish asphalt) across the road section. Measurement The two ways to measure road slipperiness are surface friction testing and stopping distance testing. Friction testing can use surface friction testers or portable friction testers, and involves allowing a freely moving object, usually a wheel, to move against the surface. By measuring the resistance experienced by the wheel, the friction between the ground and the wheel can be found. Stopping distance testing involves performing an emergency stop in a test vehicle and measuring the distance required to come to a stop. This can be measured either from the length of the skid marks left by the vehicle, or by the \\"chalk-to- gun\\" method, where the brakes are connected to a small gun filled with chalk powder, which marks the point when the brakes were applied. This has the advantage of measuring the full stopping distance, while simply measuring the skid marks only measures the distance from the point where the wheels began to lock or slip. Measurement of skidding resistance is not yet universally harmononised despite a number of attempts such as FEHRL's HERMES project.FEHRL Report 2006/01 HERMES project, Harmonization of European Routine and research Measuring Equipment for Skid Resistance The European Standards Organisation (CEN)has been working on the topic for many years through its committee CEN/TC 227 - Road materials.http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/TechnicalCommitteesWorkshops/CENTechnicalCommittees/Pages/default.aspx?param=6208&title;=Road%20materials Contributions to this were made through the FP7 Tyrosafe projecttyrosafe.fehrl.org which aims to raise awareness, to coordinate and prepare for European harmonisation and to optimise the assessment and management of essential tyre/road interaction parameters in order to increase safety and support greening of road transport. This project will provide a synopsis of the current state of scientific understanding and its current application in different standards. It will identify the needs for future research and propose a way forward in the context of the future objectives of road administrations in order to optimise three key properties of roads: skid resistance, rolling resistance and tyre/road noise emission. Reduction Dutch newsreel about the anti-skid training school of Rob Slotemaker Road slipperiness can contribute to car accidents. In 1997, over 53,000 accidents were caused by slippery roads in the United Kingdom out of an estimated 4,000,000 accidents (or approximately 1.3 per cent) . A small change in road slipperiness can have a drastic effect on surface friction: decreasing the coefficient of friction from 0.45 to 0.35, equivalent to adding a dusting of wet snow, increased the accident rate by almost 1000%. As such, road agencies have a number of approaches to decreasing road slipperiness. Most roads are designed with a convex camber to provide sufficient drainage, thereby allowing surface water to drain out of the road. Trouble sections include entrances and exits of banked outercurves, where the cross slope is close to zero. Unless these sections have a longitudinal grade of at least 0.4‚Äì0.5%, the drainage gradient (resultant to crossfall and longitudinal grade) will be lower than 0.5% so water will not run off the road surface. Storm drains may be installed at regular intervals and modern paving materials are designed to provide high friction in most conditions. Permeable paving allows water to soak through the paving material, reducing slipperiness in very adverse conditions. Road slipperiness can be prevented or delayed by proper pavement design. The aggregate used in the pavement should be selected with care, as certain aggregates such as dolomite may polish, or wear smooth under the action of tires. With asphalt pavements and surface treatments, using too much asphalt or asphalt emulsion can cause bleeding or flushing, a condition where excess asphalt rises to the top and fills in the road texture. Both problems increase slipperiness, especially when the pavement is wet. Once lost, pavement texture can be restored with retexturing procedures such as diamond grinding of pavement, surface treatments such as chipsealing and resurfacing with asphalt concrete. Snow and ice removal also decreases road slipperiness; snowploughs and snow blowers can remove the snow from the road surface while gritters drop road salt and sand, which both melts the snow and ice from the road surface, and provide a rougher surface to grip onto. However, in dry conditions, sand and salt on the road surface can themselves increase road slipperiness and pose a danger to road traffic, and therefore, roads are cleared by street sweepers after roadworks and gritting to make sure that all the loose material is cleared from the road surface.

As a connexin, GJA1 is a component of gap junctions, which allow for gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) between cells to regulate cell death, proliferation, and differentiation. As a result of its function, GJA1 is implicated in many biological processes, including muscle contraction, embryonic development, inflammation, and spermatogenesis, as well as diseases, including oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD), heart malformations, and cancers. Structure GJA1 is a 43.0 kDa protein composed of 382 amino acids. GJA1 contains a long C-terminal tail, an N-terminal domain, and multiple transmembrane domains. The protein passes through the phospholipid bilayer four times, leaving its C- and N-terminals exposed to the cytoplasm. The C-terminal tail is composed of 50 amino acids and includes post-translational modification sites, as well as binding sites for transcription factors, cytoskeleton elements, and other proteins. As a result, the C-terminal tail is central to functions such as regulating pH gating and channel assembly. Notably, the DNA region of the GJA1 gene encoding this tail is highly conserved, indicating that it is either resistant to mutations or becomes lethal when mutated. Meanwhile, the N-terminal domain is involved in channel gating and oligomerization and, thus, may control the switch between the channel's open and closed states. The transmembrane domains form the gap junction channel while the extracellular loops facilitate proper channel docking. Moreover, two extracellular loops form disulfide bonds that interact with two hexamers to form a complete gap junction channel. The connexin-43 internal ribosome entry site is an RNA element present in the 5' UTR of the mRNA of GJA1. This internal ribosome entry site (IRES) allows cap independent translation during conditions such as heat shock and stress.  Function  Connexin 43 distribution in the rat myocardium (gap junctions between cardiomyocytes) As a member of the connexin family, GJA1 is a component of gap junctions, which are intercellular channels that connect adjacent cells to permit the exchange of low molecular weight molecules, such as small ions and secondary messengers, to maintain homeostasis. GJA1 is the most ubiquitously expressed connexin and is detected in most cell types. It is the major protein in heart gap junctions and is purported to play a crucial role in the synchronized contraction of the heart. Despite its key role in the heart and other vital organs, GJA1 has a short half-life (only two to four hours), indicating that the protein undergoes daily turnover in the heart and may be highly abundant or compensated with other connexins. GJA1 is also largely involved in embryonic development. For instance, transforming growth factor- beta 1 (TGF-Œ≤1) was observed to induce GJA1 expression via the Smad and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, resulting in trophoblast cell differentiation into the placenta. Furthermore, GJA1 is expressed in many immune cells, such as eosinophils and T cells, where its gap junction function promotes the maturation and activation of these cells and, by extension, the cross- communication necessary to mount an inflammatory response. In addition, GJA1 can be found in the Leydig cells and seminiferous tubules between Sertoli cells and spermatogonia or primary spermatocytes, where it plays a key role in spermatogenesis and testis development through controlling the tight junction proteins in the blood-testis barrier. While it is a channel protein, GJA1 can also perform channel-independent functions. In the cytoplasm, the protein regulates the microtubule network and, by extension, cell migration and polarity. This function has been observed in brain and heart development, as well as wound-healing in endothelial cells. GJA1 has also been observed to localize to the mitochondria, where it promotes cell survival by downregulating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway during conditions of oxidative stress.  Clinical significance  Mutations in this gene have been associated with ODDD; craniometaphyseal dysplasia; sudden infant death syndrome, which is linked to cardiac arrhythmia; Hallermann‚ÄìStreiff syndrome; and heart malformations, such as viscero-atrial heterotaxia. There have also been a few cases of reported hearing loss and skin disorders unrelated to ODDD. Ultimately, GJA1 has low tolerance for deviations from its original sequence, with mutations resulting in loss- or gain-of-channel function that lead to disease phenotypes. It is paradoxical, however, that patients with an array of somatic mutations in GJA1 most often do not present with cardiac arrhythmias, even though connexin-43 is the most abundant protein forming gap junctional pores in cardiomyocytes and are essential for normal action potential propagation. Notably, GJA1 expression has been associated with a wide variety of cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, meningioma, hemangiopericytoma, liver tumor, colon cancer, esophageal cancer, breast cancer, mesothelioma, glioblastoma, lung cancer, adrenocortical tumors, renal cell cancer, cervical carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, prostate cancer, thyroid carcinoma, and testis cancer. Its role in controlling cell motility and polarity was thought to contribute to cancer development and metastasis, though its role as a gap junction protein may also be involved. Moreover, the cytoprotective effects of this protein can promote tumor cell survival in radiotherapy treatments, while silencing its gene increases radiosensitivity. As a result, GJA1 may serve as a target for improving the success of radiotherapeutic treatment of cancer. As a biomarker, GJA1 could also be used to screen young males for risk of testis cancer. Currently, only rotigaptide, an antiarrhythmic peptide-based drug, and its derivatives, such as danegaptide, have reached clinical trials for treating cardiac pathologies by enhancing GJA1 expression. Alternatively, drugs could target complementary connexins, such as Cx40, which function similarly to GJA1. However, both approaches still require a system to target the diseased tissue to avoid inducing developmental abnormalities elsewhere. Thus, a more effective approach entails designing a miRNA through antisense oligonucleotides, transfection, or infection to knock down only mutant GJA1 mRNA, thus allowing the expression of wildtype GJA1 and retaining normal phenotype.

Built in the 1850s, it is one of the most opulent antebellum mansions to survive in the southeastern United States. It is now operated as a historic house museum by the Pilgrimage Garden Club. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974 and and a Mississippi Landmark in 1995. Description Stanton Hall occupies an entire city block north of downtown Natchez, bounded by High, Commerce, Monroe, and Pearl Streets. The property is ringed by wrought iron fencing with elaborate gate posts. The house is a two-story brick structure, plastered and painted white. Its front entrance features a two-story Greek temple portico, with four fluted Corinthian columns supporting an entablature and gabled pediment. Spaces between the columns have decorative iron railings, repeated in a second-floor balcony railing set under the portico. The main roof is hipped, and truncated with a large cupola at the center. The interior is elaborately decorated, using materials such as imported Italian marble, and chandeliers made of glass and bronze.  History  Stanton Hall, by Frances Benjamin Johnston, 1938 Stanton Hall was built during 1851‚Äì57 for Frederick Stanton, a cotton broker, as a replica of his ancestral home in Ireland. Stanton named it \\"Belfast\\", but only lived in it a short time before he died. The house's scale and opulence made it a great financial burden on his heirs, but it survived the American Civil War, and in 1890 was made home to the Stanton College for Young Ladies. In 1940 it was acquired by the Pilgrimage Garden Club, which uses it as its headquarters and operates it as a museum and event venue.  In popular culture  The mansion serves as a design for Disneyland's Haunted Mansion. The house's insides have appeared in ABC's mini- series North and South as the Mains' mansion interiors.The exteriors were filmed at the Boone Hall Plantation, near Charleston, South Carolina The house was also seen briefly in Show Boat (1951). In South and West: From a Notebook, Joan Didion writes that Ben Toledano's wife suggested she visit Stanton Hall as well as the Asphodel Plantation, the Oakley Plantation and the Rosedown Plantation to understand the South better.

Since opening in 1978 the Foosaner Art Museum has amassed over 5,000 objects, spanning 20 centuries. These items form the Museum's Permanent Collection, reflecting not only the Museum's interests and specialties, but also the lives of the people who have lived in the community. Throughout the year, visitors can experience a changing selection of exhibitions. Rotating exhibitions of nationally and internationally recognized artists showcase contemporary trends and historical art movements as do the variety of exhibitions created from the Museum's permanent collection. The Foosaner Art Museum's permanent collection is composed primarily of Modern and Contemporary Art and includes the Enrique Conill Mendoza Collection of American Industrial Design and the world's largest collection of works by Ernst Oppler (German, 1897 - 1929). History The Foosaner Art Museum, Florida Institute of Technology, was established March 8, 1978 as the Brevard Art Center and Museum, Inc. The first building was acquired during the summer of 1978, and was modified to meet the needs of a visual arts museum. The Museum was then a 4,500-square-foot exhibition space consisting of three galleries. In June 1980, a major gift from Cocoa Beach philanthropist Samuel J. Foosaner made possible the purchase of a 6,000-sq. ft. building adjoining the existing museum. The building was subsequently remodeled to accommodate an extensive program of studio classes. Children and adults now enjoy the opportunity to study and create art at the Renee Foosaner Education Center. In February 1986, the Museum moved to a new five-gallery facility across the street from the original site. The renovated space tripled the exhibition area and provided greater office, technical support, and storage areas. Culturally significant collections could now be exhibited at the Museum. The permanent collection has grown to over 3,000 objects with the addition of several recently gifted artworks. Following the demise of the community's local science museum in 1994, the Board of Trustees voted to undergo expansion and develop a children's science education facility adjacent to the Museum's educational wing, adding approximately 5,000 square feet of science exhibition space. The newly refurbished science center opened in the fall of 1995. In February 1995, the organization name was officially changed to Brevard Museum of Art and Science. In 1999 the science center was renamed the Ruth Cote Clemente Children's Science Center, in honor of a major donor. Educational programming remains at the core of the Foosaner Art Museum's mission, with their extensive range of programs designed to appeal to the community. As the largest visual arts museum in Brevard County, the Museum plays an invaluable role in the County for both residents and visitors. Today, more than 30 years later, the Foosaner Art Museum has tripled the exhibition area and provides modern technical conservation methods and storage areas as the collection increases in size. In addition, children and adults now enjoy the opportunity to study and create art at the Renee Foosaner Education Center which houses pottery, painting, drawing and printmaking studios. In June 2007, the Board of Trustees announced the Museum's name change from the Brevard Museum of Art and Science to the Brevard Art Museum. The former Science Center space was redesigned to enlarge painting and ceramic studios. On July 1, 2011, the Museum merged with the Florida Institute of Technology, the only independent, technological university in the Southeast. A $1 million gift was received from the Foosaner Foundation to benefit the Museum, now officially known as the Foosaner Art Museum. \\"The Foosaner family has a long history of philanthropy in Brevard,\\" said Florida Tech President Anthony J. Catanese. \\"This generous gift will help perpetuate the important efforts of education and cultural enrichment started by the museum in 1978, and now continued by Florida Tech.\\" Exhibits *Clyde Butcher: Florida's Photographer (8 June 2019 ‚Äì present) - 69 black and white landscape photographs.

Nevakhovich was friend and prot√©g√© of Abram Peretz. He went to St. Petersburg toward the end of Catherine II's reign, and engaged in commercial pursuits, then turned to literature. He was among the first Russian Jews to gain a mastery of the Russian language, starting with translations from German, Hebrew and Swedish. Nevakhovich was a linguist, a student of philosophy, and an ardent admirer of Moses Mendelssohn. Nevakhovich held patriotic views regarding both his Jewish heritage and the Russian Empire, expressing his gratitude for opportunities of growth. He also was optimistic in regard to the future of the Jews and assumed that they would be granted greater liberty. In 1806 Nevakhovich was baptized into the Lutheran Church (Russian Orthodox according to other sources). In 1817 he moved to Warsaw where he started working for the Ministry of Finance. In 1831 he returned to St. Petersburg in order to produce one of his plays on the stage, but he died before he could accomplish his purpose. Nevakhovich is interred in Volkovo Cemetery in St. Petersburg. Works Nevakhovich, with his friends Abram Peretz and Noah Notkin, made a determined effort to secure recognition for the Jews of Russia. Under the title Vopl' Dshcheri Iudeiskoi (Russian for Lament of the Daughter of Israel) he wrote an urgent appeal to the people of Russia, calling upon them to show a spirit of tolerance and justice toward Jews. In this appeal he shows how the Jewish people have been maligned, and insists that the Jewish religion tends to produce good men and good citizens: \\"For centuries, the Jews have been accused by the peoples of the earth. They have been accused of witchcraft, of irreligion, of superstition ... All their actions were interpreted to their disadvantage, and whenever they were discovered to be innocent their accusers raised against them new accusations ... I swear that the Jew who preserves his religion undefiled can be neither a bad man nor a bad citizen.\\" In 1804, Nevakhovich published Perepiska Dvukh Prosvyeschonnykh Druzei (Russian for Correspondence of Two Enlightened Friends); other writings followed in 1805 and 1806. He became close to Prince Alexander Shakhovskoy, a dramatist. Nevakhovich's play Sulioty ili Spartantzy XVIII Vyeka (Russian for Sulliots, or Spartans of the 18th century) was successfully produced at the Imperial Theater in St. Petersburg in 1809, and was performed before the emperor in October of the same year. His Mech Pravosudiya (Russian for The Sword of Justice) was put on the stage after his death in 1831.

The show is the most watched fiction program in Catalonia, Spain, especially among female audiences, drawing around 28-33% of the audience with as much as 40% during season finales. El cor de la ciutat follows the lives of the people who live and work in the neighbourhood of Sants and Sant Andreu in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Eight complete seasons have been broadcast up until July 2008, with Season 9 currently airing. Five episodes are broadcast each week, one on each weekday, on TV3. With 1,906 episodes of the programme have been produced, making El cor de la Ciutat the longest-running television series TVC has produced. The show receives almost 800,000 viewers and near season endings some episodes have had over one million viewers. At the end of each season, a special night of programming is dedicated to the soap opera, known as La Nit del Cor (The Night of the Heart). During the sixth season of the show (2005-2006), there was a change of neighbourhood for the show, as the Peris-Noguera family had to move from Sant Andreu to Sants, both of which are real areas of Barcelona. The family had fallen into poverty by selling their bar in order to pay release charges to prevent their son, David, from returning to prison. Having thought they had paid it all off, a large compensation claim was made against the family. The claim was made by one of the widowers of a dead passenger, killed in an accident involving a cruiser crashing into the front of The Chyme, a restaurant on the coast of Menorca which David worked in as a chef. In spite of the renewal of characters that the change of location has brought to the program, many of the older characters from Sant Andreu have turned up in episodes set in Sants - some of them, like Francisco and Remei even moved to Sants soon after the Peris- Noguera family. As a result of the show's move to Sants, viewers have been introduced to the stories behind characters such as the Galiana/Guti√©rrez family, Merc√® Amor√≥s Sendra and the teachers at the high school there very quickly. Moreover, some of the new characters which have passed through the new series have been played by very famous actors such as Joan Pera and √Ängels Gonyalons, who both made two special collaborations during the seventh season of the show (2006 - 2007). Two years after leaving Sant Andreu, the life of the Peris-Noguera family has changed a lot. Cinta Noguera, now very ill, decides to do everything possible for the Peris-Noguera family to get their bar back in Sant Andreu. The death of his wife makes Pere Peris reassess his life and so he decides start again in his lifelong neighbourhood with his infant daughter, Carolina, and his new partner √Ängela Montford. This return to Sant Andreu opens the door to a new phase of the series. From 12 September 2007, the series is broadcast in high definition, incorporates ten new actors and the majority of characters are from Sant Andreu again whilst retaining some of the more popular protagonists of Sants (such as Fidel Amor√≥s Furi√≥, Benet Sep√∫lveda Campruv√≠ (Beni), the Sendra sisters, Trini Gonz√°lez and the Benjumea family).

Career Mabry attended the University of Oklahoma and the University of New Mexico School of Law. He settled in Clovis, New Mexico, where he practiced law and published the local newspaper. He was a member of the New Mexico Constitutional Convention in 1910. Mabry held numerous political and judicial posts, including serving in the New Mexico Senate (1912‚Äì17); on the Albuquerque City Commission (1926‚Äì27); as District Attorney of Albuquerque (1932‚Äì36); and as a state district judge (1937‚Äì39).

Anxiety disorder is the class of mental disorder in which anxiety is the predominant feature. This disorder, an illness characterized by constant and boundless worry that interferes with the daily life, is the most common psychiatric illness in the United States, affecting 40 million American adults.The Mental Health Business Week Editors. (2006). ANXIETY DISORDERS; Anxiety Disorders Association of America survey finds Americans report stress, anxiety. The Mental Health Business Week. Pg.9. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) is involved in education, training, and research for anxiety and stress-related disorders. The mission statement of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) is to promote the prevention, treatment, and cure of anxiety, depression, and stress-related disorders through education, practice, and research. ADAA offers free educational information and resources about anxiety disorders, local treatment provider referrals, self-help groups, self-tests, and clinical trial listings. The organization funds scientific research through grants and awards and promote awareness that anxiety disorders are real and treatable. The organization's headquarters is located in Silver Spring, Maryland. ADAA is guided by a board of directors, scientific advisory board, and clinical advisory board, and it is supported by donations. The association holds an annual conference focused on the science and treatment of anxiety and anxiety-related disorders in children and adults. ADAA publishes self-help books such as Facing Panic, Triumph Over Shyness: Conquering Social Anxiety Disorder, in hopes of helping the estimated 40% of anxiety suffering Americans the opportunity to cope with and possibly overcome the disorder. Furthermore, anxiety stems from a complex arrangement of factors such as life experiences, personality, brain chemistry, or even genetics, so as a developing, mental disorder, anxiety requires patience to overcome. ADAA has a free online peer support community on HealthUnlocked for people with anxiety or depression.  History  The Anxiety Disorders Association was founded by Jerilyn Ross, Drs. Robert Dupont, Arthur Hardy, and Manuel Zane as the Phobia Society of America. It was officially incorporated on December 1, 1980. In spring 2008, ADAA launched \\"Treat It, Don't Repeat It: Break Free From OCD,\\" a national educational campaign about obsessive-compulsive disorder. The campaign included public service announcements featuring Howie Mandel, host of \\"Deal or No Deal;\\" Tony Shalhoub, star of the award-winning TV Series \\"Monk\\" about a detective with OCD; and David Hoberman, co-creator and executive producer of \\"Monk.\\" In June 2008, it was announced that ADAA would join with HealthCentral to provide further information, advice, and support to those with anxiety disorders. ADAA would create a blog to be used as an additional resource to HealthCentral's own website for anxiety disorders. Other features such as video interviews with ADAA experts and help for those with specific phobias were also planned. In 1980 a small group emerged and founded the Phobia Society of America (PSA) which is what it was primarily called, they promoted awareness of treatments for phobias. In 1990 the PSA changed their name to the Anxiety Disorders Association of America, often referred as ADAA.(n.d.). Retrieved from In 2012, ADAA changed its name from Anxiety Disorders Association to Anxiety and Depression Association of America to better reflect the comorbidity of anxiety disorders and depression.  Research  ADAA has funded more than $1 million to 225 anxiety disorders researchers since developing their awards program in 1999. In 2009, ADAA supported 11 anxiety disorders researchers through their Career Development Travel Awards given to early career professionals with a research interest in anxiety and anxiety-related disorders such as basic and clinical neurobiology and psychopharmacology, clinical psychology, genetics, neuroimaging, epidemiology, and public health. From a pool of callers to the ADAA, 1,000 individuals were selected to answer a 97-item questionnaire to ascertain information relating to social anxiety disorder, as well as sub- threshold social anxiety disorder. ADAA found that those individuals suffering from social anxiety disorder were likely to be younger in age, unmarried, and in lower income brackets than those non-sufferers in the control group. ADAA found that sufferers of social anxiety disorder made more extensive use of the health care system, and were also disadvantaged in many ways. In light of these facts, ADAA strives to bring about public consciousness of the mental health issue and highlight the importance of early diagnosis and effective treatment, with the broad goal of improving people's lives.

Shah Abbas I of Iran used the rivalry between Teimuraz and Saakadze to divide the Georgians into two opposing parties and to punish Saakadze who had formerly fought under the Iranian ranks.

It is a forum for cities, towns, counties, transit agencies, port districts, Native American tribes, and state agencies to address regional issues.\\"Puget Sound Regional Council. \\"Interlocal Agreement for Regional Planning in the Central Puget Sound Area\\" http://www.psrc.org/about/what/interlocal.htm Geography The Puget Sound Regional Council serves the central Puget Sound region of Washington state. The region is made up of King County, Kitsap County, Pierce County, and Snohomish County, which collectively encompass and comprise 73 cities and towns. The five major cities are Seattle, Bellevue in King County, Tacoma in Pierce County, Everett in Snohomish County, and Bremerton in Kitsap County. The region's population was estimated to be over 4.2 million as of April 2019.Washington State Office of Financial Management. \\"April 1, 2019 Population of Cities, Towns, and Counties Used for Allocation of Selected State Revenues\\" Accessed 2/4/2020 http://www.ofm.wa.gov/POP/april1/ofm_april1_population_final.pdf History =Early history (1956‚Äì1991)= In 1956 the four counties of the Puget Sound region established the Puget Sound Regional Planning Conference, which changed its name to the Puget Sound Governmental Conference (PSGC) in 1958. It launched the Puget Sound Regional Transportation Study (PSRTS) in 1962 with support from the Washington State Highway Commission, the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads (predecessor of the Federal Highway Administration), and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The study, completed in 1967, offered recommendations regarding transportation policy as well as land-use planning; its publication set the precedent of taking on \\"transportation planning duties previously done by Washington State\\". Its membership continued to expand to smaller suburban cities and tribal councils. In 1973 Washington Governor Daniel J. Evans designated PGSC as an MPO for the purposes of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1973. Two years later it decided to reorganize as the Puget Sound Council of Governments (PSCOG) and continued to expand. =Puget Sound Regional Council (1991‚Äìpresent)= The Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC) came into being in its current form in 1991 by an interlocal agreement and was designated an MPO by Washington Governor Booth Gardner. This occurred at the same time Congress passed the federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), which allowed for a larger regional role in planning. It was the \\"first time\\" that transportation projects were selected by elected officials with significant public input. Activities PSRC conducts long-range planning (20‚Äë30 years in the future) for growth management, transportation, and economic development. It also collects regional data on demographics, housing, unemployment, building permits, and traffic counts, and analyzes to inform public policy. =Securing transportation funding= PSRC President Josh Brown notes that \\"helping communities secure federal transportation funding\\" is a key priority because of its positive effects on employment growth and the economy. Indeed, PSRC maintains the regional Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), a database of nearly $12 billion in projects that are being financed between 2010 and 2013. Some examples of such projects include new bridges in Tacoma and Bothell, more efficient traffic signal timing in Redmond, and light rail construction to Northgate. =VISION 2040= VISION 2040 is PSRC's strategy to ensure that Puget Sound region residents have a high quality of life come 2040, when the region's population is expected to reach 5 million. The document analyzes policies in response to the needs of housing, economic development, transportation, and the environment. It identifies infrastructure investments that would contribute to the region's and its residents' well-being and suggests a financing plan for the investments. =\\"BNSF Corridor Preservation Study\\"= The \\"BNSF Corridor Preservation Study\\" was prepared in 2006‚Äì2007 to evaluate the potential of an eastside rail corridor for public use by an advisory committee working with HDR Engineering, a consultancy, with grants from the Federal Transit Administration, the Federal Highway Administration, and the Washington State Department of Transportation. It recommended replacing most of the Woodinville Subdivision rail line that runs through Seattle's eastern suburbs with a bicycle and walking trail, as well as preserving freight services along the northern segment. For the longer term (10‚Äì40 years), the study recommended planning for high-capacity commuter rail. In 2008 the Washington State Legislature requested that Sound Transit and PSRC evaluate the feasibility of commuter rail in the BNSF Woodinville Subdivision along the east side of Lake Washington. The report, prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff, found that it would be \\"feasible through a variety of capital improvements to facilitate higher speeds\\" within the range of capital cost estimates of similar projects in the United States, \\"although at the high end of that range\\" due to the dilapidated infrastructure and the absence of safety and communications systems. =Prosperity Partnership= The Prosperity Partnership is a coalition of public- and private-sector organizations as well as nonprofits that is \\"working to promote a strong central Puget Sound economy\\". It was launched in November 2004 and has accrued more than 300 member organizations. Achievements include: * Founded the Washington Clean Technology Alliance, the first trade association dedicated to clean technology in the state (2007) * Published a report on the \\"size, scope, segments, and growth potential\\" of the region's clean tech cluster as well as its niche advantages and how to pair them with export-oriented industries (Nov. 2009) * Founded the Washington Global Health Alliance, which markets Washington as an \\"epicenter of global health discovery, development, and delivery\\" (2007) * Published a foreign direct investment (FDI) toolkit to aid local and state governments in attracting FDI (Jan. 2009) * Established the International Regions Benchmarking Consortium, a gathering of \\"metropolitan regions that find it mutually beneficial to learn from each other\\" by comparing data and research findings, with financial support from Microsoft and Boeing (2008) * Created the Washington Defense Partnership to serve as a central coordinating body for the military presence and mission in Washington as well as families, veterans, and the defense-contracting community (2009)Indeed, total economic output resulting from the defense industry is conservatively estimated at nearly 4% of Washington State's total GDP.

Biography Nugroho was born in Yogyakarta, Special Region of Yogyakarta on 6 June 1961. He was the fourth child of postal workers Soetjipto Amin and Mariah, who eventually had seven children. As a child, he attended an Islamic elementary school, later attending Catholic secondary schools. His father owned a lending library and enjoyed writing, leading Nugroho to start writing from a young age; he later quit writing because he felt his father to be too critical. He also enjoyed exploring, and would bathe in the Code River fed by the cold lahar runoffs from Mount Merapi; he notes that the sulfur, which was brought to the river by the lava, was good for his skin. After graduating from Kolese Loyola high school in 1981, Nugroho went to Jakarta to study filmmaking at the Jakarta Institute of Arts (Institut Kesenian Jakarta, or IKJ), as well as law and politics at the University of Indonesia (UI). After studying under Teguh Karya, he graduated from the IKJ in 1985. He later graduated from UI in 1991. During his free time, Nugroho directed documentaries and short movies. Nugroho made his directorial debut with 1991's Cinta dalam Sepotong Roti (Love in a Slice of Bread), overcoming bureaucracy caused by his refusal to join the Indonesian filmmakers' union. Cinta dalam Sepontong Roti was selected as Best Film in that year's Indonesian Film Festival. After his mother's death in 2005, Nugroho decided to make a film about Javanese culture. He was later commissioned by the government of Austria to make a film for the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth. The result, Opera Jawa, was based on the Ramayana and produced by Simon Fields. In 2008 Nugroho returned to theatre with The Iron Bed, adapted from Opera Jawa. The play was shown at the Z√ºrcher Theater Spektakel in Zurich, Switzerland. Style The Jakarta Post writes that Nugroho's films emphasize aesthetics, but contain sociopolitical messages. Among the issues he has discussed in his films are multiculturalism, politics, intercultural communication, and his vision for a \\"New Indonesia\\". However, he has faced criticism that his films are too difficult for the general public to understand; Seno Gumira Ajidarma credits this to Nugroho's narrative style, which comes across as strange to Indonesian viewers. Joko Anwar, writing for The Jakarta Post, notes that dialogue written by Nugroho tends to lack believability. Sylviana Hamdani of The Jakarta Globe describes his dialogue as poetic. Nugroho also mixes historical footage with staged scenes in several of his movies, including Surat Untuk Bidadari and Aku Ingin Menciummu Sekali Saja. Recognition Nugroho's debut film Cinta dalam Sepotong Roti garnered six Citra award nominations (Best Director, Best Movie, Best Editing, Best Music, Best Artistic Scenes and Best Cinematography) at the Indonesian Film Festival (IFF); Nugroho was selected as the Best Young Director at the Asia Pacific Film Festival in Seoul the next year. His next movie, Surat untuk Bidadari (Letter for an Angel), won Best Film at the Taormina Film Festival as well as the Tokyo International Film Festival, while Nugroho himself received Best Director at the Pyongyang International Film Festival and Young Filmmakers Jury award at the Berlin International Film Festival. His film Daun di Atas Bantal (Leaf on a Pillow) also won Tokyo International Film Festival, in 1998. Personal life Nugroho enjoys gardening and travelling, both in Indonesia and abroad.

Jackson, the seventh United States president, took office after defeating incumbent President John Quincy Adams in the bitterly contested 1828 presidential election. During the 1828 presidential campaign, Jackson founded the political force that coalesced into the Democratic Party during Jackson's presidency. Jackson won re-election in 1832, defeating National Republican candidate Henry Clay by a wide margin. He was succeeded by his hand-picked successor, Vice President Martin Van Buren, after Van Buren won the 1836 presidential election. Jackson's presidency saw several important developments in domestic policy. A strong supporter of the removal of Native American tribes from U.S. territory east of the Mississippi River, Jackson began the process of forced relocation known as the \\"Trail of Tears.\\" He instituted the spoils system for federal government positions, using his patronage powers to build a powerful and united Democratic Party. In response to the Nullification Crisis, Jackson threatened to send federal soldiers into South Carolina, but the crisis was defused by the passage of the Tariff of 1833. He engaged in a long struggle with the Second Bank of the United States, which he viewed as an anti-democratic bastion of elitism. Jackson emerged triumphant in the \\"Bank War,\\" and the federal charter of the Second Bank of the United States expired in 1836. The destruction of the bank and Jackson's hard money policies would contribute to the Panic of 1837. Foreign affairs were less eventful than domestic affairs during Jackson's presidency, but Jackson pursued numerous commercial treaties with foreign powers and recognized the independence of the Republic of Texas. Jackson was the most influential and controversial political figure of the 1830s, and his two terms as president set the tone for the quarter-century era of American public discourse known as the Jacksonian Era. Historian James Sellers has stated, \\"Andrew Jackson's masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the American stage.\\"Charles Grier Sellers, Jr., \\"Andrew Jackson versus the Historians,\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review (1958) 44#4, pp. 615-634 in JSTOR His actions encouraged his political opponents to coalesce into the Whig Party, which favored the use of federal power to modernize the economy through support for banking, tariffs on manufactured imports, and internal improvements such as canals and harbors. Of all presidential reputations, Jackson's is perhaps the most difficult to summarize or explain. A generation after his presidency, biographer James Parton found his reputation a mass of contradictions: \\"he was dictator or democrat, ignoramus or genius, Satan or saint.\\" Thirteen polls of historians and political scientists taken between 1948 and 2009 ranked Jackson always in or near the top ten presidents. Election of 1828 \\"Some account of the bloody deeds of General Andrew Jackson,\\" The 1828 election was a rematch between Jackson and John Quincy Adams, who had faced‚Äìoff against each other four years earlier in the 1824 presidential election. Jackson had won a plurality, but not the required majority, of the electoral vote in the 1824 election, while Adams, Secretary of War William H. Crawford, and Speaker of the House Henry Clay also received a significant share of the vote. Under the rules of the Twelfth Amendment, the U.S. House of Representatives held a contingent election. The House elected Adams as president. Jackson denounced the House vote as the result of an alleged \\"corrupt bargain\\" between Adams and Clay, who became Adams's Secretary of State after the latter succeeded outgoing President James Monroe in March 1825. Jackson was nominated for president by the Tennessee legislature in October 1825, more than three years before the 1828 election. It was the earliest such nomination in presidential history, and it attested to the fact that Jackson's supporters began the 1828 campaign almost as soon as the 1824 campaign ended. Adams's presidency floundered, as his ambitious agenda faced defeat in a new era of mass politics. Critics led by Jackson attacked Adams's policies as a dangerous expansion of federal power. Senator Martin Van Buren, who had been a prominent supporter of Crawford in the 1824 election, emerged as one of the strongest opponents of Adams's policies, and he settled on Jackson as his preferred candidate in the 1828 election. Jackson also won the support of Vice President John C. Calhoun, who opposed much of Adams's agenda on states' rights grounds. Van Buren and other Jackson allies established numerous pro-Jackson newspapers and clubs around the country, while Jackson made himself available to visitors at his Hermitage plantation. 1828 election results The 1828 campaign was very much a personal one. As was the custom at the time, neither candidate personally campaigned, but their political followers organized many campaign events. Jackson was attacked as a slave trader, and his conduct was attacked in pamphlets such as the Coffin Handbills. Rachel Jackson was also a frequent target of attacks, and was widely accused of bigamy, a reference to the controversial situation of her marriage with Jackson.First Lady Biography: Rachel Jackson National First Ladies Library. Web. Retrieved February 15, 2016. Despite the attacks, in the 1828 election, Jackson won a commanding 56 percent of the popular vote and 68 percent of the electoral vote, carrying most states outside of New England. Concurrent congressional elections also gave Jackson's allies nominal majorities in both houses of Congress, although many of those who campaigned as supporters of Jackson would diverge form Jackson during his presidency. The 1828 election marked the definitive end of the one-party \\"Era of Good Feelings\\", as the Democratic-Republican Party broke apart. Jackson's supporters coalesced into the Democratic Party, while Adams's followers became known as the National Republicans. Rachel had begun experiencing significant physical stress during the election season, and she died of a heart attack on December 22, 1828, three weeks after her husband's victory in the election. Jackson felt that the accusations from Adams's supporters had hastened her death, and he never forgave Adams. \\"May God Almighty forgive her murderers\\", Jackson swore at her funeral. \\"I never can.\\" Philosophy Jackson's name has been associated with Jacksonian democracy or the shift and expansion of democracy as political power shifted from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties. \\"The Age of Jackson\\" shaped the national agenda and American politics. Jackson's philosophy as president was similar to that of Thomas Jefferson, as he advocated republican values held by the Revolutionary War generation. He believed in the ability of the people to \\"arrive at right conclusions,\\" and he thought that they should have the right not only to elect but also to \\"instruct their agents & representatives.\\" He rejected the need for a powerful and independent Supreme Court, arguing that \\"the Congress, the Executive, and the Court must each or itself be guided by its own opinions of the Constitution.\\" Jackson thought that Supreme Court justices should be made to stand for election, and believed in strict constructionism as the best way to ensure democratic rule. He also called for term limits on presidents and the abolition of the Electoral College. Administration and cabinet Instead of choosing party leaders for his cabinet, Jackson chose \\"plain businessmen\\" whom he intended to control. For the key positions of Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury, Jackson chose two Northerners, Martin Van Buren of New York and Samuel Ingham of Pennsylvania. He appointed John Branch of North Carolina as Secretary of the Navy, John Macpherson Berrien of Georgia as Attorney General, and John Eaton of Tennessee, a friend and close political ally, as Secretary of War. Recognizing the growing importance of the Post Office, Jackson elevated the position of Postmaster General to the cabinet, and he named William T. Barry of Kentucky to lead the department. Of the six officials in Jackson's initial cabinet, only Van Buren was a major political figure in his own right. Jackson's cabinet choices were criticized from various quarters; Calhoun and Van Buren were both disappointed that their respective factions were not more prominent in the cabinet, while leaders from the state of Virginia and the region of New England complained about their exclusion. In addition to his official cabinet, Jackson would come to rely on an informal \\"Kitchen Cabinet\\" of advisers, including General William Berkeley Lewis and journalist Amos Kendall. Jackson's nephew, Andrew Jackson Donelson, served as the president's personal secretary, and Donelson's wife, Emily, acted as the White House hostess. Jackson inaugural cabinet suffered from bitter partisanship and gossip, especially between Eaton, Vice President John C. Calhoun, and Van Buren. By mid-1831, all except Barry (and Calhoun) had resigned. Governor Lewis Cass of the Michigan Territory became Secretary of War, ambassador and former Congressman Louis McLane of Delaware took the position of Secretary of the Treasury, Senator Edward Livingston of Louisiana became Secretary of State, and Senator Levi Woodbury of New Hampshire became Secretary of the Navy. Roger Taney, who had previously served as the Attorney General of Maryland, replaced Berrien as the U.S. Attorney General. In contrast to Jackson's initial choices, the cabinet members appointed in 1831 were prominent national leaders, none of whom were aligned with Calhoun. Outside of the cabinet, journalist Francis Preston Blair emerged as an influential adviser. At the start of his second term, Jackson transferred McLane to the position of Secretary of State, while William J. Duane replaced McLane as Secretary of the Treasury and Livingston became the ambassador to France. Due to his opposition to Jackson's removal of federal funds from the Second Bank of the United States, Duane was dismissed from the cabinet before the end of 1833. Taney became the new Secretary of the Treasury, while Benjamin F. Butler replaced Taney as Attorney General. Jackson was forced to shake up his cabinet again in 1834 after the Senate rejected Taney's nomination and McLane resigned. John Forsyth of Georgia was appointed Secretary of State, Mahlon Dickerson replaced Woodbury as Secretary of the Navy, and Woodbury became the fourth and final Secretary of the Treasury under Jackson. Jackson dismissed Barry in 1835 after numerous complaints about the latter's effectiveness as Postmaster General, and Jackson chose Amos Kendall as Barry's replacement. Judicial appointments Jackson appointed six Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States. Most were undistinguished. His first nominee was John McLean, a close ally of Calhoun's who had been Adams's Postmaster General. Because McLean was reluctant to make full use of his office's powers of patronage, Jackson delicately removed him from office with an appointment to the Supreme Court. McLean \\"turned Whig and forever schemed to win\\" the presidency. Jackson's next two appointees‚ÄìHenry Baldwin and James Moore Wayne‚Äìdisagreed with Jackson on some points but were poorly regarded even by Jackson's enemies. In reward for his services, Jackson nominated Taney to the Court to fill a vacancy in January 1835, but the nomination failed to win Senate approval. Chief Justice John Marshall died later that year, leaving two vacancies on the court. Jackson nominated Taney for Chief Justice and Philip Pendleton Barbour for Associate Justice, and both were confirmed by the new Senate. Taney served as Chief Justice until 1864, presiding over a court that upheld many of the precedents set by the Marshall Court. On the last full day of his presidency, Jackson nominated John Catron, who was confirmed. By the time Jackson left office, he had appointed a majority of the sitting members of the Supreme Court, the only exceptions being Joseph Story and Smith Thompson. Jackson also appointed eighteen judges to the United States district courts. Inauguration Jackson's first inauguration, on March 4, 1829, was the first time in which the ceremony was held on the East Portico of the United States Capitol.http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/pihtml/pinotable.html Inaugurals of Presidents of the United States: Some Precedents and Notable Events. Library of Congress. Due to the acrimonious campaign and mutual antipathy, Adams did not attend Jackson's inauguration. Ten thousand people arrived in town for the ceremony, eliciting this response from Francis Scott Key: \\"It is beautiful; it is sublime!\\" Jackson was the first president to invite the public to attend the White House inaugural ball. Many poor people came to the inaugural ball in their homemade clothes and rough-hewn manners. The crowd became so large that the guards could not keep them out of the White House, which became so crowded with people that dishes and decorative pieces inside were broken. Jackson's raucous populism earned him the nickname \\"King Mob\\".Edwin A. Miles, \\"The First People's Inaugural1829.\\" Tennessee Historical Quarterly (1978): 293-307. in JSTOR Though numerous political disagreements had marked Adams's presidency and would continue during his own presidency, Jackson took office at a time when no major economic or foreign policy crisis faced the United States. He announced no clear policy goals in the months before Congress convened in December 1829, save for his desire to pay down the national debt. Petticoat affair Secretary of War John H. Eaton Jackson devoted a considerable amount of his time during his early years in office responding to what came to be known as the \\"Petticoat affair\\" or \\"Eaton affair.\\" Washington gossip circulated among Jackson's cabinet members and their wives, including Vice President Calhoun's wife Floride Calhoun, concerning Secretary of War Eaton and his wife Peggy Eaton. Salacious rumors held that Peggy, as a barmaid in her father's tavern, had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute. Some also accused the Eatons of having engaged in an adulterous affair while Peggy's previous husband, John B. Timberlake, was still living. Petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members, led by Floride Calhoun, refused to socialize with the Eatons. The cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all American women were at stake. They believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage. Historian Daniel Walker Howe argues that the actions of the cabinet wives reflected the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the woman's rights movement. Jackson refused to believe the rumors regarding Peggy Eaton, telling his cabinet that \\"She is as chaste as a virgin!\\" He was infuriated by those who, in attempting to drive the Eatons out, dared to tell him who he could and could not have in his cabinet. The affair also reminded him of similar attacks that had been made against his wife. Though he initially blamed Henry Clay for the controversy over Eaton, by the end of 1829 Jackson had come to believe that Vice President Calhoun had masterminded the dissension in his cabinet. The controversy over Eaton dragged on into 1830 and 1831, as the other cabinet wives continued to ostracize Eaton. Jackson's cabinet and closest advisers became polarized between Vice President Calhoun and Secretary of State Van Buren, a widower who remained on good terms with the Eatons. In early 1831, as the controversy continued unabated, Van Buren proposed that the entire cabinet resign, and the Petticoat Affair finally ended after Eaton stepped down in June 1831. With the sole exception of Postmaster General Barry, the other cabinet officials also left office, marking the first mass resignation of cabinet officials in U.S. history. Van Buren was rewarded with a nomination to the position of ambassador to Great Britain, but the Senate rejected his nomination. Calhoun, who cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate to defeat Van Buren's nomination, believed that the Senate vote would end Van Buren's career, but in fact it strengthened Van Buren's position with Jackson and many other Democrats. By cultivating the support of Jackson, Van Buren emerged from the Petticoat Affair as Jackson's heir apparent. Three decades later, biographer James Parton would write that \\"the political history of the United States, for the last thirty years, dates from the moment when the soft hand of Mr. Van Buren touched Mrs. Eaton's knocker.\\" Meanwhile, Jackson and Vice President Calhoun became increasingly alienated from one another. Following the Petticoat Affair, Jackson acquired the Globe newspaper to use as a weapon against the rumor mills.Meacham, pp. 171‚Äì75;Kirsten E. Wood, 'One Woman so Dangerous to Public Morals': Gender and Power in the Eaton Affair.\\" Journal of the Early Republic (1997): 237-275. in JSTOR Rotation in office and spoils system Jackson removed an unprecedented number of presidential appointees from office, though Thomas Jefferson had dismissed a smaller but still significant number of Federalists during his own presidency. Jackson believed that a rotation in office (the removal of governmental officials) was actually a democratic reform preventing nepotism, and that it made civil service responsible to the popular will. Reflecting this view, Jackson told Congress in December 1829, \\"In a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people, no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another.\\"David Resnick and Norman C. Thomas. \\"Reagan and Jackson: Parallels in Political Time.\\" Journal of Policy History 1#2 (1989): 181-205. Jackson rotated about 20% of federal office holders during his first term, some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes. The Post Office was most strongly affected by Jackson's rotation policy, but district attorneys, federal marshals, customs collectors, and other federal employees were also removed from office. Jackson's opponents labeled his appointments process a \\"spoils system,\\" arguing that he was primarily motivated by a desire to use government positions to reward supporters and build his own political strength. Because he believed that most public officials faced few challenges for their positions, Jackson dismissed the need for a meritocratic appointment policy. Many of Jackson's appointees, including Amos Kendall and Isaac Hill, were controversial, and many of those who Jackson removed from office were popular. Jackson's appointment policy also created political problems within his own coalition, as Calhoun, Van Buren, Eaton, and others clashed over various appointments. His appointments encountered some resistance in the Senate, and by the end of his presidency, Jackson had had more nominees rejected than all previous presidents combined. In an effort to purge the government from the alleged corruption of previous administrations, Jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive cabinet offices and departments. His administration conducted a high-profile prosecution against Tobias Watkins, the Auditor at the Treasury Department during Adams's presidency. John Neal, a friend of Watkins and critic of Jackson, said that this prosecution served to \\"feed fat his ancient grudge\\" and was \\"characteristic of that willful, unforgiving, inexorable man, who was made President by the war-cry.\\" He also asked Congress to reform embezzlement laws, reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions, and pass laws to prevent evasion of custom duties and improve government accounting. Despite these attempts at reform, historians believe Jackson's presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics. Supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of Washington, such as the New York Customs House, the Postal Service, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs proved to be difficult. However, some of the practices that later became associated with the spoils system, including the buying of offices, forced political party campaign participation, and collection of assessments, did not take place until after Jackson's presidency. Eventually, in the years after Jackson left office, presidents would remove appointees as a matter of course; while Jackson dismissed 45 percent of those who held office, Abraham Lincoln would dismiss 90 percent of those who had held office prior to the start of his presidency. Indian removal Indian tribes from their traditional territories, including the Trail of Tears. =Indian Removal Act= Prior to taking office, Jackson had spent much of his career fighting the Native Americans of the Southwest, and he considered Native Americans to be inferior to those who were descended from Europeans. His presidency marked a new era in Indian-Anglo American relations, as he initiated a policy of Indian removal. Previous presidents had at times supported removal or attempts to \\"civilize\\" the Native Americans, but had generally not made Native American affairs a top priority. By the time Jackson took office, approximately 100,000 Native Americans lived east of the Mississippi River within the United States, with most located in Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin Territory, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida Territory. Jackson prioritized removing Native Americans from the South, as he believed that the Native Americans of the Northwest could be \\"pushed back.\\" In his 1829 Annual Message to Congress, Jackson advocated for setting aside land west of the Mississippi River for Native American tribes; while he favored voluntary relocation, he also proposed that any Native Americans who did not relocate would lose their independence and be subject to state laws. A significant political movement, consisting largely of evangelical Christians and others from the North, rejected Indian removal and instead favored continuing efforts to \\"civilize\\" Native Americans. Overcoming opposition led by Senator Theodore Frelinghuysen, Jackson's allies won the passage of the Indian Removal Act in May 1830. The bill passed the House by in a 102 to 97 vote, with most Southern congressmen voting for the bill and most Northern congressmen voting against it. The act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands farther west, outside of existing state borders. The act specifically pertained to the \\"Five Civilized Tribes\\" in the Southern United States, the conditions being that they could either move west or stay and obey state law. The Five Civilized Tribes consisted of the Cherokee, Muscogee (also known as the Creek), Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole Indians, all of whom had adopted aspects of European culture, including some degree of sedentary farming. =Cherokee= alt=White-haired man stands outdoors beside a tree with cane. With Jackson's support, Georgia and other states sought to extend their sovereignty over tribes within their borders, despite existing U.S. treaty obligations. Georgia's dispute with the Cherokee culminated in the 1832 Supreme Court decision of Worcester v. Georgia. In that decision, Chief Justice John Marshall, writing for the court, ruled that Georgia could not forbid whites from entering tribal lands, as it had attempted to do with two missionaries supposedly stirring up resistance among the tribespeople. The Supreme Court's ruling helped establish the doctrine of tribal sovereignty, but Georgia did not release the prisoners. Jackson is frequently attributed the following response: \\"John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it.\\" Remini argues that Jackson did not say it because, while it \\"certainly sounds like Jackson...[t]here was nothing for him to enforce.\\" The court had held that Georgia must release the prisoners, but it had not compelled the federal government to become involved. In late 1832, Van Buren intervened on behalf of the administration to put an end to the situation, convincing Georgia Governor Wilson Lumpkin to pardon the missionaries. As the Supreme Court was no longer involved, and the Jackson administration had no interest in interfering with Indian removal, the state of Georgia was free to extend its control over the Cherokee. In 1832, Georgia held a lottery to distribute Cherokee lands to white settlers. Under the leadership of Chief John Ross, most Cherokee refused to leave their homeland, but a group led by John Ridge and Elias Boudinot negotiated the Treaty of New Echota. In return for $5 million and land west of the Mississippi River, Ridge and Boudinot agreed to lead a faction of the Cherokee out of Georgia; a fraction of the Cherokee would leave in 1836. Many other Cherokee protested the treaty, but, by a narrow margin, the United States Senate voted to ratify the treaty in May 1836. The Treaty of New Echota was enforced by Jackson's successor, Van Buren; subsequently, as many as 4,000 out of 18,000 Cherokees died on the \\"Trail of Tears\\" in 1838. =Other tribes= Jackson, Eaton, and General John Coffee negotiated with the Chickasaw, who quickly agreed to move. Jackson put Eaton and Coffee in charge of negotiating with the Choctaw tribe. Lacking Jackson's skills at negotiation, they frequently bribed the chiefs in order to gain their submission. The Choctaw chiefs agreed to move with the signing of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. The removal of the Choctaw took place in the winter of 1831 and 1832, and was wrought with misery and suffering. Members of the Creek Nation signed the Treaty of Cusseta in 1832, allowing the Creek to either sell or retain their land. Conflict later erupted between the Creek who remained and the white settlers, leading to a second Creek War. The Creek uprising was quickly crushed by the army, and the remaining Creek were escorted across the Mississippi River. Of all the tribes in the Southeast, the Seminole proved to be the most resistant to mass relocation. The Jackson administration reached a removal treaty with a small group of Seminole, but the treaty was repudiated by the tribe. Jackson sent soldiers into Florida to remove the Seminole, marking the start of the Second Seminole War. The Second Seminole War dragged on until 1842, and hundreds of Seminole still remained in Florida after 1842. A shorter conflict broke out in the Northwest in 1832 after Chief Black Hawk led a band of Native Americans across the Mississippi River to their ancestral homeland in Illinois. A combination of the army and the Illinois militia drove out the Native Americans by the end of the year, bringing a close to the Black Hawk War. By the end of Jackson's presidency, nearly 50,000 Native Americans had moved across the Mississippi River, and Indian removal would continue after he left office. Nullification crisis and the tariff =First term= In 1828, Congress had approved the so-called \\"Tariff of Abominations\\", which set the tariff at a historically high rate. The tariff was popular in the Northeast and, to a lesser extent, the Northwest, since it protected domestic industries from foreign competition. Southern planters strongly opposed high tariff rates, as they resulted in higher prices for imported goods. This opposition to high tariff rates was especially intense in South Carolina, where the dominant planter class faced few checks on extremism. The South Carolina Exposition and Protest of 1828, secretly written by Calhoun, had asserted that their state could \\"nullify\\"‚Äîdeclare void‚Äîthe tariff legislation of 1828. Calhoun argued that, while the Constitution authorized the federal government to impose tariffs for the collection of revenue, it did not sanction tariffs that were designed to protect domestic production. Jackson sympathized with states' rights concerns, but he rejected the idea of nullification. In his 1829 Annual Message to Congress, Jackson advocated leaving the tariff in place until the national debt was paid off. He also favored a constitutional amendment that would, once the national debt was paid off, distribute surplus revenues from tariffs to the states. John C. Calhoun of South Carolina Calhoun was not as extreme as some within South Carolina, and he and his allies kept more radical leaders like Robert James Turnbull in check early in Jackson's presidency. As the Petticoat Affair strained relations between Jackson and Calhoun, South Carolina nullifiers became increasingly strident in their opposition to the \\"Tariff of Abominations.\\" Relations between the Jackson and Calhoun reached a breaking point in May 1830, after Jackson discovered a letter that indicated that then-Secretary of War Calhoun had asked President Monroe to censure Jackson for his invasion of Spanish Florida in 1818. Jackson's adviser, William Lewis, acquired the letter from William Crawford, a former Monroe cabinet official who was eager to help Van Buren at the expense of Calhoun. Jackson and Calhoun began an angry correspondence which lasted until July 1830. By the end of 1831, an open break had emerged not just between Calhoun and Jackson but also between their respective supporters. Writing in the early 1830s, Calhoun claimed that three parties existed. One party (led by Calhoun himself) favored free trade, one party (led by Henry Clay) favored protectionism, and one party (led by Jackson) occupied a middle position. Believing that Calhoun was leading a conspiracy to undermine his administration, Jackson built a network of informants in South Carolina and prepared for a possible insurrection. He also threw his support behind a tariff reduction bill that he believed would defuse the nullification issue. In May 1832, Representative John Quincy Adams introduced a slightly revised version of the bill, which Jackson accepted, and it was passed into law in July 1832. The bill failed to satisfy many in the South, and a majority of southern Congressmen voted against it, but passage of the Tariff of 1832 prevented tariff rates from becoming a major campaign issue in the 1832 election. =Crisis= Seeking to compel a further reduction in tariff rates and bolster the ideology of states' rights, South Carolina leaders prepared to follow through on their nullification threats after the 1832 election. In November 1832, South Carolina held a state convention that declared the tariff rates of 1828 and 1832 to be void within the state, and further declared that federal collection of import duties would be illegal after January 1833. After the convention, the South Carolina Legislature elected Calhoun to the U.S. Senate, replacing Robert Y. Hayne, who had resigned to become that state's governor. Hayne had often struggled to defend nullification on the floor of the Senate, especially against fierce criticism from Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts. In his December 1832 Annual Message to Congress, Jackson called for another reduction of the tariff, but he also vowed to suppress any rebellion. Days later, Jackson issued his Proclamation to the People of South Carolina, which strongly denied the right of states to nullify federal laws or secede.Jackson ordered the unionist South Carolina leader, Joel Roberts Poinsett, to organize a posse to suppress any rebellion, and promised Poinsett that 50,000 soldiers would be dispatched if any rebellion did break out. At the same time, Governor Hayne asked for volunteers for the state militia, and 25,000 men volunteered. Jackson's nationalist stance split the Democratic Party and set off a national debate over nullification. Outside of South Carolina, no Southern states endorsed nullification, but many also expressed opposition to Jackson's threat to use force. Democratic Congressman Gulian C. Verplanck introduced a tariff reduction bill in the House of Representatives that would restore the tariff levels of the Tariff of 1816, and South Carolina leaders decided to delay the onset of nullification while Congress considered a new tariff bill. As the debate over the tariff continued, Jackson asked Congress to pass a \\"Force Bill\\" explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the government's power to collect import duties. Though the House effort to write a new tariff bill collapsed, Clay initiated Senate consideration of the topic by introducing his own bill. Clay, the most prominent protectionist in the country, worked with Calhoun's allies rather than Jackson's allies to pass the bill. He won Calhoun's approval for a bill that provided for gradual tariff reductions until 1843, with tariff rates ultimately reaching levels similar to those proposed in the Verplanck bill. Southern leaders would have preferred lower rates, but they accepted Clay's bill as the best compromise they could achieve at that point in time. The Force Bill, meanwhile, passed both houses of Congress; many Southern congressmen opposed the bill but did not vote against it in an effort to expedite consideration of the tariff bill. Clay's tariff bill received significant support across partisan and sectional lines, and it passed 149‚Äì47 in the House and 29‚Äì16 in the Senate. Despite his intense anger over the scrapping of the Verplanck bill and the new alliance between Clay and Calhoun, Jackson saw the tariff bill as an acceptable way to end the crisis. He signed both the Tariff of 1833 and the Force Bill into law on March 2. Simultaneous passage of the Force Bill and the tariff allowed both the nullifiers and Jackson to claim that they had emerged victorious from the confrontation. Despite his earlier support for a similar measure, Jackson vetoed a third bill that would have distributed tariff revenue to the states. The South Carolina Convention met and rescinded its nullification ordinance, and, in a final show of defiance, nullified the Force Bill. Though the nullifiers had largely failed in their quest to lower tariff rates, they established firm control over South Carolina in the aftermath of the Nullification Crisis. Bank War and 1832 re-election =First term= devil's Bank The Second Bank of the United States (\\"national bank\\") had been chartered under President James Madison to restore an economy devastated by the War of 1812, and President Monroe had appointed Nicholas Biddle as the national bank's executive in 1822. The national bank operated branches in several states, and granted these branches a large degree of autonomy. The national bank's duties included storing government funds, issuing banknotes, selling Treasury securities, facilitating foreign transactions, and extending credit to businesses and other banks. The national bank also played an important role in regulating the money supply, which consisted of government-issued coins and privately issued banknotes. By presenting private banknotes for redemption (exchange for coins) to their issuers, the national bank limited the supply of paper money in the country. By the time Jackson took office, the national bank had approximately $35 million in capital, which represented more than twice the annual expenditures of the U.S. government. The national bank had not been a major issue in the 1828 election, but some in the country, including Jackson, despised the institution, The national bank's stock was mostly held by foreigners, Jackson insisted, and it exerted an undue amount of control over the political system. Jackson had developed a life-long hatred for banks earlier in his career, and he wanted to remove all banknotes from circulation. In his address to Congress in 1830, Jackson called for the abolition of the national bank. Senator Thomas Hart Benton, a strong supporter of the president despite a brawl years earlier, gave a speech strongly denouncing the Bank and calling for open debate on its recharter, but Senator Daniel Webster led a motion that narrowly defeated the resolution. Seeking to reconcile with the Jackson administration, Biddle appointed Democrats to the boards of national bank branches and worked to speed up the retirement of the national debt. Though Jackson and many of his allies detested the national bank, others within the Jacksonian coalition, including Eaton and Senator Samuel Smith, supported the institution. Despite some misgivings, Jackson supported a plan proposed in late 1831 by his moderately pro-national bank Treasury Secretary Louis McLane, who was secretly working with Biddle. McLane's plan would recharter a reformed version of the national bank in a way that would free up funds, partly through the sale of government stock in the national bank. The funds would in turn be used to strengthen the military or pay off the nation's debt. Over the objections of Attorney General Taney, an irreconcilable opponent of the national bank, Jackson allowed McLane to publish a Treasury Report which essentially recommended rechartering the national bank. Hoping to make the national bank a major issue in the 1832 election, Clay and Webster urged Biddle to immediately apply for recharter rather than wait to reach a compromise with the administration. Biddle received advice to the contrary from moderate Democrats such as McLane and William Lewis, who argued that Biddle should wait because Jackson would likely veto the recharter bill. In January 1832, Biddle submitted to Congress a renewal of the national bank's charter without any of McLane's proposed reforms. In May 1832, after months of congressional debate, Biddle assented to a revised bill that would re-charter the national bank but give Congress and the president new powers in controlling the institution, while also limiting the national bank's ability to hold real estate and establish branches. The recharter bill passed the Senate on June 11 and the House on July 3, 1832. When Van Buren met Jackson on July 4, Jackson declared, \\"The Bank, Mr. Van Buren, is trying to kill me. But I will kill it.\\" Jackson officially vetoed the bill on July 10. His veto message, crafted primarily by Taney, Kendall, and Andrew Jackson Donelson, attacked the national bank as an agent of inequality that supported only the wealthy. He also noted that, as the national bank's charter would not expire for another four years, the next two Congresses would be able to consider new re-chartering bills. Jackson's political opponents castigated the veto as \\"the very slang of the leveller and demagogue\\", claiming Jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man. =1832 election= In the years leading up to the 1832 election, it was unclear whether Jackson, frequently in poor health, would seek re-election. However, Jackson announced his intention to seek re-election in 1831. Various individuals were considered as possible Democratic vice presidential nominees in the 1832 election, including Van Buren, Judge Philip Pendleton Barbour, Treasury Secretary McLane, Senator William Wilkins, Associate Justice John McLean, and even Calhoun. In order to agree on a national ticket, the Democrats held their first national convention in May 1832. Van Buren emerged as Jackson's preferred running mate after the Eaton affair, and the former Secretary of State won the vice presidential nomination on the first ballot of the 1832 Democratic National Convention. Later that year, on December 28, resigned as Vice President, after having been elected to the U.S. Senate. In the 1832 election, Jackson would face a divided opposition in the form of the Anti-Masonic Party and the National Republicans. Since the disappearance and possible murder of William Morgan in 1827, the Anti-Masonic Party had emerged by capitalizing on opposition to Freemasonry. In 1830, a meeting of Anti-Masons called for the first national nominating convention, and in September 1831 the fledgling party nominated a national ticket led by William Wirt of Maryland. In December 1831, the National Republicans convened and nominated a ticket led by Henry Clay. Clay had rejected overtures from the Anti-Masonic Party, and his attempt to convince Calhoun to serve as his running mate failed, leaving the opposition to Jackson split among different leaders. For vice president, the National Republicans nominated John Sergeant, who had served as an attorney for both the Second Bank of the United States and the Cherokee Nation. 1832 election results The political struggle over the national bank emerged as the major issue of the 1832 campaign, although the tariff and especially Indian removal were also important issues in several states. National Republicans also focused on the Jackson's alleged executive tyranny; one cartoon described the president as \\"King Andrew the First.\\" At Biddle's direction, the national bank poured thousands of dollars into the campaign to defeat Jackson, seemingly confirming Jackson's view that it interfered in the political process. On July 21, Clay said privately, \\"The campaign is over, and I think we have won the victory.\\" Jackson, however, managed to successfully portray his veto of the national bank recharter as a defense of the common man against governmental tyranny. Clay proved to be no match for Jackson's popularity and the Democratic Party's skillful campaigning. Jackson won the election by a landslide, receiving 54 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes. Nationwide, Jackson won 54.2 percent of the popular vote, a slight decline from his 1828 popular vote victory. Jackson won 88 percent of the popular vote in the states south of Kentucky and Maryland, and Clay did not win a single vote in Georgia, Alabama, or Mississippi. Clay received 37 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes, while Wirt received eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes. The South Carolina legislature awarded the state's electoral votes to states' rights advocate John Floyd. Despite Jackson's victory in the presidential election, his allies lost control of the Senate. =Removal of deposits and censure= Jackson's victory in the 1832 election meant that he could veto an extension of the national bank's charter before that charter expired in 1836. Though a congressional override of his veto was unlikely, Jackson still wanted to ensure that the national bank would be abolished. His administration was unable to legally remove federal deposits from the national bank unless the Secretary of the Treasury issued an official finding that the national bank was a fiscally unsound institution, but the national bank was clearly solvent. In January 1833, at the height of the Nullification Crisis, Congressman James K. Polk introduced a bill that would provide for the removal the federal government's deposits from the national bank, but it was quickly defeated. Following the end of the Nullification Crisis in March 1833, Jackson renewed his offensive against the national bank, despite some opposition from within his own cabinet. Throughout mid-1833, Jackson made preparations to remove federal deposits from the national bank, sending Amos Kendall to meet with the leaders of various banks to see whether they would accept federal deposits. Jackson ordered Secretary of the Treasury William Duane to remove existing federal deposits from the national bank, but Duane refused to issue a finding that the federal government's deposits in the national bank were unsafe. In response, Jackson replaced Duane with Roger Taney, who received an interim appointment. Rather than removing existing deposits from the national bank, Taney and Jackson pursued a new policy in which the government would deposit future revenue elsewhere, while paying all expenses from its deposits with the national bank. The Jackson administration placed government deposits in a variety of state banks which were friendly to the administration's policies; critics labeled these banks as \\"pet banks.\\" Biddle responded to the withdrawals by stockpiling the national bank's reserves and contracting credit, thus causing interest rates to rise. Intended to force Jackson into a compromise, the move backfired, increasing sentiment against the national bank. The transfer of large amounts of bank deposits, combined with rising interest rates, contributed to the onset of a financial panic in late 1833. When Congress reconvened in December 1833, it immediately became embroiled in the controversy regarding the withdrawals from the national bank and the subsequent financial panic. Neither the Democrats nor the anti-Jacksonians exercised complete control of either house of Congress, but the Democrats were stronger in the House of Representatives while the anti-Jacksonians were stronger in the Senate. Senator Clay introduced a measures to censure Jackson for unconstitutionally removing federal deposits from the national bank, and in March 1834, the Senate voted to censure Jackson in a 26‚Äì20 vote. It also rejected Taney as Treasury Secretary, forcing Jackson to find a different treasury secretary; he eventually nominated Levi Woodbury, who won confirmation. Led by Polk, the House declared on April 4, 1834, that the national bank \\"out not to be rechartered\\" and that the depositions \\"ought not to be restored.\\" The House also voted to allow the pet banks to continue to serve as places of deposit, and sought to investigate whether the national bank had deliberately instigated the financial panic. By mid-1834, the relatively mild panic had ended, and Jackson's opponents had failed to recharter the national bank or reverse Jackson's removals. The national bank's federal charter expired in 1836, and though Biddle's institution continued to function under a Pennsylvania charter, it never regained the influence it had had at the beginning of Jackson's administration. Following the loss of the national bank's federal charter, New York City supplanted Philadelphia (the national bank's headquarters) as the nation's financial capital. In January 1837, when the Jacksonians had a majority in the Senate, the censure was expunged after years of effort by Jackson supporters. Rise of the Whig Party Henry Clay of Kentucky Clear partisan affiliations had not formed at the start of Jackson's presidency. He had supporters in the Northwest, the Northeast, and the South, all of whom had different positions on different issues. The Nullification Crisis briefly scrambled the partisan divisions that had emerged after 1824, as many within the Jacksonian coalition opposed his threats of force, while some opposition leaders like Daniel Webster supported them. Jackson's removal of the government deposits in late 1833 ended any possibility of a Webster-Jackson alliance and helped to solidify partisan lines. Jackson's threats to use force during the Nullification Crisis and his alliance with Van Buren motivated many Southern leaders to leave the Democratic Party, while opposition to Indian removal and Jackson's actions in the Bank War spurred opposition from many in the North. Attacking the president's \\"executive usurpation,\\" those opposed to Jackson coalesced into the Whig Party. The Whig label implicitly compared \\"King Andrew\\" to King George III, the King of Great Britain at the time of the American Revolution. The National Republicans, including Clay and Webster, formed the core of the Whig Party, but many Anti-Masons like William H. Seward of New York and Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania also joined. Several prominent Democrats defected to the Whigs, including former Attorney General John Berrien, Senator Willie Person Mangum of North Carolina, and John Tyler of Virginia. Even John Eaton, the former Secretary of War, became a member of the Whig Party. Beginning in December 1833, voting behavior in Congress began to be dominated by partisan affiliation. By the time of the 1836 presidential election, Whigs and Democrats had established state parties throughout the country, though party strength varied by state and many of Jackson's opponents in the Deep South eschewed the Whig label. While Democrats openly embraced partisanship and campaigning, many Whigs only reluctantly accepted the new system of party politics, and they lagged behind the Democrats in establishing national organizations and cross-sectional unity. Along with the Democrats, the Whigs were one of the two major parties of the Second Party System, which would extend into the 1850s. Calhoun's nullifiers did not fit neatly into either party, and they pursued alliances with both major parties at various times. Panic of 1837 alt=Political cartoon showing people suffering from economic trouble The national economy boomed after mid-1834 as state banks liberally extended credit. Due in part to the booming economy, Jackson paid off the entire national debt in January 1835, the only time in U.S. history that that has been accomplished. In the aftermath of the Bank War, Jackson asked Congress to pass a bill to regulate the pet banks. Jackson sought to restrict the issuance of paper banknotes under $5, and also to require banks to hold specie (gold or silver coins) equal to one fourth of the value of banknotes they issued. As Congress did not act on this proposal by the end of its session in March 1835, Secretary of the Treasury Woodbury forced the pet banks to accept restrictions similar to those that Jackson had proposed to Congress. The debate over financial regulation became tied to a debate over the disposition of the federal budget surplus and proposals to increase the number of pet banks. In June 1836, Congress passed a bill that doubled the number of pet banks, distributed surplus federal revenue to the states, and instituted Jackson's proposed bank regulations. Jackson considered vetoing the bill primarily due to his opposition to the distribution of federal revenue, but he ultimately decided to let it pass into law. As the number of pet banks increased from 33 to 81, regulation of the government's deposits became more difficult, and lending increased. The growing number of loans contributed to a boom in land prices and land sales; the General Land Office sold 12.5 million acres of public land in 1835, compared to 2 million acres in 1829. Seeking to curb land speculation, Jackson issued the Specie Circular, an executive order that required buyers of government lands to pay in specie. The Specie Circular undermined the public's trust in the value of paper money; Congress passed a bill to revoke Jackson's policy, but Jackson vetoed that bill on his last day in office. The period of good economic conditions ended with the onset of the Panic of 1837. Jackson's Specie Circular, albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy, left many investors unable to afford to pay loans in gold and silver. The same year there was a downturn in Great Britain's economy, resulting in decreased foreign investment in the United States. As a result, the U.S. economy went into a depression, banks became insolvent, the national debt increased, business failures rose, cotton prices dropped, and unemployment dramatically increased. The depression that followed lasted until 1841, when the economy began to rebound. Other domestic issues =Internal improvements= In the years before Jackson had taken office, the idea of using federal funding to build or improve internal improvements (such as roads and canals) had become increasingly popular. Jackson had campaigned against Adams's support for federally funded infrastructure projects, but, unlike some states' rights supporters, Jackson believed that such projects were constitutional so long as they aided the national defense or improved the national economy. The National Road was one of the major infrastructure projects worked on during Jackson's presidency, and his tenure saw the National Road extended from Ohio into Illinois. In May 1830, the House passed a bill to create the Maysville Road, which would link the National Road to the Natchez Trace via Lexington, Kentucky. With the strong support of Van Buren, Jackson vetoed the bill, arguing that the project was too localized for the federal government to become involved. Jackson further warned that government expenditures on infrastructure would be costly and threatened his goal of retiring the national debt. The veto shored up Jackson's support among pro-states' rights \\"Old Republicans\\" like John Randolph, but angered some Jacksonians who favored internal improvements. Despite the Maysville Road Veto, federal funding for infrastructure projects increased substantially during Jackson's presidency, reaching a total greater than all previous administrations combined. Because of a booming economy and high levels of federal revenues, the Jackson administration was able to retire the national debt even while spending on infrastructure projects increased. =Slavery controversies= A slaveowner himself, Jackson favored the expansion of slavery into the territories and disapproved of anti-slavery agitation. Though slavery was not a major issue of Jackson's presidency, two notable controversies related to the issue of slavery arose while he was in the White House. In 1835, the American Anti-Slavery Society launched a mail campaign against the peculiar institution. Tens of thousands of antislavery pamphlets and tracts were sent to Southern destinations through the U.S. mail. Across the South, reaction to the abolition mail campaign bordered on apoplexy. In Congress, Southerners demanded the prevention of delivery of the tracts, and Jackson moved to placate Southerners in the aftermath of the Nullification Crisis. Postmaster General Amos Kendall gave Southern postmasters discretionary powers to discard the tracts, a decision that abolitionists attacked as suppression of free speech.Bertram Wyatt-Brown, \\"The Abolitionists' Postal Campaign of 1835,\\" Journal of Negro History (1965) 50#4 pp. 227-238 in JSTOR Another conflict over slavery in 1835 ensued when abolitionists sent the U.S. House of Representatives petitions to end the slave trade and slavery in Washington, D.C. These petitions infuriated pro- slavery Southerners, who attempted to prevent acknowledgement or discussion of the petitions. Northern Whigs objected that anti-slavery petitions were constitutional and should not be forbidden. South Carolina Representative Henry L. Pinckney introduced a resolution that denounced the petitions as \\"sickly sentimentality\\", declared that Congress had no right to interfere with slavery, and tabled all further anti-slavery petitions. Southerners in Congress, including many of Jackson's supporters, favored the measure (the 21st Rule, commonly called the \\"gag rule\\"), which was passed quickly and without any debate, thus temporarily suppressing abolitionist activities in Congress. Two other important slavery-related development occurred while Jackson was in office. In January 1831, William Lloyd Garrison established The Liberator, which emerged as the most influential abolitionist newspaper in the country. While many slavery opponents sought the gradual emancipation of all slaves, Garrison called for the immediate abolition of slavery throughout the country. Garrison also established the American Anti-Slavery Society, which grew to approximately 250,000 members by 1838. In the same year that Garrison founded The Liberator, Nat Turner launched the largest slave rebellion in U.S. history. After killing dozens of whites in southeastern Virginia across two days, Turner's rebels were suppressed by a combination of vigilantes, the state militia, and federal soldiers. =U.S. Exploring Expedition= , a alt=Sketch of a ship with sails at sea Jackson initially opposed any federal exploratory scientific expeditions during his first term in office. Jackson's predecessor, President Adams, had attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration in 1828, but Congress was unwilling to fund the effort. When Jackson assumed office in 1829 he pocketed Adams' expedition plans. However, wanting to establish a presidential legacy similar to that of Jefferson, who had sponsored the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Jackson decided to support scientific exploration during his second term. On May 18, 1836, Jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic United States Exploring Expedition. Jackson put Secretary of the Navy Mahlon Dickerson in charge of planning the expedition, but Dickerson proved unfit for the task, and the expedition was not launched until 1838. One brig ship, , later used in the expedition; having been commissioned by Secretary Dickerson in May 1836, circumnavigated the world and explored and mapped the Southern Ocean, confirming the existence of the continent of Antarctica. =Administrative reforms= Jackson presided over several reforms in the executive branch.Leonard D. White, The Jacksonians. A study in administrative history, 1829-1861 (1954) pp 1-84. Postmaster General Amos Kendall reorganized the Post Office and successfully pushed for the Post Office Act of 1836, which made the Post Office a department of the executive branch. Under Commissioner Ethan Allen Brown, the General Land Office was reorganized and expanded to accommodate the growing demand for public land. The Patent Office was also reorganized and expanded under the leadership of Henry Leavitt Ellsworth. After his request to divide the State Department into two departments was rebuffed, Jackson divided the State Department into eight bureaus. Jackson also presided over the establishment of the Office of Indian Affairs, which coordinated Indian removal and other policies related to Native Americans. By signing the Judiciary Act of 1837, Jackson played a role in extending the circuit courts to several western states. =States admitted to the Union= Two new states were admitted into the Union during Jackson's presidency: Arkansas (June 15, 1836) and Michigan (January 26, 1837). Both states increased Democratic power in Congress and voted for Van Buren in 1836. Foreign affairs William C. Rives successfully negotiated payments that France owed the U.S. for damages caused by Napoleon. =Spoliation and commercial treaties= Foreign affairs under Jackson were generally uneventful prior to 1835.John M. Belohlavek, Let the Eagle Soar!: The Foreign Policy of Andrew Jackson (1985)John M. Belohlavek, \\"'Let the Eagle Soar!': Democratic Constraints on the Foreign Policy of Andrew Jackson.\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly 10#1 (1980) pp: 36-50 in JSTOR His administration's foreign policy focused on expanding trade opportunities for American commerce. The Jackson administration negotiated a trade agreement with Great Britain that opened the British West Indies and Canada to American exports, though the British refused to allow American ships to engage in the West Indian carrying trade. The agreement with Britain, which had been sought by previous presidents, represented a major foreign policy success for Jackson. The State Department also negotiated routine trade agreements with Russia, Spain, the Ottoman Empire, and Siam. American exports (chiefly cotton) increased 75%, while imports increased 250%. Jackson increased funding to the navy and used it to defend American commercial interests in far-flung areas such as the Falkland Islands and Sumatra. A second major foreign policy emphasis in the Jackson administration was the settlement of spoliation claims. The most serious crisis involved a debt that France owed for the damage Napoleon had done two decades earlier. France agreed to pay the debt, but kept postponing payment. Jackson made warlike gestures, while domestic political opponents ridiculed his bellicosity. Jackson's Minister to France William C. Rives finally obtained the ‚Ç£ 25,000,000 francs involved (about $5,000,000) in 1836.Robert Charles Thomas, \\"Andrew Jackson Versus France American Policy toward France, 1834-36.\\" Tennessee Historical Quarterly (1976): 51-64 in JSTORRichard Aubrey McLemore, \\"The French Spoliation Claims, 1816-1836: A Study in Jacksonian Diplomacy,\\" Tennessee Historical Magazine (1932): 234-254 in JSTOR. The Department of State also settled smaller spoliation claims with Denmark, Portugal, and Spain. =Recognition of Republic of Texas= Jackson believed that Adams had bargained away rightfully American territory in the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty, and he sought to expand the United States west. He continued Adams's policy of attempting to purchase the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas, which Mexico continued to rebuff. Upon gaining independence, Mexico had invited American settlers to that underdeveloped province, and 35,000 American settlers moved to the state between 1821 and 1835. Most of the settlers came from the Southern United States, and many of these settlers brought slaves with them. In 1830, fearing that the state was becoming a virtual extension of the United States, Mexico banned immigration into Coahuila y Tejas. Chafing under Mexican rule, the American settlers became increasingly dissatisfied. In 1835, American settlers in Texas, along with local Tejanos, fought a war for independence against Mexico. Texan leader Stephen F. Austin sent a letter to Jackson pleading for an American military intervention, but the United States remained neutral in the conflict. By May 1836, the Texans had routed the Mexican military, establishing an independent Republic of Texas. The new Texas government sought recognition from President Jackson and annexation into the United States.Ethel Zivley Rather, \\"Recognition of the Republic of Texas by the United States.\\" The Quarterly of the Texas State Historical Association 13#3 (1910): 155-256. in JSTOR Antislavery elements in the U.S. strongly opposed annexation because of slavery's presence in Texas.Frederick Merk, Slavery and the Annexation of Texas (1972).Michael A. Morrison, Slavery and the American West: The Eclipse of Manifest Destiny (2000). Jackson was reluctant to recognize Texas, as he was unconvinced that the new republic would maintain its independence from Mexico and did not want to make Texas an anti-slavery issue during the 1836 election. After the 1836 election, Jackson formally recognized the Republic of Texas, and nominated Alc√©e Louis la Branche as charg√© d'affaires. Attack and assassination attempt Richard Lawrence's attempt on Jackson's life, as depicted in an 1835 etching alt=Several people in a crowd, man aims a gun at Jackson On January 30, 1835, the first attempt to kill a sitting president occurred just outside the United States Capitol. When Jackson was leaving through the East Portico after a funeral, Richard Lawrence, an unemployed house painter from England, aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired. Lawrence then pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired, possibly due to the humid weather. Jackson, infuriated, attacked Lawrence with his cane, and others present restrained and disarmed Lawrence. Lawrence said that he was a deposed English king and that Jackson was his clerk. He was deemed insane and was institutionalized. Jackson initially suspected that a number of his political enemies might have orchestrated the attempt on his life, but his suspicions were never proven. Presidential election of 1836 1836 electoral vote results Jackson declined to seek a third term in 1836, instead throwing his support behind his chosen successor, Vice President Van Buren. With Jackson's support, Van Buren won the presidential nomination of the Democratic Convention without opposition. Two names were put forward for the vice-presidential nomination: Representative Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky, and former senator William Cabell Rives of Virginia. Southern Democrats, as well as Van Buren, strongly preferred Rives, but Jackson strongly preferred Johnson. Again, Jackson's considerable influence prevailed, and Johnson received the required two-thirds vote after New York Senator Silas Wright prevailed upon non-delegate Edward Rucker to cast the 15 votes of the absent Tennessee delegation in Johnson's favor. Van Buren's competitors in the election of 1836 were three members of the newly established Whig Party, still a loose coalition bound by mutual opposition to Jackson's Bank War. The Whigs ran several regional candidates in hopes of sending the election to the House of Representatives, where each state delegation would have one vote and the Whigs would stand a better chance of winning. Senator Hugh Lawson White of Tennessee emerged as the main Whig nominee in the South. White ran against the Force Bill, Jackson's actions in the Bank War, and Van Buren's unpopularity in the South. William Henry Harrison, who had gained national fame for his role in the Battle of Tippecanoe, established himself as the main Whig candidate in the North, although Daniel Webster also had the support of some Northern Whigs. Van Buren won the election with 764,198 popular votes, 50.9 percent of the total, and 170 electoral votes. Harrison led the Whigs with 73 electoral votes, while White received 26, and Webster 14. Willie Person Mangum received the 11 electoral votes of South Carolina, which were awarded by the state legislature. Van Buren's victory resulted from a combination of his own attractive political and personal qualities, Jackson's popularity and endorsement, the organizational power of the Democratic party, and the inability of the Whig Party to muster an effective candidate and campaign. Historical reputation Equestrian statue of Gen. Jackson, Jackson County Courthouse, Kansas City, Missouri, commissioned by Judge Harry S. Truman Jackson remains one of the most studied and controversial figures in American history. Historian Charles Grier Sellers says, \\"Andrew Jackson's masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the American stage.\\" There has never been universal agreement on Jackson's legacy, for \\"his opponents have ever been his most bitter enemies, and his friends almost his worshippers.\\" He was always a fierce partisan, with many friends and many enemies. He has been lauded as the champion of the common man, while criticized for his treatment of Indians and for other matters. According to early biographer James Parton: In the 20th century, Jackson was written about by many admirers. Arthur M. Schlesinger's Age of Jackson (1945) depicts Jackson as a man of the people battling inequality and upper-class tyranny. From the 1970s to the 1980s, Robert Remini published a three-volume biography of Jackson followed by an abridged one- volume study. Remini paints a generally favorable portrait of Jackson. He contends that Jacksonian democracy \\"stretches the concept of democracy about as far as it can go and still remain workable. ... As such it has inspired much of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in American history‚ÄîPopulism, Progressivism, the New and Fair Deals, and the programs of the New Frontier and Great Society.\\" To Remini, Jackson serves as \\"the embodiment of the new American...This new man was no longer British. He no longer wore the queue and silk pants. He wore trousers, and he had stopped speaking with a British accent.\\" However, other 20th-century writers such as Richard Hofstadter and Bray Hammond depict Jackson as an advocate of the sort of laissez-faire capitalism that benefits the rich and oppresses the poor. Brands observes that Jackson's reputation declined after the mid-20th century as his actions towards Indians and African Americans received new attention. After the Civil Rights Movement, Brand writes, \\"his unrepentant ownership of slaves marked him as one to be censured rather than praised.\\" Further, \\"By the turn of the present [21st] century, it was scarcely an exaggeration to say that the one thing American schoolchildren learned about Jackson was that he was the author of the Trail of Tears.\\" Starting mainly around 1970, Jackson came under sharp attack from historians for his Indian removal policies. Howard Zinn called him \\"the most aggressive enemy of the Indians in early American history\\" and \\"exterminator of Indians.\\" By contrast, Remini claims that, if not for Jackson's policies, the Southern tribes would have been totally wiped out, just like other tribes-namely, the Yamasee, Mahican, and Narragansett‚Äìwhich did not move. Despite some criticism, Jackson's performance in office has generally been ranked in the top half in polls of historians and political scientists. His position in C-SPAN's poll of historians dropped from 13th in 2009 to 18th in 2017. Some associate this decline with the frequent praise Jackson has received from sitting President Donald Trump, who hung Jackson's official portrait in the Oval Office. A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association‚Äôs Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Jackson as the fifteenth best president.

Howells, born in Maerdy in Rhondda Valleys, played flanker at his nearest club Tylorstown RFC, before playing for Penygraig RFC. There he was noticed by Pontypridd RFC, and represented one of the top clubs in Wales in 1971. Coaching career =1990's= Having played for the club in 1971, Howells joined Pontypridd in 1991 as an assistant coach to Dennis John. Howells and John made a formidable coaching duo, bringing a number of silverware to the club for the first time since the late 70's. They guided Ponty to Cup and League Championship successes in 1996 and 1997, before Howells parted way with the club in 1998 to join Cardiff. At the same time, Kevin Bowring left his role as head coach of the Welsh national team, prompting the union to appoint Dennis John as an interim head coach for their 1998 tour of Southern Africa.Rugby Union: Wales call on John for the short term John brought Howells with him for the tour as an assistant, where they only managed to secure a single win out of the 6-match tour; a 49‚Äì11 victory over Zimbabwe. New Zealander Graham Henry was appointed as Wales' new head coach, and Howells was kept on by Henry as his assistant/forwards coach.Henry the great redeemer In April 1999, it was announced that Lynn Howells would leave his post at Pontypridd to take on the head coaching role at Cardiff.Rugby Union: Cardiff count cost of rebellion The start of the season saw the club lose 13 first choice players due to the 1999 Rugby World Cup, where Howells was also taking part in as assistant coach for Wales, the host country. Henry and Howells lead Wales to top of the Pool with victories over Argentina and Japan, but were defeated by Samoa. Wales were knocked out by the eventual Champions Australia in the quarter-finals, losing 24‚Äì9. Howells played a massive part in the preparations for the World Cup, creating a strong forward pack that beat South Africa for the first ever time, 29‚Äì19. Howells returned to Cardiff post World Cup and despite the sides poor start and failing to win in the first rounds of the 1999‚Äì2000 Heineken Cup, they progressed to the quarter-finals, where they were beaten by Llanelli 22‚Äì3. He guided the team to the Welsh/Scottish League title with three games remaining in season, while the season was also notable for a club record victory of 116‚Äì0 over Duvnant during the League. The club had gone unbeaten at home for almost the whole season, before losing 41‚Äì40 to Swansea in their very last game of the season, which was Cardiff's first defeat at the Arms Park for over two years, since 13 December 1997, again against Swansea. The following season saw Howells leave the side following an unsuccessful season. Howell's led the side to five Welsh/Scottish League matches in the first five rounds and led the side to home and away victories over English Premiership leaders Saracens in the 2000‚Äì01 Heineken Cup. However at the start of 2001, Cardiff lost all of their crucial matches, including a Heineken Cup quarter-final loss to Gloucester 21‚Äì15. A loss at home to Bridgend and later Ebbw Vale in the League, saw Cardiff fail to retain their title. =2000s= With Henry coaching the British and Irish Lions on their tour of Australia, Howells became caretaker coach of the national side for their 2001 test series against Japan. Wales won the test series 2‚Äì0, with a 64‚Äì10 win in the first test and a 53‚Äì30 win in the second. After the tour, Howells left the national set up, becoming head coach of Pontypridd. With Howells at the reign between 2001 and 2003, Ponty made it all the way to the final of the 2001‚Äì02 Parker Pen Shield in just his first season in charge. They were beaten by Sale Sharks 25‚Äì22 in the final, but later went onto secure the Welsh Cup title ahead of Llanelli. In 2003, the Welsh Rugby Union brought in regional rugby (Welsh Regional Rugby) which saw Pontypridd merge with Bridgend, forming the Celtic Warriors. Howell's was named Director of Rugby at the new side, where he guided the side to 4th in the 2003‚Äì04 Celtic League. In the 2003‚Äì04 Heineken Cup, they failed to get out of their group with losses to Perpignan home and away, though the Warriors did defeat Pool leaders and eventual champions, London Wasps, both home and away. On 1 June 2004, the club was disbanded by the union.WRU axe falls on Warriors Between 2004 and 2006, Howells coach in Italy, becoming Director of Rugby at Leonessa. They had recently earned promotion to the top Italian division, the Super 10, but failed to keep their place in the league during the 2004/05 season. In September 2006 Howells was appointed Head Coach of Edinburgh, and after leading the side to 8th in the 2006‚Äì07 Celtic League and bottom of their pool in the 2006‚Äì07 Heineken Cup, he was sacked in August 2007 after a management restructuring.Edinburgh back in union control He took up the head coach position at Doncaster Knights, leading them to 4th in the 2007‚Äì08 National Division One in his first season in charge. In the 4 years Howells was at the club, Doncaster failed to get much above the middle part of the table, and left the club at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 RFU Championship. On 14 January 2012 he was announced as the new manager of the Romanian national team. In November 2012, he became the head coach of Bucure»ôti Wolves, a role that comes with being head coach of the Romanian national team. He led the side to a 25‚Äì22 victory over French side Agen in the 2012‚Äì13 European Challenge Cup. During the 2013‚Äì14 European Challenge Cup, the Wolves picked up two victories, both coming home and away to Italian side Calvisano, although they did lose narrowly to Brive and Newcastle Falcons. At the 2014‚Äì15 European Rugby Challenge Cup, the side lost all six of their games for the first ever time, while in the 2015‚Äì16 European Rugby Challenge Cup they failed to qualify altogether, forcing the disbandment of the side.Howells plots Romania's course back to the glory days =Head coach of Romania= Lynn Howells attending a SuperLiga match between Steaua and CSM Baia Mare in 2017 After an unsuccessful 2012 end-of-year rugby union internationals, the then head coach of Romania Haralambie Dumitras resigned, with Howells taking over. His first match came in the first year of the 2012‚Äì14 European Nations Cup First Division, a narrow 19‚Äì13 win over Portugal, before securing wins against Russia, 29‚Äì14, Spain, 25‚Äì15 and Belgium, 32‚Äì14. On 16 March 13, they drew with Georgia, 9‚Äìall, the sides' first ever draw; however, Georgia claimed the title on point difference, +74 to +49. In June 2013, Romania clinched their second IRB Nations Cup with victories over Russia, Argentina XV and Italy A. During the 2013 end-of-year rugby union internationals, Howells led Romania to a 19‚Äì18 win over Tonga, a first ever meeting between the two nations, and a 21‚Äì20 win over Canada. A clean sweep was blocked by Fiji on 23 November, when the Flying Fijians won, 26‚Äì7. In the second year of the 2012‚Äì14 European Nations Cup First Division, Howells led Romania to a 24‚Äì0 victory over Portugal, followed by a 34‚Äì3 win over Russia, a 32‚Äì6 win over Spain and a 29‚Äì10 win over Belgium. Heading into the final match against Georgia, Romania were leading the table with 38 points; however, a 22‚Äì9 loss to the Lelos saw the Georgians take their third consecutive European Nations Cup title. Romania finished second to qualify as Europe 2 in the 2015 Rugby World Cup.2015 Rugby World Cup: Georgia and Romania qualify both book spots in tournament During the 2014 IRB Nations Cup, Romania finished second behind Emerging Ireland, who were the only side to beat Howells' men, 31‚Äì10. The 2014 end-of-year rugby union internationals saw Romania claim a single victory, coming in the final week of their campaign, an 18‚Äì9 win over Canada. Their losses came against the United States, 27‚Äì17, and Japan, 18‚Äì13. At the start of the 2014‚Äì16 European Nations Cup First Division, Romania picked up a 37‚Äì10 win over Portugal and a 29‚Äì8 win over Spain. However, on 28 February 2015, Romania lost to Russia, 16‚Äì13, for the first time since 2009, before defeating newly promoted side Germany, 17‚Äì12. On 21 March 2015, Romania failed to beat Georgia for the seventh consecutive time, losing, 15‚Äì6. A promising performance in the 2015 World Rugby Nations Cup gave the side a glimmer of hope heading into the World Cup later in the year, with a 35‚Äì9 win over Spain, a 43‚Äì3 win over Namibia and finally a convincing 23‚Äì0 win over Argentina XV. Ahead of the World Cup, Romania failed to win a single warm-up match, drawing with Yorkshire Carnegie 10‚Äìall, losing to Edinburgh 31‚Äì16 and in their only test match, losing to Tonga 21‚Äì16. During the World Cup, Romania performed well against France, in what was Romania's first Tier 1 opponent since England during the 2011 Rugby World Cup almost exactly 4 years before the French game. France downed Romania, 38‚Äì11, before Romania faced another Tier 1 side, Ireland, losing, 44‚Äì10. They earned their first World Cup win since the 2007 tournament defeating Canada 17‚Äì15, despite being 8‚Äì0 down at half time; a 78th-minute penalty by Florin Vlaicu sealed the win. Despite scoring 3 tries, Romania were defeated by Italy 32‚Äì22 in their final match of the tournament, seeing them finish fourth in their group. In the second leg of matches of the 2014‚Äì16 European Nations Cup First Division, Romania secured wins over Russia, Spain, Germany and Portugal, before losing to Georgia, 38‚Äì9, in their final match; a record winning margin for the Lelos. The 2016 World Rugby Nations Cup saw Romania claim their fourth title, after beating Argentina XV, 20‚Äì8, in the final. In the 2016 end-of-year rugby union internationals Romania had a vert successful campaign winning all three tests; 23‚Äì10 against the United States, 21‚Äì16 win over Canada and ended with a 36‚Äì10 victory over Uruguay. During the 2017 Rugby Europe Championship, Romania started with a first ever loss to Germany since 1938, losing 41‚Äì38. However, Romania went onto win all of their remaining matches; Spain 13‚Äì3, Russia 30‚Äì10, Belgium 33‚Äì17 and a first ever win over Georgia since 2010, 8‚Äì7. This was the first ever time Howells had led Romania to a victory over Georgia and to win the Antim Cup. Their victory also meant they won the Championship for the first ever time since 2010. In June 2017, Howells led Romania on their first June tour since June 2006, where they played two away games followed by a historic home game. Their tour started with a first visit to Japan since 2005, where they lost 33‚Äì21. The following week saw Canada host Romania for the first time, where Romania continued their winning streak, winning 25‚Äì9, a record winning margin for Romania against Canada. On 24 June, Romania became the first Tier 2 nation to play against Brazil, as Brazil had never played a test match against a team in a higher tier than them outside any tournament or competition. The test match was unsurprisingly won by Romania, winning 56‚Äì5 in a game that saw only forwards score tries, 8 in total.

A neutral panel found that Romania were guilty of breaching Regulation 8 and the panel determined that Romania would be deducted 5 points for each game they had fielded an ineligible player, regardless of if more than one ineligible player had been fielded. The investigation found that Romania had fielded ineligible players 6 times and therefore were deducted 30 points from the table, and effectively disqualifying them from the world cup - Romania now sat third across the two- year aggregate table and bottom of the 2018 Championship.MEDIA RELEASE - RWC-2019-QUALIFICATION-DISPUTE-JUDGMENT On 29 May 2018, Romania appealed the decision.Disciplinary update: Romania and Spain to appeal disputes committee outcomes On 6 June, the appeal failed and the decision was upheld meaning Russia was confirmed as Europe 1 and qualified for the World Cup, whilst Germany advanced to round 6.Independent Appeal Committee decision regarding Romania and Spain This meant Russia qualified for the World Cup ahead of Romania.

MRFU is part of the Mid-America Geographical Union (MAGU), which is of several Geographical Unions (GU's) that comprise USA Rugby.  History  Early History. The honor of creating the Missouri Rugby Football Union belongs largely to Harry Langenberg. In 1933 Harry arrived back in St. Louis after attending Princeton University, where he was introduced to rugby. Harry not only played rugby, but also served as an assistant coach for a school club. In St. Louis, Harry joined forces with Edmond St. John Hoogewerf and Hugo Walther to form the Missouri Rugby Football Union. Shortly after the formation of the Missouri Rugby Football Union, Harry founded the first club to become a member, the Ramblers. The Missouri Rugby Football Union is now one of the oldest of the 39 territorial unions operating within the USA Rugby Union, and one of the oldest sports organizations in the St. Louis area. The Ramblers Rugby Club is the second oldest surviving independent rugby club in the United States. The Ramblers were Missouri Rugby Football Union champions in 1947. Grand Rec. Grand Rec was the first team allowed to keep the Missouri Rugby Football Union trophy for winning the championship three years in a row, in 1950. During its last years a younger team, the Grand Rec Juniors, was formed and also played. After winning permanent possession of the championship trophy, Grand Rec disbanded, and the juniors became just Grand Rec. Paul Birchfield from Grand Rec became coach of the juniors, now Grand Rec, and coached them to a championship. Bill \\"Terrible\\" Turk was the only Grand Rec player who played on as a member of the juniors, now just Grand Rec. Among Grand Rec's original team was Rudy Bukich (see Wikipedia entry). All the Missouri Rugby Football Union games during this time were played on the pitch in Forest Park, St Louis, Missouri. During the original Grand Rec's reign the champion of the Missouri Rugby Football Union played Princeton for the Missouri Challenge Cup. This series was discontinued when Princeton returned the cup, after having won the game the previous year, saying the scheduled date interfered with studying for exams.  Gateway Ruggerfest  The MRFU has hosted the Gateway Ruggerfest Tournament annually since 1948. The tournament was traditionally scheduled on Easter weekend in Forest Park and was known as the Easter Ruggerfest. In recent years the tournament has been scheduled the week after Easter and has outgrown the capacity of Forest Park. The 62nd annual Ruggerfest was held on April 10‚Äì11, 2010 at Creve Coeur Lake Memorial Park in St. Louis County.

The ferry links the northern bank near Marble Hill House in Twickenham with the southern bank near Ham House in Ham. It is one of only four remaining ferry routes in London not to be replaced by a bridge or tunnel. Historical background Although ferries (and later bridges) had crossed the river to the east at Richmond since 1459 and to the west at Eel Pie Island since at least 1652, the lands to the south of the river at this point had historically been privately held by the Tollemache family (owners of Ham House) and were off limits to the public. Consequently, despite the distance from the nearest crossings there was little demand for cross-river services at this location. Additionally, the Tollemache family had licensing rights for the Twickenham Ferry at Eel Pie Island (sometimes known as Dysart's ferry after the family), and consequently had little interest in promoting a competing service. The Twickenham Ferry is a setting for some action in Little Dorrit by Charles Dickens. Walter Hammerton In 1901 Marble Hill House on the north bank of the Thames and the surrounding park were purchased for public use and in 1902 the footpath on the southern bank near Ham House became a public right of way by Act of Parliament, resulting in increased passenger traffic in the area. In 1908 local resident Walter Hammerton began hiring out boats to leisure users from a boathouse opposite Marble Hill House, and in 1909 began to operate a regular ferry service across the river at this point using a 12-passenger clinker-built skiff, charging 1d per journey. =Legal challenge= In 1913, William Champion and Lord Dysart, operators of the nearby Twickenham Ferry, took legal action against Hammerton to remove his right to operate the ferry. Although Hammerton won the initial case, the judgement was reversed on appeal. Following considerable public interest in the case, a public subscription raised the funds for Hammerton to take the case to the House of Lords, who ruled in his favour on 23 July 1915. The legal case resulted in considerable publicity for Hammerton, culminating in the release of the song \\"The Ferry to Fairyland\\" celebrating the case. (\\"Fairyland\\", in this case, referring to Marble Hill House, recently purchased by the London County Council for public enjoyment.) In 1947 Hammerton retired after 38 years of operating the ferry, leaving the ferry and boathouse to Sandy Scott. Current operation The ferry is currently owned by Francis Spencer and operated by Stan Rust. The current ferry, Peace of Mind, was designed and built by Thanetcraft Limited in South Wales in 1997. Hammerton's original skiff is now on display at the Museum of London Docklands. The ferry currently operates between a floating boathouse on the north bank of the Thames and a rudimentary jetty on the south bank. The boathouse is also in use as a private mooring for leisure craft. The ferry operates on all weekends, and weekdays between February and October. As well as the ferry service, rowboats, canoes and motorboats can also be hired from the boathouse. In July 2007 the ferry briefly made headlines when owner Francis Spencer saved from drowning a woman found floating in the Thames. After the rescue, the woman left the scene and was never identified. A local tradition holds that a tunnel connects Ham House and Marble Hill House, paralleling the route of the ferry. However, there is no evidence that this is the case. The ferry is just downstream of the finish line of the Great River Race and is on the course of the Twickenham Regatta. As the ferry has right- of-way over rowed craft, the races have to be carefully timed to ensure that the ferry does not interfere with their running.

Closely linked to battlefield archaeology and Military Sites Archaeology, conflict archaeology is developing as an umbrella sub-discipline that encompasses these others, allowing for greater epistemological elasticity than other terms. Modern conflict archaeology deals with technological, social, cultural, psychological aspects of present conflicts. Unlike battlefield archaeology, modern conflict archaeology delves deeper into the anthropological study of the conflicts rather than the physical manifestations of the battles.As stated by Nicholas Saunders in his book entitled Beyond the Dead Horizon, \\"These complexities are generated partly by nature of modern wars/conflicts of industrialized intensity and they incorporate political and nationalistic motivations and notions of ethnicity and identity.\\" In order to understand the modern-day conflict, it is important to recognize two fundamental issues: 1\\\\. Realize that each conflict is a multifaceted issue which incorporates many anthropological contexts of involved populations. 2\\\\. In order to understand the actual conflict, one must understand all facets of the motivating issues and their layers of conflict. As stated by Saunders,\\"This multitude of issues makes modern conflict sites...multi-layered landscapes...that require robust interdisciplinary approaches.\\"(Saunders, pg. x). Conflict archaeology addresses any type of issue regardless of size or effect, more importantly the residual effects felt from the conflict itself upon the surrounding populations. \\"In this view the constantly shifting multidimensional aftermaths of conflict are as important as the conflict themselves.\\" Conflict archaeology is most strongly followed by some historical archaeologists in the United States and archaeologists of all time periods in Europe. Significant studies of conflict in North America predating the arrival of Europeans have been done, but these works are largely situated within regional, not thematic literature.  A Case Study: The Bare Bones; body parts and conflict behavior  Within Saunders work, Susannah Callow's paper is presented as she analyzes the role in which body parts of the deceased act as key indicators of complex narratives of individual experiences during a conflict (i.e. politics, social status, personal memento etc.) as stated by allowing, \\"...the body is central to human experiences of modern warfare...material and human destruction...becomes a way of living material form to discourse and the body in pain is a vital component in battle to assert meaning and authority.\\" Essentially our bodies act as physical manifestations of past conflicts. The physical effects that violence inflicts upon our bodies are allowed for the characterization of the surrounding conflict which was participated in. Our bodies tell us the human interaction enacted and the course of the conflict, whether one side was dominated in regards to another, based on physical evidence. As Callow states, \\"Permanent wounds such as scars or missing body parts convey messages about the success or failure of casing wounds to one another...and the military success of the individual who carries out such acts.\\" A primary component is that of dehumanization. \\"Dehumanization is the psychological term describing a process of denying the humanity or human characteristic of an individual/subgroup\\" Dehumanization is evident via acts of mutilation and is often revealed by the manner in which the dead are killed. This psychological process leads to the lack of restraint and often incites the celebration of death. Therefore, this is often illustrated by mass killings, genocides, use and disuse of parts and body part artifact construction. There are two major components of the dehumanization perspective: 1\\\\. Body parts are equivalent to material culture This is expressed in the lynchings of the south in the late 18th century. These lynchings often featured a crowd oftentimes which would take and sell body parts of the deceased. These actions, as Callow states, \\"...conferred the stakes of belonging to the 'correct' group\\" 2\\\\. Deceased Individuals are viewed as waste. For example, Nazi concentration camps often referred to the Jews as \\"loads or \\"merchandise\\" and resulted in the victims loss of identity. This is further emphasized as they were marked with numbers and herded like cattle. In the end disposal of their bodies were often mechanical oftentimes lacking proper post-mortem practices. Also, the deceased body parts were often used to create various commodities. For example, skulls were collected and sold for profit, skin was used to make leather and human fat was used to make soap. Therefore, it is through these examples that we realize that modern day conflicts are not limited to the battles and wars, but the psychological and anthropological interactions between various populations and the underlying motivations it exposes.  Methods and theory  = Origins = Over the last two decades conflict archaeology has developed from Historic archaeology to include multiple elements in the fields of anthropology and archaeology. Early efforts include 1842 surveys of the English Civil War site of Naseby, and in the twentieth century the 1950s examination of the Portuguese battle of Aljbarotta of AD1325. In the United States attention was drawn to the possibilities of conflict archaeology in the National Parks sites of Little Big Horn and selected Civil Battle fields. Much of the work done on these later sites was with metal detectors. Although this technology has received a less than warm welcome to field work due to its use in relic hunting, it has become a staple in many investigations. Relic hunting was around long before the metal detector was invented. = Field methodology = Since much of conflict archaeology has been from the historic period, documentary research remains a primary starting point for the process. Published documents, maps, chart, aerial photography all aid in getting preliminary starting point. Field work will then include pedestrian survey and possibly remote sensing, including not only metal detecting, but also magnetometry, Ground Penetrating Radar(GPR), Resistivity, and more recently, Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR). This ability to sense what is beneath the surface often allows for the true location of structure. In conflict archaeology these are often fortifications such as trenches, breastworks as well as housing, transportation and storage areas. Facilities away from the battlefield itself are also a concern of conflict archaeology. Other complexes such as supply, food preparation, sanitation, transportation, command structures, facilities for prisoners, hospitals and possibly the burial of the dead. Structural elements and fortifications may be mobile or static, short term or long term, and may even have multiple occupations during protracted periods. Identification of these structures should reflect the cultural tendencies of a group in that period. Following that theme, the location through remote sensing and traditional test excavation may reveal elements of conflict at a more personal level. All of this may be used to observe first hand behavior of groups and individuals under the stress of battle. = Applications toward anthropology = Cultural patterns-One of the approaches to working in this area is to understand the nature of conflict of given cultures. Not all people fight the same way. By studying the cultural signature of opposing groups, insight may be gained to help interpret not only the battlefield, but also the areas involved in pre and post conflict activities. Training is one of these areas. Again, not all people fight the same way given their individual histories, demographic makeup, as well as technical and natural resources. Also, people tend to fight the way they were trained, so that in examining an area of conflict similar patterns are likely to appear. The way the forces reconnoiter, approach, deploy and exit a conflict will often reflect a given group's training, hence these may be predicted, thereby locating archaeological evidence by studying the groups training or cultural proclivities. = Landscape = Terrain in the purely geographical sense has long been an element of archaeological investigations and reports, but terrain has a critical role that is part of not only battle field conflict but staging areas, routes for access and withdrawal, and movement before, during and after the conflict itself. An area for conflict and pre and post activities will yield significantly different kinds of materials for observation. Theaters of conflict between a colonial power and an indigenous group will most probably yield significantly different archaeological records. How the area was chosen, and to what purpose can reveal strategies and tactics such as siege or holding operations. Clandestine and guerrilla tactics will often manifest themselves in different kinds of bases and transport operations such as tunnels and caves. = Time and space = Time and space are also pivotal considerations for the study of conflict. Time may be measured in seconds or years even decades or longer. Opportunities for the deposition of archaeological evidence may consist of very minuscule traces to layers of multiple accumulations, all telling unique stories. The same applies to space. It too may range from a single event of ‚Äòone on one‚Äô contact to fields of conflict that are truly global in nature. The events that are small in physical scale, again may or may not leave much evidence, but the larger episodes my in fact completely alter the landscape. Large construction projects of camps, docks, airfields as well as fortifications may remain for centuries. = Alterity = Alterity is the concept of identifying those groups who have been omitted in traditional historical narratives, sometimes identified as 'others;. Conflict archaeology seeks to be more inclusive regarding non-traditional narratives that focus less on purely military aspects of battle. The roles of indigenous peoples, insurgents, and noncombatants have been greatly under reported in both the historic and archaeological reports on conflict. Adding to these should be women and children who are often integral elements in conflict scenarios as the adult male participants. These are often the under-reported participants of support, espionage, and partisan activities. = Colonialism = A close inspection of the documents of a period of colonialism will often reveal that the recordings of conflict will reflect the justifications of the subjecting power. These ‚Äòhistories‚Äô may be nothing more than period propaganda and will often be perpetuated into long studied and repeated narratives. These will also ignore, or downplay, or intentionally omit the role of the subaltern players in those dramas. Examples of some of the new examinations range from the Fascist control over Ethiopia during the 1930s to massacres of Aboriginals in Australia. = Ethics = Recent innovations in the study and identification of human remains have been utilized in the last three decades is drawing the study of conflict and archaeology into prominence. Modern examples of extra-national conflicts, civil wars, episodes of genocide, concentration camps, ‚Äòethnic cleansing‚Äô are producing execution sites, mass graves and other archaeological evidences. These episodes are heavily involving conflict archaeology into the legal theatre to augment evidence of war crimes and atrocities. The same recovery techniques are also being use to repatriate remains to families and provide closure to events that may span decades.

During his reign, Xueyantuo largely aligned with China's Tang Dynasty, even though the two states were at odds at times, with the most serious dispute involving Tang's attempt to reestablish Eastern Tujue as a vassal state under the Qilibi Khan Ashina Simo‚Äîan attempt that eventually failed due to frequent incursions by Yi'nan's army against Ashina Simo. Throughout Yi'nan's reign, Xueyantuo remained powerful despite Tang attempts to curb its power, but after Yi'nan's death, a succession dispute between his sons, Bazhuo and Yemang (), led to Bazhuo's killing of Yemang and subsequent internal unrest. Further, Bazhuo attacked Tang, resulting in a major Tang retaliation campaign that, along with a revolt by the Huige, led to Xueyantuo's destruction in 646.  Prior to Tang's capture of Ashina Duobi  It is not known when Yi'nan was born, but it is known that he was the grandson of the Yiedie Khan Yishibo, who was the first ruler of the Xueyantuo, then a constituent tribe of the Chile confederation, which was then submitting to the rule of Eastern Tujue khans. It was said that at the time Yi'nan was initially Xueyantuo's ruler under Eastern Tujue's Jiali Khan Ashina Duobi, Yi'nan had 70,000 tents of people under him. By 627, it was said that because of Ashina Duobi's misrule, several of the stronger members of the Chile, including Xueyantuo, Huige, and Bayegu (), rebelled. Ashina Duobi sent his son Ashina Yugu to attack the Chile rebels with some 400,000 horsemen, but were defeated by an army of only 5,000 horsemen commanded by the Huige chieftain Pusa (). At the same time, Xueyantuo also defeated four Eastern Tujue generals, and Ashina Duobi could not respond adequately. Ashina Duobi then sent the subordinate Tuli Khan Ashina Shibobi (), against the Chile, but the Huige and the Xueyantuo both defeated Ashina Shibobi, causing him to flee. (Ashina Duobi's subsequent anger at and brief detention of Ashina Shibobi eventually led to Ashina Shibobi also rebelling and entering into an alliance with Tang.) By late 628, the northern vassals of Eastern Tujue had all rebelled, and they submitted to Yi'nan, offering him the title of khan. Yi'nan initially declined the title, not daring to use it. As Emperor Taizong of Tang wanted to enter into an alliance with Xueyantuo against Eastern Tujue, he sent the general Qiao Shiwang () as an envoy to Yi'nan, recognizing him the Zhenzhupiqie Khan (or Zhenzhu Khan in short), and awarding him with drums and banners. Yi'nan was very pleased, and he offered tribute to Emperor Taizong. It was said that by this point, his territory stretched from the Mohe to the east, Western Tujue to the west, and Gobi Desert to the south, and that many tribes, including Huige (ÂõûÁ∫•), Bayegu (Êãî‰πüÂè§), Adie (ÈòøË∑å), Tongluo (ÂêåÁæÖ), Pugu (ÂÉïÈ™®), and Baixi (ÁôΩÈú´), all submitted to him. In fall 629, he sent his brother Tong () to offer tribute to Emperor Taizong, and Emperor Taizong, in return, awarded him with a sword and a whip, stating, \\"Lord, if your subordinates commit crimes, you can use the sword to execute those with major crimes, and whip those with minor crimes.\\" Yi'nan was pleased, and this brought fear in Ashina Duobi, who requested a marriage with the Tang imperial clan, to no avail. In 630, a Tang army commanded by the general Li Jing defeated the Eastern Tujue, capturing Ashina Duobi. Some of the Eastern Tujue people surrendered to Tang; some surrendered to Xueyantuo; and some fled to the west to Western Tujue or the nearby city states. Xueyantuo was now the predominant power to the north of the Tang empire.  Reign over former Eastern Tujue territory  As the supreme ruler over former Eastern Tujue territory, Yi'nan tried to maintain peaceful relationship with Tang by formally submitting to Tang, while at the same time strengthening his state. In 632, Western Tujue's Siyehu Khan Ashina Dieli attacked Xueyantuo, and Xueyantuo forces defeated him, contributing to Ashina Dieli's subsequent downfall. Another challenge that Yi'nan had to face was an attack from the Eastern Tujue prince Ashina She'er (), who had, during the collapse of the Eastern Tujue, fled to Western Tujue and taken over a part of its territory, claiming the title of Dubu Khan. As Ashina She'er viewed Xueyantuo as the source of Ashina Duobi's downfall, he vowed vengeance against Xueyantuo, and he attacked Xueyantuo in or around 634, with indecisive results. However, at that time a new Western Tujue khan, the Dielishi Khan Ashina Tong'e, had just taken the throne, and a large portion of Ashina She'er's people, not willing to continue fighting, fled to Ashina Tong'e, allowing Xueyantuo to counterattack and defeat Ashina She'er. (Ashina She'er eventually fled to Gaochang and then Tang, eventually becoming a major Tang general.) Meanwhile, Yi'nan was strengthening, and by 638, he was said to have more than 200,000 soldiers under him. It was also said that he had divided the army to be separately commanded by his sons Bazhuo and Jialibi (), with Bazhuo in charge of the south and Jialibi in charge of the north.It is not clear whether Jialibi was the same person as Yemang. However, when describing the dispute between Bazhuo and Yemang in 645, the Tang Huiyao mentioned that at one point, at Yi'nan's request, Emperor Taizong had created both Bazhuo and Yemang subordinate khan titles, which may suggest that Yemang and Jialibi were the same person. The division described here (by south and north) was different than the west/east and ethnic division described for the division between Bazhuo and Yemang. Emperor Taizong, believing that Xueyantuo was becoming strong and difficult to subjugate, created both Bazhuo and Jialibi as subordinate khans under their father, awarding them both drums and banners, ostensibly to honor them, but hoping to instead cause dissent between them. Meanwhile, Qu Wentai (), the king of Gaochang, was said to have allied himself with Western Tujue against Tang, and also tried to engage Xueyantuo in their alliance, sending an emissary to Yi'nan to tell him, \\"You are a khan, and you have enough power to stand up to the emperor. Why bow to his emissary?\\" Yi'nan, in response, informed Emperor Taizong of Qu's instigation and, when Emperor Taizong sent the general Hou Junji to attack Gaochang in 638, offered to send an army to assist Hou. Emperor Taizong sent the official Tang Jian and the general Zhishi Sili () to Xueyantuo, to award Yi'nan with silk for his loyalty and to discuss coordination. (However, when Hou actually attacked and conquered Gaochang in 639, it appeared to be without actual participation from Xueyantuo.) In 639, there was a failed plot, led by the Eastern Tujue prince Ashina Jiesheshuai, to assassinate Emperor Taizong. Emperor Taizong thereafter rethought his policy of settling the Eastern Tujue people inside Tang borders, instituted initially in 630. He created the Eastern Tujue prince Ashina Simo as Qilibi Khan, ordering him to take the Eastern Tujue people to settle between the Yellow River and the Gobi. He sent an emissary to Yi'nan, explaining the reasons and ordering Yi'nan to keep peace with the rebuilt Eastern Tujue. Yi'nan, while displeased with the action, agreed, and by 641, Ashina Simo had settled in near Dingxiang (, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia). However, Yi'nan disliked the situation and, later that year, believing that Emperor Taizong was about to offer sacrifices to heaven and earth at Mount Tai and would take his soldiers with them, he wanted to use this chance to destroy Ashina Simo. He commissioned his son Dadu (),Dadu was described to be his oldest son, but Yemang was also later described to be his oldest son. Moreover, Dadu's soldiers, described to be from the various tribes, also appeared to coincide with the ethnic composition of the people under Yemang in 645, and so it was possible, but not confirmed, that Dadu and Yemang were the same person. with an army made of soldiers from the Tongluo, Pugu, Huige, Mohe, and Xi, to attack Eastern Tujue with 200,000 men. Ashina Simo could not resist, and withdrew within the Great Wall, took up position at Shuo Prefecture (roughly modern Shuozhou, Shanxi), and sought emergency aid from Emperor Taizong. In winter 641, Emperor Taizong sent the generals Zhang Jian, Li Shiji, Li Daliang, Zhang Shigui (), and Li Xiyu (), to attack Xueyantuo to try to save Ashina Simo. Around the new year 642, Li Shiji engaged Dadu's army. Dadu's army was initially able to kill Li Shiji's army's horses with arrows, but Li Shiji's lieutenant Xue Wanche () was able to, in turn, concentrate on attacking Xueyantuo army's horses. Li Shiji was able to thereafter defeat Dadu, forcing him to flee. (At the same time, Yi'nan had sent an emissary to Emperor Taizong, offering peace with Eastern Tujue, and after Li Shiji defeated Dadu, Emperor Taizong sent the emissary back to Yi'nan with harsh words, but did not make further attacks on Xueyantuo or rebuke Yi'nan any further.) Later in 642, Yi'nan began an effort to enter into a marriage with a Tang princess to cement the relationship. He sent his uncle Nishou () to Emperor Taizong, offering a tribute of 3,000 horses, 38,000 mink coats, and a mirror made of amber. Meanwhile, with the Tang general Qibi Heli ()  the chief of the Qibi tribe, a constituent tribe of the Chile as well‚Äîbeing detained in Xueyantuo after he, on a visit back to his tribe, was seized by his own subordinates and taken to Xueyantuo (as his subordinates wanted to submit to Xueyantuo rather than Tang), Emperor Taizong, concerned about Qibi Heli's safety (as Qibi Heli had refused to submit to Xueyantuo, cutting off an ear to show his resolve, causing Yi'nan to nearly execute him), agreed to the marriage proposal, sending the official Cui Dunli to negotiate with Yi'nan the terms, under which Emperor Taizong's daughter Princess Xinxing would marry Yi'nan, in exchange for Qibi Heli's release. In 643, Yi'nan again sent his nephew Tuli () to offer tributes of 50,000 horses, 10,000 cattle or camels, and 100,000 goats, to serve as bride price. Emperor Taizong welcomed Tuli in a grand ceremony, and Tuli held a great banquet in Emperor Taizong's honor, which Emperor Taizong and his officials personally attended. However, at Qibi's urging, Emperor Taizong was considering renouncing the marriage‚Äîinitially ordering Yi'nan to personally meet him and Princess Xinxing at Ling Prefecture (, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia) to marry her, believing that Yi'nan would refuse and that he would then have a good excuse to break off the marriage. When Yi'nan agreed to go to Ling Prefecture, Emperor Taizong found another excuse‚Äîthat the bride price offered had not been all collected (as, in order to gather the livestock making up the bride price, Yi'nan had to collect them from subordinate tribes, and it was taking longer than thought, and the livestock were also dying from having to go through the Gobi)  to cancel the marriage treaty, despite strong opposition from his official Chu Suiliang, who pointed out that, effectively, he was devaluing his own words. Emperor Taizong rationalized his decision by arguing that if Yi'nan had married a Tang princess, he would have greater legitimacy over the Chile tribes and would be more difficult to control. Meanwhile, Yi'nan was continuing to attack Eastern Tujue periodically. When Emperor Taizong sent emissaries to try to stop him from doing so, Yi'nan responded: By the end of 644, the Eastern Tujue people, who were not whole-heartedly supportive of Ashina Simo in the first place, collapsed in light of Xueyantuo threat, fleeing back to Tang territory, and were again settled there. Ashina Simo also went back to Tang and again became a Tang general, ending Tang's attempt to recreate Eastern Tujue as a vassal state. This caused Emperor Taizong to be displeased, and when Yi'nan subsequently sent an emissary to offer tribute to Emperor Taizong, who was at that time deeply into preparation to attack Goguryeo, Emperor Taizong responded, \\"Go back and tell your khan: My son and I are now about to attack Goguryeo. If he thinks that he can take advantage of this, he is welcome to come!\\" Yi'nan, fearful of Emperor Taizong's anger, sent another emissary to apologize and offering to assist in the military campaign against Goguryeo, an offer that Emperor Taizong declined. In 645, after Emperor Taizong had defeated the main Goguryeo forces at Mount Zhubi (), near the fortress of Anshi (, in modern Anshan, Liaoning), Goguryeo's mangniji (regent) Yeon Gaesomun requested that Yi'nan attack Tang, offering great tributes to him if he did. Yi'nan, fearful of Tang power, did not do so. (However, Emperor Taizong was eventually forced to abandon the campaign anyway after being stymied in his siege of Anshi.) Yi'nan died in fall 645. Despite the friction that had developed in the latter years, Emperor Taizong held a grand mourning ceremony for Yi'nan. It was said that Yi'nan, with Tang permission, had previously created his oldest son Yemang Tulishi Khan, giving him the eastern parts, to govern over various tribes, and his wife's son Bazhuo the Siyehu Khan, giving him the western parts, to govern over the Xueyantuo people, and that Emperor Taizong had carried out the creation in grand ceremonies. Yemang was said to be violent and disturbed, and also having a poor relationship with Bazhuo. After Yi'nan's death, both attended the funeral, and after the funeral, Yemang, fearful that Bazhuo would harm him, departed suddenly first, which led to Bazhuo chasing him down and killing him. Bazhuo thereafter took the throne with the title of Jialijulixueshaduomi Khan (or Duomi Khan, in short).

An oil painting depicting five prostitutes from a brothel in Barcelona. Prostitution in Spain is not addressed by any specific law, but a number of activities related to it, such as pimping, are illegal. In 2016, UNAIDS estimated there to be 70,268 prostitutes in the country, although other estimates put the number in the 300,000 - 400,000 region. The sex industry in Spain is estimated to be worth ‚Ç¨3.7 billion.  Legal status  Prostitution was decriminalized in 1995. Prostitution itself is not directly addressed in the Criminal Code of Spain, but exploitation such as pimping is illegal. The only article in the Code dealing specifically with adult prostitution is Art√≠cle 188, which bans pimping: > Whoever causes a person of legal age to engage in prostitution or to > continue to do so, with the use of violence, intimidation or deception, or > by abusing a position of power or the dependency or vulnerability of the > victim, shall be punished with a prison sentence of two to four years and a > fine from 12 to 24 months. Gaining profit from the prostitution of another > shall incur the same penalty, even with the consent of that person. Owning an establishment where prostitution takes place is in itself legal, but the owner cannot derive financial gain from the prostitute or hire a person to sell sex because prostitution is not considered a job and thus has no legal recognition. = Local government = Local governments differ in their approaches to both indoor and outdoor prostitution, usually in response to community pressure groups, and based on \\"public safety\\". Most places do not regulate prostitution, but the government of Catalonia offers licenses for persons \\"to gather people to practice prostitution\\". These licenses are used by brothel owners to open \\"clubs\\", where prostitution takes place (the women are theoretically only \\"gathered\\" to work on the premises not employed by the owner). Some places have implemented fines for street prostitution. =COVID-19 pandemic= As part of the State of alarm due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, all brothels and other places of entertainment were closed.  Politics  = History = Prostitution was tolerated in Spain throughout the mediaeval period, until the 17th century and the reign of Phillip IV (1621‚Äì65) whose 1623 decree closed the manceb√≠as (brothels) forcing the women out into the street, a very unpopular decision, but one that remained in place till the 19th century. In the reign of Isabel II (1843‚Äì1868) regulation was introduced, firstly in cities, the Disposiciones de Zaragoza (1845) and the Reglamento para la represi√≥n de los excesos de la prostituci√≥n en Madrid (1847), followed by the 1848 Penal Code. (Guerena 2003, 2008) In 1935 during the Second Republic (1931‚Äì36) prostitution was prohibited. Once the Dictatorship (1939‚Äì75) was established, this law was repealed (1941). Spain became officially abolitionist on 18 June 1962, when the 1949 United Nations (UN) Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others was ratified by Spain, and the Decree 168 of 24 January 1963 modified the Penal Code (C√≥digo Penal) according to the Convention. In theory, this policy, in accordance with the Convention, regarded sex workers (trabajadores sexuales) as victims of sexual exploitation and advocated punishment of their exploiters rather than the workers themselves, and refused to distinguish between voluntary and coerced sex work.Carracedo Bullido, Rosario (2001). Legislaci√≥n penal espa√±ola (Spanish penal law). In Direcci√≥n General de la Mujer de la Comunidad de Madrid (ed.)

Madrid: Direcci√≥n General de la Mujer de la Comunidad de Madrid: pp.149-59. However, there were inconsistencies, as the prostitutes were in fact treated more like criminals: under Act 16/1970 of 4 August on social menace and rehabilitation (Ley de peligrosidad y rehabilitaci√≥n social) prostitutes were declared amongst those classes categorized as social evils, and could be confined to special centres or forbidden to live in specified areas. In practice however, prostitution was quietly ignored and tolerated. Although democracy was restored in 1975, it was not till the Penal Code revisions of 1995Peter Pierson. The history of Spain. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999. p. 11 that this policy was revisited, and most laws regarding prostitution were repealed, with the exception of those governing minors and those with mental health problems. This included the Act 16/1970. Further revisions in 1999 addressed trafficking, as did the 2000 Immigration Act which followed other European precedents by offering asylum to trafficked victims if they collaborated (Valiente 2003). = Public opinion = Opinion remains deeply divided in Spain over prostitution, and law reform has been in a political impasse for a long time. Consequently, it remains in rather a grey zone of unregulated but tolerated semi-legality. The standard debates exist as to whether it is work like any other work, or exploitation of women as espoused by groups like Malostratos. Meanwhile, it thrives, and has prompted headlines such as El nuevo burdel de Europa (The New Brothel of Europe).El nuevo burdel de Europa. El Pa√≠s 26 Sep 2005 = Public policy = The key instruments in order of importance are the Penal Code (C√≥digo penal) (1822‚Äì) and the Immigration or Aliens Act (Ley de Extranjer√≠a de Espa√±a) 2000. Plans: *Plan Municipal de Intervenci√≥n ante la Prostituci√≥n en el municipio 2011‚Äì2014, Santa Cruz de Tenerife  Migrant workers  In the 1980s, most of the sex workers in the country were Spanish, but by 2006 70% of sex workers were migrants according to a TAMPEP study, with 70-80% of those migrants being from Latin America, (mainly from Ecuador, Colombia and the Dominican Republic)Trullen Gas J. Trends in female prostitution in Castellon (Spain). Int Conf AIDS. 2004 Jul 11-16; 15: abstract no. C10698See also Laura Oso, 2003, 2010 After Bulgaria and Romania became EU members in 2007, a large number travelled to Spain and engaged in sex work. TAMPEP carried out a further study in 2009 and found 90% of sex workers were migrants. Of all countries studied, only Italy had proportion of migrant workers at comparable level. The 2009 study found the migrant sex workers were 49% were from Latin America, 24% from Central Europe (mainly Bulgaria and Romania) and 18% from Africa. There was an influx of prostitutes from China in the early 2010s. From 2012 to September 2013, 544 prostitutes were identified in 138 inspections in brothels of Asian prostitutes in Barcelona. In the late 2010s a large number of Nigerian women have been trafficked into the country for prostitution. As in other countries in Western Europe, there are concern over the presence of migrant workers on the streets and claims that many of them were coerced. NGOs believe a large percentage of individuals in prostitution in Spain are trafficking victims. Various reports give figures of 80-90% of prostitutes in Spain being trafficked, but this is disputed. In 2008 the Spanish Government announced plans to aid women who had been trafficked.Spain Targets Sex Traffickers With Aid to Prostitutes Bloomburg 19 December 2008 There is also cross-border prostitution between Spain and Portugal, and between Spain and France.) There are organisations working with migrant women, including Proyecto Esperanza and shelters such as IPSSE (Instituto para la Promoci√≥n de Servicios Especializados).  Advocacy  Organisations working with sex workers in Spain include APRAMP (Associacion para la Prevenci√≥n, Reinserci√≥n y Atenci√≥n de la Mujer Prostituida) while sex workers' rights organisations include Hetaira (Madrid), as well as regional organisations such as SICAR Asturias, AMTTTSE (Asociaci√≥n de Mujeres, Transexuales y Travestis como Trabajadoras Sexuales en Espa√±a, M√°laga) and CATS (Comit√© de Apoyo a las Trabajadoras del Sexo, Murcia). Spanish sex workers continue to be concerned about their lack of protection and in July 2011 petitioned the Minister of Health (Leire Paj√≠n).Pide a la ministra Leire Paj√≠n que escuche a las trabajadoras del sexo. Actuable July 2011 A demonstration is planned for 6 November 2011 in Madrid, and a communique has been released setting out sex workers' complaints and demands. The Organizaci√≥n de Trabajadoras Sexuales (OTRAS) was formed in August 2018 and registered with Spain's Labour Ministry as a trade union. Feminists and activist opposed the formation of the union and instigated a campaign on social media against them using the hashtag #SoyAbolicionista (‚ÄúI‚Äôm an Abolitionist‚Äù). Abolitionist groups brought a court action against OTRAS, which resulting on OTRAS's statutes being annulled on the grounds that there can be no employment contract for prostitutes and therefore they were not \\"workers\\" in terms of employment law, but the court did not dissolve the union. However, in February 2019, the Superior Court of Justice of Madrid ruled that a prostitute working in a club in Barcelona had a valid employment relationship with the club owners.  Social history  Prostitution in Spain was highly sectored, with at one end the damas cortesanas of high society, and the mistresses of the bourgeoisie and barraganas, the concubines of the clergy. (Harrison)  Sex work in Spanish culture  La Maja Desnuda c. 1800, oil on canvas, 98 * 191 cm (38.58 * 75.2 in), Prado, Madrid Goya (1746‚Äì1828) frequently commented on the place of prostitution in Spanish high society such as satirising the church's involvement in the trade, for profit. Best known though are his controversial Majas. Other examples are Murillo's Four Figures on a Step and Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (illustrated). In literature, Miguel de Cervantes discusses prostitution in his early 17th century novel Don Quixote, and the subject is found throughout 19th- and 20th-century Spanish literature. = Sex work celebrities in Spain = La se√±ora Rius (see photograph) is a Barcelona celebrity and Madam who told her story in Juli√°n Peir√≥'s La Sra. Rius, de moral distra√≠da (Comanegra, Barcelona 2008). Overseas autonomous communities =Canary Islands= In 2006, 42 people were arrested following the discover of a prostitution ring operating out of nightclubs in Las Palmas and Telde. The prostitutes were from South American countries, mainly Brazil. Five people were jailed as a result. In 2012, a councillor in Santa Cruz de Tenerife told the ABC newspaper about the city's draft plan for prostitution. He said that, in cases examined by NGOs, 91% of the prostitutes were women and 9% were transsexual women. A study is 2016 estimated there were around 3,000 prostitutes working on the islands, mainly in the tourist areas and the cities of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas. =Ceuta= Prostitution occurs in the Ceti (Temporary Reception Center) in Ceuta. The prostitutes are mainly Nigerian women. =Melilla= Local NGO Melilla Acoge, which provides medical and other assistance to prostitutes, report that there are about 1,000 Moroccan prostitutes in Melilla. Some cross over the border into Melilla in the mornings and leave at midday, other cross over the border in the afternoon and leave at night. Sex trafficking Sex traffickers exploit foreign victims in Spain and, to a lesser extent, Spanish victims abroad. Women from Eastern Europe (particularly Romania and Bulgaria), South America (particularly Paraguay, Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador), Central America (particularly Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua), China, and Nigeria are exploited in sex trafficking. Authorities report Nigerian women now make up the largest demographic of sex trafficking victims. Sex traffickers exploit Venezuelan women fleeing the collapsing social and economic conditions at home. Spanish law does not permit nor prohibit prostitution, and NGOs believe a large percentage of individuals in prostitution in Spain are trafficking victims. Various reports give figures of 80-90% of prostitutes in Spain being trafficked, but this is disputed. Sex traffickers are increasingly using online apartment rental platforms to make their illicit operations difficult to track. An increasing number of victims arrived in southern Spain by sea via Morocco. Nigerian criminal networks recruit victims in migrant reception centers in Italy for forced prostitution in Spain. Unaccompanied migrant children continue to be vulnerable to sex trafficking. The increased numbers of newly arrived refugees and asylum-seekers are vulnerable to trafficking. Law enforcement conducted targeted operations against 37 criminal organisations involved in sex trafficking in 2018. The judiciary initiated prosecutions of 63 defendants for sex trafficking. The government reported several cases in which convicted traffickers received significant penalties. In January 2019, an Oviedo court sentenced four Romanians to 20 to 55 years in prison for forcing 12 Romanian women into prostitution. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Spain as a 'Tier 1' country.

His father's ancestors, of Dutch descent, included Philip Schuyler, a general in George Washington's army and a U.S. Senator.; His mother was the half-sister of Charles Scribner, the founder of the famous American publishing house. At the age of fifteen, Schuyler entered Yale College, where he studied languages, literature and philosophy. He graduated with honors in 1859 and was a member of Skull and Bones. He became one of the first graduate students at Yale, and in 1861, he and two other students were the first Americans to receive Ph.D.s from an American university. In 1860, Schuyler became an assistant to Noah Porter, a prominent linguistician and literary figure, in the revision of Webster's Dictionary, the first dictionary of American English. In 1862, Schuyler began to study law at Yale Law School, and received his law degree, in 1863, from Columbia Law School. He began practicing law in New York, but did not find it very interesting. Instead he began to write, becoming a contributor to The Nation magazine. He continued to write for The Nation until the end of his life.. Career In September 1863 a Russian naval squadron made a long stay in New York harbor, hoping to escape capture by the British Navy in the event of a war between Britain and Russia over the Polish Uprising of 1863. Schuyler met some of the officers of the Russian flagship, the Alexander Nevsky, which inspired him to study Russian. He learned Russian well enough to translate the novel of Ivan Turgenev, Fathers and Sons, which was published in 1867, the first translation of Turgenev to appear in the United States.. The same year Schuyler studied Finnish, and edited the first American translation of the Finnish national epic, Kalevala. = Diplomat to Russia = In 1864, Schuyler applied for a diplomatic post in the State Department. The State Department took three years to consider his application, and then offered him the position of consul in Moscow, then the second city of Russia. En route to his post, Schuyler stopped in Baden-Baden to meet Turgenev, who gave him a letter of introduction to Lev Tolstoi. Schuyler began his diplomatic tour in Moscow in August 1867. In the spring of 1868 he made his first trip to the edge of Central Asia, traveling with a Russian merchant, Vasilii Alekseich, by steamboat down the Volga to Samara, then by carriage to Orenburg, which at the time was the base for Russian military operations The Russians had occupied the Khanate of Bukhara in 1866 and were advancing toward Samarkand. In 1868, Schuyler was a guest of Tolstoi for a week at his estate at Yasnaya Polyana, at the time when Tolstoi was finishing War and Peace. He helped Tolstoi rearrange his library, and went hunting with him. Tolstoi, who was interested in public education in the United States, asked Schuyler for copies of American primers and school textbooks. Schuyler received Tolstoi's permission to translate his novel The Cossacks into English. In 1869, the new Administration of President Ulysses Grant removed Schuyler from his post in Moscow and replaced him with a political appointee. Schuyler was able to obtain a post as consul to the Russian port of Reval (now Tallinn). In November, 1869, President Grant appointed a new Minister to Russia, Andrew Curtin, a former Governor of Pennsylvania who knew nothing of Russia. Curtin was impressed by Schuyler and appointed him as the secretary of the American legation in St. Petersburg, a post which Schuyler held until 1876. = Travels in Central Asia = \\"Map of the Khanates of Bukhara, Khiva, and Khokand and Part of Russian Turkistan\\" by Eugene Schuyler, 1875. Schuyler was able to combine his diplomatic duties with scholarship and travel. He began writing a major biography of Peter the Great, and frequented the meetings of the Russian Geographic Society in St. Petersburg. In 1873, he was one of the first foreigners invited to visit Russia's new conquests in Central Asia. Schuyler left St. Petersburg by train on March 23, 1873 and traveled first to Saratov. He was accompanied by an American journalist, Januarius MacGahan, who was working for the New York Herald. Schuyler and MacGahan traveled from Saratov by sledge to Orenburg, then to Kazala (now Kazalinsk), then to Fort Perovskii (now Kzyl-Orda). MacGahan went from there to find the Russian Army at Khiva, while Schuyler travelled on to Tashkent, in present-day Uzbekistan, Samarkand, Bukhara and Kokand. He returned to St. Petersburg via Siberia and the Urals. His trip had taken eight months (he had told the State Department he would be gone only three months), but he brought back a wealth of geographical information. Schuyler wrote extensively about his trip for the National Geographic Society in the United States, and he also wrote a long report for the State Department. He was embarrassed when his confidential report was published in December 1876 in Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States - 1874, and translated into Russian by the St. Petersburg press. His report had been critical of the treatment of the Tatars by the Russian General Konstantin Petrovich Von Kaufman. A Russian journalist responded, \\"it did not lie in the mouth of an American statesman to say evil things of the Russian treatment of Tatars - he ought to look at home, and criticize the policy of his own countrymen toward the North American Indians.\\" With the exception of the treatment of the Tatars, Schuyler was favorable toward the Russian presence in Central Asia. \\"On the whole, the Russian influence is beneficial in Central Asia,\\" he wrote, \\"not only for the inhabitants, but to the world, and it certainly is greatly to our interest that a counterpoise should exist there against the extension of English domination in Asia. Having once taken possession of the country, it will be almost impossible for the Russians, with any fairness to the natives, to withdraw from it..\\" Schuyler wrote a two-volume book about his travels in Central Asia. The book, Turkestan, was published in October 1876, in both the United States and England.; Like his report to the State Department, it was favorable to Russia's role in Central Asia: \\"Notwithstanding the many faults which may be found in the administration of the country, the Russian rule is on the whole beneficial to the natives, and it would be manifestly injust to them to withdraw her protection and leave them to anarchy and to the unbridled rule of fanatical despots.\\" = Investigation of Turkish Atrocities in Bulgaria = Schuyler left Russia in 1876. He tried unsuccessfully to be named Minister to Turkey, but that position went to a political appointee of the Grant administration and he was given the position once more of the secretary of the legation, and also of consul general. He arrived in Istanbul on July 6, 1876. Two months after earlier an uprising against Turkish rule had taken place in Bulgaria. The uprising had been repressed by force by the Ottoman Army, with the massacre of civilians. Schuyler learned of these massacres from the Bulgarian students and faculty of Robert College in Constantinople. Vague reports of the massacres had first been printed in the British press on May 6. American Faculty members from Robert College collected more information and sent them to the British Minister to Turkey, with no result. They then sent the reports to the correspondents of The Times and the London Daily News. The London Daily News published its account on June 23, 1876. via Internet Archive It caused an immediate sensation in London. The Bulgarian atrocities were discussed in Parliament on June 26, and the opposition Liberal Party demanded a full investigation. The Conservative government of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli agreed to investigate the reports. The British Government appointed a second secretary at their embassy in Istanbul, Walter Baring, to conduct the investigation. Fearing a cover-up, the faculty members of Robert College asked the American Minister to Turkey, Horace Maynard, to conduct his own investigation. Maynard gave the task to Schuyler. Schuyler prepared to travel to Bulgaria to investigate the reports. By chance, Schuyler's friend from Russia, Januarius MacGahan, arrived in Constantinople to cover the Serbia- Turkish War. Schuyler invited MacGahan to accompany him on his journey to Bulgaria. Schuyler and MacGahan left for Bulgaria on July 23. They were joined by a correspondent of K√∂lnische Zeitung German journalist Karl Schneider (1854‚Äì1945) and by a second secretary of the Russian Embassy in Constantinople Georgian prince Aleksi Tsereteli (Aleksei Tseretelev) and Turkish and Bulgarian translator Petar Dimitrov, instructor at the American Robert College in Constantinople.Maria Todorova,Imagining the Balkans, p. 106, Oxford University Press 2009 They spent three weeks documenting the atrocities which had taken place at villages in southern Bulgaria three months earlier. After visiting a number of towns and villages, Schuyler stated in his report to the U.S. Minister to Turkey, Horace Maynard: \\" It is very difficult to estimate the number of Bulgarians who were killed during the few days that the disturbances lasted, but I am inclined to put 15,000 for the districts that I have named.\\" Mr. Schuyler's Preliminary Report on the Moslem Atrocities, published with the letters by Januarius MacGahan. See Schuyler gave a vivid account of what he saw at the village of Batak, three months after the massacres had taken place: Schuyler's official report, and MacGahan's newspaper reporting, combined to cause a sensation in the British press. The Government of Benjamin Disraeli tried to minimize the massacres, saying that the Bulgarians were equally responsible, but these claims were refuted by Schuyler and MacGahan's eyewitness reports. When Russia threatened war against Turkey, Britain told the Turkish government that, because of the state of public opinion, it could not take the side of Turkey.See the Introduction to the , for an account of the reaction by the British government and Parliament. via Internet Archive The Russian Government, moved by Pan-Slavic sentiment and a desire to help the Orthodox Christian Bulgarians, declared war on the Ottoman Empire and invaded Bulgaria in 1877. The Turkish Army was defeated and Bulgaria was liberated from Ottoman rule in 1878. Schuyler's role in the liberation of Bulgaria greatly displeased the Ottoman Government, which protested to the U.S. Government. Secretary of State Hamilton Fish was also displeased with Schuyler, since Schuyler had acted without his knowledge or consent. He discussed withdrawing Schuyler from Turkey, but decided against it, since he did not want to appear to be unsympathetic to the Bulgarians. When a new President, Rutherford Hayes, took office, Schuyler was subjected to more attacks in the press, accused of bias toward the Bulgarians. On January 3, 1878, the Turkish Government demanded his recall: \\"The Porte regarded a continuance of Mr. Schuyler as consul-general at Constantinople as a serious injury to Turkey in its diplomatic relations and in the administration of its affairs in the provinces.\\" On May 29, 1878, a State Department investigation of Schuyler found that \\"His sentiments and sympathies are strongly anti- Turkish\\" and that he \\"aided greatly to alienate British sympathy from Turkey in her struggle with Russia,\\" and reprimanded him for his \\"unauthorized and self-imposed mission to Bulgaria.\\" Schuyler was removed from Turkey and given the post of consul in Birmingham, England. While there he finished his translation of Tolstoi's The Cossacks, which was published in 1878.; vol. II. = Later diplomatic career= In August 1879, Schuyler became consul general in Rome, where he completed writing his book on Peter the Great, and began a new book on Catherine the Great.; A year later, he became Charg√© d'affaires in Bucharest, as the United States prepared to recognize the independence of Romania and Serbia. In Romania, he studied Romanian and became a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy of Sciences. On July 7, 1882, he was concurrently appointed the Minister Resident/Counsul General to Romania, Serbia, and Greece, while becoming a resident in Athens. He presented his credentials to Romania on September 8, 1882, to Serbia on November 10, 1882, and to Greece on January 9, 1883. In July 1884, he was out of a job again when the U.S. Congress, as an economy measure, abolished the post of minister to Greece, Romania and Serbia. He presented his recall on September 7, 1884 for Romania, his recall was transmitted by note by the Vice Consul General at Belgrade on September 19, 1884 for Serbia, and he presented his recall on October 13, 1884 for Greece. In 1884, Schuyler left the diplomatic service to lecture at Johns Hopkins and Cornell University on diplomatic practice and the conduct of American diplomacy. His book American Diplomacy and the Furtherance of Commerce was published by Scribner's in 1886,. and according to his death notice in The New York Times, the publication of the book \\"prevented him from becoming a member of the permanent staff of the State Department, where his experience would have made him especially useful.\\" In 1889, the Administration of President Benjamin Harrison nominated him as First Assistant Secretary of State. The nomination was withdrawn, however, after opposition within the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and William F. Wharton was eventually appointed and confirmed. Instead, Schuyler took the post of diplomatic agent and consul general in Cairo, Egypt. While in Egypt, he contracted malaria, and died in Venice on July 16, 1890, at the age of fifty. He was buried in Cimitero di San Michele in Venice. Personal life On July 12, 1877, Schuyler was married to Gertrude Wallace \\"Gert\\" King (b. 1836) in Paris. She was the daughter of the late President of Columbia University Charles King, niece of former U.S. Representative and New York Governor John Alsop King, and granddaughter of both Rufus King and Nicholas Low. Her sister, Mary Alsop King Waddington, was a writer who was married to the Prime Minister of France William Henry Waddington. =Legacy and honors= A view of the Street named after Eugene Schuyler in Sofia, Bulgaria () Mount Schuyler on Graham Land in Antarctica is named after Eugene Schuyler \\"who investigated the crushing of the Bulgarian April Uprising of 1876 and co-authored the draft decisions of the subsequent 1876 Constantinople Conference.\\" Streets in the Bulgarian cities of Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna and Panagyurishte are named after him. Between the many curious things Schuyler found in Russian Turkestan is worth mentioning the figure of the iskatchi as it is/was frequent in Wales, (Great Britain), the person sprinkling salt and bread over a corpse at a funeral and eating later such bread to clean the deceased man of his sins, sometimes for a fee.

A unit load can be packed tightly into a warehouse rack, intermodal container, truck or boxcars, yet can be easily broken apart at a distribution point, usually a distribution center, wholesaler, or retail store for sale to consumers or for use. Function Most consumer and industrial products move through the supply chain in unitized or unit load form for at least part of their distribution cycle. Unit loads make handling, storage, and distribution more efficient. They help reduce handling costs and damage by reducing individual handling. A typical unit load might consist of corrugated fiberboard boxes stacked on a pallet or slip sheet and stabilized with stretch wrap, pressure-sensitive tape, strapping or shrink wrap. About 2 billion unit loads are in daily use in the United States.Ward 1993  Unit load design  There are three kinds of unit load design: component-based, systems-based, and standards-compliant. These have different applications. =Component-based design= Component- based design is the outmoded ad hoc method of unit load design. Components are sometimes over-specified to get assured performance, or tested to get inexpensive economic performance. Unit load storage and distribution systems consist of several interacting parts: * Packaging and labeling (with product) * Pallet * Handling/storage equipment * The distribution environment (shock, vibration, humidity, temperature, etc.) Considerable knowledge exists regarding the design of each of these components: their interactions have more recently been studied. When packaging, pallet, and handling systems are designed separately at different locations by different teams, the result might be inefficient unit load systems. The consequences of independent component-based design in the supply chain can include: *Unsafe workplaces *Product damage *High packaging costs *Reduced handling efficiency *Wasted natural resources *Reduction of environmental quality =Systems-based design= Systems-based design is a proven process of unit load component cost optimization based on an understanding of how the pallet, packaging and material handling equipment interact during product distribution and storage to design the unit load component parts. A systems-based approach to unit load design uses software tools and lab testing to create a package that uses just the right amount of material to protect the product, make for safe handling and transportation and minimize the use of non-recyclable materials.http://www.millwoodinc.com/resources/1/literature/Designing-The- Better-Unit-Load-From-The-Ground-Up.pdf Companies must now consider sustainability when determining how their packaging products will be reused or recycled at the end of their journey. By combining sustainability with unit load science, they not only create the optimal unit load, but also reduce the amount of packaging material used to transport that load, maximizing the materials that can be recycled and minimizing what goes into a landfill. Unit loads move via an unpredictable combination of many types of vehicles and storage areas, and the exact set is difficult to predict. Therefore, unit loads must be designed to travel by any such vehicles, and be stored in a wide variety of places. There are many similarities in the requirements for long- term storage and long-distance transportation of unit loads. Factors considered in unit load systems-based design include: *Distribution vibration and resonance *Load bridging and deformation *Unit load deflections *Interfacial friction and load stability *Compression stress and product protection *Vertical and horizontal stabilization Often a few inexpensive additions to the packaging can stabilize or stiffen a critical part and give good unit-load performance at a low cost. Systems Based Design Eliminates Product Damage, Pallet Enterprise, pg. 90 =Standards-compliant design= Standards permit a unit load to be designed and tested to meet a written specification or test method. A unit load can be verified to comply with a standard and validated to determine that the unit load is indeed effective. Standards provide institutional memory of the many conditions in real logistic trains, and collect the best practices for design and testing unit loads. Standards also describe load requirements, so that logistic providers can plan to meet them. * Material-based standards describe proven designs for particular circumstances. These are often used to describe unit load components such as pallets, strapping, seals, caps, retaining rings and battens. * Performance testing standards describe needs and allow flexibility in the choice of materials. These are applied to particular unit load designs. ASTM D4169 has standard test protocols for unit loads. These vary based on the value of the load, the expected hazards, and the distribution environment. This is a performance-based standard. Another standard for unit loads is MIL- STD-1660, a standard for ammunition unit loads. DOD unit loads generally use pallets, which unfortunately do not pack efficiently into ISO containers. They weigh less than to limit the stresses on handling equipment. They are weatherproof, and stack high. They often use steel pallets, steel straps with notched seals, outdoor plywood, and plastic film. MIL-STD-1660 mandates that loads must never be less than the width of a pallet, while permitting some overhang. The markings are LOGMARS bar codes and standard inventory numbers. The standard describes major parts of the logistic path, including storage, ship, air, truck, forklift and sling (i.e. ship-to-ship and parachute). There are auxiliary standards for ship-to-ship transfers, and amphibious transfers. There are tests for stacking, transport, sling, forklift and pallet jack, impact, drop tests, tip, water-retention (i.e. weather), and safe disassembly. MIL-STD-1660 at first looks like overdesign to commercial unit-load designers. However, similar marking standards, safety, stability, volumetric efficiency, weight limits and impact resistance are routinely needed in commercial logistics. Sling handling is routine for small ports and noncontainer transports. Weatherproofness could be optional. It is sometimes valuable, and the baggies are cheap. High, standardized stacking could be optional as well. It is expensive, but sometimes valuable for rackless and military customers. Further reading * Ward, R.E. 1993.

In a number of countries, the communist party simply changed its name and continued to function.After socialism: where hope for individual liberty lies. Svetozar Pejovich. Stephen Holmes of the University of Chicago argued in 1996 that after a period of active decommunization, it was met with a near-universal failure. After the introduction of lustration, demand for scapegoats has become relatively low, and former communists have been elected for high governmental and other administrative positions. Holmes notes that the only real exception was former East Germany, where thousands of former Stasi informers have been fired from public positions.Michael Mandelbaum (Ed., 1996) \\"Post-Communism: Four Perspectives\\", Council on Foreign Relations Holmes suggests the following reasons for the turnoff of decommunization: *After 45‚Äì70 years of Communism, nearly every family has members associated with the state. After the initial desire \\"to root out the reds\\" came a realization that massive punishment is wrong and finding only some guilty is hardly justice. *The urgency of the current economic problems of postcommunism makes the crimes of the communist past \\"old news\\" for many citizens. *Decommunization is believed to be a power game of elites. *The difficulty of dislodging the social elite makes it require a totalitarian state to disenfranchise the \\"enemies of the people\\" quickly and efficiently and a desire for normalcy overcomes the desire for punitive justice. *Very few people have a perfectly clean slate and so are available to fill the positions that require significant expertise.

The SpursEngine processor is also known as the Quad Core HD processor. Announced 20 September 2007. The SpursEngine is a stream processor powered by four Synergistic Processing Elements (SPE), also used in the Cell processor featured in Sony PlayStation 3. These processing elements are fed by on chip H.264 and MPEG-2 codecs and controlled by an off die host CPU, connected by an on chip PCIe controller (in contrast to the Cell processor which has an on chip CPU (the PPE) doing similar work). To enable smoother interaction between the host and the SpursEngine Toshiba also integrated a simple proprietary 32-bit control core. The SpursEngine employs dedicated XDR DRAM as its working memory. The SpursEngine is designed to work at much lower frequencies than the Cell and Toshiba has also optimized the circuit layout of the SPEs to reduce the size by 30%. The resulting chip consumes 10-20 W of power. The SpursEngine is accessible to the developer from a device driver developed for Windows and Linux systems. Software supporting the SpursEngine is limited and is primarily in the realm of video editing and encoding.  Technical specification  Logic schematic of the SpursEngine chip The first generation of SpursEngine processors are specified as follows: * Built with a 65 nm bulk CMOS fabrication process with 7 layers of copper interconnect * 9.98 mm √ó 10.31 mm (102.89 mm¬≤) large die * 239.1 million transistors (Logic: 134 M, SRAM:104.8 M) * Thermal design power: <20 W * Max frequency: 1.5 GHz * Packaged in a 624 pin FC-BGA (Flip Chip-Ball Grid Array) * 48GFLOPS peak performance (12GFLOPS per SPU @ 1.5GHz)  Commercialization  In April 2008 Toshiba shipped samples of the SpursEngine SE1000 device, a PCIe-based reference board. * The accelerator card connects to a 1x PCI Express bus and has 128MB XDR DRAM with 12.8GB/s bandwidth. * Leadtek is producing the WinFast PxVC1100 and HPVC1100, internal and external PCIe accelerators based on the SE1000 platform.TechPowerUp.comCustompc.co.uk Akihabaranews.com * Thomson- Canopus has announced the Firecoder Blu, a PCIe accelerator based on the SE1000 platform.Thomson-canopus.jp Toshiba included the SpursEngine processors in their Qosmio laptops, models F50, G50 and G55, in the third quarter of 2008.

He is the author of The Adamantine Scalpel (ÈáëÂâõÈåç Jin'gang Pi) among other works. References Bibliography  Chen, Shuman (2011).

D. Robb. It is the twenty-third novel in the In Death series, preceding Haunted in Death. It is the longest In Death novel, by a small margin. Plot summary Following the events in Origin in Death, Lt. Eve Dallas only wants a break as Christmas nears, but her past is coming back to haunt her. A television news special about her and her husband Roarke's involvement in the destruction of the Icove center airs on national television, and in Texas, catches the eye of Trudy Lombard, who promptly comes to New York City with her son and her daughter-in-law. Lombard shows up at Eve's office, and Eve remembers everything about her. Eve was taken in by Lombard, after she killed her father. Lombard was an abusive woman, who often made Eve go without food, clean the floors with a toothbrush, locked her in her bed room without light, and scrubbed her skin raw in ice cold baths, all the time telling her she deserved it because she was a 'filthy' little girl who'd already 'engaged in sexual relations' (referring to the beatings and rape committed by Eve's father) before the age of ten. Eve realizes Lombard wants something, and her suspicions come true when Lombard tries to blackmail her for $2 million. When Eve refuses, Lombard tries to blackmail Roarke, who also refuses. Shortly after, Lombard is found dead. At first it seems like a classical murder; Lombard has been hit on the head by a blunt murder weapon and articles of clothing, her purse, and her tele-link are missing. Eve Dallas however, who is familiar with Trudy Lombard, does not believe it to be so clear a homicide, and Trudy Lombard's daughter in law, Zana Kline, seems too innocent to not have a hand in the murder; however, because there is no evidence pointing to her, Eve becomes extremely frustrated. At the end of the book it is revealed that Zana is in fact one of the children Lombard had fostered.

He played a prominent part in his brother's military campaigns, most notably in the crucial victory at the Battle of Pelagonia, but also in repeated campaigns against Epirus and against the Turks in Asia Minor. He retired from active service after his defeat at Neopatras, and died shortly after. Biography =Early life and first successes= Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259‚Äì1282). John Doukas Palaiologos was born sometime after 1225 and before 1230, the son of Andronikos Palaiologos, the megas domestikos of the Empire of Nicaea, and his first wife Theodora Palaiologina. John was their second son, after the future emperor Michael Palaiologos, and the fourth child overall... Nothing is known of him until 1256, when he appears to have been sent to Rhodes. The reasons for this is unclear; possibly to take charge of the military, fill an administrative post, or as an exile, is unknown.. He appears again in 1258, when he participated in the coup launched by his elder brother Michael Palaiologos, then megas konostaulos, against the regent for the underage John IV Laskaris (r. 1258‚Äì1261), George Mouzalon. After Mouzalon's murder, Michael placed the young emperor under the protection of John and their half-brother Constantine.. Michael quickly secured his own nomination as regent, and in turn appointed John as megas domestikos and sent him to command the Nicaean army in Macedonia, with Alexios Strategopoulos and John Raoul Petraliphas as subordinate commanders... After his coronation as co-emperor in early 1259, Michael raised his brother further to the rank of sebastokrator (Strategopoulos succeeded him as megas domestikos), and arranged a marriage to a daughter of the general .. Michael then ordered John to attack Michael II, the ruler of the rival Byzantine Greek state of Epirus. The Nicaean army advanced so quickly that they caught the Epirote army by surprise at its camp at Kastoria, and forced it to flee in disorder. John then proceeded to retake the fortresses of Deabolis and Ochrid, only recently captured by the Epirotes. The cities fell after short sieges, and the plain of Pelagonia, with the town of Bitola, and around Lake Prespa, was subjugated.; . Michael of Epirus, however, marshalled his forces, and was reinforced with men from the Principality of Achaea and the Latin states of southern Greece under Prince William II of Villehardouin himself, as well as a Sicilian contingent. Further forces were provided by Michael II's illegitimate son, John Doukas, ruler of Thessaly.. The allied force was clearly superior in numbers to the Nicaean army, and John Palaiologos avoided direct confrontation, using his mobile Turkish and Cuman horse archers instead to wear down the opposing forces. In addition, the allied army was divided by conflicting aims and the hatred between the Epirote Greeks and the Latins. A quarrel with William II led to the withdrawal of the Epirote army and the temporary defection of John Doukas to the Nicaean camp. The next day, the Nicaean forces attacked the Latins and secured a crushing victory; William II himself and many other barons were taken prisoner, while most of the Latin soldiery was killed or captured.; . In the aftermath of this success, John Palaiologos joined by the forces of John Doukas, marched south into Thessaly, seizing and fortifying its fortresses, until he reached the town of Neopatras, where he made his camp for a time. He then continued on into Boeotia; the territory of the Duchy of Athens, where he took and plundered Levadeia and Thebes. At this point, however, John Doukas defected back to his father, upsetting the balance of power and John himself was soon after recalled to Lampsacus. Thus, his conquest of Greece remained incomplete and was soon reversed by the recovery of Epirus' fortunes... =Later years and death= Map of the Byzantine Empire and the surrounding states in circa 1265. At Lampsacus, John met with his brother, who rewarded his victories with the title of despotes, the second after the emperor himself in the Byzantine hierarchy, while his father-in-law Tornikes and his half- brother Constantine were raised to sebastokratores. Then, or sometime after, he was also given the islands of Rhodes and Lesbos as personal domains (pronoiai).. In July 1261, Constantinople was recovered and the Byzantine Empire restored with Michael VIII as sole emperor. In the meantime, however, things had been going badly in Epirus, where Michael II had recovered his realm and was once again threatening imperial possessions in Macedonia. In 1261, John was sent on campaign against the Epirotes.; . After long and hard fighting, in the summer of 1263/1264 he achieved a major victory, which forced Michael II to come to terms: the Epirote ruler acknowledged imperial suzerainty, and his son and heir, Nikephoros, was married to Anna Palaiologina Kantakouzene, a niece of Michael VIII.. After this success, he was sent to Asia Minor, where the Turkish raids on the Byzantine borderlands had become a menace, and where Turkish settlers had begun encroaching upon imperial territory. He remained there until 1267 and achieved some success, securing the lands around the valley of the Maeander River and restoring the defences of the region. The historian George Pachymeres certainly praised his conduct of these operations, and alleged that the mere mention of his approach caused fear to his enemies.. In the late 1260s, John returned to Europe, and there is evidence of his activity in Macedonia and Thessaly. He had estates in the valley of the river Strymon in Macedonia, and is attested in documents concerning the properties of monasteries in eastern Thessaly, which the Byzantines had probably recovered by that time, following the death of Michael II of Epirus in 1267/1268... John Doukas of Thessaly, however, remained one of the Empire's chief opponents, and Michael Palaiologos organized a campaign (variously dated to 1272/1273 or 1274/1275) to finally subdue him. It was a large-scale undertaking: an army of some 30,000 men, mostly mercenaries, was placed under the command of John Palaiologos and Alexios Kaballarios, while the land forces were to be aided by a fleet of over 70 vessels under Alexios Philanthropenos.. The campaign was initially crowned with success, as the Byzantine army advanced quickly through Thessaly and besieged John Doukas at his capital Neopatras. The latter, however, was able to escape in secret, procure aid from the Duchy of Athens, and utterly defeat the besieging Byzantine army at the Battle of Neopatras.; . With his forces scattered, John Palaiologos retreated to the north; on his way, he learned of an attack by the Latin fleet on the Byzantine navy at Demetrias. Assembling whatever men he could find, the despotes led his troops in a forty-mile ride, through the night, towards Demetrias. There they encountered the battle in full swing, and the Latins having the advantage. The arrival of fresh troops, however, tilted the balance, and the battle ended in a crushing Byzantine victory.; . Despite his contribution to the victory at Demetrias, John Palaiologos was shattered by the loss of his army at Neopatras. According to the Byzantine sources, he resigned his title of despotes (although some modern historians have postulated that it was revoked by his brother), and appears to have died shortly after (1273/1274 or 1274/1275, depending on the dating of the Thessalian campaign).; .

Terumasa fought in many of the battles of the late Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period, and due to his service at the Battle of Sekigahara, received a fief at Himeji. His childhood name was Araokojimaru (ËçíÂ∞æÂè§Êñ∞‰∏∏). He was the son of Ikeda Tsuneoki and brother of Ikeda Sen.  Background  203x203pxThe 2nd son and heir of Ikeda Nobuteru, Terumasa held Ikejiri Castle (Mino Province) and joined his father in fighting for Hideyoshi in the Komaki Campaign (1584). He led troops at Nagakute (1584), the battle in which his father was killed. In 1590, following the transfer of Tokugawa Ieyasu to the Kanto, Terumasa was established at Yoshida in Mikawa, a 152,000-koku fief. In 1594 Terumasa married one of Tokugawa's daughters, and after Hideyoshi's death in 1598, the Ikeda drifted into Ieyasu's camp.  Battle of Sekigahara  When the Sekigahara Campaign began in the fall of 1600, Terumasa immediately sided with his father-in-law, Tokugawa. On 28 September he competed with Fukushima Masanori to be the first to attack Gifu, held by Oda Hidenobu. At the Battle of Sekigahara, Ikeda commanded 4,560 troops in the rear guard and saw some desultory fighting with Chosokabe Morichika's contingent as the battle wound down. Following the Tokugawa victory, Terumasa was given a 520,000-koku fief and the province of Harima. He expanded the Himeji Castle, which he completed in 1609. In 1603 Bizen was added to Terumasa's territory, and this he assigned to his eldest son, Toshitaka (1584‚Äì1616). By the time of Terumasa's death in 1613, the Ikeda had grown to rule over Harima, Bizen, Inaba, and Awaji, with a combined income of around 1,000,000-koku. Following the death of Toshitaka, the Tokugawa Bakufu took steps to reduce the alarming power of the Ikeda and eventually reduced the family to Tottori (Inaba) and Okayama (Bizen).

It has about 500 inhabitants. It lies on the S√°zava River. The centre of the market town is historically significant and is protected by law as Urban monument zone. History The first written record of Rataje nad S√°zavou dates back to 1156. It acknowledges that Rataje existed as a stronghold and market place. There are not any written reports about the exact date of its origin but it was probably about 946. A castle, partly brick, partly wooden was founded on the place of the current castle in the middle of the 10th century. The castle was built as a border fortress of the Zlic region. This was proved by finding bronze and ceramic ornaments from 1890 when a road around the castle was built. Rataje was rebuilt after a large fire in the middle of the 13th century. It was the property of the king at that time. John of Bohemia gave Rataje to Henry of Lip√°. The lords of Lipa also built a lower castle called Pirk≈°tejn. Hynce Pt√°ƒçek of Pirkstein gained Rataje in 1420. He was the highest hofmeister and m√ºnzmeister of the Bohemian kingdom, an administrator of the royal towns including Kutna Hora and a guardian of the future king, George of Podƒõbrady. This is the most important holder of Rataje and is buried in the family tomb in the local church. Many noble families owned Rataje later on. For example, Ladislav, V√°clav and Jan of Male≈°ice started the reconstruction of the Renaissance part of the ch√¢teau in the era from 1531 to 1579. In 1656 William Francis of Talmberk started the reconstruction of the entire ch√¢teau and his son Frantisek Maxmilian Leopold finished it. Rataje was held by the Liechtenstein family from 1772 to 1919. The municipality of Rataje bought the ch√¢teau in 1933 and placed a municipal office, post office, police station and school there. Present Although the municipality once had several hotels these are now largely closed as of 2016. Sights * Pirk≈°tejn Castle which is now closed was first mentioned in 1366.

The word comes from meaning truth and similis meaning similar. Oxford English Dictionary Online, Second Edition 1989. Language philosopher Steve Neale distinguishes between two types: cultural verisimilitude, meaning plausibility of the fictional work within the cultural and/or historical context of the real world, outside of the work; and generic verisimilitude, meaning plausibility of a fictional work within the bounds of its own genre (so that, for example, characters regularly singing about their feelings is a believable action within the fictional universe of a musical). Original roots Verisimilitude has its roots in both the Platonic and Aristotelian dramatic theory of mimesis, the imitation or representation of nature. For a piece of art to hold significance or persuasion for an audience, according to Plato and Aristotle, it must have grounding in reality. This idea laid the foundation for the evolution of mimesis into verisimilitude in the Middle Ages particularly in Italian heroic poetry. During this time more attention was invested in pinning down fiction with theory. This shift manifested itself in increased focus on unity in heroic poetry. No matter how fictionalized the language of a poem might be, through verisimilitude, poets had the ability to present their works in a way that could still be believed in the real world. Verisimilitude at this time also became connected to another Aristotelian dramatic principle, decorum: the realistic union of style and subject. Poetic language of characters in a work of fiction as a result had to be appropriate in terms of the age, gender or race of the character. This classical notion of verisimilitude focused on the role of the reader in his/her engagement in the fictional work of art. The goal of the novel therefore, as it became a more popular form of verisimilitude, was to instruct and offer a pleasurable experience to the reader. The novel had to facilitate the reader's willingness to suspend his/her disbelief, a phrase used originally by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Verisimilitude became the means to accomplish this mindset. To promote the willing suspension of disbelief, a fictional text needed to have credibility. Anything physically possible in the worldview of the reader or humanity's experience was defined as credible. Through verisimilitude then, the reader was able to glean truth even in fiction because it would reflect realistic aspects of human life. Continued evolution The idea that credibility, and in turn verisimilitude, rested on the reader's sense of the world encountered opposition because of the dilemma it created: every reader and every person does not have the same knowledge of the world. This kind of theory suggests that the novel consisted of distinct parts. The way novelists avoided this dilemma initially was by adding a preface to the work of fiction stating its credibility or by including more references to known history within the text of the fiction. As more criticism on the novel surfaced, the inclusion of a preface or a scattering of some historical references was not enough to engage the reader. French theorist Pierre Nicolas Desmolets' notion that the author should obscure the fiction or art of the novel to avoid destroying illusion: the made up attributes of the text. The novel before was perceived as a work of distinct parts. Now the novel was not thought of in terms of separate parts, but rather as a work as a whole. The novel was a total illusion of life within itself. It was a closed fictional world that could establish its own rules and laws. Verisimilitude then became deeply rooted in structure. The focus of credibility did not rest solely on the external world of the reader; the novel's credibility then could be seen in terms of the novel's own internal logic. The focus of verisimilitude was no longer concerned with the reader. The focus shifted to the novel itself. Verisimilitude was a technical problem to resolve within the context of the novel's fictional world. Detail centered on the creation of a logical cause web in the text that then could reinforce the overarching structural logic of the plot. Postmodern perspective During the rise of the postmodern novel, some critics suggested that truth or significance lies beyond verisimilitude and that only by complete non-discursive freedom to encounter a novel could meaning truly be discovered. Verisimilitude, they argued, was not the first aspect of the text a reader experiences. The reader instead first tries to observe if the novel works as an intelligible narrative. The lens of verisimilitude is applied only after the reader establishes if the novel makes sense or not. The reader can understand the novel as art but not necessarily as a cultural construction. The novel should challenge the construction of reality. In this sense, it was possible for art to precede reality. Reality had to catch up to the text rather than text staying present to reality. A boundary existed establishing that text does not belong to a current time or situation. In the postmodern context, verisimilitude was less of a concern for the novelist according to some critics. Application of the concept in the arts In the production of the classic superhero film, Superman, director Richard Donner had a picture of the title character holding a sash with the word \\"verisimilitude\\" on it in his office during the project. That display was to remind Donner that he intended to approach the story of the fantasy superhero in a way true to the source material that would make it feel intuitively real to the audience within the context of the story's world. The result was a highly acclaimed film that would set the standard for a film genre that would become dominant decades later.

Events An England cricket team toured Australia and New Zealand in the winter of 1876‚Äì77 and, in March 1877, took part with Australia in the first two matches to be designated as Tests. Domestic cricket The 1876‚Äì77 Australian cricket season focused on the touring England team and featured no first-class matches between the colonies. New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania were unable to arrange fixtures as in previous seasons. Club cricket matches were played in most of the colonies. In 1877‚Äì78, South Australia in its inaugural first-class match defeated Tasmania by an innings and 13 runs at the Adelaide Oval, this being the initial first-class match at that famous venue. New South Wales defeated Victoria twice. At the Melbourne Cricket Ground, NSW won by an innings and 6 runs. Then, in the initial first- class match at the Sydney Cricket Ground, NSW won by 1 wicket. The colonies continued to arrange matches against each other on an ad hoc basis through the 1880s.

One of his older brothers was Matsudaira Katamori, who later became the lord of Aizu. In 1859, Tetsunosuke was adopted to succeed the newly deceased Matsudaira Sadamichi as lord of the Kuwana Domain. He was betrothed to Sadamichi's 3-year-old daughter Hatsu, thus formalizing the adoption. Coming of age, he took the name Sadaaki.

Left to right: Matsudaira Sadaaki, Matsudaira Katamori, Tokugawa Mochinaga, and Tokugawa Yoshikatsu Sadaaki fought in the Boshin War (1868-1869), leading Kuwana forces during the fighting in northern Japan. He was together with Katamori until the start of the siege of Aizu, when Katamori asked him to leave and seek reinforcements from the other clans of the Northern Alliance.Yamakawa, Kenjir≈ç (1933). Aizu Boshin Senshi. p. 523. Sadaaki followed his brother's advice and headed for the Yonezawa Domain. After the fall of Yonezawa and the defeat of the Alliance, Sadaaki embarked on Enomoto Takeaki's warships at Matsushima Bay, and went on to the Ezo Republic.Yamakawa, p. 505. He was brought to Yokohama at the war's end, where he formally surrendered. After a few years in confinement, he was pardoned and released in 1872. It was soon after his release that he finally married Matsudaira Hatsu, who had just turned 16. Matsudaira Sadaaki in Western uniform during the Bakumatsu period as Kyoto Shoshidai Sadaaki joined the Imperial Japanese Army during the Satsuma Rebellion, leading a group of former Kuwana samurai and heading for Ky≈´sh≈´. Later in life, he served as one of the head priests of T≈çsh≈çg≈´ Shrine, along with his brother Katamori, and his brother's former chief kar≈ç, Saig≈ç Tanomo. He also lived in Tokyo for some time, and had an avid interest in music; Clara Whitney, an American resident of Tokyo, notes in her diary that he was a skilled organ player. Sadaaki and Hatsu had two children, Toshi and Masao, both of whom died in infancy. However, Sadaaki also had a concubine; it was this concubine who bore him a son (Sadaharu) who survived to adulthood. He also had a daughter by another woman; this daughter married Sakai Tadakazu. Sadaaki died at age 61, and is buried in the Somei Cemetery in Tokyo. Cultural references Matsudaira Sadaaki has appeared as a character in many works of fiction, usually in works about his brother and Aizu. In the 1987 TV miniseries Byakkotai, he was portrayed by Hashinosuke Nakamura.\\"Matsudaira sono ichi\\" In NHK's 1998 Taiga drama Tokugawa Yoshinobu, J≈ç Watanabe portrayed him. He also appears briefly in episode 7 of the anime Clockwork Fighters, Hiwou's war. Notes References * Meyer, Eva-Maria. (1999).

It is a tributary of the River Bure. It's spring is in the North Norfolk village of Aylmerton west of the main street. It eventually merges, after with the River Bure at Ingworth just north of the Blickling Hall estate. There are two watermills on the beck, both of which are no longer in working order. A third windmill at Gresham stands on Gur Beck, a small tributary of Scarrow Beck. The source The spring of Scarrow Beck is in a small area of marshy ground in fields south of Aylmerton parish church close to Church Lane. The beck flows east, south, east through a man-made ditch across open fields towards the national trust estate of Felbrigg Hall. At the Boundary of the estate it enters a culvert under a lane and turns south, south, east. During the middle part of the 18th century the beck was dammed to form Felbrigg pond which was part of the landscape plans of the Estate. It is reputed but not confirmed that the forming of the pond may have been the early work of Humphry Repton, who, in 1778, lived close to the estate in Old Hall, Sustead. From the pond the beck flows on out of the estate and towards the village of Metton passing along the northern boundary of the water works in the village. Here it turns to the south crossing under the lane on the western outskirts of the village. Once again the beck has been ditched by man and crosses arable farm land. It is here that a tributary joins the beck from Gresham called Gur Beck. 200 meters from the merger the beck flows through Big Fen Plantation before reappearing on Hanworth Common. The Beck now flows around the western edge of the Common and is greatly supplemented by several small ditches, ponds and areas of marshy springs. After passing under Ringsbank Lane the beck skirts some woodland before supplying several large boomerang shaped ponds in Thurgarton woods. The next village is Aldborough and it is here, south of the village, that Scarrow Beck was the supply for the first of the two watermills on the beck. Aldborough watermill There has been a watermilll at Aldborough at the buildings present location since before the Domesday Book although the present building, now a private dwelling, was built around 150 years ago. The Waterwheel was removed around 1930 and replaced with a diesel engine. In 1950, the Millpond that was fed by Scarrow Beck was bulldozed in and the beck was diverted away from the mill buildings. Today, there is no trace of the millrace or the old watercourse of Scarrow beck.  Erpingham watermill  Erpingham watermill was demolished in 1965 and stood in a meadow on the eastern bank of Scarrow bank between the villages of Calthorpe and Erpingham. This watermill was recorded as the smallest watermill in the county of Norfolk and was not very efficient due to the lack of water supply from the Scarrow Beck. The mill relied for its water power on a hand dug watercourse from the near-by beck which remnants can still be found in the meadow. The mill itself was a timber structure constructed upon foundation and ground floor of brickwork construction. The upper floor of the mill was clad in shiplap weatherboarding. The roof was constructed using traditional Norfolk red pantile. At one time there was also a Smock windmill on the site but this was also demolished sometime in the 1890s. The two mills were owned by the Johnson family until they were sold at the turn of the 19th century when the site was purchased by a Mr Witham.

He has said that he never wanted to be a pilot, but rather in an \\"elite paratrooper unit\\". Gil stated that he \\"was forced to go to the tests for the pilot course, which are like a game, so I played along and I was accepted against my will\\". He had no intention of staying on in regular service, but did so because \\"we were taught to bear the burden\\". Gil flew fighter jets, and flew missions in the Six-Day War, the War of Attrition and the Yom Kippur War. Gil eventually became a Squadron Commander (253 Squadron), and retired from regular duty in 1985, but still kept flying for another 18 years until he was 60 years old. Gil's last flight was on June 20, 2003. Gil has set the Guinness World Record for being the longest-flying fighter pilot.\\"Israeli Airman Attains New Heights in Painting,\\" Michelle Fram Cohen, Navigator Review of Politics and Culture, May 2004 Documentary In 2008, Gil was featured in an Israel documentary titled The Best Pilot in the World. The film was directed by Dr. Amir Har-Gil. In the film, Gil talks about his over 41 years of service in the Israeli Air Force, and the many enemy planes he shot down. Gil stated in the film that he was the only pilot who had downed planes in all the wars. Painter Wilfred Israel Museum Gil started painting as a pastime when he was in his late twenties while still a career officer in the Israeli Air Force. When he was 42, he left his career in the Air Force to devote his time to painting but continued to fly as a reserve officer until his retirement in June 2003. After leaving the Air Force, Gil moved with his wife to Ein Hod, an artist's village on the coast of the Mediterranean. Gil started doing commissioned portraits, including a portrait from a photograph of Ayn Rand. Gil likes to paint still-life paintings and innocently sensual nudes. In 1995 and 1998, Gil had two shows at the Wilfred Israel Museum in Northern Israel. Gil has also exhibited some of his work in Israeli galleries, but the reviews of his work have been lukewarm or nonexistent.

At the 2001 Singapore International Film Festival the film won the FIPRESCI Prize and the Silver Screen Award for Best Asian Actor which went to the poet Ibrahim Kadir, who played himself. The film was also nominated at for the Silver Screen Award for Best Asian Feature Film, while Nugroho won the Silver Leopard Video Award at the Locarno International Film Festival. Plot In 1965, Ibrahim Kadir (played by himself) is falsely arrested after being accused of being a communist or communist sympathizer. While imprisoned, he meets other inmates who have also been falsely imprisoned. Together, they sing the traditional poetic form didong, and attempt to band together. However, every day more prisoners are taken outside and executed. While alone, Kadir thinks of the crimes committed by the military that he has witnessed, including the killings of unarmed women and children, as well as the execution of the wrongfully incarcerated. He continues to hear the voices of the past as the number of prisoners dwindles done to a few; he is eventually released after spending 22 days in prison. Production According to the film's director Garin Nugroho, he wrote Puisi Tak Terkuburkan to \\"reinterpret the wounds of history\\" after being offered Rp 60 million (US$7,000) to write a script after finishing Daun di Atas Bantal. At the time, he intended to make three films: one regarding Aceh, one regarding Papua, and one about the youth movement, choosing areas of potential conflict. Anne Rutherford, a senior lecturer on cinema studies at the University of Western Sydney, notes that Puisi Tak Terkuburkan was the first Indonesian movie to discuss the 1965‚Äì1966 communist purge. It was produced during a \\"wave\\" of Indonesian films criticizing former president Suharto's New Order regime. Such films were not allowed during the New Order, and Nugroho reported that his family feared he would be killed. Puisi Tak Terkuburkan was shot in a digital video format, with shooting beginning in August 1999. Style The movie is set entirely within two prison cells and a guards' room. Nugroho uses close shots which, according to Rutherford, amplify the claustrophobia of the setting. The film is shot entirely in black and white. She describes the sound as being fluent and mobile, contrasting the claustrophobia of the shots. Nugroho himself considered the visuals secondary to the dialog. The perpetrators of the communist purges are not shown on screen. According to Rutherford, this leaves the audience wondering \\"what has gone wrong?\\". Themes The Gayo poetic form didong, contrasting two or more voices, is prominent throughout the film. During and following the communist purges, didong was used as a way to reinforce that revolutions would bring death to the perpetrators. Release and reception Puisi Tak Terkuburkan was released in 2000. Nugroho said that it was not meant to be commercial, and that he only planned to show it for several days at higher-class theatres before selling it to local television stations. It was screened at the Sydney Asia Pacific Film Festival in 2001. In February 2005, Nugroho showed the film to raise money to help the Acehnese survivors of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Awards Puisi Tak Terkuburkan received the Silver Leopard award at the 2000 Locarno International Film Festival. Kadir won Best Actor at Cinefan film festival in India in 2001; that same year, he received best actor at the Singapore International Film Festival, with the film winning a jury prize for best film.

He added Fatio in 1844 to distinguish himself from a businessman of the same name. It was apparently in reference to a Swiss branch of the family. Biography When he still very young his father, √âtienne-Louis Morel, moved the family to Paris to open a bank. He was enrolled at the prestigious Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand, but he was dismissed for lack of discipline in 1824. He finished his studies at the Lyc√©e Condorcet (then known as the Coll√®ge Royal de Bourbon). In 1827, he enlisted as a pilot on a British merchant ship to learn navigation. Upon his return he began work at the family bank, but spent much of his time decorating the account books with ornamentation. His family then placed him with the banking firm of , but he soon renounced the profession.Histoire du Lyc√©e Bonaparte (Coll√®ge Bourbon), de Lefeuve (Charles), p. 239 and 240. His artistic inclinations led him to keep company with the marine painter, Adolphe- Hippolyte Couveley. He briefly studied with several artists, and made trips to Italy, but his career began in earnest in 1830, when he accompanied an expedition to Algeria and witnessed the actions of naval commander Guy-Victor Duperr√©. He made sketches and created two paintings that were exhibited at the Salon in 1833 with great success. He would be a regular exhibitor there from that time on. In 1838, he was commissioned by Horace Vernet, Director of the Acad√©mie de France √† Rome, to accompany him in a French squadron to Mexico, witness and paint what would become known as the Battle of Veracruz. The following year, he was part of a squadron commanded by Admiral Julien Pierre Anne Lalande and debarked in Istanbul, where he witnessed a fire that broke out in Pera, spread to Galata and threatened to destroy the wealthiest part of the city. In 1840, he painted a scene depicting the remains of Napoleon being returned to France from St. Helena. He would later accompany President Louis Napol√©on Bonaparte on his travels. In 1845, he married Louise Fran√ßoise Aim√©e Ernestine du Chastel (1815-1876), the daughter of Mar√©chal de Camp, . They had two children; a son and a daughter. in 1846, he was named a Chevalier in the Legion of Honor.Listing @ the Base L√©onore In 1849, he was appointed Deputy Curator at the Naval Museum in the Louvre. Three years later, following the resignation of , he became the Director as well. He was named a Peintre de la Marine in 1853. In 1854, he took part in the Crimean War as an official painter and witnessed the Battle of Bomarsund. Upon his return, he and Jean- Baptiste Henri Durand-Brager published views of the coast of the Black Sea. Shortly after, he visited Scandinavia, Normandy and Brittany, where he painted scenes of old ships. In 1857, he was promoted to full Curator at the museum.Alain Niderlinder, ¬´ Le Mus√©e de la Marine et ses collections : √©l√©ments chronologiques ¬ª in Neptunia, n¬∞195, sept. 1994, pp. 41-50. He served as the first Mayor of the 20th Arrondissement of Paris from 1860 to 1869. He died in 1871, during the Franco-Prussian War. While standing on a balcony at the Louvre, observing events, he saw the Prussian Army invading the museum and suffered a fatal heart attack.

RTA incident In 2005, Deputy-Minister of Information and Culture Saied Aqa Husain Sancharaki stated that a copyright law was forthcoming, which prompted the National Independent Commission for Radio and Television Broadcasting to circulate a statement requesting that media outlets either pay royalties or cease distributing material that had been created by Radio Television Afghanistan as the outlet began transforming to a public broadcaster. It was later pointed out that RTA had no right to make such an autonomous declaration. The move was criticised by the heads of Ayna TV and Tolo TV, who argued that the cost of royalties meant that potential independent media outlets could not afford to broadcast, and the lack of independent media in the country meant broadcasters relied on RTA footage to play \\"a significant cultural role...filling this void\\".

Properly done, such a seal is hermetic (vacuum tight, good electrical insulation, special optical properties e.g. UV lamps). To achieve such a seal, two properties must hold: # The molten glass must be capable of wetting the metal, in order to form a tight bond, and # The thermal expansion of the glass and metal must be closely matched so that the seal remains solid as the assembly cools. Thinking for example about a metal wire in a glass bulb sealing, the metal glass contact can break if the CTEs (coefficient of thermal expansion) are not well aligned. For the case that the CTE of the metal is larger than the CTE of the glass, the sealing shows a high probability to break upon cooling. By lowering the temperature, the metal wire shrinks more than the glass does, leading to a strong tensile force on the glass, which finally lead to breakage. On the other hand, if the CTE of the glass is larger than the CTE of the metal wire, the seal will tighten upon cooling since compression force is applied on the glass. Commercially available sealing and solder glasses Thermal expansion data for some metals and alloys According to all requirements that need to be fulfilled and the strong necessity to align the CTE of both materials, there only a few companies offering specialty glass for glass-metal sealing. Such as SCHOTT AG and Morgan Advanced Materials. Glass-to-metal bonds Glass and metal can bond together by purely mechanical means, which usually gives weaker joints, or by chemical interaction, where the oxide layer on the metal surface forms a strong bond with the glass. The acid-base reactions are main causes of interaction between glass-metal in the presence of metal oxides on the surface of metal. After complete dissolution of the surface oxides into the glass, further progress of interaction depends on the oxygen activity at the interface. The oxygen activity can be increased by diffusion of molecular oxygen through some defects like cracks. Also, reduction of the thermodynamically less stable components in the glass (and releasing the oxygen ions) can increase the oxygen activity at the interface. In other words, the redox reactions are main causes of interaction between glass-metal in the absence of metal oxides on the surface of metal. For achieving a vacuum-tight seal, the seal must not contain bubbles. The bubbles are most commonly created by gases escaping the metal at high temperature; degassing the metal before its sealing is therefore important, especially for nickel and iron and their alloys. This is achieved by heating the metal in vacuum or sometimes in hydrogen atmosphere or in some cases even in air at temperatures above those used during the sealing process. Oxidizing of the metal surface also reduces gas evolution. Most of the evolved gas is produced due to the presence of carbon impurities in the metals; these can be removed by heating in hydrogen. The glass-oxide bond is stronger than glass-metal. The oxide forms a layer on the metal surface, with the proportion of oxygen changing from zero in the metal to the stoichiometry of the oxide and the glass itself. A too-thick oxide layer tends to be porous on the surface and mechanically weak, flaking, compromising the bond strength and creating possible leakage paths along the metal-oxide interface. Proper thickness of the oxide layer is therefore critical. =Copper= Metallic copper does not bond well to glass. Copper(I) oxide, however, is wetted by molten glass and partially dissolves in it, forming a strong bond. The oxide also bonds well to the underlying metal. But copper(II) oxide causes weak joints that may leak and its formation must be prevented. For bonding copper to glass, the surface needs to be properly oxidized. The oxide layer is to have the right thickness; too little oxide would not provide enough material for the glass to anchor to, too much oxide would cause the oxide layer to fail, and in both cases the joint would be weak and possibly non-hermetic. To improve the bonding to glass, the oxide layer should be borated; this is achieved by e.g. dipping the hot part into a concentrated solution of borax and then heating it again for certain time. This treatment stabilizes the oxide layer by forming a thin protective layer of sodium borate on its surface, so the oxide does not grow too thick during subsequent handling and joining. The layer should have uniform deep red to purple sheen. The boron oxide from the borated layer diffuses into glass and lowers its melting point. The oxidation occurs by oxygen diffusing through the molten borate layer and forming copper(I) oxide, while formation of copper(II) oxide is inhibited. The copper-to-glass seal should look brilliant red, almost scarlet; pink, sherry and honey colors are also acceptable. Too thin an oxide layer appears light, up to the color of metallic copper, while too thick oxide looks too dark. Oxygen-free copper has to be used if the metal comes in contact with hydrogen (e.g. in a hydrogen-filled tube or during handling in the flame). Normally, copper contains small inclusions of copper(I) oxide. Hydrogen diffuses through the metal and reacts with the oxide, reducing it to copper and yielding water. The water molecules however can not diffuse through the metal, are trapped in the location of the inclusion, and cause embrittlement. As copper(I) oxide bonds well to the glass, it is often used for combined glass-metal devices. The ductility of copper can be used for compensation of the thermal expansion mismatch in e.g. the knife-edge seals. For wire feed throughs, dumet wire ‚Äì nickel-iron alloy plated with copper ‚Äì is frequently used. Its maximum diameter is however limited to about 0.5 mm due to its thermal expansion. Copper can be sealed to glass without the oxide layer, but the resulting joint is less strong. =Platinum= Platinum has similar thermal expansion as glass and is well-wetted with molten glass. It however does not form oxides, its bond strength is lower. The seal has metallic color and limited strength. =Gold= Like platinum, gold does not form oxides that could assist in bonding. Glass-gold bonds are therefore metallic in color and weak. Gold tends to be used for glass-metal seals only rarely. Special compositions of soda-lime glasses that match the thermal expansion of gold, containing tungsten trioxide and oxides of lanthanum, aluminum and zirconium, exist. =Silver= Silver forms a thin layer of silver oxide on its surface. This layer dissolves in molten glass and forms silver silicate, facilitating a strong bond. =Nickel= Nickel can bond with glass either as a metal, or via the nickel(II) oxide layer. The metal joint has metallic color and inferior strength. The oxide-layer joint has characteristic green-grey color. Nickel plating can be used in similar way as copper plating, to facilitate better bonding with the underlying metal. =Iron= Iron is only rarely used for feedthroughs, but frequently gets coated with vitreous enamel, where the interface is also a glass-metal bond. The bond strength is also governed by the character of the oxide layer on its surface. A presence of cobalt in the glass leads to a chemical reaction between the metallic iron and cobalt oxide, yielding iron oxide dissolved in glass and cobalt alloying with the iron and forming dendrites, growing into the glass and improving the bond strength. Iron can not be directly sealed to lead glass, as it reacts with the lead oxide and reduces it to metallic lead. For sealing to lead glasses, it has to be copper-plated or an intermediate lead-free glass has to be used. Iron is prone to creating gas bubbles in glass due to the residual carbon impurities; these can be removed by heating in wet hydrogen. Plating with copper, nickel or chromium is also advised. =Chromium= Chromium is a highly reactive metal present in many iron alloys. Chromium may react with glass, reducing the silicon and forming crystals of chromium silicide growing into the glass and anchoring together the metal and glass, improving the bond strength. =Kovar= Kovar, an iron- nickel-cobalt alloy, has low thermal expansion similar to high-borosilicate glass and is frequently used for glass-metal seals especially for the application in x-ray tubes or glass lasers. It can bond to glass via the intermediate oxide layer of nickel(II) oxide and cobalt(II) oxide; the proportion of iron oxide is low due to its reduction with cobalt. The bond strength is highly dependent on the oxide layer thickness and character. The presence of cobalt makes the oxide layer easier to melt and dissolve in the molten glass. A grey, grey-blue or grey-brown color indicates a good seal. A metallic color indicates lack of oxide, while black color indicates overly oxidized metal, in both cases leading to a weak joint. =Molybdenum= Molybdenum bonds to the glass via the intermediate layer of molybdenum(IV) oxide. Due to its low thermal expansion coefficient, matched to glass, molybdenum, like tungsten, is often used for glass-metal bonds especially in conjunction with aluminium-silicate glass. Its high electrical conductivity makes it superior over nickel-cobalt-iron alloys. It is favored by the lighting industry as feedthroughs for lightbulbs and other devices. Molybdenum oxidizes much faster than tungsten and quickly develops a thick oxide layer that does not adhere well, its oxidation should be therefore limited to just yellowish or at most blue-green color. The oxide is volatile and evaporates as a white smoke above 700 ¬∞C; excess oxide can be removed by heating in inert gas (argon) at 1000 ¬∞C. Molybdenum strips are used instead of wires where higher currents (and higher cross-sections of the conductors) are needed. =Tungsten= Tungsten bonds to the glass via the intermediate layer of tungsten(VI) oxide. A properly formed bond has characteristic coppery/orange/brown-yellow color in lithium-free glasses; in lithium- containing glasses the bond is blue due to formation of lithium tungstate. Due to its low thermal expansion coefficient, matched to glass, tungsten is frequently used for glass-metal bonds. Tungsten forms satisfying bonds with glasses with similar thermal expansion coefficient such as high-borosilicate glass. The surface of both the metal and glass should be smooth, without scratches. Tungsten has the lowest expansion coefficient of metals and the highest melting point. =Stainless steel= 304 Stainless steel forms bonds with glass via an intermediate layer of chromium(III) oxide and iron(III) oxide. Further reactions of chromium, forming chromium silicide dendrites, are possible. The thermal expansion coefficient of steel is however fairly different from the glass; like with copper, this can be alleviated by using knife-edge (Houskeeper) seals. =Zirconium= Zirconium wire can be sealed to glass with just little treatment ‚Äì rubbing with abrasive paper and short heating in flame. Zirconium is used in applications demanding chemical resistance or lack of magnetism. =Titanium= Titanium, like zirconium, can be sealed to some glasses with just little treatment. =Indium= Indium and some of its alloys can be used as a solder capable of wetting glass, ceramics, and metals and joining them together. Indium has low melting point and is very soft; the softness allows it to deform plastically and absorb the stresses from thermal expansion mismatches. Due to its very low vapor pressure, indium finds use in glass-metal seals used in vacuum technology and cryogenic applications. =Gallium= Gallium is a soft metal with melting point at 30 ¬∞C. It readily wets glasses and most metals and can be used for seals that can be assembled/disassembled by just slight heating. It can be used as a liquid seal up to high temperatures or even at lower temperatures when alloyed with other metals (e.g. as galinstan). =Mercury= Mercury is a metal liquid at normal temperature. It was used as the earliest glass-to-metal seal and is still in use for liquid seals for e.g. rotary shafts. Mercury seal The first technological use of a glass-to-metal seal was the encapsulation of the vacuum in the barometer by Torricelli. The liquid mercury wets the glass and thus provides for a vacuum tight seal. Liquid mercury was also used to seal the metal leads of early mercury arc lamps into the fused silica bulbs. A less toxic and more expensive alternative to mercury is gallium. Mercury and gallium seals can be used for vacuum-sealing rotary shafts. Platinum wire seal The next step was to use thin platinum wire. Platinum is easily wetted by glass and has a similar coefficient of thermal expansion as typical soda- lime and lead glass. It is also easy to work with because of its non- oxidibility and high melting point. This type of seal was used in scientific equipment throughout the 19th century and also in the early incandescent lamps and radio tubes. Dumet wire seal In 1911 the Dumet-wire seal was invented which is still the common practice to seal copper leads through soda-lime or lead glass. If copper is properly oxidised before it is wetted by molten glass a vacuum tight seal of good mechanical strength can be obtained. After copper is oxidized, it is often dipped in a borax solution, as borating the copper helps prevents over-oxidation when reintroduced to a flame. Simple copper wire is not usable because its coefficient of thermal expansion is much higher than that of the glass. Thus, on cooling a strong tensile force acts on the glass- to-metal interface and it breaks. Glass and glass-to-metal interfaces are especially sensitive to tensile stress. Dumet-wire is a copper clad wire (about 25% of the weight of the wire is copper) with a core of nickel-iron alloy 42, an alloy with a composition of about 42% nickel. The core has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, allowing for a wire with a coefficient of radial thermal expansion which is slightly lower than the linear coefficient of thermal expansion of the glass, so that the glass-to-metal interface is under a low compression stress. It is not possible to adjust the axial thermal expansion of the wire as well. Because of the much higher mechanical strength of the nickel-iron core compared to the copper, the axial thermal expansion of the Dumet-wire is about the same as of the core. Thus, a shear stress builds up which is limited to a safe value by the low tensile strength of the copper. This is also the reason why Dumet is only useful for wire diameters lower than about 0.5 mm. In a typical Dumet seal through the base of a vacuum tube a short piece of Dumet-wire is butt welded to a nickel wire at one end and a copper wire at the other end. When the base is pressed of lead glass the Dumet-wire and a short part of the nickel and the copper wire are enclosed in the glass. Then the nickel wire and the glass around the Dumet-wire are heated by a gas flame and the glass seals to the Dumet-wire. The nickel and copper do not seal vacuum tight to the glass but are mechanically supported. The butt welding also avoids problems with gas-leakages at the interface between the core wire and the copper. Copper tube seal Three types of copper tube seals (from Bell System Technical Journal, 1922). In A, the edge of the copper is not in contact with the glass. In B and C, the copper is machined to a sharp knife edge in contact with the glass, with the glass either inside (B) or outside (C) of the copper. Another possibility to avoid a strong tensile stress when sealing copper through glass is the use of a thin walled copper tube instead of a solid wire. Here a shear stress builds up in the glass-to- metal interface which is limited by the low tensile strength of the copper combined with a low tensile stress. The copper tube is insensitive to high electric current compared to a Dumet-seal because on heating the tensile stress converts into a compression stress which is again limited by the tensile strength of the copper. Also, it is possible to lead an additional solid copper wire through the copper tube. In a later variant, only a short section of the copper tube has a thin wall and the copper tube is hindered to shrink at cooling by a ceramic tube inside the copper tube. If large parts of copper are to be fitted to glass like the water cooled copper anode of a high power radio transmitter tube or an x-ray tube historically the Houskeeper knife edge seal is used. Here the end of a copper tube is machined to a sharp knife edge, invented by O. Kruh in 1917. In the method described by W.G. Houskeeper the outside or the inside of the copper tube right to the knife edge is wetted with glass and connected to the glass tube. In later descriptions the knife edge is just wetted several millimeters deep with glass, usually deeper on the inside, and then connected to the glass tube. If copper is sealed to glass, it is an advantage to get a thin bright red containing layer between copper and glass. This is done by borating. After W.J. Scott a copper plated tungsten wire is immersed for about 30 s in chromic acid and then washed thoroughly in running tap water. Then it is dipped into a saturated solution of borax and heated to bright red heat in the oxidizing part of a gas flame. Possibly followed by quenching in water and drying. Another method is to oxidize the copper slightly in a gas flame and then to dip it into borax solution and let it dry. The surface of the borated copper is black when hot and turns to dark wine red on cooling. It is also possible to make a bright seal between copper and glass where it is possible to see the blank copper surface through the glass, but this gives less adherence than the seal with the red containing layer. If glass is melted on copper in a reducing hydrogen atmosphere the seal is extremely weak. If copper is to be heated in hydrogen-containing atmosphere e.g. a gas flame it needs to be oxygen-free to prevent hydrogen embrittlement. Copper which is meant to be used as an electrical conductor is not necessarily oxygen-free and contains particles of which react with hydrogen that diffuses into the copper to which cannot diffuse out-off the copper and thus causes embrittlement. The copper usually used in vacuum applications is of the very pure OFHC (oxygen-free-high- conductivity) quality which is both free of and deoxidising additives which might evaporate at high temperature in vacuum. Copper disc seal In the copper disc seal, as proposed by W.G. Houskeeper, the end of a glass tube is closed by a round copper disc. An additional ring of glass on the opposite side of the disc increases the possible thickness of the disc to more than 0.3 mm. Best mechanical strength is obtained if both sides of the disc are fused to the same type of glass tube and both tubes are under vacuum. The disc seal is of special practical interest because it is a simple method to make a seal to low expansion borosilicate glass without the need of special tools or materials. The keys to success are proper borating, heating of the joint to a temperature as close to the melting point of the copper as possible and to slow down the cooling, at least by packing the assembly into glass wool while it is still red hot. Matched seal Matched glass-to-metal seals In a matched seal the thermal expansion of metal and glass is matched. Copper- plated tungsten wire can be used to seal through borosilicate glass with a low coefficient of thermal expansion which is matched by tungsten. The tungsten is electrolytically copper plated and heated in hydrogen atmosphere to fill cracks in the tungsten and to get a proper surface to easily seal to glass. The borosilicate glass of usual laboratory glassware has a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than tungsten, thus it is necessary to use an intermediate sealing glass to get a stress-free seal. There are combinations of glass and iron-nickel-cobalt alloys (Kovar) where even the non-linearity of the thermal expansion is matched. These alloys can be directly sealed to glass, but then the oxidation is critical. Also, their low electrical conductivity is a disadvantage. Thus, they are often gold plated. It is also possible to use silver plating, but then an additional gold layer is necessary as an oxygen diffusion barrier to prevent the formation of iron oxide. While there are Fe-Ni alloys which match the thermal expansion of tungsten at room temperature, they are not useful to seal to glass because of a too strong increase of their thermal expansion at higher temperatures. Reed switches use a matched seal between an iron-nickel alloy (NiFe 52) and a matched glass. The glass of reed switches is usually green due to its iron content because the sealing of reed switches is done by heating with infrared radiation and this glass shows a high absorption in the near infrared. The electrical connections of high-pressure sodium vapour lamps, the light yellow lamps for street lighting, are made of niobium alloyed with 1% of zirconium.stahl und eisen 130 (2010), Vol. 2, p. 16 Historically, some television cathode ray tubes were made by using ferric steel for the funnel and glass matched in expansion to ferric steel. The steel plate used had a diffusion layer enriched with chromium at the surface made by heating the steel together with chromium oxide in a HCl-containing atmosphere. In contrast to copper, pure iron does not bond strongly to silicate glass. Also, technical iron contains some carbon which forms bubbles of CO when it is sealed to glass under oxidizing conditions. Both are a major source of problems for the technical enamel coating of steel and make direct seals between iron and glass unsuitable for high vacuum applications. The oxide layer formed on chromium-containing steel can seal vacuum tight to glass and the chromium strongly reacts with carbon. Silver- plated iron was used in early microwave tubes. It is possible to make matched seals between copper or austenitic steel and glass, but silicate glass with that high thermal expansion is especially fragile and has a low chemical durability. Halogen bulb with molybdenum foil seal Molybdenum foil seal Another widely used method to seal through glass with low coefficient of thermal expansion is the use of strips of thin molybdenum foil. This can be done with matched coefficients of thermal expansion. Then the edges of the strip also have to be knife sharp. The disadvantage here is that the tip of the edge which is a local point of high tensile stress reaches through the wall of the glass container. This can lead to low gas leakages. In the tube to tube knife edge seal the edge is either outside, inside, or buried into the glass wall. Stress trajectories in glass-to-metal compression seal with two metal leads Compression seal Semi-hermetic compressor multipole feedthrough (compression glass-to-metal-seal Another possibility of seal construction is the compression seal. This type of glass-to-metal seal can be used to feed through the wall of a metal container. Here the wire is usually matched to the glass which is inside of the bore of a strong metal part with higher coefficient of thermal expansion. Compression seals can withstand extremely high pressures and physical stress such as mechanical and thermal shock. Because glass is extremely strong in compression, compression seals can withstand very high pressures. Silver chloride Silver chloride, which melts at 457 C bonds to glass, metals and other materials and has been used for vacuum seals. Even if it can be a convenient way to seal metal into glass it will not be a true glass to metal seal but rather a combination of a glass to silver chloride and a silver chloride to metal bond; an inorganic alternative to wax or glue bonds. Design aspects Also the mechanical design of a glass-to-metal seal has an important influence on the reliability of the seal. In practical glass-to-metal seals cracks usually start at the edge of the interface between glass and metal either inside or outside the glass container. If the metal and the surrounding glass are symmetric the crack propagates in an angle away from the axis. So, if the glass envelope of the metal wire extends far enough from the wall of the container the crack will not go through the wall of the container but it will reach the surface on the same side where it started and the seal will not leak despite the crack. Another important aspect is the wetting of the metal by the glass. If the thermal expansion of the metal is higher than the thermal expansion of the glass like with the Housekeeper seal, a high contact angle (bad wetting) means that there is a high tensile stress in the surface of the glass near the metal. Such seals usually break inside the glass and leave a thin cover of glass on the metal. If the contact angle is low (good wetting) the surface of the glass is everywhere under compression stress like an enamel coating. Ordinary soda-lime glass does not flow on copper at temperatures below the melting point of the copper and, thus, does not give a low contact angle. The solution is to cover the copper with a solder glass which has a low melting point and does flow on copper and then to press the soft soda-lime glass onto the copper. The solder glass must have a coefficient of thermal expansion which is equal or a little lower than that of the soda-lime glass. Classically high lead containing glasses are used, but it is also possible to substitute these by multi-component glasses e.g. based on the system -.

Plot =Synopsis= A series of mysterious deaths in Cardiff prompts Jack to recruit UNIT medical specialist Martha Jones. The victims appear to have died from toxic shock, but their medical records have been deleted and closer examination by Owen and Martha reveals that all have been murdered. Further investigation shows that the victims have previously suffered from incurable diseases such as diabetes and HIV, but were cured of them prior to their deaths. All were participants in clinical drug trials at a secure medical research facility called The Pharm, run by the well respected medical researcher, Professor Copley. One victim, still alive when Torchwood find her, dies while being questioned and fly-like creatures erupt from her mouth. Jack and Owen confront the professor who claims only to use human subjects for advanced clinical trials of disease curing drugs, but Jack detects a strong presence of alien life forms within The Pharm, and the facility's security system proves to be beyond the ability of Torchwood to hack from the outside. Martha offers to infiltrate the facility disguised as a human test subject and is accepted after claiming to be infected with hepatitis. Once inside, Martha discovers that The Pharm uses a substance called \\"Reset\\" that releases alien parasites called Mayflies into the host's body. The parasites cure the patient of any diseases and restores them to \\"factory settings\\", but at the price of infecting the patient with the parasite. When the eggs hatch, the creatures destroy the host. Copley determines that Martha's body has experienced the effects of time travel and further connects Martha to Jack and Torchwood. Feeling that she would be a remarkable test subject, Copley injects her with multiple doses of Reset, curious to determine the effect of Mayflies on her immune system. With The Pharm's computer systems compromised by Martha, Torchwood discover the assassin employed by The Pharm to dispose of research subjects and realise he is about to kill the last living test subject. Ianto and Gwen apprehend the killer and return him to the Hub for questioning. He agrees (under duress) to help Torchwood to infiltrate The Pharm and rescue Martha, but it becomes clear that he is infected with Mayflies, likely contracted from one of his previous victims, and is about to die. Owen attempts to remove the creature with the singularity scalpel, but fails to operate the device correctly, leaving the Mayfly alive and killing the man. The team rushes to the Pharm hidden in the assassin's vehicle, using the dead man in the driver's seat to fool the security guards into letting them inside the compound. Within the Pharm, they find numerous tormented aliens being used to produce various test substances, including the mature Mayfly that is the source of Reset. They also find Martha near death in the professor's laboratory and Owen this time is able to successfully use the singularity scalpel to neutralise the Mayfly within her. Jack orders Tosh to shut down the Pharm, euthanizing all of the trapped aliens and crashing all computer systems. Before the team can depart, though, they are stopped at gunpoint by Professor Copley. Owen places himself between Martha and the gun while attempting to reason with the professor. Copley fires, hitting Owen in the chest and Jack responds by firing and killing Copley. Martha and the Torchwood team try to save Owen, but their efforts are unsuccessful. =Cultural references= *Jack refers to meeting Christopher Isherwood, and attributes the quotations \\"I am a camera\\" (in its full form, \\"I am a camera with its shutter open, quite passive, recording, not thinking.\\", from \\"Berlin Diary\\", 1930) and \\"It's not the getting in, it's the getting out\\" to him.

It has been introduced into the United States and Canada accidentally through transport in ballast water. It is caught and used for human consumption. The European flounder is oval in shape and is usually right-eyed. It normally grows about 30 cm in length, although lengths of up to 60 cm have been recorded. The upper surface is usually dull brown or olive in colour with reddish spots and brown blotches and this fish can change colour to suit its background, providing an effective camouflage. The underside is pearly-white, giving the fish one of its common names, the white fluke. The lateral line features rows of small tubercles, as do the bases of the dorsal and anal fins. Description The European flounder is a flatfish with an oval-shaped body with a width about half its length. The maximum recorded length is and the maximum recorded weight . However, a more usual mature length is about . The fish is flattened laterally and swims and rests on one side. During development, its eyes usually migrate to the right side of the fish and what appears to be its upper surface is in reality its right side. In about thirty percent of individuals, its eyes move to the left and the left side becomes uppermost. The fish has a small mouth at the end of its bluntly pointed snout. The upper surface is fawn, olive green or pale brown with spots and larger patches of darker brown and some irregular reddish spots. The under surface is opaque pearly-white giving the fish its common name of \\"white fluke\\". The lateral line is nearly straight and runs along the middle of the upper surface, curving round the short pectoral fins. The dorsal fin runs from the base of the head to beside the caudal peduncle. It has no dorsal spines but has between 53 and 62 soft rays. The anal fin also runs the length of the body and has no spines and 37 to 46 soft rays. The skin is rough, with prickly tubercles at the base of the dorsal and anal fins, and there are large scales beside the lateral line. The caudal peduncle is about half the length of the tail and the caudal fin has a squared-off end. Distribution and habitat The European flounder is native to the north eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. The range extends from the Barents Sea, White Sea and Baltic Sea to Greece, Turkey, the Black Sea and the North African coast. It has been introduced into Iran and has become established off the eastern coast of Canada and the United States, possibly getting there by way of ballast water. It is normally found from the low shore down to depths of about on sandy, shingle or muddy bottoms where its dappled colouring camouflage it and make it difficult to detect. The European flounder can also be found in estuaries where it is tolerant of low salinity levels and, unlike other species of Pleuronectidae, it often spends part of its life cycle in freshwater and regularly makes its way into rivers. In the British Isles, it has been found as far inland as Montgomeryshire on the River Severn, Dinas Mawddwy on the River Dovey and Garstang on the River Wyre. Unlike the Atlantic salmon, it feeds in the rivers and makes its way out to sea again before spawning. Biology European flounder, like other flatish, experience an eye migration during their lifetime. The European flounder lives and feeds on the seabed and in the waters immediately above. It is mainly nocturnal and during the day rests on the sea floor, semi-submerging itself in the substrate. It feeds on bivalve molluscs and other benthic invertebrates such as shrimps, polychaete worms, gastropod molluscs and small fish. The European flounder leaves freshwater in the autumn and can often be caught in estuaries when the first frosts occur. Then the fish move into deeper water for the winter. In the spring it migrates to the spawning grounds, travelling at three to four miles (five to seven kilometres) per day and not eating en route. Spawning takes place between February and May being later in more northerly latitudes. The female releases about a million eggs which are lighter than water. The male releases sperm which also floats and both eggs and sperm rise to the surface. Here the eggs are fertilised and hatch after six to eleven days depending on the water temperature. The developing larvae are planktonic and drift towards the coast and use selective tidal stream transport to migrate into estuaries and rivers. Juvenile flounders live in shallow waters, estuaries and rivers commonly at low salinity conditions. Flounders become mature when still small, the males when they measure and the females when they measure . The European flounder sometimes hybridises with European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and, particularly in the western Baltic Sea, the hybrid is common. In the Baltic Sea, populations of European flounder are known to breed in shallow waters rather than the deep water typical of the species; these populations are now known to be a distinct species, the Baltic flounder (P. solemdali). The Baltic flounder has steadily outcompeted the European flounder over the past 5,000 years due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic environmental changes. Human interactions The European flounder is used for human consumption but is not so highly esteemed as the European plaice or common sole (Solea solea). The most important fisheries are in the Baltic Sea and the waters around the Netherlands and Denmark. In 2010, the total world catch was about nineteen thousand tonnes, mostly caught by bottom trawling. The fish is marketed fresh and frozen and can be fried, boiled, steamed, baked or microwaved. It has been found that male European flounders living in polluted estuaries may show signs of excess exposure to oestrogens. Substances such as vitellogenins have been identified in their blood at between four and six times the concentration found in the blood of fish from uncontaminated areas; however, the flounder is less sensitive to oestrogens than is the freshwater rainbow trout. Status The European flounder is assessed by the IUCN in their Red List of Threatened Species as being of \\"Least Concern\\". This is because it has a large population size and extensive range, and is common in nearly all parts of its range. Numbers of fish may be decreasing somewhat but not to the extent that would warrant listing it under a higher risk category. However, in portions of the Baltic Sea, changes in the environment have resulted in steadily receding breeding grounds for the European flounder; in some places such as the Gulf of Finland, the European flounder has been nearly completely extirpated, leaving the Baltic flounder as the predominant species.

It was built in 2000 by Swiss manufacturers Bolliger & Mabillard and was the second dive coaster model to be built, the first being Oblivion at Alton Towers in the United Kingdom. It is located in the Sky Plaza section of the park. It is a nearly mirror image of Oblivion. Diving Machine G5 is dubbed after the amount of g-forces it creates when it goes through the drop hole. Like Insane Speed, Diving Machine G5 is not themed to anything. Along with the Ku Ku Roller Coaster, and Insane Speed, Diving Machine G5 is one of the three roller coasters at the park. Diving Machine G5 is the closest ride to the entrance, thus it has long lines in the morning and short waits in the afternoons and nights. Ride experience Diving Machine G5 starts right out of the station and engages the lift chain which slowly takes them up the 45-degree angle lift hill to a dizzying height. The train then makes a turn to the right and brakes violently. Riders then hear a small click and slow down as they engage the holding brake and stop right on the edge. After the car completely stops, three seconds pass before the car is released down the 87.5 degree drop and under a bridge into the tunnel, where riders experience a blast of air and 5 g-forces. After exiting the tunnel, riders traverse a massive overbanked turn to the right, drop slightly, then are treated to a burst of airtime as they dip and rise into the final brake run, just as the camera flash goes off.

History The start of the 1980s was the dawn of Polish steam locomotives era. New diesel locomotives were needed for pulling passenger trains. Locomotives that were able to heat carriages with electrical systems were most in demand. Due to an economic crisis within Poland, it was impossible to start local production, so PKP decided to buy 200 locomotives produced in FAUR (former 23 August Works) from Bucharest, Romania. This company had previously produced Lxd2 and MBxd2 narrow gauge locomotives for PKP. First two locomotives began to work for PKP in 1985 and received the SP49 designation. Different series numbers were given as those locomotives were supposed to work in multiple steering. As other engines lacked that device, all locomotives were renamed to SP32-001 and 002. Units were appointed to the Jas≈Ço, Nysa, Siedlce, and Zamo≈õƒá depots. The very first month of service revealed a series of failures that were reported back to the producer. Changes introduced afterwards did not limit the breakdowns. The most serious problems included failures of the diesel engines, compressors, and alternators. Additionally, their power proved to be insufficient, especially during winter when heating the carriages. These problems caused an end of their importation in 1991, after a total of 150 units. The last two locomotives (151 and 152) exchanged prototypes and their numbers were changed to 001 and 002. As the whole series had been far too young to be withdrawn, several attempts to upgrade the units were started. New diesel engines (12V396TC12 licensed by MTU) had the same power as previous ones, but were more reliable. They were installed in the following units: 073, 096, 147, 148, and 149. In 2000, a more complex modernization of the SP32 series began. Locomotives were given new 12V396TC14 diesel engines with an electronic regulator produced by MTU, on-board diagnostics system, more convenient dashboards, fire extinguishing installation, and new lights. The leasing company that now owns and lends PKP modernized locomotives funded the modernization. Units with all those improvements were numbered from 201 to 210. Presently, only those locomotives are in use, with the rest remaining as reserve. About one-third of the locomotives have been scrapped. Technical data SP32 is a Bo‚Ä≤Bo‚Ä≤ locomotive as it runs on two bogies, each equipped with two axles. Each axle is propelled separately by one traction motor. Power from diesel engine to traction motors is delivered through electrical transmission. The electric heating system is powered by a 250 kW alternator that allows the locomotive to heat six carriages (assuming 40 kW power consumption per carriage). During summer months all power from heating is transferred to traction motors, thus increasing tractive effort. Traction motors, bogies, transmissions, and compressor, as well as several different parts are similar to those used in ST43 locomotive. SP32 has a non-typical for Polish passenger locomotives box construction. It has only one crew compartment, located approximately two- thirds of way down the locomotive. Thanks to a replaceable dashboard, driving in both directions is comfortable. The relatively low weight this locomotive puts on rails allows it to run on tracks laid on unstable surfaces.

The law was revised by Organic Laws 9/1994 and 3/1999, however the article defining the community's flag remained as follows: The most recent Statute of Autonomy, from 2007, maintained the same wording for the article which defines the flag, although it changed from the fourth to the sixth article of the Statute. The autonomous government does not precisely specify the colours of the flag, so that the tones of yellow, red and purple often vary, although the purple is habitually chosen to be dark. Similarly, the design of the castle is not defined, and so various designs have flourished with minor differences, such as the size of the castle with respect to the quarter, or the details of their masonry. Generally, the castle is represented with a wall above which the five towers are placed, of which the central tower is often the highest.

In some United States jurisdictions \\"settled insanity\\" can be used as a basis for an insanity defense, even though voluntary intoxication cannot, if the \\"settled insanity\\" negates one of the required elements of the crime such as malice aforethought. However, U.S. federal and state courts have differed in their interpretations of when the use of \\"settled insanity\\" is acceptable as an insanity defense and also over what is included in the concept of \\"settled insanity\\". History Early English common law recognized \\"settled insanity\\" as a complete defense for a person who is a habitual drunk but is not intoxicated at the time of the offense. A complete defense exonerates the accused and is a verdict of not guilty. Thus a person meeting the criteria of \\"settled insanity\\" is not considered responsible for his actions. Under the M'Naghten Rules, the first attempt in criminal law to address the issue of a mentally ill defendant, mental illness (or insanity) can be used as a defense if the defendant was unable to understand the criminal nature of his act or was unable to distinguish right from wrong at that time of the offense. The standard for an insanity defense developed by the American Law Institute requires a showing that the defendant's mental illness prevented him from abiding by the law. Traditionally, under English common law intoxication, no matter to what degree, was not considered grounds for excusing the defendant's criminal behavior. However, over the last half century, there has been a movement toward allowing intoxication as evidence admissible in court to help the jury understand the criminal act and perhaps use it as an excuse or a mitigating factor. Although voluntary intoxication is not considered an excuse for a criminal act, if it can be shown that the defendant was too intoxicated to deliberate or premeditate the wrongful act, (lacking malice aforethought), a defense of diminished capacity, while not excusing the defendant from responsibility for the act, can serve to reduce the charges. Similarly, the plea of temporary insanity (applicable only to charges of murder) can serve to reduce the charges from first degree murder to assault or lessen the sentence if it can be shown that the defendant, due to intoxication, acted without deliberation or reflection (lacking malice aforethought), thus negating specific intent. However, ten states have rejected that specific intent can be negated by voluntary intoxication. Some jurisdictions allow voluntary intoxication in the context of a preexisting mental disorder to qualify for an insanity defense. Settled insanity Over time, as United States court ruling have been refining the insanity defense, the concept of \\"settled insanity\\" has been evolving. Originally, any form of insanity caused by the voluntary use of drugs was not an eligible defense for a criminal offense. The rationale was that any act that results from voluntary behavior, including the voluntary intake of drugs, is choosing to increase the risk of breaking the law. Most United States jurisdictions now recognize that the long-term voluntary use of an intoxicating substance can cause a stable or \\"settled insanity\\" that can serve as a defense to a criminal act, especially if the long-term use exacerbated a preexisting mental condition. For example, the concept of \\"settled insanity\\" includes the delirium tremens experienced by alcoholic during alcohol withdrawal, but it excludes temporary insanity of intoxication. California law recognizes \\"settled insanity\\" in the case of long-term use, but it does not recognize the temporary mental state caused by the recent consumption of an intoxicant as a sufficient defense. Moreover, recent rulings have upheld that the insanity need not be permanent to qualify as a defense of \\"settled insanity\\". For instance, in a case where a woman with a substance-induced psychosis murdered her mother expert witnesses testified that the defendant had \\"personality defects\\" that predisposed her to psychosis, and that the psychosis was triggered by chronic substance abuse and the resulting nine months of hospitalization. The defendant was found guilty because the court ruled that her insanity was temporary; however, the Supreme Court of California overturned the lower court's guilty finding, ruling not guilty by reason of insanity, and stating that temporary psychosis not caused by an episode of intoxication constitutes settled insanity and qualifies as a complete defense. In People v. Skinner (1985), the California Supreme Court further specified the criteria for \\"settled insanity\\". The person must have a mental illness that is relatively stable over time, not caused solely by the length of time the substance was abused, and it must also meet the legal definition of insanity in that jurisdiction. Therefore, it appears that the court is stating that a threshold condition for the insanity defense exists when there is a permanent impairment caused by chronic substance abuse in a person with a preexisting mental illness unrelated to substance abuse, but aggravated or set off by voluntary intoxication. However, a 2007 decision by the Colorado Court of Appeals in People v. Grant upheld a lower court ruling that did not allow expert testimony on the defendant's state of mind due to voluntary intoxication, thus ruling out any possibility that the issue of \\"settled insanity\\" might be raised. Case example In Jervon Lamont Herbin v. Commonwealth of Virginia (1998), Herbin appealed his convictions of malicious wounding, two counts of forcible sodomy, abduction, and attempted rape. At the time of the offenses, Herbin was a long-term guest of the victim's parents and was on crutches due to a gunshot wound received when he tried to enter his mother's house while on crack cocaine a week before. After the victim's parents had left the home, Herbin asked the victim to help him put on his socks. Then he threatened her with a knife and ordered her to take off her clothes. He slashed each of her breasts and stabbed her in the abdomen. Then he committed the sex offenses. The defendant asked the victim about whether the cars had manual or automatic transmission. When the victim told him that the car had a manual transmission, the victim was able to convince Herbin to call paramedics. Herbin pretended to call for assistance and eventually did call paramedics. He first told authorities that she was injured in the kitchen, and then he told the authorities that he was trying to commit suicide and she was injured trying to save him. At trial, Herbin testified that he felt disturbed that day and had no memory of what happened except seeing the victim sitting in a pool of blood. He also testified to numerous stressors, including the gunshot wound, breaking up with his girlfriend, and recent attempts at suicide. He introduced extensive evidence of a history of physical and sexual abuse, drug abuse, and suicide attempts as well as a lengthy hospitalization. Further, he had attended a sex offender treatment program. On the other hand, Herbin called paramedics and properly recited the address, which had many numbers, and his voice on the 911 tape was controlled and calm. He gave paramedics a version of the events that was inconsistent with the facts and which exculpated him. Virginia does allow for a drug induced \\"settled insanity\\" as a defense to crime. However, Virginia draws a distinction between intoxication and organic brain damage resulting from long term-substance abuse. In order to qualify for this defense, Herbin was required to provide substantial evidence of the presence of a mental disorder and the connection between it and the substance abuse. The term settled insanity refers to a degree of organic brain damage that would cause permanent, or settled, impairment. Herbin provided evidence of recent drug abuse and the victim's mother testified that, the day before, she had provided him with prescription drug, Halcion. No lay witnesses testified that Herbin appeared to be under the influence of any substance that day. To meet the standard for any kind of insanity, the degree of impairment must be severe: > The first portion of M'Naghten relates to an accused who is psychotic to an > extreme degree. It assumes an accused who, because of mental disease, did > not know the nature and quality of his act; he simply did not know what he > was doing. For example, in crushing the skull of a human being with an iron > bar, he believed that he was smashing a glass jar. The latter portion of > M'Naghten relates to an accused who knew the nature and quality of his act. > He knew what he was doing; he knew that he was crushing the skull of a human > being with an iron bar. However, because of mental disease, he did not know > that what he was doing was wrong. He believed, for example, that he was > carrying out a command from God. White v. Com., 636 S.E.2d 353, 356‚Äì7, 272 > Va. 619, __ (2006). The appeals court held that a \\"settled insanity\\" defense requires substantial evidence of not only long-term and heavy substance abuse, but convincing evidence of a mental disorder that is caused by long-term substance abuse. In Herbin, the court found that > The weight of authority in this country recognizes an insanity defense that > is based on a mental disease or defect produced by long-term substance > abuse.\\" Commonwealth v. Herd, 413 Mass. 834, 604 N.E.2d 1294, 1299 (1992). > At the same time, \\"evidence of mere narcotics addiction, standing alone and > without other physiological or psychological involvement, raises no issue of > such a mental defect or disease as can serve as a basis for the insanity > defense.\\" United States v. Lyons, 731 F.2d 243, 245 (5th Cir.1984) (citing > cases).

The court held that the substance abuse did not serve as evidence for a \\"settled insanity\\" defense alone without the link to a mental disorder. No lay witnesses testified as to any behavior consistent with insanity, even if lay testimony were admissible to establish the insanity defense in Virginia. Also, although Herbin did provide an extensive history of drug and sexual abuse, the court said no evidence showed either of these issues were causes or results of a mental disorder. Therefore, the appeals court upheld his conviction. Conclusion In those states allowing a \\"settled insanity\\" defense, the expert witness must first determine whether any symptoms of a mental disorder were present at the time of the offense, and if there were, determine if those symptoms were the result of a lasting impairment rather than caused by intoxication no matter how acute. If it can be shown that any existing the mental disorder is lasting or relatively enduring, then the expert must be able to show how the mental illness interfered with the defendant's ability to know the nature and consequences of his/her behavior and know that his/her behavior was wrong, or if it impaired his/her ability to control his/her behavior. Aggressiveness, memory lapses and other common symptoms resulting from acute intoxication are not sufficient in themselves to excuse criminal acts. Further, not all psychotic reactions caused by substance abuse result in behavior that can be related to the criminal act in a way that can support an insanity defense. The presence of psychosis does not mean that the criminal act was caused by the psychosis. A relationship must be shown to exist between the psychosis and the behavior of the defendant.

Sometimes such an editor is called a roving reporter or roving editor. Unlike an editor who works on a publication from day to day and is hands-on, an editor-at-large contributes content on a semi-regular basis and has less of a say in matters such as layout, pictures or the publication's direction. Preferences and purpose Editors-at-large are more independent; they are allowed their own preferences in the content they have to generate, and they do not always have to pitch their ideas to the main editor. Though they are still subject to the direction and oversight of chief editors and executive editors, they frequently come up with ideas for other writers to research and write. \\"At large\\" means the editor has no specific assignments, but rather works on whatever interests them. The position of editor-at-large is not a standing role at most publications. Instead, it is created on an as-needed basis. The most common reason for appointing an editor-at-large is when an editor with extensive experience and long association with the publication, who has been in the role of editor for a very long time, is replaced by a new editor but kept on board by being given the title of editor-at-large. This can be because the editor desires to go back to writing rather than stay in a largely 'management' role; because the long-time editor is burnt out and perhaps not performing; because a new editor with a different skillset or a different focus is needed; or a new publisher takes over and decides a new editor is called for. The title of editor-at-large is offered as a way to keep the outgoing editor at the publication rather than lose his or her skills, connections and readership appeal, especially if the outgoing editor could be employed by a competing publication.

Located south-west of Bells Corners, west of Barrhaven and the 416 and north-east of Richmond within the southwest area of the city. Fallowfield is located in the triangle of Fallowfield Road, Richmond Road and Steeple Hill Crescent and also includes Richmond Road north up to Hope Side Road. The village serves as a bedroom community for the larger urban area of Ottawa as there are no retail or commercial enterprises in the village. It assumes a rather prominent position over the surrounding countryside as the major part of the Village is located on a gently terraced escarpment. Population for the village is estimated at about 366 people as of 2004. Public high school students in this area go to South Carleton High School in Richmond. History Road Gang extending Fallowfield Road to the West at Richmond Road, circa 1880 The Edward Monaghan house, pictured behind the workers, still stands and is designated under the Ontario Heritage Act. Fallowfield Village was originally settled in the 1820s by Irish immigrants from counties Tipperary and Cork at which time the majority of Carleton County was similarly settled. There are two churches, both along Steeple Hill; St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church built in 1833 with the current stone chapel completed in 1866 and the Fallowfield United Church built in 1868 with the current chapel completed in 1886. The cornerstone for the United (then Methodist) church was laid by Canada's first Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald. The name for the area was Piety Hill but the village name was not formalized to Fallowfield until June 1, 1872, with the appointment of a postmaster, P. Omeara, and the opening of a post office. As a direct result of this action, the village received its name, the origin of which was inspired by nearby fields that were in the process of being fallowed for the summer and is not historically linked to Fallowfield, in Manchester, England. The post office was closed June 30, 1914. For a timeline perspective, the Rideau Canal was built between 1826 and 1832 and the village of Richmond, to the southwest, was settled in 1818. Fallowfield village was a strategic stop over point for travels between Perth, Richmond and Bytown (later to become Ottawa). By the turn of the century, Fallowfield was a bustling village and it became a favourite stopping place for travellers, especially farmers with their produce wagons and horse teams, en route to and from the market in Ottawa. At one time there were four hotels in the village to serve the travelling public. In addition, there were three carriage shops, two blacksmiths, a grist mill, tailor shop, cheese factory, shoemaker, general store and weigh scales for the farmers to weigh their produce. The widespread use of the automobile most likely rendered the village into a bedroom community as farther distances could be travelled in one day with no need for stop overs like what Fallowfield village offered. The majority of the development was established in the early 1980s. Rooney Park is named after the Rooney family who were Irish farmers in the village. Fallowfield village was originally part of Carleton County, Nepean but has been within the City of Ottawa since January 1, 2001 as part of amalgamation. The Nepean Museum =Churches= L to R: St. Barnabas Anglican, St. John's Presbyterian, and Fallowfield Methodist c.1910 Old Richmond Road used to follow what is now known as Steeple Hill, the current name coming from the fact that no less than four churches were located in a one kilometre stretch of road. These churches are, from North to South: St. Patrick's Catholic (1866), St. Barnabas Anglican (1889), St. John's Presbyterian (1886) and Fallowfield Methodist (1886). In 1925 the United Church was formed between the Presbyterian, Methodist and Congregationalist and St. John's Presbyterian was vacated and demolished in the 1940s. St. Barnabas Anglican was also demolished in the 1940s and only two churches of the original churches remain today. 2002 Tornado June 23, 2002 saw numerous tragedies in the Ottawa area. The Lady Duck sank, the Ontario Power Generation Barrett Chute dam overflowed into the Madawaska River, killing a mother and son and Fallowfield village had a late day F2 tornado at around 5:15pm. Many trees were uprooted and homes damaged. Barns were levelled and garages damaged to the point of demolition. Very few residents were spared from some sort of damage. Mowat's silos, just east of the intersection of Fallowfield Road and Steeple Hill Crescent, were heavily damaged as well. Public transit The community is served by OC Transpo bus route 283 with the only stop located at the intersection of Steeple Hill and Fallowfield. The morning direction is located on the south side of Fallowfield (stop #0870) and the afternoon direction is located on the north side of Fallowfield (stop #2227).

It is one of the most acclaimed films from Indonesia in recent years and was the country's proposal for an Academy Award. It was also screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. Plot The film follows three street children, Sugeng, Heru, and Kancil (played by themselves), in their day-to-day lives in Yogyakarta. Although they live in poverty, are from broken homes, and must do anything to survive, they aspire to rise above poverty and hope to receive an education. They are supported by Asih (Christine Hakim), a saleswoman who lets them stay in her workshop; the children fight over Asih's leaf pillow. The children's lives do not go smoothly. Kancil is decapitated while playing on top of a train. Heru falls victim to an insurance scam, where he is given false identification papers and then killed to collect the premium. Production Daun di Atas Bantal was produced by Hakim, who also played Asih. The film was her first production, and she initially did not intend to act in it to avoid stress; however, she changed her mind after being told the film would be more marketable in Japan if she acted in it. Hakim has called the film \\"an expensive university\\" for her because she made a mistake that required Nugroho to reshoot all of the footage. In an attempt to cut expenses, she had saved all cans of exposed film in an attempt to send them to the developing together; upon their receipt, the lab notified her that a technical fault with the camera had rendered the film unusable, and that it could have been detected earlier had she sent each can as it was filmed. Garin Nugroho was chosen to direct based on his previous film Dongeng Kancil untuk Kemerdekaan. Hakim chose Garin Nugroho to direct the film, noting that he was a \\"very talented young director\\", partly inspired by Nurgoho's 1995 documentary film on street children Dongeng Kancil untuk Kemerdekaan. The street children in Daun di atas Bantal are actual street children, who portray \\"dramatized versions\\" of their own lives. After production, Hakim ensured that the children received an education; for example, Heru was placed in a music school. The sound for Daun di Atas Bantal is Dolby Digital and was done in Australia. At the time, Dolby Digital sound was rare in Indonesian films. Style and themes The film is based on true stories in the lives of three street boys in Yogyakarta who all die under tragic circumstances, and was played by the real street boys around the event location. The film also deals with poverty in Indonesia, as seen through the experiences of the poor. According to Stephen Holden in a review for The New York Times, Daun di Atas Bantal is a \\"documentary-flavored\\" film that does not attempt to make the viewer care for the characters; he describes it as being detached and loosely structured. Ade Irwansyah of Tabloid Bintang notes that the plot is much more linear than Nugroho's earlier works, without confusing metaphors or poetic imagery. Release and reception Daun di Atas Bantal was shown in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival on 23 May 1998. It was Indonesia's submission to the 71st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, although it was not nominated. Derek Elley, writing for Variety, called the movie Nugroho's best work to date, noting that although the opening was weak, \\"the viewer is slowly drawn into the urchins' nether world\\". Holden wrote that the film \\"hits you in the face with almost unimaginable squalor and a patchwork of teeming sights and sounds that are more than the senses can take in\\". In 2010, Ade Irwansyah of Tabloid Bintang listed Daun di Atas Bantal as the 17th-best Indonesian film of all time, noting that it was the first film in which Nugroho's dialogue was effective and the plot was easy to follow.

During the positive half-cycle of the signal, the base is positive with respect to the emitter and hence the base- emitter junction is forward biased. This causes a base current and much larger collector current to flow. The positive half-cycle of the signal is amplified in the collector. During the negative half-cycle, the base-emitter junction is reverse biased and hence no current flows. No output flows during the negative half-cycle of the signal. Thus the positive-only amplified output is unfaithful. A sufficient battery source in the base circuit keeps the input circuit forward biased even during the peak of the negative half-cycle. When no signal is applied, a DC current I C will flow in the collector circuit due to the battery.

It is located in a facility and highlights the progress and history of the space program.Brevard Business News. Air Force's Missile History Center opens, showcases many exhibits (Melbourne, Florida: Brevard Business News, September 06, 2010), p. 4. The museum features displays which chronicle the story of each of the launch pads from its establishment in 1949 as the Joint Long Range Proving Ground. Exhibits contain artifacts dating back to the 1950s and include parts to launch vehicles and control systems. Unlike the Air Force Space and Missile Museum, its sister museum which is located inside gates of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the center does not require special arrangements or a fee- based tour to visit. Admission is free and it is open to the public six days per week. As of 2017, it is open 9AM-2PM Tuesday through Friday, 9AM-5PM Saturday, and noon-4PM Sunday. Hangar C During the museum's early history, an extensive outdoor display (much of which included once flight-capable hardware), known as the \\"Rocket Garden\\" provided a large, open-air exhibit area. Over the years, the central Florida heat, humidity, and ocean air gradually took their toll, degrading the outward appearance and internal structure of most of the exhibits. One-by-one, these degrading artifacts were removed from outdoor display, professionally refurbished, and returned to a pristine (almost \\"factory new\\") appearance. Not wanting to repeat the process, the museum placed them in protective storage (out of public view) until such time as a suitable display area could be secured. Toward the end of this years-long process, historic Hangar C was secured as the future public display area. The oldest hangar on the Cape (Hangars A and B were built on Patrick AFB), for a time served as a central missile assembly facility for nearly all Cape launch activity. Once it was determined that Hangar C would serve as a central display area for much of the museum's large artifacts, it underwent extensive renovation to make it suitable for public access. In early 2020 public tours conducted by the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex began making stops at Hangar C as part of the newly introduced \\"Rise to Space\\" tour (separate and distinct from the \\"Early Space\\" tour). The museum provides a volunteer staff, many of whom are seasoned space and missile professionals, to act as exhibit interpreters.

Biography A native of Licenza and the daughter of Ercole Costantini and Geltrude Montori, Lattanzi began her acting career in 1922 when she met Vittorio De Sica, who in turn, introduced her to Tatyana Pavlova, who coached her into acting. Lattanzi was mainly active on stage during the 1920s before making her screen debut in 1930 and she was well known for her portrayals of women of noble birth. In 1954, Lattanzi began focusing her attention on television. Because of her drawl, persuasive voice, she also turned to the Cooperativa Doppiatori Cinematografici during the 1940s. As a prominent dubbing artist, Lattanzi performed the Italian voices of some of the major film icons of the 20th century such as Greta Garbo, Rita Hayworth, Marlene Dietrich, Joan Crawford, Greer Garson, Myrna Loy, Rosalind Russell, Martita Hunt, Agnes Moorehead, Tamara Lees and Italian actresses such as Franca Marzi. In her animated roles, Lattanzi typically dubbed the Italian voices of villains such as the Evil Queen in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Lady Tremaine in Cinderella, the Queen of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland and Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty.Cronologia fondamentale dell'epoca d'oro del doppiaggio italiano Dagli albori agli anni 1970 (in Italian) By the time Lattanzi reached her sixties, there had been a decline in her career, yet she was still active on television. She eventually retired after an eye infection. =Personal life= Lattanzi married Giovanni Lattanzi in 1919 and took his name. They had two children, Fiorella and Glauco. They later divorced because of her acting obligations and her later relationship with her collaborator Guido Brignone. Death Lattanzi died in Rome on October 25th 1997 less than two months before her 100th birthday.

History The Al Maktoum family descends from the Al Bu Falasah (now known as Al-Falasi) section of the Bani Yas, a tribal federation that has been the dominant power throughout most of what is now the United Arab Emirates. In 1833, a large group of the Al Bu Falasah section of the Bani Yas seceded to Dubai during the pearling season, under the leadership of Maktoum bin Butti bin Sohal, escaping the violence of Sheikh Khalifah of Abu Dhabi. Dubai was readily given up to them by its wali. The following autumn, the bulk of their relatives joined them and virtually all of the Al Bu Falasah were domiciled in Dubai from then on. Sheikh Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum (Ruler from 1894-1906) convinced merchants from Lingeh in Iran to stay in the city by assuring zero taxation. A more modern cosmopolitan city as well as a business friendly orientation was later established, which is what Dubai is now known for. By the 1930s the population of Dubai nearly reached 20,000, a quarter of whom were expatriates. In the 1950s the Dubai Creek began to silt up. The late Ruler of Dubai Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum comminisioned the dredging of the waterway; resulting in an increased volume of cargo handling in Dubai, reinforcing Dubai's position as a re-export and tradinghub.

Milde had a much-travelled career, but is best remembered as a Dynamo Dresden player, having had three separate spells with the club. Career =Early career= Milde began his career with Dynamo Dresden, and made his debut for the club in a DDR-Oberliga match against Hallescher FC Chemie in April 1988. He was on the fringes of the Dynamo team for the next two seasons as the club won two East German titles, as well as the FDGB Pokal in 1990. During the 1989‚Äì90 season he also turned out for TSG Mei√üen and Stahl Riesa, both of whom were acting as feeder clubs to Dynamo. =Bundesliga years= Like many players, Milde moved west after the fall of the Berlin Wall, joining Bundesliga side VfL Bochum in 1990. He spent over three years with Bochum, scoring three goals in 54 games, before leaving at the end of 1993, just after the club had been relegated to the 2. Bundesliga. He signed for Hannover 96, and scored on his debut, a 2‚Äì0 win over Rot-Wei√ü Essen. He made a further 16 appearances, scoring twice more, before signing for Hansa Rostock in July 1994. The 1994‚Äì95 season was the most successful of Milde's career to date - he scored nine goals in 21 appearances as the club won the 2. Bundesliga title. Rostock followed this up with an impressive sixth-place finish in the Bundesliga, but Milde was less involved, making sixteen appearances (mostly as a substitute) and scoring once. =Return to Saxony= In 1996 Milde re-joined Dynamo Dresden, who had since been demoted to the third-tier Regionalliga Nordost. He partnered another Dynamo veteran, Torsten G√ºtschow, for the next two seasons, and both scored prolifically, but the club were unable to return to the second tier. In 1998 Milde signed for FSV Zwickau, who had just been relegated to the Regionalliga Nordost, and formed a successful striking partnership with the Serbian forward Veselin Popovic. However, the Regionalliga was to be re-structured at the end of the 1999‚Äì2000 season, and this combined with a poor start meant that Zwickau were effectively relegated with the season half over. Many players left the club, with Milde joining Dresdner SC along with team-mates Ren√© Beuchel and Ren√© Gro√ü. At this time, DSC were the top club in Dresden: while Dynamo were being relegated to the Oberliga, Milde helped them to a second-place finish in the Regionalliga in 1999‚Äì2000. They finished 9th the following year, with Milde as top scorer (with nine goals), but after falling out of favour during the 2001‚Äì02 season he joined Dynamo Dresden for a third time. Milde's return to Dynamo was a popular one, but was marred by injuries. The club won the 2002 NOFV-Oberliga S√ºd title in 2002, and beat Hertha BSC II in a playoff to earn promotion to the Regionalliga Nord. Milde made just nine appearances the following season, and left Dynamo for a final time in 2003. He played out the remainder of his career with amateur side VfL Pirna-Copitz, before retiring in 2005. =Honours= *DDR-Oberliga: 1988‚Äì89, 1989‚Äì90 *FDGB-Pokal: 1989‚Äì90 *2.

In their 15-year existence, they released three albums, one demo, one EP and one compilation album. The group had been in the process of recording a fourth album, but ultimately disbanded in January 2007. In 2011, the band re-united with the promise of new material sometime in 2013. Two notable past members include Peter Nagy (former multi-instrumentalist for M√∂rk Gryning) and Ted Lundstr√∂m (current Amon Amarth bassist). History Eternal Oath was formed in 1991 by Ted Jonsson (drums), Petri Tarvainen (guitar) and Joni M√§ensivu (vocals). In February 1994, the band recorded a 3 song promotional tape which secured a deal with Rat Pack Records for one EP. In March 1995, So Silent was recorded. Financial problems with the company would delay the EP's release; The group subsequently broke their contract with the label and self-released the EP the following year financed by Nwrapped Media. In March 1998, the band entered the studio to record their first album, Through The Eyes Of Hatred for Singapore-based label Pulverised Records. The album would be released in early 1999. In the fall of 2001, the band entered Studio Fredman in Gothenburg, Sweden to record their second album, Righteous. Containing 10 tracks including a cover of Paradise Lost's \\"Eternal\\", the album received a wide response all over the world. Righteous was mixed and engineered by Fredrik Nordstr√∂m, known for contribution to albums by In Flames, Arch Enemy, At The Gates and Dark Tranquillity. A few months later, Pulverised Records went bankrupt, and in early 2004 the band signed with Sound Pollution/Black Lodge Records, who in turn purchased the entire Eternal Oath back catalog. In June of the same year, Eternal Oath returned to Studio Fredman once again to record their 3rd (and last) LP, Wither, which would be released March 29, 2005 through Black Lodge. Breakup and reunion After over 15 years of activity, the band dissolved in early 2007, with some previous members going on to form a new project, Faceshift, later in the year. In 2011, the band announced that Eternal Oath was rejoins forces after a 5-year absence. This came at the 20th anniversary of the band. The new line-up consists of 4 of the founding members, with Peter Nagy-Eklof and Petri Tarvainen on guitar, Ted Jonsson on drums and Joni M√§ensivu on vocals. They also have reinforced the set with 2 new members, Mika Kajanen on bass and Johan Adler on keyboards. The band has started working on new material and a new album is planned for beginning of 2013. Style While firmly rooted in Swedish melodic death metal, the band's direction has varied on each album, going from blues/folk music progressions similar to Opeth to symphonic experimentation like Hypocrisy. The band had also utilized female gothic metal vocals and traits of doom/death metal.

Biography Blackett was the eldest son of Rev. William Blackett, a missionary and educationalist in India and his wife Grace Phillott. He was born in Calcutta and educated at Marlborough College. At Marlborough, he injured his leg badly, and while he recuperated, he spent some time in Germany and acquired a lifelong interest in the country. He then went to University College, Oxford on a scholarship. Basil Blackett entered the civil service in 1904 and chose the Treasury, instead of the Indian Service, as he had originally intended. He was in the financial division and was secretary to the Royal Commission on Indian Finance and Currency (1913‚Äì1914) when the First World War broke out. He went to America for the first time in October 1914 in connection with foreign exchange matters and was made a Companion of the Bath (CB) in the 1915 New Year Honours. He was a member of the Anglo-French Financial Commission, which went to America in 1915 and so when the United States entered the war in 1917, he was seen as the natural choice to represent HM Treasury in Washington. He held the post from 1917 to 1919, and on his return in 1919, he became First Controller of Finance at the Treasury. He was made Knight Commander of the Bath (KCB) in 1921. In 1922, he went to India as finance member of the Viceroy's Executive Council. Over the next five years, he was seen to be an outstanding financial administrator, and within a year, he had initiated and put through three major financial reforms. He put the Indian railways on an independent footing, concentrated the charges for the public debt into a statutory sinking fund, and set up a conference bringing together the eight provincial finance members for the first time to compare and co-ordinate their problems. He became involved in political questions and applied the same principles of conference and co-ordination to them. He taught himself the art of debating, although he was not a natural, and came to lead the legislative assembly in which he introduced six successive budgets. He was made Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI) in 1926 in recognition of his achievements. Blackett returned to England in 1928 and left the Treasury for the City. His friend Montagu Norman, then governor of the Bank of England, sponsored his election to the court of directors, and he became chairman of the new Imperial and International Communications Limited. He was a member of the international committee on reparations, which produced the Young Plan in 1929. He responded to the crisis of 1931 and the sterling devaluation in a progressive way and became increasingly involved in national problems. He shared the views of John Maynard Keynes with regard to planned money and to budgeting for a deficit. He was a proponent of the sterling area and popularised the phrase. He was founding president of Political and Economic Planning in 1931 and was once president of the British Social Hygiene Council. He stood as an unofficial Conservative candidate for parliament for St Marylebone in 1932 but was not elected. In the same year, he left Imperial and International Communications Limited and joined the board of De Beers Consolidated Mines. In August 1935, Blackett died in Marburg where he was taken to after his car was hit by a train in the Lumda valley in Germany on his way to giving a lecture at Heidelberg University.Gie√üener Allgemeine Zeitung, 9 March 2013, page 55 In his will, he bequeathed the balance of his estate to the public trustee to be used for various purposes with \\"one third of any surplus to go to the Commissioners for the reduction of the National Debt\\". There is a memorial window to him in the west window of the North Transept of Durham Cathedral, and Marlborough College's Observatory is named the Blackett Observatory after him. Blackett was twice married but had no children. His wife Beatrice Bonner was an American, daughter of Edward H. Bonner of Staten Island.New York Times, Social news, 10th May 1930: Lady Blackett, the former Miss Beatrice Bonner, who has been visiting relatives here, will sail today on the Minnewaska to join her husband, Sir Basil P.

He died during an attempt to climb the Eiger north face with his partner Toni Kurz. A section of the north face was later named the \\"Hinterstoisser Traverse\\" in his honor. The 2008 film North Face was based on his experience climbing the Eiger. Biography Andreas Hinterstoisser was born on 3 October 1914 in Bad Reichenhall, Bavaria, Germany, where he was raised. He worked in a bank before joining the German Wehrmacht as a professional soldier in 1935. Together with his childhood friend Toni Kurz, he made numerous first ascents of peaks in the Berchtesgaden Alps, including some of the most difficult climbs of that time. The two young men climbed the southwest wall of the Berchtesgadener Hochthron in 1934, and the south wall of the straight pillar in 1936. They also made first ascents in the Reiter Alpe on the German‚ÄìAustrian border, and of the direct southern route up the Watzmannkinder in the Watzmann in 1935.Auffermann 2010, p. 91. In 1936 he formed part of a four-man team making the second attempt to scale the north face of the Eiger. He was renowned as one of the best rock climbers of his time and is held in high esteem to this day. He cleverly traversed a slab of icy rock, a feat which made the rest of the attempt on the Eiger possible, by climbing up on it and lowering himself to execute a pendulum to the other side, securing a rope and enabling his companions to cross the impassable section. This move became known as the Hinterstoisser Traverse. Hinterstoisser's grave at Friedhof Bad Reichenhall, Germany During a retreat from the wall, due both to an injury suffered by one of his comrades and to the severe weather, Hinterstoisser could not recross the traverse to safety because the group had previously removed the rope that had helped them across. The group decided to abseil down the vertical face (the great rock barrier) to the base of the mountain. Contact was made with a railway guard halfway down the descent during which the climbers called back that everything was all right (perhaps from pride and the knowledge that they were close to safety). However, as Hinterstoisser set up the last stage of the descent an avalanche came down the mountain, wiping out Hinterstoisser, who had unclipped from the group. He fell to his death and was found at the bottom of the mountain days later. The rest of the group suffered the same fate: Willy Angerer was killed by the impact; Edi Rainer was asphyxiated from the weight of the rope holding his comrades; and Toni Kurz died from exposure, despite having made contact with rescuers. Legacy The tragic story became well known after publication of Heinrich Harrer's classic 1960 book The White Spider and was more recently covered by Joe Simpson's book (and Emmy-winning TV documentary), The Beckoning Silence, as well as the 2008 German dramatic movie North Face.

Based on the play of the same name by Trey Anthony, the story was adapted into a television show and aired on Global during prime time. It was the first comedy series on a national private mainstream broadcaster that was created by and starring black women in Canada. The series had centred on a hair salon in the heart of Toronto's Caribbean-Canadian community, Eglinton West. The series debuted on Global on October 14, 2007, and the final episode aired on May 14, 2009. It was the winner of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Best Fiction Series prize in 2008 and won a Gemini Award for Best Hair. The series has been rebroadcast on Television Jamaica. Cast The show stars Ordena Stephens- Thompson as Novelette \\"Letty\\" Campbell, the Caribbean-Canadian owner of a hair salon in Toronto. Trey Anthony, the writer of the original play on which the series was based, also stars as Letty's sister Joy. The original cast also included Ngozi Paul, Richard Fagon, and Conroy Stewart. In season 2, the role of Dre was recast and Daniel J. Gordon assumed the role created by Stewart. Characters =Main characters= *Ordena Stephens-Thompson as Novelette \\"Letty\\" Campbell. Letty is the Jamaican-Canadian owner of the salon. Originally from Spanish Town, Jamaica, she is the mother of Dre (Conray Stewart/Daniel J. Gordon) and the sister of Joy (Trey Anthony) and has a brother Winston who lives in Kingston. Letty has been living in Canada for seven years prior to the beginning of the series and opened up \\"Letty's Hair Salon\\" not long after. She is very proud of her business and enjoys working as well trying to make people happy. Letty is dedicated to her business and knows how important the shop is to its clients, most of whom are recent women immigrants from The Caribbean. Letty recently sent for her sister Joy and son Dre, whom Joy raised while Letty was in Canada. Letty, however, is unimpressed by the way Joy raised him and wants to raise him by her rules. Despite this, the two both co-raise the young boy. A running gag throughout the first season is that Letty hasn't been on a date in over seven years. *Trey Anthony as Joy Campbell. Joy is Letty's younger sister and the shop receptionist. Originally from Spanish Town, Jamaica, Joy recently arrived in Toronto after Letty sent her for her and Letty's teenage son Dre, who Joy raised while Letty was trying to send for them to join her in Canada. Joy is known for her very colourful weaves, her vibrant fun-loving personality, as well as her outspoken attitude. A running gag throughout the series is that Joy would rather be back home in Jamaica than in Canada, where she doesn't like the laws and rules. Joy is also a hopeless romantic who is openly disapproving when black men date interracially. In the first season, Joy dated Gary, a successful Jamaican- Canadian real estate agent, whom she broke up with later in the season due to his abusive behaviour and demanding attitude. *Ngozi Paul as Priscilla \\"Star\\" McMasterson. Star is an African-Canadian trainee at the salon. Adopted by a white family, she was raised in an all-white environment in Ontario so to discover herself as a black woman she moved to Toronto after quitting law school and began working at the salon. During the first season, Star was ashamed of her adoptive family but later grew to accept them. Although Star stated she \\"does not date black men\\", she had a brief crush and flirtationship with her coworker Nigel before he got back with his ex. A running gag throughout the series is that Star knows nothing of Jamaican culture. She meets her biological mother (Vivica A. Fox) in the second season finale. *Richard Fagon as Nigel. A first-generation Jamaican Canadian, Nigel is a stylist at the salon who is known for his womanizing ways. Whenever an ex entered the shop Nigel would ask Letty for a break. He also had a brief flirtationship with Star before he began dating Nikki. Although he only appeared in the first season, Nigel was a major character who would jokingly make fun of Star, about her being \\"whitewashed\\" and nothing little of Jamaican culture. The character of Nigel did not return in the second season. Episodes =Season 1 (2007‚Äì08)= =Season 2 (2009)= Ratings The show was a hit in its Sunday night 7:30pm time slot achieving solid 2's and 3's in the first two episodes. Due to a scheduling mishap and a lack of communication with the audience, after being preempted for two weeks it returned with 1.5's and rose steadily to complete the season. Global announced on March 20, 2008, that the show would be renewed for a second season.\\"Global renews new TV series for another year\\", The Globe and Mail, March 21, 2008. The second season premiered on Global on February 12, 2009, and was scheduled to start in the middle of Grey's Anatomy.

UNAIDS estimate there to be 67,000 prostitutes in the country. Adult prostitution Prostitution between adults is legal for women and men over 18 years of age if they register with municipal authorities and carry a health certificate. Brothels must be licensed. The vast majority of prostitutes work in the informal sector, where they lack health protection. Individual police officers tolerate the operation of unlicensed brothels. Child prostitution Child prostitution is illegal. Penalties for pimps and clients of underage prostitutes range from four to eight years in prison. Child prostitution is common in the country, and especially in Peru's isolated Amazonian mining communities. In the Amazonian department of Madre de Dios the illegal exploitation of gold has dramatically increased the recruitment and coercion of adolescents into prostitution through false employment offers. While poverty and inequality are important causes of child prostitution, part of the problem is also a social attitude that views sex‚Äîincluding paid sex‚Äîbetween adult men and adolescent girls as normal. Luis Gonzalez-Polar Zuzunada, president of La Restinga (an Iquitos- based nonprofit organization that works with at-risk children) said about teenage prostitution:\\"It's not seen as a crime. People think that's the way it is. Here, anyone is a potential client.\\" The Peruvian government recognizes child sex tourism to be a problem, particularly in Iquitos, Madre de Dios, and Cuzco. Sex trafficking Peru is a source, transit point, and destination for trafficked persons. The majority of human trafficking occurs within the country. Many trafficking victims are women and girls from impoverished rural regions of the Amazon, recruited and coerced into prostitution in urban nightclubs, bars, and brothels, often through false employment offers or promises of education. Domestic trafficking occurs particularly in districts located in the Andes or the Amazon jungle, to bring underage girls into cities or mining areas to work as prostitutes. Victims are recruited by friends or acquaintances and through newspaper and Internet advertisements or street posters offering employment; some victims are recruited by local employment agencies that offer poor young women from rural areas relatively well-paid \\"restaurant work\\" in Lima, Cusco, major coastal cities, and abroad. The principal victims and groups at high risk for trafficking are children and young women from rural or poor urban areas, persons living in poverty, persons with disabilities, victims of domestic abuse, illiterate persons, and persons lacking birth certificates or other identification documents. Peru also is a destination country for some Ecuadorian and Bolivian women trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Peru as a 'Tier 2' country. References External links *Lima, Peru: Want to get rid of prostitution?

There are currently about 350 students in grades 9 through 12.Saranac Lake Central School District It is under the jurisdiction of the Saranac Lake Central School District, whose offices are housed on the ground floor of the auditorium building. The school is housed in a building, completed in 1969. It is designed in the typical unsightly style of the mid-century period and is colloquially referred to as \\"prison-like\\" in image and nature among staff and students. The majority of graduating students from Saranac Lake High School attend an institution of higher education. Approximately one-half of each graduating class continues on to a four-year college or university. Recently, students have matriculated to institutions such as Amherst College, the California Institute of Technology, Columbia University, Cornell University, Hamilton College, Harvard University, Oberlin College, and many other highly regarded colleges and universities. About one-half of the students continuing their education from Saranac Lake High School attend a State University of New York (SUNY) institution, such as SUNY Plattsburgh and SUNY Albany. High school seniors that have shown particular academic excellence are accepted into SUNY Plattsburgh and SUNY North Country Community College with free tuition. History Saranac Lake's first schools date to 1838. In 1870, a new school was built in the center of the village. In 1890, the first high school was built, and was dedicated by U.S. President Benjamin Harrison. In 1924, a new school was built on Petrova Avenue that housed grades 1 through 12. The Petrova School was dedicated in February 1925. Then in 1968 and 1969 the present building was erected; the former school became an elementary and middle school. Classes were first held in the current school on December 1, 1969 following the Thanksgiving holiday break.  Arts  Recently, the Saranac Lake High School has been recognized for its music program (under the direction of Drew Benware and Keith Kogut), with which about one half of the student body participates in. Choral conductor Drew Benware was named a national semifinalist as a Grammy Award music educator in 2017. Additionally, a number of students have participated in the NYSSMA and NAFME Conference All- State and All-Eastern music festivals for both instrumental and vocal music.  Athletics  The school colors are red and white, and the school's sports teams have been called the Red Storm since 2001. Sports include Football, Soccer, Cross Country, Basketball, Ice Hockey, Basketball, Downhill Skiing, Cross Country Skiing, Volleyball, Lacrosse, Baseball, Softball, Track and Golf.Digital Sports - Saranac Lake High School SLHS teams have won New York State titles in boys speed skating three times in 1930, 1931, and 1932; boys cross country in 1995 and 2018; and girls alpine skiing in 2008 and 2015. In 1995, the school played against Leroy for the New York State Class C High School Championship in the Carrier Dome in Syracuse. The 2004-2005 Boys Ice Hockey team made it to the New York State Final Four for the first time in school history, defeating Williamsville East High School, the defending State Champions to do so. The Boys Ice Hockey team also made it to the NYS Final Four in 2011-2012. In 1998 the Saranac football team defeated Voorheesville, at home on Ken Wilson field, to advance to the state Final Four in Kingston, New York where they lost to the eventual state champions Edgemont. In 2008 the Red Storm football team defeated Watervilet to visit Kingston again and play in the state Final Four. They did the same again in 2010 when they defeated Hoosick Falls and went on to play Bronxville. The Philadelphia Eagles NFL team held training camp at Saranac Lake High School from 1946 to 1948.  Controversy  Throughout the tenure of Mr. Eric Bennett as the Athletic Director, many students and community members have been critical of his leadership and unequal prioritization of sports over other aspects of the educational experience. Current and former students have voiced their concerns over review platforms and in the media. Most recently, some students have commented on the likely Title IX violation of the lack of appropriate restroom facilities for the disabled and in general across the sports facilities. A number of alumni have mentioned across the Niche website that he has placed sport priorities over academically-related ones and there was a lack of action from the administration and Bennett regarding those claims. Additionally, the high school administration has gotten a fair amount of negative attention for being strongly disciplinarian in nature, yet under the direction of Mr. Josh Dann it has seen a positive trend in reputation.

The concept of a cone is a more abstract notion that subsumes all of these families. A similar notion is the faithful cone, having somewhat relaxed conditions. For example, the context-sensitive languages do not form a cone, but still have the required properties to form a faithful cone. The terminology cone has a French origin. In the American oriented literature one usually speaks of a full trio. The trio corresponds to the faithful cone. Definition A cone is a family \\\\mathcal{S} of languages such that \\\\mathcal{S} contains at least one non-empty language, and for any L \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} over some alphabet \\\\Sigma, * if h is a homomorphism from \\\\Sigma^\\\\ast to some \\\\Delta^\\\\ast, the language h(L) is in \\\\mathcal{S}; * if h is a homomorphism from some \\\\Delta^\\\\ast to \\\\Sigma^\\\\ast, the language h^{-1}(L) is in \\\\mathcal{S}; * if R is any regular language over \\\\Sigma, then L\\\\cap R is in \\\\mathcal{S}. The family of all regular languages is contained in any cone. If one restricts the definition to homomorphisms that do not introduce the empty word \\\\lambda then one speaks of a faithful cone; the inverse homomorphisms are not restricted. Within the Chomsky hierarchy, the regular languages, the context-free languages, and the recursively enumerable languages are all cones, whereas the context-sensitive languages and the recursive languages are only faithful cones. Relation to Transducers A finite state transducer is a finite state automaton that has both input and output. It defines a transduction T, mapping a language L over the input alphabet into another language T(L) over the output alphabet. Each of the cone operations (homomorphism, inverse homomorphism, intersection with a regular language) can be implemented using a finite state transducer. And, since finite state transducers are closed under composition, every sequence of cone operations can be performed by a finite state transducer. Conversely, every finite state transduction T can be decomposed into cone operations. In fact, there exists a normal form for this decomposition, which is commonly known as Nivat's Theorem:cf. Namely, each such T can be effectively decomposed as T(L) = g(h^{-1}(L) \\\\cap R), where g, h are homomorphisms, and R is a regular language depending only on T. Altogether, this means that a family of languages is a cone if and only if it is closed under finite state transductions. This is a very powerful set of operations. For instance one easily writes a (nondeterministic) finite state transducer with alphabet \\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\\\\\} that removes every second b in words of even length (and does not change words otherwise). Since the context-free languages form a cone, they are closed under this exotic operation.

Its principal mandate is to focus on research, interpretation and dissemination initiatives in order to broaden the influence and appreciation of contemporary visual arts. These activities are informed by a significant collection of art documentation and authoritative resources, as well as a network of multidisciplinary partners. Artexte's partnerships and alliances are built with others who also seek to bring attention to the value of documentation produced by the study and practice of contemporary art. Artexte affirms the presence of experimental, innovative and critical components of this field. Its activities touch on all aspects of contemporary visual art from 1965 to today, with special emphasis placed on Quebec and Canada. Through its bilingual reference services and research assistance, the Centre provides a user-friendly interface between its collection and researchers from Canada and abroad. History Established in 1980 by art historian Francine P√©rinet and artists Angela Grauerholz and Anne Ramsden, Artexte began as a bookstore specializing in Canadian and International contemporary art. The organization responded to an essential need in Quebec and Canada for up to date, accurate information on contemporary visual art. In order to realize their objective of disseminating this information, the founders opened a documentation centre in Montreal. They then created Artextes Editions, which today comprises about 20 titles. Artexte also set up a national service for the distribution of exhibition catalogues and independent publications on contemporary art. In 1997, this service was transferred to a private business specializing in the distribution of this type of document, ABC Art Books Canada. In 1993, the bookstore moved into the Mus√©e d'art contemporain de Montr√©al. Two years later Artexte let go of its bookstore operations, which were passed on to Librairie Olivieri in September 1995, under a partnership agreement respecting the initial objectives of Artexte's mandate. The Librairie Olivieri du Mus√©e closed its doors in 2009. In May 1996, Artexte moved to a larger space at 460 Sainte-Catherine Street West. This move marked the beginning of a new era for the organization and its users, by positioning Artexte within the heart of a network frequented by artists and researchers of contemporary art. In 2012, Artexte moved to new premises in Montreal's vibrant Quartier des spectacles. Artexte now occupies a large, luminous space on the third floor of the 2-22 Building (at 2 Sainte-Catherine Street East). In addition to having a larger consultation area for research purposes than before, it opened a new exhibition space. The gallery's programming is linked to print culture and addresses issues pertaining to visual arts documents. Artexte has become a renowned arts organization which, by the scope of its activities, responds with a high level of professionalism to the specific needs of the visual arts network in Canada and beyond. Collection The Mobilivre-Bookmobile Project Collection at Artexte The collection of Artexte Information Centre includes: * 30,000 publications and visual, audio or digital documents * 11,000 documentation files for arts organizations, events, subjects and disciplines, etc. * 4,500 Canadian artists' files * 3,000 non-Canadian artists' files * Canadian and foreign art periodicals * special collections of artists' publications including the Mobilivre-Bookmobile Project collection of artists' books, zines, multiples, etc., \\"A Relatively Small Collection\\" and \\"Galerie Largeness\\" The collection of Artexte is non-circulating.

Dr. James Bandinel (1733 - 17 November 1804) was a British scholar and cleric. Life He was born in the parish of St Martin, on the Channel Island of Jersey, second son of George Bandinel by his second wife, Elizabeth Lempriere. Educated at Winchester College, Bandinel went on to achieve distinction at the University of Oxford, entering Jesus College, Oxford in 1752 (B.A. 1755, M.A. 1758, B.D. 1767 and D.D. 1777); he was Fellow 1754-1776. At University level, he was Junior Proctor in 1766 under Nathaniel Haines of Pembroke College; elected to White's Professorship of Moral Philosophy in February 1767; and elected Oxford's twenty-first Public Orator in May 1776, a position he held until 1784. He was sometime Chaplain to the Marquess of Buckingham, the Viceroy of Ireland, and his nomination to a bishopric had been proposed by his close friend, Viscount Bulkeley of Cashel, with whom he travelled in his youth. He was Rector of St Bartholomew‚Äôs, Furtho, Northamptonshire, and also of St Giles‚Äô, Wigginton, Oxfordshire, 1775-1789. In 1789, Bandinel was presented by his kinsman, Rev. Dr. Daniel Dumaresq, to the vicarage of Netherbury in Dorset. He sold off his possessions in an auction from his home in New College Lane, Oxford, and moved with his young family to Dorset. He is described as \\"a man of deep learning, sincere piety, refined manners, and great kindness of heart.\\" Bandinel‚Äôs memory was long cherished at Netherbury, with a respect and devotion which had not died in fifty years after his death. Works Bandinel was selected to be the first Bampton Lecturer, a post instituted by John Bampton. His series of sermons\\"Eight sermons preached at the lecture founded by the rev. John Bampton. To which is added, a vindication of st. Paul from the charge of wishing himself accursed, a sermon\\" (Oxford: 1780) were published the next year and demonstrate \\"great erudition and knowledge of the Holy Scriptures\\"; the sermons, were, however, of a noticeably High Church strain, and his known attachment to the house of Stuart alone prevented him from attaining the highest ecclesiastical dignity. Family Bandinel married in December 1775 to Margaret Dumaresq, and had five children, of whom Mary Anne, born 1784, died at the age of fourteen. His firstborn son, Bulkeley Bandinel, was Bodley's Librarian at Oxford from 1813-1860. His second son, James Bandinel of the Foreign Office was Superintendent of the Slave Trade Department there. Bandinel died at Winchester and was buried in the chancel at St Mary the Virgin‚Äôs, Netherbury. His wife pre-deceased him in 1792.

Tauber (born 1947), is an American philosopher and historian of science, who, from 1993 to 2010, served as director of the Boston University Center for Philosophy and History of Science at Boston University. Tauber has published extensively on 19th and 20th century biomedicine, the development of modern immunology, the doctor-patient relationship, and contemporary science studies. He is the 2008 recipient of the Science Medal from the University of Bologna in Bologna, Italy, and Doctor of Philosophy honoris causa from the University of Haifa in Haifa, Israel, in 2011. Since 2013 he has been chairman of the board of governors of the University of Haifa.  Research  Tauber's key publications fall into three areas: He published the first philosophical study of contemporary immunology, The Immune Self: Theory or Metaphor? (Cambridge 1994), which became the second monograph of a quartet tracing the theoretical development of this science. In these works and various critical papers he has argued that the prevailing self/nonself paradigm inadequately models immune tolerance and over-emphasizes host defense at the expense of cooperative ecological relationships. By advocating a cognitive view of immune functions, he presents physiological autoimmunity and symbiotic relationships as alternate immune frameworks for modeling normal immunity. His Immunity: The Evolution of an Idea (Oxford 2017) summarizes this interpretation. In medical ethics, Tauber has focused on the doctor-patient relationship: In Confessions of a Medicine Man (MIT 1999), he promoted the foundational status of the ethics of medicine and thus firmly placed science and technology in the employ of the moral mandate of health care. Patient Autonomy and the Ethics of Responsibility (MIT Press 2005) extended this argument with a description of \\"relational autonomy\\" to define the moral status of the patient, coupled with advocacy of patient-centered medicine. His third area of interest has centered on the replacement of reified notions of science with an epistemology thoroughly melded with human-centered interests and intentions. In seeking a comprehensive understanding of scientific practice and application, Tauber argues for a \\"moral epistemology\\", a philosophy that builds upon the collapse of the fact/value distinction to define the interplay of various values in the diversity of science's methodologies and interpretations. More specifically, he is concerned with the nature of knowing that translates objective knowledge into personal meaning. His Thoreau and the Moral Agency of Knowing (California 2001) illustrates the composite character of personal identity that such an approach presents, one in which moral agency broadly defines personal identity. These studies have been extended in critiques of psychoanalytic portrayals of the ego that place Freud in imagined dialogues with philosophers of his own era in Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher (Princeton 2010) and with Adorno, Heidegger, and Wittgenstein in Requiem for the Ego (Stanford 2013). While primarily teaching and writing in science studies and bioethics, Tauber originally trained as a biochemist and hematologist and has published over 125 research publications in biochemistry and cell biology. Since 2004, Tauber has held a part-time visiting professorship at Tel Aviv University in Tel Aviv, Israel, where he teaches in the Cohn Institute for the History of Science and Ideas.  Personal  Tauber is married to Paula Fredriksen , the William Goodwin Aurelio Professor of the Appreciation of Scripture Emerita at Boston University. Alfred Tauber's extracurricular activities focus on 1) Amuta Moshe Hess, a charity he founded, which provides services to the mentally disabled in Israel; 2) Avaloch Farm Music Institute established in Boscawen, New Hampshire, to foster the development of professional chamber music ensembles and composition of new classical music ; and 3) Molad, the Center for Renewal of Israeli Democracy, where he is the chairman of the board .

This includes public solicitation, living on the earnings of a prostitute and maintaining a brothel. In practice, police unofficially tolerate and monitor a limited number of brothels. Prostitutes in such establishments are required to undergo periodic health checks and must carry a health card. History The rapid economic development of Singapore in the late nineteenth century combined with the city's gender imbalance (the male population greatly outnumbered the female) resulted in prostitution becoming a flourishing business and brothels a boom industry. The prostitutes were primarily Chinese and Japanese, imported as karayuki-san. It is estimated that 80% of the women and girls coming from China to Singapore in the late 1870s were sold into prostitution. The development of the Japanese enclave in Singapore at Middle Road, Singapore was connected to the establishment of brothels east of the Singapore River, namely along Hylam, Malabar, Malay and Bugis Streets during the late 1890s. By 1905 there were at least 109 Japanese brothels in Singapore. Prostitution was seen by the colonial authorities as a necessary evil but a number of steps were taken to place restrictions on prostitution in the city. The registration of prostitutes and brothels was made compulsory in an attempt to prevent forced prostitution, and an Office to Protect Virtue was set up to help anyone unwillingly involved in prostitution. Shortly after the outbreak of World War I the colonial authorities banned prostitution by white women, and as a result the white brothels in Singapore (over twenty in 1914) had all closed by 1916. A 1916 report described the misery and indecency of the prostitutes working in the red-light districts around Malay Street and Smith Street, and pressure was placed on the Colonial Office in Britain to further restrict licensed prostitution. Sir Arthur Young, governor-general of the Straits Settlements, considered prostitution indispensable for the colony's economy and labour supply but the sale of women and girls into prostitution was banned in 1917. Influential figures in the city's Japanese community who were concerned about dignity and morality put pressure on the Japanese Consulate to end Japanese prostitution. In 1920 the Consulate ordered the banishment of all Japanese prostitutes from Singapore, though some of the women remained as unlicensed prostitutes. The importation of women and girls for prostitution was banned in 1927 and brothels were banned in 1930, though prostitution remained legal. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore (1942‚Äì45), brothels were set up for the use of Japanese servicemen. There were about twenty such brothels in the city, typically housed in deserted Chinese mansions. By the time of the surrender of Japan in 1945 prostitution was flourishing. In the 1950s striptease acts took place at the city's getai shows, performed by specialist travelling dance troupes. The shows developed a sleazy image, partly as a result of stories about performers working as prostitutes. During this decade the city's police organised operations to reduce prostitution and Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock sought out suggestions as to how prostitution could be limited. Women's rights activist Shirin Fozdar described Singapore as \\"one big brothel\\" and the city was a regional centre for prostitution. The People's Action Party under the leadership by Lee Kuan Yew initially banned prostitution when they came to power in the late 1950s, switching to a strategy of containment in the mid 1960s. From the 1950s to the early 1980s Bugis Street was famous for its nightly adult-themed shows performed by transvestites and groups of prostitutes would also openly solicit there. Neighbouring Johore Road was also part of the red-light district in the 1960s and the 1970s, with transgender prostitutes soliciting for business in the shophouses and alleys. Suppression of prostitution in the area began in the 1970s, and the trade was dispersed to the surrounding areas such as Jalan Besar. The old Bugis Street was demolished in the mid-1980s and Johore Road disappeared in the late 1990s.

Prostitution and Law Enforcement in Practice Prostitution occupies an ambivalent position in Singaporean society. Major constraints control its practice despite it being legal. Police unofficially tolerate and monitor a limited number of brothels, where the prostitutes are regularly screened for health check-ups; however prostitution outside these brothels also exists such as via social escort agencies that usually adopt an internet website or Facebook presence. Prostitution outside the informally designated red-light areas operates via three main channels: internet advertising, street solicitation, and karaoke box and massage parlor work. The internet-advertised sex workers are based in anonymous hotels, and the profile of each sex worker is available from the internet advertisement. Interested clients contact the sex worker's agent through SMS, who arranges the timing and gives the hotel address to the client. Sex workers operating via such illegal pimps come primarily from Thailand, China and Philippines to Singapore for a short tourist visit, and therefore are not screened for health check-ups. There are also local Singaporean masseurs, therapists, call girls or social escorts in the industry working as sex workers on the pretext of being students at a local educational institution such as a polytechnic, models, working office professionals or ex-air stewardesses. Some of these say that they are certified therapists. Apart from the usual bilingual Singaporean Chinese that speak English as well as a mother tongue such as Mandarin, other ethnic races on the island such as Malay and Indian women also work as social escorts often using an English name, alongside Eurasians and Russians. Vietnamese prostitutes in Singapore charge high prices for their services. There are grey areas such as social escorts which do not infringe on the women's charter in Singapore's law. Apart from these regulated brothels, commercial sex workers can be found in many \\"massage\\" or \\"spa\\" establishments. Some massage parlours, including tui na outlets, employ women from mainland China and offer massages as a pretext for 'special' sexual services. These activities are illegal, and the operators of such massage establishments risk jail if exposed by anti-vice police raids. Yet, virtually everyone who visits these establishments in particular is fully aware of the sexual services provided within, and are there precisely because of it. The main red-light district in Singapore is located in Geylang. Orchard Towers, nicknamed the \\"Four Floors of Whores\\", is a shopping centre frequented by prostitutes. Some bars in Duxton Hill also offer sexual services, the most controversial ones being located at Adelphi basement which also houses a handful of law firms in the same building as well as within walking distance from the Ministry of Law in Singapore. =Vice busting= As the year 2015 came to an end, there had been an increase of around 40% of commercial crimes including prostitution or sex-related scams involving the internet; the public has been advised by the National Crime Prevention Council (Singapore) to be wary of controversial practices such as sugar mommies, credit-for-sex or internet love scams. With sensual massage palours and other sex-related vice activities also appearing in suburban heartlands such as Woodlands, Sembawang, Sengkang, Jurong West, Yishun, Chinatown and River Valley, the Government of Singapore is looking at various options of regulating and punishing violations such as cases of unlicensed prostitutions or operators of brothels. In 2016, examples of sentencing include Chew Tiong Wei who was jailed 85 months and fined S$130,000 for running an online vice ring and evading S$26,964.65 in income tax. There are also reported cases of nightly vice activities involving transvestite prostitutes soliciting at a car park in the old Woodlands Town Garden which is adjacent to the Johor-Singapore Causeway. These are possibly Malaysian transvestites working full-time jobs in Singapore, moonlighting to save money for sex-change operations. Member of Parliament Halimah Yacob announced in 2016 a series of changes involving National Parks Board to clean up the sleaze in the area that involves upgrading the pre-existing park and malls there. There are also rare cases of policemen impersonation on the pretext of robbing sex workers. These are offences punishable by the law in Singapore, as in the case of Teo Zhi Jie, Melvin Tan Shen Kang, Andrew Tan Zhi Wei and Lee Qing Yew. Teo Zhi Jie has since been sentenced to two years and seven months in jail and 12 strokes of the cane. Sex trafficking Singapore is a destination country for women and girls from other Asian countries subjected to sex trafficking and a source country for Singaporean women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Some of the 965,000 foreign work permit holders that comprise more than one-quarter of Singapore's total labor force are vulnerable to trafficking; most victims migrate willingly. Traffickers compel victims into sex exploitation through illegal withholding of their pay, threats of forced repatriation without pay, restrictions on movement, and physical and sexual abuse. Foreign women sometimes arrive in Singapore with the intention of engaging in prostitution, but under the threat of serious harm or other forms of coercion, they become victims of sex trafficking. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Singapore as a 'Tier 2' country.

The original farm was founded by Doctor Joseph McKegg Pound and his wife Sarah in 1854 in an unsettled area of Central Texas, now located in the City of Dripping Springs. The farmstead is currently a museum about the life and times of Dr. Pound, his family and descendants. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 28, 1995. Pound first came to Texas 1847 to fight in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He returned to Kentucky to pursue his medical education. In 1853, he returned to Texas with his wife, Sarah, along with two other families, John Lee and Malvina Wallace and daughter, Carrie; and John Lauter and Indiana \\"Nannie\\" Moss and son, Joseph. Dr. Pound first bought acreage near Henly; however, by December 1854, he sold his holdings there and purchased the land in what would become Dripping Springs. It is believed the spot for the farm was chosen because it was on the road connecting Austin to Fort Martin Scott in Fredericksburg. The original Pound Home, the oldest existing building in Dripping Springs, was built as a \\"dog-trot\\" style log cabin, but was expanded to make room for Dr. Pound's medical practice. Dr. Pound was the earliest doctor in Hays County. The Pound house served as a medical office and hospital, church, schoolhouse, post office and social gathering place for the fledgling community of Dripping Springs. Dr. Pound also insisted on treating the local Indians with respect, and due to this was never raided. The Pounds had nine children. Four generations of the family occupied the farmstead over a period of 130 years, until 1983. The property was donated to the City of Dripping Springs in 1987. In 1990, restorations on the house began. The Dr. Joseph M. and Sarah Pound Historical Museum opened in May 2003 and is part of Founder's Park.

Biography Gordon was born in Vilna, Russian Empire (currently Vilnius, Lithuania), March 15, 1872, the son of a medical practitioner. He attended a college at Vilna, taking the rabbinical course, and came to the United States in 1890. After working for a time in a harness shop at Meriden, Connecticut, he went West and with headquarters at Denver, Colorado, established a photograph enlarging business, traveling from town to town by wagon and enlarging pictures as he went. Later he operated a picture slot-machine place at Helena, Montana, and a drug store at Seattle, Washington. In 1902 he returned to Denver where he became part owner of a penny arcade, showing slot-machine pictures. In the following year he returned to New England and with his brother Israel Gordon opened a slot-machine picture business at Worcester, Mass., placing machines in stores, penny arcades and elsewhere. Later he established penny arcades in several neighboring cities in Massachusetts and Connecticut. In 1906 he opened at Worcester a ‚Äúnickelodeon,‚Äù the first motion picture theatre in that city. Its success prompted him to extend the scope of his operations gradually until he became the largest operator of motion picture and vaudeville theatres in New England. He also built, with his three brothers, the Gordon Olympia theatre at Rochester, N.Y. In 1912 he organized and became president of Olympia Theatres, Inc., which eventually operated thirty-eight motion picture theatres in New England. He was also the managing director of each theatre in the chain. Secondarily, Gordon and Louis Mayer formed the Gordon-Mayer Theatrical Company, which booked talent for his theatres and distributed Metro's pictures.Hollywood East by Diana Altman, page 45 Meanwhile, as one of the largest exhibitors of motion pictures, Gordon became interested in the stabilization of conditions in the industry and in 1917 was largely instrumental in organizing the First National Exhibitors Circuit, Inc., of which he was elected a vice-president and director. This corporation, which was succeeded in 1919 by Associated First National Pictures, Inc., and in 1924 by First National Pictures, Inc., was formed originally to function as an agency to lease and distribute motion pictures for exhibition by its members. More specifically, by late 1921, over 4,000 franchise holders were participating in a consolidated enterprise with an estimated value of $50 million for \\"the elimination of wasteful expense and for the betterment of the quality of photoplays and methods of exchanging and distributing films.\\"Boston Daily Globe, September 11, 1921, page 48 This limitation on its field of action, however, did not long continue, the corporation early developing into a product of motion pictures on a large scale, with an extensive plant at Burbank, Calif., and with some of the most popular film stars of that period, including Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, on its list of actors. As recalled by his son, William J. J. Gordon:Lion of Hollywood by Scott Eyman, page 45 Advertisement for Gordon's theatres in the Boston area, 1920 > \\"My father was a typical bourgeois. The theatre business wasn't formal > enough for him. Some people he admired on the screen, but couldn't do > business with. Charlie Chaplin, for instance; he couldn't stand him > personally. Father was a banker; the sooner he could put on banking clothes, > the more relaxed he was. Louis Mayer he regarded as perhaps overenthusiastic > but an honorable man, far more than most of the people in the business.\\" Gordon, as a director and member of the executive committee, played an important role in this evolution. He resigned from the directorate in 1923 but as one of the largest stockholders continued active in the management of First National Pictures until control of the corporation was acquired by Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., in 1928. Meanwhile he disposed of his interest in Olympia Theatres, Inc., to the Paramount Famous Lasky Corp. in 1925. According to the Boston Daily Globe, the transaction was reportedly valued at $12 million and included Gordon's holdings in 38 moving picture playhouses in New England. Boston Daily Globe, May 16, 1925, page 4 Widely known for his philanthropic interests, he was a trustee of the Beth Israel hospital in Boston and a director of the Associated Jewish Philanthropies of that city and the Hebrew Ladies home at Dorchester, Mass. He was non-sectarian in his benefactions, however, giving generously to Christian as well as Jewish institutions and causes. Among these was the Baptist hospital in Boston, to which he donated the Gordon Piazza. A man of innumerable private charities, he helped many of his employees to build homes and at Christmas time made gifts to hundreds of children. Possessing great energy, courage and driving power, he overcame the handicap of serious ill health in his youth and became a successful and respected figure in the motion picture industry. He was married at Rochester, N.Y., Aug. 25, 1909, to Sarah Anna, daughter of Abraham Edinberg, a merchant of Worcester, Mass., and they had three children  Alvin, William and Marion. As retold by his daughter:Lion of Hollywood by Scott Eyman, page 45 > \\"He was a powerhouse, an impossible father and not a very good husband, but > he was terribly, terribly intelligent. He never owned a house until he was > sixty. He rented those huge places already furnished, and Mother would have > to accommodate herself. ... One of the biggest houses was in Jamaica Plain. > It had a bowling alley in the garage.

Although it underwent extensive development, it was not successful, only a single aircraft being built. Design and development Conceived as a biplane powered by the Bristol Jupiter radial engine it would have much better performance than the Virginia with similar engines. Initially a private venture, the submission of the Vickers design to the Air Ministry coincided with the issuing of Air Ministry specification B.19/27 for a Virginia replacement. The B.19/27 specification meant that the Vickers submission would be tested competitively in trials against other manufacturer's designs. In the redesign to meet the specification, the B.19/27 project took the Virginia Mark X all moving rudder together with an all-moving tailplane. Three designs were submitted in total; two biplanes with Jupiter and geared Bristol Mercury engines respectively and a monoplane version. The Mercury-engined design, the Vickers Type 150 was selected by the Ministry for consideration and building, now to be funded by the Ministry, started. Partway through it was agreed that an alternative engine was allowable, the Rolls-Royce F.XIV (later developed into the Rolls- Royce Kestrel). The aircraft flew for the first time on 30 November 1929. The aircraft was a two-bay biplane of all-metal construction, with a biplane tailplane and with the two engines mounted between the wings. Initial testing and evaluation showed that the aircraft had poor handling, being unstable laterally, prone to Dutch roll and to severe flexing of the rear fuselage.Andrews and Morgan 1988, p.259 Following a forced landing it was rebuilt incorporating recommendations made in reports from Ministry test pilots to try to resolve these problems, and was powered by Kestrel III engines. It was then given the name Vickers Vanox by Vickers. These changes did not solve the aircraft's handling problems, and the sweepback of the wings was reduced, which did resolve the handling problems. The Kestrel engines proved unreliable,Andrews and Morgan 1988, p.261 and were replaced by more powerful Bristol Pegasus radial engines. In this form, the aircraft was designated the Vickers Type 195 Vanox, and was demonstrated to meet the requirements of specification. Following further modifications in February 1933 to improve performance, with extended, three-bay wings being fitted, it was now designated the Type 255. However, by this time, the competing Handley Page Heyford and Fairey Hendon bombers had already been ordered into production, so the sole Type 255 was used for aerial refuelling trials work by the Royal Aircraft Establishment, being flown for the last time on 7 January 1938.

Many researchers have been trained to conduct studies, requiring multiple skills ranging from liaising with clinical staff to the statistical analysis of complex data, such as using Bayesian methods. The role of a Statistical Epidemiologist is to bring the most appropriate methods available to bear on observational study from medical research, requiring a broad appreciation of the underpinning methods and their context of applicability and interpretation. The earliest mention of this phrase was in an article by EB Wilson, taking a critical look at the way in which statistical methods were developing and being applied in the science of epidemiology.

There is an offence of ‚Äúaggravated procuring‚Äù where a minor is involved. Keeping a brothel is not prohibited. Prostitution is widespread in Guatemala; UNAIDS estimate there to be 26,000 prostitutes in the country. Guatemala City alone has 9 red- light districts, including La Linea, El Trebol and Parque Concordia. Statistics from the Vigilancia Centinela de las Infecciones de Transmisi√≥n Sexual (VICITS) sexual health clinics from 2007‚Äì2011, showed 10.8 of the sex workers worked on the streets, the rest working indoors at strip clubs, brothels based at residential homes, bars etc. Child sex tourism is a problem in the country especially in areas such as Antigua and Guatemala City. Human trafficking is also a significant and growing problem in the country, particularly the exploitation of children in prostitution. Many women and children are brought into the country from El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras by organized rings that force them into prostitution. Colonial period In colonial Guatemala, and into the 20th century, prostitution was thought of as necessary to protect the virtues of the \\"ladies\\" of Guatemala. Brothels and street prostitution were tolerated and commonplace. Guatemalan law held that prostitutes could not be raped and that violence was an occupational hazard. Any woman, whether a prostitute or not, convicted of \\"bad conduct\\" could be incarcerated in a brothel for up to 3 years. Until outlawed in 1906, individual women and their sentences could be brought and sold between brothel madams. La Linea In Guatemala City there is a red-light district by the \\"La Linea\\" railway track. About 250 prostitutes work there in shacks. The women rent the shacks directly from the owners and work for themselves, not pimps. They do have to pay protection money to local gangs. Generally the local police ignore the area. The 'Oblate Sisters of the Most Holy Redeemer' provide outreach services to the women and run a drop-in center. The MuJER also provide outreach services to the women in La Linea and the other red-light districts of Guatemala City. =La Linea All-Stars= In 2004, some of the prostitutes formed a five-a-side football team to bring attention to the indignities and dangers of their lives. They joined a local league and their first match was against a high class private girl's school. During the game the parents found out how the team playing their daughters were and had the game stopped. Following this the team was expelled from the league. As a result of the publicity surrounding the incident, a local travel company sponsored them to go on a tour of Guatemala, playing against other teams including other teams of prostitutes, such as the \\"Tigers of Desire\\", a team from a brothel in Flores. The tour attracted adverse publicity from moral conservatives and sponsorship was withdrawn. Director Chema Rodr√≠guez made a documentary film, Estrellas de La L√≠nea, about the All Stars in 2006. HIV With less than 1 percent of the adult population estimated to be HIV-positive, Guatemala is considered to have a concentrated epidemic.\\"Health Profile: Guatemala\\" . United States Agency for International Development (June 2008). Accessed 7 September 2008. In 2008, national HIV prevalence among sex workers is 4 percent, and among street-based female sex workers prevalence is as high as 12 percent. Following national and local awareness campaigns, education on sexual health and condom distribution, the HIV prevalence rate amongst sex workers dropped to 1.6% in 2016. Child prostitution International tourists travel to Guatemala to engage in child sex tourism, especially in areas such as Antigua and Guatemala City. Children from poor families fall victims to trafficking for purposes of prostitution through advertisements for lucrative foreign jobs or through personal recruitment. Street children are especially vulnerable to sexual exploitation. The NGO End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography, and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes (ECPAT) reported that children between the ages of 8 and 14 were sold for 750 to 1,500 quetzals ($97 to $194) to work in various economic activities, but primarily for sexual exploitation. According to ECPAT, the incidents of trafficking in persons and the sale of children for sexual exploitation have likely increased due to higher unemployment rates and increasing numbers of individuals living in extreme poverty. Police, military, and elected officials have been placed under investigation for paying children for sex acts, facilitating child sex trafficking, or protecting venues where trafficking occurs. Sex trafficking Guatemala is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Guatemalan women, girls, and boys are exploited in sex trafficking within the country and in Mexico, the United States, Belize, and other foreign countries. Commercial sexual exploitation of Guatemalan children by foreign tourists from Canada, the United States, and Western Europe, and by Guatemalan residents persists. Women and children from other Latin American countries and the United States are exploited in sex trafficking in Guatemala. Government studies of past cases suggest women recruited victims while men ran criminal organizations. Criminal organizations, including gangs, exploit girls in sex trafficking. Some Latin American migrants transiting Guatemala en route to Mexico and the United States are subjected to sex trafficking in Mexico, the United States, or Guatemala. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Guatemala as a Tier 2 Watch List' country.

Hatcher family =Peter Warren \\"Pete\\" Hatcher= A smart, impatient, sarcastic, and seemingly naive boy who lives in New York City. He is a kind, polite, thoughtful and sensitive boy, but reveals a quick temper when provoked or impassioned. He often feels unappreciated and uncared for by his parents, mainly due to the amount of attention his brother requires. In the first book, he is nine years old and in the fourth grade, and in Double Fudge he is twelve and in seventh grade. He has a habit of imagining things, often at times thinking up TV ads for concepts he has just been introduced to (a trait likely inherited from his father as that is his career). He likes to collect things, such as baseball cards. Peter tries to make it very clear that he despises his brother, but it is obvious that he truly cares for him. He was originally called \\"Pee-tah\\" by Fudge when Fudge was a toddler, which later changed to \\"Pete\\" when Fudge improved his speaking with age. Peter despised being called \\"Pete\\" by his little brother more than \\"Pee-Tah\\", but does his best to put up with it. He is a smart kid and he is a hard worker who cares deeply for his family and friends. =Farley Drexel \\"Fudge\\" Hatcher= Fudge is Peter's little brother. Disaster follows him everywhere he goes, often making a spectacle of himself and setting a bad image to his family. Some of his best-known escapades in the series include throwing temper tantrums (most notably at the shoe store), finger-painting with mashed potatoes at a diner, scribbling all over Peter's transportation committee poster, and ultimately, swallowing Peter's small pet turtle. Although Fudge is spoiled, will often throw tantrums, and act very immature, he later becomes very intelligent for his age (as first revealed in Superfudge). Later still, he becomes very imaginative like his brother Peter. Thus, he eventually develops from a spoiled and demanding toddler into a less spoiled and much kinder boy with a vivid imagination and a strong desire to learn things. From book one until book 3, he calls Peter \\"Pee-tah\\". In book 4, he decides to call Peter \\"Pete\\", much to the dislike of his brother. Fudge will have a meltdown if he is called by his real name of \\"Farley Drexel,\\" \\"Farley,\\" or even \\"Drexel\\" as shown in the third book; however, in \\"Fudge-a-Mania\\", he briefly identifies himself as Farley to someone without incident. (Also, in \\"Double Fudge\\", when he becomes obsessed with money, he refers to the bank he'd like to have as the \\"Farley Drexel Hatcher Bank,\\" which surprises Peter and causes him to realize that Fudge is not a good adult name.) He has a pet bird named \\"Uncle Feather\\". =Tamara Roxanne \\"Tootsie\\" Hatcher= Peter and Fudge's baby sister, born in the second book. Fudge is jealous and hates her in the beginning, even attempting to exchange her for things such as money or a two-wheeled bicycle. Right before the Hatchers move to Princeton Fudge hides her in a closet. Tootsie is rather playful, curious and likable. Her first word that she ever spoke was \\"Yuck\\" when she hears Peter say it when he is changing her diaper. Then she says \\"Nu Yuck,\\" when the family decides to go back to New York City. She eventually learns more words and likes to repeat what some people say. She especially likes to make animal noises when she hears somebody saying the name of an animal. In the fourth book, Tootsie accidentally walks across Frank Fargo's paintings before they dry, leading Fargo to create a whole series of paintings featuring Tootsie's footprints on canvas, called \\"Baby Feet.\\" In Double Fudge, when the Fargos move downtown, the Hatchers learn she can't pronounce \\"sh\\" yet. =Anne Hatcher= Mother of Peter, Fudge, and later, Tootsie. She is a stay-at-home mom who later becomes a professional dental hygienist. She always does her best to be a mother to her children, although she tends to be more partial towards Fudge. She becomes related to the Tubman family when her mother, Muriel, marries Bertram \\"Buzzy Senior\\" Tubman in Maine. =Warren Hatcher= Father to Peter, Fudge and Tootsie. (Peter's middle name comes from his father.) He is in the advertising business and he writes commercials. His agency has had accounts with Juicy-O and the Toddle Bike company (for whom Fudge appears in a commercial), as well as with X-Plode Cereal (only mentioned by Fudge, though). In the first book, he is much more of a blunt parent than his wife. When Fudge refuses to eat his meals and wants to be fed like a dog, Warren takes charge and warns Fudge he will either \\"eat it or wear it\\" ‚Äî putting an end to the tomfoolery. In the second book, he takes a leave of absence from the ad agency to attempt to write a book called History Of Advertising but at the end of the second book, he gives it up altogether and returns to his old job in the advertising company. He grows a beard in Superfudge, but later shaves it off in Fudge-a-Mania.\\" =Grandma Muriel= Anne's mother. She is known for using classic phrases and various tricks to help the kids. She originally was a gymnastics teacher, so she is very good at turning cartwheels, and agrees to teach Sheila Tubman how. In the fourth book, she marries Sheila's grandfather, Buzzy Senior, thereby uniting both the Hatcher and Tubman families much to the dismay of Peter Hatcher and Sheila Tubman. She is a very likable, and agreeable person altogether. =Cousin Howard \\"Howie\\" Hatcher= Warren's long-lost cousin in Double Fudge, both of whom were great friends. Howie seems to have some slightly rude behavior, as he calls Warren \\"Tubby\\" even though he's lost some weight since, and a rather crazy driver when it comes to golf carts, and easily gets frustrated. Howie works as a park ranger in Hawaii and plans to move his family to the Everglades. According to Peter, Howie says \\"no\\" to everything such as pop music, romance series books, TV, junk food, school, fashion magazines with advice to the lovelorn, etc.. =Cousin Eudora Hatcher= Howie's wife in Double Fudge. Like her husband, she calls Warren \\"Tubby.\\" She also happens to be pregnant, and isn't as rude and strict as her husband, and is often the mediator between Howie and their daughters. =Flora and Fauna Hatcher= Howie and Eudora's two identical twelve-year-old twin daughters in Double Fudge. They are known for both finishing each other's sentences, and breaking it into song and dance routines in public, which impresses others but embarrasses Peter. They do seem to be somewhat spoiled, and usually beg and plead to get their way, while Eudora manages to present the case carefully to Howie. They are usually nicknamed the \\"Natural Beauties\\" (due to Flora meaning plant life and Fauna meaning animal life) and the \\"Heavenly Hatchers.\\" =\\"Mini\\" Farley Drexel Hatcher= Flora and Fauna's younger 3-and-1/2-year- old brother and Howie's and Eudora's son in Double Fudge, who acts similar to Fudge's 2-year-old Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing behavior in many ways. Usually he will just growl and act like an animal, due to his older sisters trying to always comment on him and act as if he were non-verbal, but all that changed by the end when he finally made the point to the twins he can speak for himself. Fudge grows to dislike him, due to him nearly receiving the same nickname as Fudge, being the cause of Uncle Feather's broken wing, and ultimately swallowing Fudge's first loose tooth at their farewell dinner. ;Back to top Fargo family =Jimmy Fargo= Peter's best friend. He is in the same grade as Peter and slightly older than he is, assuming that he celebrated his tenth birthday in the first book, and taller than Sheila. Jimmy and his family originally lived a few buildings down from Peter and Sheila, and then moved into Peter and Sheila's building, before eventually moving down to SoHo. In the TV series, Jimmy and his father are African-American. =Frank Fargo= Jimmy's father. He used to be an actor but became an abstract artist, judging from Peter's descriptions of some of his paintings. In Superfudge he and his wife divorced, which was very unsettling for their son. In a later book, Tootsie accidentally toddles across one of Frank's paintings, which inspires him for a new artwork series entitled \\"Baby Feet.\\" Frank gets remarried to Beverly Muldour, an art dealer and neighbor of the Hatchers from their time in Princeton, New Jersey. =Anita Fargo= Jimmy Fargo's mother and the first wife of Frank Fargo. She is first seen in the first Fudge book at Jimmy's birthday party giving Peter his pet turtle, Dribble. She later divorced Frank Fargo after an argument during which she threw red paint at one of his paintings, to which Mr. Fargo took advantage to display, calling the painting \\"Anita's Anger.\\" Jimmy said that his mother loves kissing, so she moved from New York to Vermont, where Jimmy and Peter believe people engage in much kissing. Mrs. Fargo appears to have moved to a very rural community in Vermont, as Peter says at one point he is unable to contact Jimmy as he is visiting his mother in Vermont, and they had no telephone service there. ;Back to top Tubman family =Sheila Tubman= Peter's rival (though Peter sees her as a \\"sworn enemy\\"). She lives in Peter's apartment building two floors below his own. Peter believes Sheila is a real know-it-all. She was the Queen of Cooties even when she was in 4th grade. She gives up cooties sometime between the fourth and seventh chapters of the first book. She is incredibly bossy, which is especially evidenced when she tries to run a report committee (which Peter and Jimmy were also in) by herself. She has an older sister named Libby. In the second book, she exhibits a fear of dogs, especially Peter's dog, Turtle. There may be some chances of Sheila and Peter showing slight affections towards each other throughout the series, and it is obvious she has a small crush on him. In the fourth book, Sheila becomes Peter's cousin-in-law when her grandfather, Buzzy, and Peter's grandmother, Muriel, marry. In the book Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great, Sheila meets her best friend, Mouse Ellis. She constantly fibs about her fear for many things, such as dogs, spiders, swimming, and the dark. But in the end, she confronts her fears and admits her weak side. She is mean to the Hatchers. =Libby Tubman= Sheila's older sister, who often is seen dancing in a leotard. She fancies herself as being very sophisticated and glamorous, addressing her parents as \\"Mother\\" and \\"Father.\\" She is very interested in boys, and it is also shown she is not a great singer, when she does not get the part of Wendy in a production of Peter Pan. In the third book, Mrs. Hatcher hires Libby to help watch after Fudge when the demands of a baby and other parenting responsibilities get to be too much for her to handle at once. Her friend, when the Tubman family lived in Tarrytown, is Mary Ann Markman. Libby is often annoyed by Sheila and her attention-getting, much like Peter could be with Fudge, and so, because of their shared situations, is often willing to try to get along with Peter. In the fourth book, Libby becomes Peter's cousin-in-law when her grandfather Buzzy Senior marries Peter's grandmother. In the fifth book, she does not appear. According to Sheila, Libby went off to college. =Jean and Bertram \\"Buzz\\" Tubman= Sheila and Libby's parents. Mr. Tubman is a college professor at Marymount College in the second book. In the fourth book, they become related to the Hatchers when Mr. Tubman's father marries Anne Hatcher's mother. =Buzzy Senior= Sheila's grandfather, who ends up marrying Muriel at the end of Fudge-A-Mania, thereby uniting the Hatcher and Tubman families, much to Peter's and Sheila's dismay. ;Back to top Ellis family =Merle 'Mouse' Ellis= Sheila's same age friend from Tarrytown in Otherwise Known As Sheila The Great that has many noticeable scabs on her legs. They are best buds until a game of slam book where they start fighting with Bobby Egran's models with the Van Arden twins, Sondra and Jane. Despite it all, Mouse and Sheila repair their friendship afterwards. She is the grand champion of Tarrytown in yo-yo and is an expert swimmer. She was going to visit Sheila in Maine in Fudge-a-Mania, but was struck down with chicken pox and couldn't make it, much to the dismay of Sheila. =Betsy Ellis= Mouse's little sister at age 4 in Otherwise Known As Sheila The Great. She is a champion swimmer known to do perfect dives. She is allergic to dogs and carries around her make- believe dog (which is an empty candy box), whom she calls Ootch. She calls Sheila \\"Sunny\\", which was her made-up nickname. ;Back to top Manheim family =Daniel Manheim= Fudge's new friend, introduced in Superfudge. He is described as adopted, pudgy and Jewish, with much reddish hair, and ears that stick out even more than Peter's. Daniel is a bird expert, as seen in the beginning of Chapter 9 as he is lecturing Fudge on myna birds. He also delivers his tough-guy line: \\"Ya wanna make somethin' of it?\\" whenever asked of something. Once, though, after delivering his \\"tough-guy\\" line, Elaine, an acquaintance of Peter, agreed to \\"make something of it\\" and (playfully) challenged him to fight. Daniel then proceeded to chicken out. According to himself, he's six years old and lives at 432 Vine Street. He is a fussy eater; he constantly mentions that he does not like onions, lima beans, peas, Oreo cookies or bread crusts, and only drinks chocolate milk. Daniel lives in Princeton in the books, but in the TV series, Daniel lives in New York City (presumably in the same building as the Hatchers) and replaces Ralph in Fudge's group of friends invited to his birthday party. Also in the TV series, Daniel wears glasses and is five years old, but still retains his tough-guy attitude. =Mrs. Manheim= Daniel's adoptive mother in Superfudge, who is heavily concerned about her son. She drives a red sports car. ;Back to top Muldour family =Mrs. Muldour= One of Peter's new acquaintances in Superfudge. She is an elderly woman who lives near Peter, also is to be believed that she eats worms as Peter and Alex dig them up for her. =Beverly Muldour= A pretty young woman Peter first sees when she is working at an art gallery in Princeton in Superfudge. Due to her plunging neckline Peter secretly refers to her as \\"Giraffe Neck\\". It is later revealed that she is the daughter of Mrs. Muldour and is a big fan of Frank Fargo's paintings for their originality. She eventually becomes Frank Fargo's second wife and Jimmy's step-mother. ;Back to top Apfel family =Mitzi Apfel= Friend of Fudge's whom he met on vacation in Maine in Fudge-A-Mania. She is obsessed with Fudge, and develops a crush on him. According to Fudge, she keeps monster spray and has a baby brother called Jacob. She is also the granddaughter of famous baseball player Big Apfel. =Mrs. A= Mitzi's grandmother and Big Apfel's wife in Fudge-A-Mania. She makes Mitzi's monster spray for her and makes really tasty cocoa. Peter and Fudge first meet her when they go round the neighbor's houses asking if the neighbors have seen Uncle Feather. Mrs A originally thinks Uncle Feather is Peter and Fudge's uncle. =Big Apfel= Famous baseball player who Peter is astounded to find is his new neighbor in Maine in Fudge-A-Mania. Peter seriously looks forward to playing a game with him as there is a weekly softball game. However, Peter's enthusiasm is somewhat tempered when Big Apfel says he has aged since his Red Sox days and takes a more relaxed attitude to the community softball game, seeing it more as a friendly get-together as opposed to the Yankee-Red Sox intense rivalry Peter had read stories about. When Peter's grandmother gets married in an outdoor wedding, Big Apfel attends in his Red Sox uniform and barbecues burgers for the guests. ;Back to top Other characters =Mrs. Reese= The Tubmans' next door neighbor in Otherwise Known As Sheila The Great. She has a small puppy named Baby. = Henry Bevelheimer = The elevator operator, whom seems to know everybody in the apartment. Henry and Peter get along very well. On one occasion (in Superfudge), he scolded Peter for siccing Turtle on Sheila after she and Peter got into an argument. In Double Fudge, he helps out with Uncle Feather's brief period of being unable to talk, and is then later promoted to superintendent of the building and converts the elevator to self- service. In the TV series, Henry is the janitor and handyman of the building. =Dr. Cone= The family pediatrician in Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing, to whom Anne turns for advice when Fudge eats flowers, falls from the jungle gym, and refuses to eat. Despite Dr. Cone's assurances that most of the problems are normal for small children, even that will often fail to sway Anne's fretfulness. He offers reassurance to Peter when Fudge swallows his turtle. =Dr. Brown= The family dentist in Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing. He went to school and is personal friends with Warren, who calls him \\"Dusty.\\" Peter even remarked that Dr. Cone is always saying he \\"takes special good care of me and Fudge because we're chips off the old block (the old block being my father).\\" He does not allow fretful parents in the room when he is working on young patients. =Mr. Berman= A children's shoe salesman at Bloomingdale's in Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing. He remembers all his regular customers including the Hatcher brothers and entertains them with comic antics and gives out candy. =Jane and Sondra Van Arden= A set of twin sisters that also live in Tarrytown that are friends with Sheila and Mouse in Otherwise Known As Sheila The Great. Sondra is amply contoured, sensitive and shy, is a great swimmer despite her size, and usually comes up with good ideas. Jane is more aggressive than her sister, and is also more rude, and much thinner than Sondra. During their slam book game, Sondra is deeply offended by her friends calling her a \\"fat slob\\" and \\"crybaby,\\" and Jane is equally offended because she got some negative criticism as well. =Ralph, Jennie and Sam= Fudge's original friends who live in the same apartment building in Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing. In the TV series, Ralph does not appear, but Jennie and Sam do. Jennie and her family are of Chinese descent in the TV series. *Ralph loves food and is very large-bodied to the point where his own mother cannot lift him. *Jennie is described by Peter as a mini-vampire since she likes to bite people. She is also quite rude (which is shown when she annoys Anne Hatcher), and she even urinates on the rug. She also dislikes when she can't have things her way. *Sam went through a stage of having nearly every phobia possible, although he got over that by the end of Fudge's third birthday party in Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing, as evidenced by Peter's remark: \\"Now that he was used to us, I guess he liked us.\\" He also winds up getting chicken pox (in the seventh chapter of Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing), and having a new baby sibling (in the first chapter of Superfudge). =Alex Santos= Peter's new friend, introduced in Superfudge, as very small, with hair that hangs into his eyes, and seems to be a fan of Princeton University as he is often seen wearing a T-shirt that says \\"Princeton, Class of '91\\". He is a Boy Scout and was away at Scout camp when Peter first moved to Princeton. He collects worms for Mrs. Muldour, an elderly neighbor, and Peter soon joins him in that business. =Joanne McFadden= A girl who sits behind Peter in his sixth grade class and becomes the object of his affection in Superfudge. Peter sits next to her when seeing Superman. During the famous scene of Superman's flying date with Lois Lane, Peter falls victim to ice poured on his back by Fudge (who flees before Peter can retaliate). Joanne handles the situation well, drying off Peter's back, and they hold hands for the rest of the film. When they stand under the mistletoe hung in the classroom, she kisses Peter near his ear, and Peter does the same, except that she turns her head at the last second, with Peter ending up with a mouthful of hair. =Martha and Harvey= The two class members in Peter's sixth grade class in Superfudge (besides Peter) that aren't native to New Jersey. Harvey is from Pennsylvania, and seems to get along with Peter as they are both \\"outsiders\\" in the class. When Peter and his class get assigned a geography report on New Jersey, Martha requests if she could give one instead on her home state of Minnesota. Although Mr. Bogner does not give an answer upfront, he does seem to approve the idea as it would be original for the class. =Sharon and Elaine= Two other girls in Peter's class while he was in Princeton in Superfudge. Sharon is known for looking down at the ground or up at the sky, and Elaine is known for hitting guys her own age in the stomach. (Neither Sharon or Elaine's last names are revealed, though.) They are friends with Joanne, and also socialize with Peter and Alex. Although Peter and Elaine are the same age, he was never socked in the stomach by her and they got along just fine. It is hinted for Jimmy to possibly develop a crush on Sharon. Elaine is also the only person to agree to take Daniel up on his offer of 'making something of it' (wherein he becomes frightened and pleads with her not to hurt him), but she was only joking. =Melissa Beth Miller= Fudge's new friend that moves into their apartment building in Double Fudge. She is Fudge's age and attends his special mixed group class at school. She has a cat named Fuzzball and dressed up as Hermione Granger for Halloween. =Richie Potter= Fudge's best friend from school in Double Fudge. He is a very wealthy boy with allergies, and likes to brag a lot, usually about what he does in the bathroom. Fudge originally thought he was a cousin of the famous boy wizard Harry Potter (as they have the same last name). When he comes to Fudge‚Äôs house, he asks for ‚Äúlightly steamed florets‚Äù as a snack. After he finds out that Fudge does not have those things, he (rather rudely) comments that he didn‚Äôt know the Hatchers were poor. =Mr. & Mrs. Yarby= The president of the Juicy-O company, who lives in Chicago, Illinois in Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing. Juicy-O is a mixed- fruit beverage‚Äîa combination of orange, pineapple, grapefruit, pear, and banana‚Äîwhich Peter and his dad found noxious-tasting, and was annoyed when Mr. Yarby sent a crate of it to the Hatcher residence after Warren wrote a TV commercial for the company. Peter's father invited the Yarbys to stay with them when they visited New York City, which annoyed Peter as he would have to sleep with Fudge. Mr. & Mrs. Yarby realize that Fudge is rambunctious and remark on poor manners, irking Peter because he felt he was being respectful to adults. The Yarbys later leave for a hotel after too much Fudge, and terminate the business relationship with Warren. However, Warren says it is a blessing in disguise that he lost the account, as Juicy-O was selling poorly in stores, as poorly as the Edsel automobile. When Peter says he refrained from hating Juicy-O to be polite, Warren reveals he hated it himself. =Mr. George Vincent= The president of the Toddle Bike company in Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing. He chooses Fudge to star in the new commercial for his product, but gets furious when Fudge does not act on cue. Mr. Vincent is almost always seen smoking a big cigar. =Janet= Warren's gorgeous secretary in Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing. She usually carries around a purse stuffed to bursting with Goldfish crackers, Oreos, and beauty supplies. She kisses Peter for convincing Fudge to complete the commercial. Peter secretly feels that her kisses are too wet. And he wipes them off. =Mr. Bogner= Peter and Alex's sixth-grade teacher in Princeton in Superfudge. Whereas Peter remarks how some of his past teachers were dumb, he realizes Mr. Bogner is skilled and dedicated to his job, thus Peter learns to respect him. =Mr. Green= The mustached school principal of Peter and Fudge's school in Princeton in Superfudge. On the first day of school, he and Peter go to Fudge's kindergarten class because of Fudge's problems with his teacher, Mrs. Hildebrandt During an assembly with author Brian Tumkin illustrating a picture of a person Fudge knows, Fudge chooses Mr. Green, who appreciates the drawing and hangs it in his office. =Mrs. Hildebrandt= Fudge's first kindergarten teacher in Superfudge, who he calls \\"Rat Face\\" with which Peter apparently doesn't disagree. According to Fudge, she is mean, wouldn't let him play with the round blocks (she never lets her students play with the round blocks on the first day of school because it's one of her rules), and wouldn't call him Fudge, so he had to kick her and climb on top of the cabinets. After he moves to the other kindergarten, Mrs. Hildebrandt frequently calls him Farley at every opportunity. When he leaves her kindergarten, she says to him \\"Goodbye, Farley Drexel\\", and when she meets Uncle Feather she says \\"What a beautiful bird Farley has\\". When Fudge tells her that Uncle Feather speaks French, Mrs. Hildebrandt who also speaks French says to him, \\"Parlez-vous Francais?\\" Uncle Feather replies, \\"Bonjour, stupid!\\" Fudge does not kick her in the TV series. =Ms. Ziff= Fudge's second kindergarten teacher in Superfudge. She is very nice and is reading \\"An Anteater Named Arthur\\" when Fudge arrives and he is impressed, since he is a fan of the book. =Brian Tumkin= A famous author in Superfudge whose children's books Fudge likes. In one chapter he gives a lecture at Fudge and Peter's school. When Fudge gets called up to the stage Mr. Tumkin says they will do a game called Chalk Talk in which Fudge dictates characteristics of a person and Mr. Tumkin will draw it out. This scares Peter as Fudge is granted a big chance to embarrass Peter in front of the whole school. However, the person drawn ends up being Mr. Green, who is pleased by the results and asks Brian Tumkin to autograph the drawing so he can hang it in his office. =Bicycle Bob= Bicycle-shop owner who acts as mentor to the children. When Peter accidentally swallows a fly, Bicycle Bob welcomes him to the ISAF club (I Swallowed a Fly) and recommends vanilla ice cream. According to Judy Blume, he is based directly on a real person whom she met one summer when she was growing up, who did indeed own a bike shop. =\\"When in Rome\\"= A woman in Fudge-A-Mania who Peter meets and calls \\"When in Rome\\" at Big Apfel's baseball game because she had quoted the old \\"When in Rome\\" phrase. She also appears at Muriel and Buzzy Senior's wedding, as the Justice of the Peace. She calls Peter \\"Junior.\\" =Olivia Osterman= An older woman who lives in the same apartment building as the Hatchers in Double Fudge. She was an actress on Broadway, and often gives out boxes of raisins to the kids (as well as dog biscuits for the dogs). However, as Peter observed, she doesn't understand why Peter named his dog Turtle, even though he had explained it to her a million times. She, Mini-Farley and Fudge got trapped in an elevator, and Fudge tells them they are fine, using the codenames Yelraf Rose, Egduf Muriel, and Aivilo Veruschka. ;Back to top Teens =Isobel= Gorgeous teenage library assistant that Peter meets on holiday in Maine in \\"Fudge-A- Mania\\", and develops a serious crush on. Her nickname is Izzy. When Fudge asks Peter what's wrong, Peter admits that Isobel makes him feel dizzy. Fudge later tells that to Jimmy and Sheila. Jimmy doesn't share Peter's affection for Isobel, and Peter loses his spark for her when she doesn't pick him for her team at the ball game. Isobel also persuades Fudge to write an autobiography of himself, entitled \\"Tell Me A Fudge\\", after he discovers his friend Mitzi has a book about herself, \\"Tell Me A Mitzi\\". Fudge, however, only writes the chapter titles. Peter's infatuation with Isobel despite her being older and him having a brief fantasy of being stranded with her on an island while wearing loincloths mirrored the protagonist of another Judy Blume book, Tony Miglione and his crush on Lisa Hoober in Then Again, Maybe I Won't. =Marty= Marty is Sheila's swim teacher in Tarrytown in \\"Otherwise Known As Sheila The Great\\". Boy-crazy Libby thinks he's gorgeous. At first he has a bit of trouble working with Sheila due to her fear of water, as well as the classes being in a public pool where she may be seen, and Sheila seems to grow a grudge against him. The friction dissolves when Sheila is upfront with Marty about her aquaphobia, and he develops a system to prepare her for her beginner's test. Shiela ends up getting a perfect score on her test and is glad to have gotten a beginner's card. When the Tubmans leave, they have an end-of-summer party, and Marty gets invited. Because she saw him all this time in swim trunks, she at first does not recognize him being fully dressed on dry land. =Freddie= A seventeen-year-old lifeguard at the Tarrytown community pool in \\"Otherwise Known As Sheila The Great\\", and yet another young gentleman Libby Tubman finds appealing. She hangs around his guard stand every day, flirts with him and brings him beverages. Upon learning he has a girlfriend, however, she ignores him and sticks to friends and company in her own age group. =Denise= A counselor at the day camp where Sheila and Libby attend in Tarrytown, who teaches pottery. She is also seen accompanying the kids on a haunted hayride where they learn about the fabled Sleepy Hollow and Ichabod Crane. =Allen & Paul= Two teenagers at the day camp Sheila attends. When Sheila runs a camp newspaper that proves too much for her, she forgot she did a crossword with a prize. Paul and Allen approach her showing they solved the crossword and asking what their prize is, and she awards them editorship of the newspaper. The two seem to do a better job at managing the paper, which Sheila is relieved by. ;Back to top Pets =Dribble= Peter's first pet that he won at his best friend Jimmy Fargo's birthday party. Peter always looked after him, but Fudge was always finding ways to harm Dribble, and in the end finally swallowed him. Despite having been successfully extracted from Fudge's stomach after he was given a combination of prune juice, castor oil and milk of magnesia, the turtle died of an unknown cause (though possibly due to being unable to survive the conditions of being in a human stomach), which Peter's doctor predicted would happen. Peter refuses to accept that, and is thus despondent when Dribble is killed. In the book \\"Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing\\" it seems that no one seems to make a big deal of Dribble's death, but in the TV series episode, his grandmother gently explains what happened, and his parents show more affection, while also apologizing for helping to cause it. =Turtle= Peter's pet dog, named in memory of Dribble. Peter received him after Fudge swallowed his first pet. He is feared and hated by Sheila Tubman due to her having a fear of large dogs. In the TV series, Turtle is a Saint Bernard. =Mumford= A male dog who sires Jennifer's puppies, one of whom is Sheila's dog Jake. =Uncle Feather= Fudge's Myna bird. They got it when Fudge wanted a bird for a pet in \\"Superfudge\\". His parents want him to get something else, like a canary or parakeet, but Peter suggests a myna bird, which he mentions can talk, much to everyone else's regret. Fudge wants one so he gets Uncle Feather, whose favorite thing to say is \\"Bonjour, stupid.\\" In Double Fudge, Turtle likes to \\"sing\\" with him to Fudge's theme song about money. Later in the book, he goes \\"on strike,\\" according to Henry, and will not talk at all, but all that changes when he has a near-death incident (thanks to Mini-Farley), which causes him to start talking again. In the books, the family got Uncle Feather when they were living in Princeton, NJ, back in Superfudge. =Baby= A small dog belonging to neighbor Mrs. Reese in \\"Otherwise Known As Sheila The Great\\". =Vinny= A Yorkie belonging to Jimmy's stepmother Beverly in \\" Double Fudge\\". =Jake= A small white and brown puppy belonging to Sheila and Libby. In Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great, the Tubman family visit Tarrytown and care for a dog named Jennifer. Jennifer mates with another dog, Mumford, and have a litter of puppies. Sheila and Libby are allowed to have one of the puppies, and later named her Jake. As Shelia isn't afraid of Jake like she is Turtle, it's hinted and eventually revealed that she isn't afraid of small dogs and big \\"disgusting\\" dogs like Turtle are the ones that make her uncomfortable. ;Back to top References External links Category:Fudge series Fudge ","title":"List of Fudge series characters"},{"id":"13880322","text":"USS LST-1074 was an built for the United States Navy during World War II.

Service history =World War II, 1945-1946= After a shakedown cruise in the Chesapeake Bay, LST‚Äì1074 got underway on 6 June for Pearl Harbor via the Panama Canal. Upon arrival she was ordered to the Big Island of Hawaii, where she engaged in maneuvers with troops of the 5th Marine Division. The 5th Marines had suffered heavy losses during the Battle of Iwo Jima. The maneuvers consisted of simulated landings on the beaches of the Island's west coast. The war ended on August 15. The peace treaty with Japan was signed on September 2 on the deck of the USS Missouri. LST 1074 was then ordered to Sasebo, Japan, carrying Marine pilots, whose observation planes were stored in the tank deck. The ship left Hawaii for Japan during the latter part of August, a trip that took 21 days. Afterwards, the ship undertook two trips to the Philippines to bring supplies to Japan, firstly to Manila returning to Osaka and secondly to Subic Bay returning to Sasebo. One day the Marine pilots flew the LST's officers over Nagasaki for a view of the city devastated by the second atom bomb. LST 1074 then set out for San Francisco, where it was berthed at the Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard and prepared for \\"moth balling.\\" The final destination of LST 1074 was the Columbia River near Portland, Oregon. =Decommissioning and sale= After operations on the West Coast she was placed out of commission in reserve on 4 September 1946. Named USS Overton County (LST-1074) on 1 July 1955, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 November 1958. Overton County was sold on 29 June 1959 to Foss Maritime for conversion to a concrete barge, and completed in 1960. The ship was resold (date unknown) to Salmon Bay Barge Line, Inc., of Seattle, Washington, and renamed Santos. The ship was being operated as a cargo barge by Salmon Bay Barge Line as of 2008.

Early life Ben Gold was born September 8, 1898 to Israel and Sarah (Droll) Gold, Jews living in Bessarabia, a province of the Russian Empire. His father was a jeweler, active in the revolutionary movement and a member of the local Jewish self-defense corps, institutions which existed in many towns as a precaution against pogroms launched by anti-semitic Black Hundreds groups. The Golds emigrated to the United States in 1910, where 12-year-old Ben took a variety of jobs to help support his family, working in box factories, making pocketbooks, and working in millinery shops. He eventually became an operatorAn \\"operator\\" removes the coarse long outer hair with a knife, leaving only the soft under-fur, applies steam heat to the skin to soften it, and then shaves it in preparation for curing and tanning.

In 1912, the 14-year-old joined the Furriers Union of the United States and Canada, which changed its name a year later to the International Fur Workers Union of the United States and Canada (IFWU). He attended Manhattan Preparatory School at night to complete his education, intending to go to law school. The same year he joined the Furriers Union, the 14-year-old Gold was elected assistant shop chairman by his local union during the first furriers' strike in the United States. His election at such a young age was not uncommon in the American labor movement. He was probably the only individual in his workplace who could read and write, or had any education whatsoever. Politically active, Gold joined the Socialist Party of America in 1916. In 1919, at the age of 21, Gold was elected to the New York Furriers' Joint Board, a council of furriers' unions whose jurisdiction covered all of New York City. In September of that year, he joined a group which broke away from the Socialist Party to form the Communist Labor Party of America. Communism and early trade union career Gold's adherence to Communism and trade unionism intertwined to shape much of his career as a labor leader. He was an occasional political candidate of the Communist movement, running for U.S. Congress in the 23rd Congressional District of New York in 1928. In 1924, Gold was suspended from the Furriers for engaging in dual unionism because of his activities on behalf of the Communist Party of America (with which the Communist Labor Party had merged in 1921). He was reinstated in 1925, and appointed manager of the New York Furriers' Joint Board. =1926 strike= In 1926, Gold led a massive furriers' strike in New York City. The Joint Board's contract with the city's furriers expired on January 31, 1926. Among the union's demands were a reduction in working hours to the five-day, 40-hour work week; union inspection of shops; a 25 percent wage increase; an employer contribution of 3 percent of each workers' salary to an unemployment insurance fund; a single paid holiday; and equal division of work among employees (to eliminate favoritism). The employer's association refused to negotiate over the work week, unemployment fund or equal division of work, but agreed to seek a settlement on the other terms if the union would withdraw the other three demands. Led by Gold, the Joint Board was on the verge of doing so when IFWU President Oizer Shachtman accused the Joint Board of being infiltrated by communists. The Joint Board made its recommendation to the employers all the same, who‚Äîaware of Shachtman's opposition‚Äîpromptly rejected it. The employers then instituted a lockout of 8,500 workers on February 11, 1926. The union responded by calling a general strike of all 12,000 fur workers in the city on February 16, 1926.\\"Fur Workers Quit Jobs This Morning.\\" New York Times. February 16, 1926. The strike quickly turned violent. On February 19, New York City police attacked a picket line of striking workers and arrested 200 workers. On March 8, Gold called out 10,000 workers for mass picketing throughout the furriers' district. Police used clubs to beat hundreds of strikers, and then drove cars at high speed into the crowd to try to break up the pickets. Only when Gold ordered the picket to break up were law enforcement authorities able to regain control; 125 workers arrested. The police response was so brutal that a city magistrate later excoriated the police department for \\"undue coercion\\" against the striking workers. As the strike commenced, President Shachtman went into hiding, leaving Vice President Isidor Winnick to take over as Acting President. Shachtman's disappearance significantly hindered the Joint Board's ability to stop furriers outside New York City from engaging in strikebreaking. Certain developments seemed to indicate an early end to the strike. On March 13, a New York state judge refused to grant the employers an injunction which would force an end to the strike. In mid-April, the Eitingon Schild Company, the wealthiest fur importer in the United States, broke with the employers' association to settle with the union. The company agreed to a five-day, 40-hour work week; equal division of work; no subcontracting; and a 10 percent wage increase. But the strike continued despite this agreement. In early April, Hugh Frayne, an organizer with the American Federation of Labor (AFL), met with a moderate faction within the Joint Board. Frayne and the moderate furriers asked AFL President William Green to personally intervene in the strike. Green and Shachtman (who had reappeared in Washington, D.C.) drew up an agreement establishing a 42-hour work week and a 10 percent wage increase. But when the proposal was presented to the membership on April 15, they overwhelmingly rejected it. The AFL barred Gold from the meeting, but the membership chanted his name and nearly rioted until he was admitted to the hall. In part, the workers rejected the proposal because they had had no hand in making it. But they also rejected the proposal because it did nothing to help Jewish workers, who needed the five-day work week provision in order to protect their Shabbat observances. Shachtman accused \\"radicals\\" of leading the near-riot and coercing the workers into rejecting the settlement. Shachtman and Green tried to get the membership to adopt the proposal a second time on May 2, but it was again turned down. In retaliation for Shachtman and Green's attempt to end-run the local leadership, and to increase pressure on the employers, Gold asked the Joint Board to initiate a drive for the 40-hour work week which would involve every union in the city. The Board agreed, and soon the New York State Federation of Labor, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, the Teachers Union, the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, and a number of other unions agreed to join the effort.\\"Fur Strikers Stand On A 40-Hour Week.\\" New York Times. May 4, 1926; \\"Finish Fight Is Seen In Furriers' Strike.\\" New York Times. May 11, 1926; \\"Fur Union to Start 40-Hour Week Drive.\\" New York Times. May 14, 1926; \\"9,000 Fur Strikers Demand Short Week.\\" New York Times. May 20, 1926. On May 22, 1926, a mass rally filled the newly built Madison Square Garden, making it the largest labor meeting held in the city up to that time. Gold denounced labor leaders who did not attend, and declared that winning the 40-hour work week in New York City would lead to a nationwide movement which would gain the limitation throughout the nation. The Joint Board faced a crisis, however. By May 27, only $70 remained in the Joint Board's strike fund. Gold spoke at every union hall in the city within four days of the revelation of the fiscal crisis. The union asked workers and other unions to buy \\"40-Hour Liberty Loan Bonds\\" which would be redeemable in six months. By May 31, more than $100,000 had been raised.\\"Fur Strikers Ask Aid of All Other Unions.\\" New York Times. May 19, 1926. Even though strike relief funds were paid on June 1, the Joint Board kept up the bond drive to maintain the pressure on the employers.\\"Seek to Finance Fur Strike By an Issue of Bonds.\\" New York Times. June 3, 1926. The fund-raising success of the union and the pressure from the 40-hour work week drive pushed the employers to agree to a new collective bargaining agreement. The manufacturers signaled their willingness to talk on May 26, but the union kept up its demand for the 40-hour week.\\"Fur Peace Offer By Manufacturers.\\" New York Times. May 27, 1926; \\"Strikers Reject Fur Peace Terms.\\" New York Times. May 28, 1926. A mediator was called in, and a new contract reached on June 11, 1926. The contract provided for the 40-hour, five-day work week; an end to overtime from December through August; time-and-a-half overtime pay for half-days from September to November; a 10 percent wage increase; 10 paid holidays; and a ban on subcontracting.\\"Fur Strikers Accept New Mediation Plan.\\" New York Times.

June 17, 1926. =AFL investigation= Gold's success in leading the 1926 furrier workers' strike was short-lived. On July 19, 1926, President Green sent a letter to Gold demanding that the Joint Board turn over all books, papers, ledgers and materials related to the conduct of the strike. In a secret letter, Hugh Frayne assured IFWU President Shachtman that the International Union was not under investigation, and that the AFL intended only to purge the Joint Board of \\"radicals\\" and \\"communists.\\" Despite his reservations, Gold turned over the Joint Board's books, and the AFL conducted its investigation throughout August and September. The goal of the investigation soon became clear: The AFL accused Gold and the other strike leaders of debauchery, wasting union money, bribery, forcing workers to join the Communist Party, coercing workers to participate in the strike, prolonging the strike on the orders of the Communist Party, and lying to the AFL investigating committee. On January 13, 1927, the AFL's final report was issued, in which the AFL demanded that the IFWU purge the Joint Board of all communists or expel the locals in question. On February 17, the New York City Central Labor Council expelled the Joint Board and its member locals; the IFWU expelled Gold and 36 other local leaders from the union on March 2. On March 17, 1927, Gold and 10 other leaders of the Joint Board were arrested for allegedly breaking into a furrier's shop near Mineola, New York, during the 1926 strike.\\"Bail Is Denied to Gold in Fur Strike Attack.\\" New York Times.

April 12, 1927. Although the AFL successfully pressured Clarence Darrow to not take Gold's case, it was unable to prevent Frank P. Walsh, former chairman of the federal Commission on Industrial Relations and the National War Labor Board, from doing so. Walsh formed a \\"Committee of 100\\" to provide financial and moral support to Gold and the others. The AFL tried to persuade the members of the committee to resign, but none did.\\"Organizes to Help Union Men In Jail.\\" New York Times. March 31, 1927. At Gold's trial, which began on April 14,\\"Gold and 10 Aides Go On Trial Today.\\" New York Times. April 14, 1927. the prosecution repeatedly asked if Gold was a member of the Communist Party, if he knew communists, and if he endorsed the party's principles.\\"Gold's Aide Denies He Raided Fur Shop.\\" New York Times. April 20, 1927; \\"Five Furnish Alibis at Furriers' Trial.\\" New York Times. April 21, 1927. Walsh protested that these questions had nothing to do with the alleged crime of burglary, but the judge overruled his objections. Nevertheless, Gold and one other person were acquitted, but nine others were not.Seven of the nine later had their sentences overturned after an appellate court ruled that the trial judge had engaged in serious misconduct during the trial. See: Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 10: The T.U.E.L., 1925-1929, 1994.\\"Gold Threatens Strike.\\" New York Times. April 29, 1927; \\"Nine Sentenced Who Beat Furrier.\\" New York Times. May 6, 1927. The AFL also accused Gold of allegedly bribing police officers to give the union favorable treatment during the 1926 strike. Charges were filed on March 4, 1927.\\"Fur Bribe Charges Before Mayor Friday.\\" New York Times. March 5, 1927; \\"Fur Bribe Charges in Walker's Hands.\\" New York Times.

March 31, 1927; \\"Fur Bribe Inquiry Will Start Today.\\" New York Times. April 6, 1927.

April 7, 1927; \\"$840,000 Fur Strike Audit Was Hopeless.\\" New York Times.

July 22, 1927. Indeed, most testimony focused on police brutality against the union and its members, significantly undermining the prosecution's claim of police favoritism. =1927 strike= The IFWU, meanwhile, organized a new \\"Joint Council\\" to replace the Joint Board. On March 2, 1927, the Joint Council announced it was the true collective bargaining agent for all New York City fur workers, that it alone administered their union contracts, and that they must become members of the Joint Council or be fired by their employers.\\"Fur Union Ousts Communist Faction.\\" New York Times. March 4, 1927; \\"Fur Union Pushes War On Reds.\\" New York Times. March 8, 1927. Thousands of workers refused; many were fired, and some had to be forcibly removed from their place of employment in protest. Gold and the Joint Board fought the Joint Council's actions. As the dispute between the Joint Board and Joint Council continued, employers ceased to honor the 1926 contract. Soon, the work week crept as high as 70 hours over seven days. Overtime pay was eliminated, wages were cut by as much as 50 percent, and subcontracting became rampant. Although Gold was on trial for assault and bribery, he led the Joint Board in a counter-organizing campaign against the AFL-dominated Joint Council. He personally led mass pickets and protests in the fur district of New York City in late March 1927.\\"Fur Workers Riot.\\" New York Times. March 23, 1927; \\"Parley Fails to End Warfare of Unions.\\" New York Times. March 25, 1927. The AFL attempted to undercut the Joint Board by releasing statements that the Gold-led union was seeking a \\"peace treaty\\" with the Joint Council, while accusing the Joint Board of coercing workers into joining.\\"Won't Deal With Fur Reds.\\" New York Times. March 30, 1927; \\"Say Fur Workers Face Terror Plot.\\" New York Times. April 11, 1927; \\"Warning to Fur Workers.\\" New York Times. April 15, 1927. Despite AFL assertions that workers were stampeding into the Joint Council,\\"Fur Workers Rush to Join New Unions.\\" New York Times. April 2, 1927. the Gold-led Joint Board had the support of the vast majority of workers in the New York City fur industry. The Joint Board's strength among the workers was so strong that on May 3, 1927, the Fur Trimming Manufacturers' Association broke with the employers' group and signed a contract with Gold's Joint Board‚Äîreaffirming the 1926 contract and restoring working conditions to their June 1926 level.\\"Fur Trimmers Sign Compact With Reds.\\" New York Times. May 4, 1927. Gold began threatening a new strike to force the employers to honor the terms of the 1926 contract and win recognition of the Joint Board again. The AFL accused the Joint Board of being a communist front, and pleaded for the public to withdraw support for it.\\"Warns of 'Red' Request.\\" New York Times. May 28, 1927. In confidential talks with the New York City police, the AFL conceded that Gold's union had the support of the workers and that the only way to defeat the \\"Red-led\\" union was a massive show of police force which would intimidate the strikers. Mass arrests and heavy fines, coupled with long jail terms, would bankrupt the Joint Board and terrify the protesters, AFL officials and staff told the police. The strike began on June 3, 1927, with several thousand picketers taking to the streets and police arresting hundreds of workers. When the police proved unable to control the large number of strikers, they began isolating groups of two or three people (often women) and beating them with clubs.\\"Gold Plans One-Day Fur Strike.\\" New York Times.

The extreme police response led Gold to call strike after strike, most of which were broken up by police attacks on peaceful picketers and which led to scores of arrests and jail sentences.\\"Fur Strike Leader Scores Picket Call.\\" June 12, 1927; \\"Gold in Attack on Woll.\\" New York Times.

July 7, 1927; \\"Radical Fur Strikers to Renew Picketing.\\" New York Times. July 8, 1927. The AFL and its leadership again accused Gold and the Joint Board of terrorizing workers in order to force them to join the union,\\"Charges Terrorism in Fur Strike Here.\\" New York Times. June 14, 1927; \\"Says Reds Threaten Furriers' Families.\\" New York Times. June 20, 1927. and claimed that only the Joint Council had the support of the majority of workers.\\"Fur Organization Nearer.\\" New York Times. June 24, 1927; \\"Tells of A.F.L. War Against Reds Here.\\" New York Times. July 19, 1927; \\"Accuses Moscow in Red Strikes Here.\\" New York Times. August 4, 1927. But by mid-July 1927, the AFL's claims were proven to be false. The Joint Council lost most of its support, and the Gold-led Joint Board received recognition by companies employing a majority of workers in the fur district. Most employers no longer compelled their workers to join the Joint Council, and the Joint Board's 1926 contract was re-established and enforced. =Creation of a new union= As the Joint Board sought to re-establish itself in New York City during the June‚ÄìJuly 1927 strike, the IFWU moved against Gold in yet another way. President Shachtman issued a call for the biennial convention of the IFWU to be held in the Executive Council chamber at the AFL Building in Washington, D.C., on July 13, 1927. The union's constitution required the convention to be held in May, but AFL leaders (including the influential Executive Council member, Matthew Woll) demanded that Shachtman delay the meeting until such time as he could guarantee that a large majority of delegates would be pro-AFL. \\"As you well know, your International Union is today being financed to a great part by the reorganizing activities going on here in New York City,\\" Woll and two others wrote Shachtman, \\"and that without this income your organization would be practically bankrupt.\\"Quoted in Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 10: The T.U.E.L., 1925-1929, 1994, p. 98. The letter was thinly-veiled blackmail, and Shachtman knuckled under to it. Nonetheless, Gold and 35 other delegates from New York City appeared at the convention and demanded to be recognized. The Credentials Committee refused to seat them, even though the Joint Board represented about 85 percent of the total IFWU membership. AFL President Green‚Äîtired of the constant conflict in New York City, believing Shachtman and the leadership of the IFWU were incompetent, and convinced that fighting the Joint Board was a waste of money‚Äîpersuaded Shachtman to at least let Gold and the other Joint Board delegates speak before the convention to make their case. Gold delivered an impassioned speech in which he denounced the attacks on the political views of the Joint Board's leadership, argued that the union should be spending its money building solidarity and fighting employers, and pushed for strong internal democratic procedures in the IFWU. But despite his pleas, the convention refused to seat the delegates, and then revoked the charters of the locals which comprised the Joint Board.\\"Fur Workers Eject New York Radicals.\\" New York Times. June 15, 1927. These efforts to undercut Gold and the Joint Board also failed. Several IFWU locals outside New York City passed resolutions criticizing the International Union's actions, and worker support for the Joint Council dwindled even further. On July 6, 1928, the AFL notified the Joint Council that it was withdrawing all staff and monetary support for the rump union. When the news leaked to the leaders of other needle trade unions, President Green was forced to publicly reiterate the AFL's support for the non-communist union. But the new flow of funds and staff did nothing to resuscitate the Joint Council. Worse, from the AFL's perspective, the Joint Board then called several strikes in July 1928 and won major wage increases from the employers. In the summer and fall of 1928, Gold began building support for a new international union of fur workers. He met with the leaders of eight non-New York City fur workers' locals as well as a left-wing group of fur workers who were attempting to disaffiliate from what remained of the Joint Council. Included in the new union were 15,000 dressmakers and other garment workers comprising the left wing of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. The new Needle Trades Workers Industrial Union was formed on January 1, 1929.Draper, Theodore. American Communism and Soviet Russia. Reprint ed. New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 2003. Louis Hyman was elected President,\\"Hyman Heads New Union.\\" New York Times. January 3, 1929. and Ben Gold was elected Secretary-Treasurer. The thirty-nine member General Executive Board included African Americans, Russians, Poles, Greeks, women and even a youth delegate. Needle Trades Workers Industrial Union =Secretary- Treasurer= As chief strategist as well as secretary-treasurer for the Needle Trades Workers Industrial Union (NTWIU), Ben Gold pursued an aggressive and militant policy of collective bargaining. The formation of the union was inauspicious: Within the year the Great Depression began, leading to thousands of layoffs in the fur industry and strong downward pressure on wages. But even as early as February 1929, as the economy slid toward depression, Hyman and Gold were announcing a series of strikes designed to raise wages.Department of Labor Research. Rand School of Social Science. The American Labor Year Book, 1916-1932. Vol. 13: 1932. New York: Rand School of Social Science, 1932. The new union's first strike occurred in the garment industry in February 1929.\\"Communists Call A Garment Strike.\\" New York Times. February 7, 1929; \\"221 Pickets Seized As Reds Aid Strike.\\" New York Times. February 12, 1929. A second strike in the New York City's fur industry occurred in June 1929, as NTWIU sought to organize AFL-affiliated locals of fur workers into the breakaway union.\\"Red Fur Workers Call For A Strike.\\" New York Times.

June 21, 1935. however, Gold made little headway against the anti-communist AFL locals. Meanwhile, press reports implied that most of the city's fur workers belonged to the AFL, inverting the true situation. On occasion, violence broke out between the two groups.\\"Police Balk Reds' Near Riot in 6th Av.\\" New York Times. January 20, 1932. The AFL also sought to strip the NTWIU's New York City locals of the right to use the phrase \\"fur workers\\" in their name.\\"Fur Union Seeks 'Left Wing' Curb.\\" New York Times. February 4, 1932. As the internecine union struggles continued, Gold led strikes in both the garment and fur industries. Sporadic violence also broke out during these events.\\"20,000 Go On Strike In Dress Industry.\\" New York Times. February 17, 1932. More than 3,500 union members struck for shorter working hours and higher wages on June 17, 1931, collective bargaining goals which were considered madness by nearly all labor leaders. Yet, Gold won an increase in working hours,During the Great Depression, employers often cut working hours to 30, 20 and even 15 hours a week, leading to significant reductions in worker pay. See: Kennedy, David M. Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. leading to a guaranteed 40-hour work week well as increased pay‚Äîan achievement important in the establishment of the standard American work week.Foner, Philip S. and Roediger, David R. Our Own Time: A History of American Labor and the Working Day. New ed. New York: Verso, 1997. In August 1932, Gold won yet another agreement retaining the union's work-week and pay goals in the fur industry despite the worsening depression.\\"Fur Workers Vote to Call Off Strike.\\" New York Times. August 20, 1932. The union also launched an assault on sweatshop conditions in the garment industry in early 1933, an effort the AFL-led Joint Council labeled communistic.\\"2,000 Reds Parade in Garment District.\\" New York Times. February 2, 1933; \\"A.F.L. Fur Union Scored in Report.\\" New York Times. August 2, 1933. Battles with the AFL-led Joint Council continued to occupy much of Gold's time. The stridently anti-communist labor leader, Matthew Woll, had been placed in charge of a three-person committee of AFL Executive Council members charged with assisting the IFWU and breaking the NTWIU. Woll and the two other council members funneled funds and staff into the IFWU and assisted the IFWU in strategizing ways to win back the loyalty of the majority of fur workers in New York City.\\"Fur Workers Open War on 'Red Reign'.\\" New York Times. May 17, 1933; \\"Fur Trade Plans War Against Reds.\\" New York Times. May 24, 1933. Violence broke out when AFL supporters stormed NTWIU offices in April 1933.\\"One Slain, 16 Hurt As Thugs Raid Union.\\" New York Times. April 25, 1933. Gold, leading the fur workers' division of the NTWIU, led a series of counter-protests and marches through the fur district in May and June 1933.\\"Red Fur Workers Routed.\\" New York Times.

The AFL also continued to work closely with the New York City police, providing law enforcement officials with information on dates, times and places Gold's union would strike or protest and pushing hard for a strong police response to intimidate the communist-led union.\\"Fur Union Accused of Coercing Labor.\\" New York Times. August 23, 1933. In July, police clashed repeatedly with marching workers led personally by Gold, leading to a number of arrests and hundreds of worker injuries. In one case, police on horseback charged at a full gallop into a peaceful march on July 5, 1933.\\"7 Seized In Fur Rows.\\" New York Times. July 6, 1933; \\"6 Hurt As Police Battle 500 Reds.\\" New York Times. July 6, 1933; \\"Police Acts Cited in Fur Inquiry.\\" New York Times. July 8, 1933. Despite the police violence and opposition of the AFL, the \\"dynamic leadership of Communist Ben Gold\\" helped the fur workers in 1933 to salvage a 35-hour work week and win an increase in pay from $38 to $50 a week.\\"Learning.\\" Time. July 10, 1933. When the Communist Party formed the Trade Union Unity League in late August 1929, Gold affiliated the NTWIU with the umbrella labor group. The League was shuttered in 1935 when the Communist Party abandoned its strategy of dual unionism and \\"boring from within\\" in favor of the Popular Front.Devinatz, Victor G. \\"Trade Unions As Instruments of Social Change: Does Ideology Matter?\\" WorkingUSA. 10:4 (January 2007); Devinatz, Victor G. \\"A Reevaluation of the Trade Union Unity League, 1929-1934.\\" Science & Society. 71:11 (November 2007); Johanningsmeier Edward P. \\"The Trade Union Unity League: American Communists and the Transition to Industrial Unionism: 1928-1934.\\" Labor History. 42:2 (May 2001). Gold also worked hard to integrate the NTWIU. While other unions actively discriminated against African Americans and other minorities or ignored the issue of race,Zieger, Robert. The CIO, 1935-1955. Reprint ed. Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 1997. Gold encouraged a bottom-up attack on racism. He actively involved members in \\"trials\\" of union members who had used racist language or engaged in discriminatory behavior, and his efforts were largely successful in weeding racism out of the union.Solomon, Mark. The Cry Was Unity: Communists and African Americans, 1917-36. Paperback ed. Jackson, Miss.: University Press of Mississippi, 1998. Meanwhile, Gold also was heavily involved in writing the \\"Fur Code.\\" The National Industrial Recovery Act, enacted on June 16, 1933, established the National Recovery Administration and authorized the agency to establish voluntary agreements within each industry regulating working hours, pay rates, and prices.Schlesinger, Arthur M. The Age of Roosevelt: The Coming of the New Deal: 1933-1935. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1958. Hundreds of industry codes were created, including a code governing the fur industry. Gold was appointed to the panel crafting the Fur Industry Code, and on July 21, 1933, the panel established a preliminary \\"blanket code\\" providing a 40-hour week and a minimum wage of $14 a week (about $216 a week in 2008 inflation-adjusted dollars).\\"Fur Code Adjusts Work to Seasons.\\" New York Times. July 22, 1933. In late 1933, Gold served a brief prison sentence after having been arrested for participating in a hunger march in Wilmington, Delaware. Hunger marches had been occurring throughout the United States since 1931.Edsforth, Ronald. The New Deal: America's Response to the Great Depression. New ed. Hoboken, N.J.: Wiley-Blackwell, 2000. Catholic social activist Dorothy Day herself encouraged Gold to participate in a march from New York City to Washington, D.C.Day, Dorothy. House of Hospitality. New York: Sheed and Ward, 1939. Gold was one of 315 marchers who left New York City on November 29, 1932, bound for Washington. The marchers reached Wilmington on December 2, their number having increased by several hundred. Their permit to march in the city was withdrawn. That night, the police herded most of the marchers into a warehouse downtown, but Gold, most of the women and most of the marchers from New England stayed in a rented church two blocks away. That night, the marchers at the church were refused permission to hold a meeting in the street, so they held it on the church steps. When the police tried to stop the meeting, the marchers resisted. The police began beating the people listening to the speaker, and the marchers fled into the church and barricaded the doors. The police fired tear gas through the windows of the building, then broke down the doors and entered the building with weapons drawn. The marchers resisted by hurling chairs at the police, but were beaten and gassed repeatedly until subdued. Twenty-three marchers, including Gold, were arrested. Four police and three marchers were hospitalized. Gold was convicted of incitement to riot, and served a brief prison term in Wilmington in late 1933 and early 1934.\\"Tear Gas Quells Wilmington Riot.\\" New York Times. December 3, 1932; \\"Benjamin Gold Free; 2,000 Welcome Red Leader on Return From Wilmington Jail.\\" New York Times. February 24, 1934.For a first-hand account, see: Daly, Sidney. \\"The Washington Hunger March of 1932.\\" Class Struggle. 3:1 (January 1933). Gold participated in additional hunger marches in 1933 and 1934, and was arrested again in Albany, New York, in late October 1934.\\"Reds Visit Lehman to Protest On Riot.\\" New York Times. November 2, 1934. Gold's battles with the AFL also continued in 1934. Joint Board and Joint Council supporters fought with fists, bricks and clubs in January 1934.\\"Rival Fur Groups Battle in 7th Av.\\" New York Times. January 17, 1934. But the AFL group continued to shrink as the Great Depression worsened, and IFWU leaders feared for the survival of their union. To forestall any peace talks, AFL President Green launched a major initiative to drive communists and communist sympathizers out of all AFL-affiliated local, national and international unions.\\"Labor Opens War on Reds in Ranks.\\" New York Times. August 19, 1934; \\"Green Urges Laws to Restrict Reds.\\" New York Times. December 18, 1934. AFL accusations against Gold and his union also continued.\\"Fur Union Charges Coercion.\\" New York Times. September 1, 1934. In 1934 and 1935, Gold led the garment and fur workers in two successful strikes which propelled his union into a merger with the IFWU. The first was week-long strike by 4,000 fur workers in late August 1934, which led to additional wage increases and stricter enforcement of contract provisions.\\"Fur Workers' Strike Puzzles Mediators.\\" New York Times. August 30, 1934; \\"Fur Strike Settle, Union Is Recognized.\\" New York Times. September 5, 1934. The second was a strike by 10,000 garment workers in April 1935 which led to a contract guaranteeing a minimum weekly wage.\\"10,000 End Dispute Over Dress Wages.\\" New York Times. April 14, 1935. =Merger with IFWU= The success of the NTWIU and particularly Gold's aggressive leadership of the union's fur workers division significantly undermined support for the AFL-supported IFWU. Gold asserted in August 1934 that the IFWU was in financial trouble and had too few members to ensure viability, but the IFWU denied his claims.\\"Union Statement Denied.\\" New York Times. September 8, 1934. IFWU President Pietro Lucchi, however, knew that Gold was correct. In May 1935, his union near bankruptcy, he approached David Dubinsky, President of the ILGWU, for an infusion of funds. Dubinsky turned him down. Lucchi next appealed to AFL President Green, who appointed a committee composed of Woll, Dubinsky, and Sidney Hillman (President of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers) to consider a fund-raising effort. But the committee would not meet until June 18, and by then the union would have collapsed. Given Green's disinclination to support the IFWU in 1927, some scholars conclude that Green purposefully delayed the committee meeting in order to let the IFWU collapse. At the IFWU convention in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the week of May 19, 1935, delegates voted to establish a Unity Committee whose charge was to seek and win immediate merger with the NTWIU.\\"Seeks Peace in Fur Industry.\\" New York Times. May 26, 1935. The committee met on May 27, 1935, with its NTWIU counterparts, and quickly hammered out a merger agreement. The merger convention opened on June 20, 1935, at the Manhattan Opera House. In a final attempt to stall merger, on June 19 Green announced that any union which admitted communists as members would have its charter pulled by the AFL Executive Council.\\"Green Opens War on Reds in Unions.\\" New York Times. June 20, 1935. The merger proceeded despite Green's threat. More than 3,000 delegates from the NTWIU met on an upper floor, and about 2,500 delegates (nearly all the union's members) from the IFWU met on the ground floor. The same speakers addressed both conventions, although by prior agreement Gold was not permitted to speak. When Gold appeared about an hour after the two conventions opened, he was greeted with chants of \\"We want Gold!\\", \\"Let Gold speak!\\", and \\"Gold! Gold! Gold!\\" Gold sat impassive in his seat while he received a standing ovation, and it was clear that a wide majority of the members of both conventions supported him. On June 21, Lucchi and the executive board of the merged organization met in Long Island City, Queens, and reinstated Gold as a member in good standing of the IFWU.\\"Fur Workers Weigh Reinstating Gold.\\" New York Times. June 22, 1935. Under an agreement reached by the merger conventions, leadership elections for the New York City locals of the merged IFWU took place 40 days later. Gold was elected to his old position of business manager of the Joint Council on August 10, 1935, defeating a candidate put forth by the AFL by a greater than 2-to-1 majority.\\"Victory for Left Wing.\\" New York Times. August 11, 1935. =Business manager once again= Gold was business manager of the New York City Joint Council for two years. Since the IFWU had just held its biennial convention in May 1935, new elections for officers of the international union could not be held until 1937. So, despite overwhelming member support, Gold had to wait to run for president of the IFWU. He was not idle, however. Relations between various New York City locals were acrimonious after years of inter-union warfare, many employers were openly ignoring provisions of the contract because the union's attention was elsewhere, and organized crime had infiltrated many union shops. The contracts controlled by the Joint Council expired on February 1, 1936. Gold faced a difficult task: In just six months, he had to rebuild the locals which had remained with the IFWU while preparing the union for a strike in the depths of a depression. A strike was authorized on January 18, but Gold quickly accepted the services of an impartial mediator to assist with the negotiations.\\"Furriers Vote Strike.\\" New York Times. January 18, 1936; \\"Seeks Peace in Fur Trade.\\" New York Times. January 30, 1936. In the final few days of January, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia intervened and heard presentations from both sides.\\"Strike Conferences Enter the 'Last Day'.\\" New York Times. January 31, 1936. The intervention by government officials worked, and a new contract reached on February 1.\\"Accord Is Reached in the Fur Industry.\\" New York Times. February 2, 1936. Gold also led a number of organizing drives among fur and garment workers in New York City, so that by May 1937 the union had nearly 35,000 members.Galenson, Walter. The CIO Challenge to the AFL: A History of the American Labor Movement. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1960. Continuing a campaign he began in 1927, Gold also purged the union's locals of organized crime influence.\\"Gurrah Is Named As Racket Leader.\\" New York Times.

Former IFWU presidents Morris Kaufman and Pietro Lucchi, the IFWU itself, several of IFWU locals and local leaders, as well as 68 employers and several organized crime figures were also included in the indictment.\\"80 Indicted Here in Huge Fur 'Trust'.\\" New York Times. November 7, 1933. The indictment alleged that Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter and Jacob \\"Gurrah\\" Shapiro‚Äîco-founders of the infamous Murder, Inc. murder-for-hire organization‚Äîformed a group of employers known as the \\"Fur Dressers Factor Corporation\\" to fix prices and eliminate competition.Block, Alan A.

The employers allegedly paid higher wages to unions which agreed to participate in the scheme by striking uncooperative businesses, and Buchalter and Shapiro provided the muscle to force other furriers out of the business (which included bombings, acid throwing, kidnapping, arson and more). After several defendants were granted their own separate trials and charges against others dropped, the court reached its verdict on December 16, 1937. Gold was convicted of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act and sentenced to one year in prison. It was the first conviction of a labor union official or labor union under the Sherman Act.\\"Six Are Convicted in Fur Racket Case.\\" New York Times. December 17, 1937. After the convictions, the government undertook additional investigations against the IFWU and now-defunct NTWIU for violations of the Sherman Act.\\"U.S. Sifts Charge Fur Union Bars Collective Pact.\\" New York Times. August 11, 1938. But Gold and his union co-defendants appealed their convictions, and on December 19, 1938, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned the convictions of all but three union officials. Gold's conviction was among those voided.\\"Unions Win Trust Case.\\" New York Times. December 20, 1938.

Gold and IFWU Vice President Irving Potash were convicted of these additional antitrust charges. As the union raised a $100,000 defense fund for Gold and Potash, the government brought a fresh set of charges against Gold on May 17, 1940, accusing him of jury tampering during his first trial. As the jury deliberated Gold's fate, a group of employers sued Gold and the NTWIU for $3 million in damages under the Clayton Antitrust Act, and accusations of witness tampering were levied against Gold. \\"Furrier Charges Threat.\\" New York Times.

Meanwhile, Gold's appeal on the second set of Sherman Antitrust Act violations was winding its way through the courts.\\"Union Men's Appeal Heard.\\" New York Times. October 10, 1940. On May 27, 1940, the Supreme Court of the United States issued its ruling in Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader 310 U.S. 469 (1940). In that case, a union had engaged in a sit-down strike which shuttered a hosiery company's operations and prevented it from fulfilling its interstate contracts. The union was indicted and convicted for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. But the Supreme Court disagreed: > The mere fact that strikes or agreements not to work, entered into by > laborers to compel employers to yield to their demands, may restrict the > power of such employers to compete in the market with those not subject to > such demands does not bring the agreement within the condemnation of the > Sherman Act.Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 503. Following the reasoning laid down by the Supreme Court in Apex Hosiery, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit once more voided the antitrust convictions imposed on Gold and the others in the case.\\"Convictions Voided in Fur Racket Case.\\" New York Times. November 5, 1940. The government declined to prosecute Gold further. Presidency Gold was elected president of the International Fur Workers Union in May 1937. Immediately after his election, Gold disaffiliated the IFWU from the American Federation of Labor and joined the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).\\"Fur Union of 30,000 Joins C.I.O.\\" New York Times. May 22, 1937; \\"Fur Workers Go to C. I. O.\\" Associated Press. May 23, 1937. The change in affiliation was driven almost solely by Gold, and shocked the members of the union. He was elected to the CIO executive council.\\"'The Time Has Come'.\\" Time. May 26, 1947. CIO affiliation did not, however, protect the IFWU or Gold from political attacks. John L. Lewis, then the president of the CIO, was a strong anti-communist. In late January 1938, Lewis publicly announced that he would pursue a policy barring communists from membership in the CIO. Moderates within the IFWU denounced Gold for using \\"Hitler methods\\" to retain power, and pleaded with Lewis to intervene.\\"Reds Not Excluded by C.I.o. Units Here.\\" New York Times. February 3, 1938; \\"Fur Union Faction Appeals to Lewis.\\" New York Times. July 29, 1938. In May 1938, the U.S. House of Representatives established the House Committee Investigating Un-American Activities as a successor to the Special Committee on Un-American Activities (which had spent the last three years investigating Nazi Germany's attempts to influence American public opinion).Goodman, Walter. The Committee: The Extraordinary Career of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1968. Rep. Martin Dies, Jr. was named chair of the committee, and charged with continuing the investigations into Nazi propaganda and initiating new investigations into the activities of the Ku Klux Klan. When committee members voiced support for the Klan and ignored the Nazi threat, Dies concentrated the committee's work on communist infiltration of the labor movement.Kennedy, David M. Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. Dies eagerly permitted the AFL time before the committee to denounce the CIO and the IFWU as riddled with communists and communist sympathizers‚Äîaccusations CIO representatives called \\"nonsense\\" and Gold denounced as redbaiting.\\"Communists Rule the C.I.O., Frey of A.F.L. Testifies.\\" New York Times. August 14, 1938; \\"Testimony of Frey Called 'Nonsense'.\\" New York Times. August 14, 1938. Gold continued to pursue an aggressive collective bargaining policy until the beginning of World War II. Within weeks of taking over as president, he authorized a sympathy strike of 13,000 fur workers in New York City to support striking fur workers in Canada.\\"13,000 Furriers Authorize a Stoppage In Sympathy Movement to Aid Strikers.\\" New York Times. June 5, 1937. The protests, rallies and spot strikes continued as Gold pushed to organize the remaining fur shops in New York City. Signed contracts were reached with newly organized employers in July 1937.\\"Fur Union Seeks $100,000.\\" New York Times. June 10, 1937; \\"Fur Workers in Protest.\\" New York Times. June 29, 1937; \\"Fur Union Wins Contract.\\" New York Times. July 7, 1937. Employers, however, often fought back, and in the spring of 1938 a lengthy strike nearly ended in defeat for the union. The U.S. economy had risen to its pre-depression levels by the spring of 1937, but a strong recession began in late summer (triggered in part by large reductions in federal spending, higher bank reserve requirements, and reductions in disposable income brought about by implementation of the Social Security Act).Meltzer, Allan H.

Documentary History of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidency: Vol. 26: FDR's Response to Recession, 1937-1938. Bethesda, Md.: University Publications of America, 2003. The steep recession led many employers to resist union demands. On February 11, 1938, employers locked out 4,000 fur workers as the IFWU contracts expired.\\"Lockout of 4,000 Fur Workers Due Today.\\" New York Times. February 11, 1938. Gold hesitated calling a strike for seven weeks, seeking peace with the manufacturers, but finally called all fur workers out in a general strike on March 30.\\"Fur Strike Is Voted for 15,000 March 30.\\" New York Times. March 18, 1938; \\"15,000 Fur Workers Called on Strike.\\" New York Times. March 31, 1938. Hoping for a quick end to the strike and alarmed by the lockout, Gold initially kept pickets and rallies small. But locked out workers attacked a fur dealer on April 1, and police retaliated against the pickets with clubs and beatings.\\"Fur Strike Marked By First Violence.\\" New York Times. April 2, 1938. Infuriated, Gold ordered all the union's members out into the streets. The police responded by attempting to use violence to intimidate the strikers, and the union responded in kind. For seven weeks, the fur district in New York City was in a state of near-riot. The union filed unfair labor practice charges against the employers, and the NLRB moved on May 6 to investigate.\\"Labor Board Acts in Fur Strike.\\" New York Times. May 7, 1938. Mass picketing and mass rallies continued, and the employers asked Mayor LaGuardia and the police to end the strike.\\"City Asked to Curb Fur Strike.\\" New York Times.

Thirteen days later, Dr. Abelson announced a tentative agreement, and IFWU members ratified the contract on May 26.\\"Join In Fur Peace Move.\\" New York Times. May 14, 1938; \\"Fur Strikers Get Settlement Plan.\\" New York Times. May 26, 1938; \\"Fur Strike Ended With 3-Year Pact.\\" May 27, 1938. Although Gold publicly characterized the strike as a victory for the union,\\"Fur Workers Cite Gains.\\" New York Times. June 25, 1938. he privately conceded that the strike had been a very near thing. Determined to expand the union, Gold merged the IFWU with the National Leather Workers' Association (NLWA). The IFWU had organized leather workers over the years but never concertedly. The NLWA was formed by four local unions in Massachusetts in 1933, and affiliated with the CIO in 1937. By 1939, however, the NLWA had only 14 locals (half of which actually functioned) and only 5,000 dues-paying members.International Fur and Leather Workers Union of the United States and Canada. Proceedings of the Convention. Washington, D.C.: International Fur and Leather Workers Union of the United States and Canada, 1942. The two unions agreed to merge in March 1939.Stepan-Morris, Judith and Zeitlin, Maurice. Left Out: Reds and America's Industrial Unions. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002. The NLWA approved the merger during its 5th National Convention in Boston, Massachusetts, April 29 to May 2, and the IFWU approved the merger at its annual convention in New York City on May 14. Ben Gold was elected the president of the newly amalgamated union, which adopted \\"International Fur and Leather Workers Union of the United States and Canada\\" (IFLWU)as its new name.\\"Gold Heads C.I.O. Unit.\\" New York Times. May 15, 1939. The new union maintained distinctly separate fur and leather divisions. Each division had its own executive board and conventions and maintained its own finances. But the amalgamated union was nonetheless effective: Within a year, the union had organized 25,000 new workers into 42 new locals. Gold was a staunch supporter of CIO President John L. Lewis. In 1940, when other left-wing unions challenged Lewis' handling of CIO finances, Gold defended him. He also applauded Lewis' refusal to endorse Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1940 presidential election, but unlike Lewis did not endorse Wendell Willkie or Montana Senator Burton K. Wheeler (whom Lewis supported as a third party candidate).Dubofsky, Warren and Van Tine, Warren. John L. Lewis: A Biography. Reprint ed. Champaign, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1992. ; Raskin, A.H. \\"J.L. Lewis Backs Bolt of 13 Unions From State C.I.O. on Third Term.\\" New York Times. September 22, 1940; \\"Fur Union Not Backing Lewis.\\" New York Times. November 2, 1940. After the United States entered World War II, Gold proved an ardent patriot. As war approached, in November 1941, he led large rallies in New York City urging union members to buy war bonds.\\"Fur Trade Holds Rally for Defense.\\" New York Times. November 11, 1941. When the CIO advocated a no- strike pledge for all American unions, Gold wholeheartedly and strongly supported the pledge. He readily agreed to the seven-day work week after the United States declared war on Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan, sent aid to the Republic of China,\\"Grateful for China Aid.\\" New York Times. January 24, 1943. and implemented a campaign to donate 50,000 fur-lined vests to British sailors as part of the war effort.\\"Backs 7-Day Work Week.\\" New York Times. December 18, 1941; \\"Mayor Stitches A Seaman's Vest.\\" New York Times. July 29, 1942; \\"Hunters Asked for Fur.\\" New York Times. October 23, 1942; \\"Fur-Lined Vests Given to British Seamen.\\" New York Times. November 3, 1942. As the war came to an end, however, Gold began to press for major salary and benefit increases for IFLWU members. Refusing to break the union's no-strike pledge, Gold submitted the union's demands to the National War Labor Board in February 1944.\\"Fur Workers Plan to Appeal to WLB.\\" New York Times. February 15, 1944. The War Labor Board subsequently granted the union a minimal wage rise in line with its \\"Little Steel Formula,\\" but granted it substantial fringe benefit increases and ordered employers to end seasonal layoffs.\\"WLB Challenged By Fur Industry.\\" New York Times. April 29, 1944; \\"10,000 Furriers Hail WLB Panel Report Providing End for Seasonal Discharges.\\" New York Times. July 25, 1944. The Board's order was vigorously opposed by employers, and Gold used the dispute as leverage to win a new collective bargaining agreement. The new agreement did not without a price, however, as Gold was forced to threaten to break his union's war-time pledge not to strike.\\"Fur Trade Argues 'Right to Fire' Case.\\" New York Times.

December 12, 1944; \\"Furriers Approve Pact.\\" New York Times. May 23, 1945; \\"One Day Work Stoppage Voted.\\" New York Times. November 13, 1945. Gold also strongly advocated a third political party which would more strongly support unions and working-class Americans. Gold first backed a third-party candidate in 1947 when he asked former Vice President Henry A. Wallace to form a third party.\\"Gold Asks 3d Party Be Led By Wallace.\\" New York Times. November 19, 1947. In 1948, Soviet leaders ordered American communists to support the third party candidacy of Wallace against incumbent President Harry S. Truman,Starobin, Joseph R.

April 15, 1948. =Communist purges= Gold was an active member in the Communist Party, and rose to important positions within its ranks by the late 1940s. He attended the Lenin Institute in Moscow (an institute of higher education which taught the works of Vladimir Lenin) for a short time during the winter of 1930-1931, and was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party from 1936 to 1948.Gold v. United States, 237 F.2d 764 (1956).Cammer, Harold. \\"Taft-Hartley and the International Fur and Leather Workers Union.\\" In The Cold War Against Labor. Ann Fagan Ginger and David Christiano, eds. Berkeley, Calif.: Meiklejohn Civil Liberties Institute, 1987. \\"Ex-Red Accused Gold.\\" Associated Press. February 25, 1954. His commitment to the party was occasionally tested, but never broken. For example, in 1939, the American Communist Party endorsed the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. Gold initially walked out of a party meeting to express his dismay at the decision. He changed his mind a few days later, and followed the party line.Beichman, Arnold. \\"The Communist Who Couldn't.\\" Washington Times. March 25, 2007. In the post-World War II period, relations between the CIO leadership and communists within its member unions deteriorated. The first sign of a break came in May 1946. CIO President Philip Murray sponsored a denouncing Communist Party interference in the affairs of the CIO. Gold voted to approve the resolution. When asked why, he allegedly replied, \\"I have no problem being a loyal American, that's all the resolution asks. We just don't agree on the Truman foreign policy. We'll work with anyone on legitimate union business. We can't worry about Jim Carey and Reuther. They have their axes to grind.\\"Quoted in Dolnick, Norman. \\"Packinghouse Workers Face the Cold War: A Memoir.\\" Labor History. Fall 1997.\\"Gold's Union Backs Murray Statement.\\" New York Times. May 21, 1946. But when the CIO established a committee in November 1946 to purge the labor federation of communists and communist influence, Gold denounced the effort and said it would \\"destroy\\" the CIO.Loftus, Joseph A. \\"CIO Committee to Attempt Purge of Communist Ties.\\" New York Times. November 16, 1946; \\"Defends Reds in CIO.\\" New York Times. January 14, 1947. In May 1947, CIO leaders met to discuss the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers, where locals representing thousands of members had recently disaffiliated due to the communist politics of the international union's leadership. CIO President Philip Murray proposed that the CIO run the international union for a time, but Gold and seven other communists voted against Murray's proposal. An outraged Murray declared, \\"Any man who goes into a shop ostensibly as the representative of the workers and then devotes his time to furthering the interest of the Communist Party is a goddamn traitor. I'm tired of defending Communists and I'm tired of hearing C.I.O. officials defend them. The time has come to kick them out wherever and whenever we find them.\\" The breach widened throughout 1947. The CIO was extremely supportive of President Truman, and Soviet opposition to the Marshall Plan in the summer and fall of 1947Schain, Martin, ed. The Marshall Plan: Fifty Years After. New York: Palgrave, 2001. (opposition supported by most communists in the CIO). This led to a significant rupture between Murray, Walter Reuther and other leaders of the federation on one side and the communist leaders and staff in the CIO member unions on the other. The situation deteriorated further when Soviet leaders ordered American communists to support the Wallace candidacy for president. Then on June 23, 1947, the Republican-controlled Congress passed the Taft‚ÄìHartley Act over President Truman's veto. The Act amended the National Labor Relations Act to require union leaders to file affidavits with the Department of Labor declaring that they were not supporters of the Communist Party and had no relationship with any organization seeking the \\"overthrow of the United States government by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional means\\" as a condition to participating in NLRB proceedings.Cochran, Bert. Labor and Communism: The Conflict That Shaped American Unions. Paperback ed. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1980. The NLRB acted to aggressively enforce the provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act. Although the level of enforcement was not certain at first, many unions quickly filed the anti-communist affidavits.\\"Enforcement Not Certain.\\" United Press International. August 26, 1947; Stark, Louis. \\"Anti-Red Affidavits Aid Labor, Denham Says as Two Unions File.\\" New York Times. August 26, 1947; Stark, Louis. \\"AFL, CIO Yielding on Oath Predicted.\\" New York Times. August 28, 1947. Gold declared the affidavit and increasingly anti-communist atmosphere a threat to the survival of the IFLWU,\\"Head of Fur Council Sees Threat to Union.\\" New York Times. November 18, 1947. and sought contract language which would lock in employer recognition of the union if its leaders failed to sign the oath.\\"Furriers Receive Unions' Demands.\\" New York Times. January 17, 1948. Political pressure on Gold also increased. Rep. John Parnell Thomas, chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), subpoenaed fur industry employers to testify before the committee about Gold's political beliefs. Their September 8, 1948, testimony blasted Gold for establishing a \\"dictatorship\\" within the union and ruining the fur industry through mass picketing and intimidation.Trussell, C.P. \\"Furriers Say Reds Menace Industry.\\" September 9, 1948; \\"Furrier Protests Mass Union Pickets.\\" New York Times. September 11, 1948. HUAC then forced Gold to testify.\\"To Study CIO Fur Union.\\" New York Times. September 5, 1948. Gold denounced and denied the testimony of the employers, proudly declaring that he had been a member of the Communist Party for nearly a quarter century.Trussell, C.P. \\"Fur Union Official Balks on 'Red' Tie.\\" New York Times. September 16, 1948; Trussell, C.P. \\"Fur Union Leader Proud He Is A Red.\\" New York Times. September 17, 1948. The CIO subsequently acted to expel Gold and the IFLWU. Over Gold's protests, the CIO expelled the Greater New York CIO Council, of which the IFLWU's Joint Council was a member, in November 1948.Davies, Lawrence E. \\"New York Council Expelled by CIO As 'Slavish' to Reds.\\" New York Times.

December 12, 1948; Loftus, Joseph A. \\"CIO Leaders Map Fight on Leftists.\\" New York Times. May 17, 1949.

May 18, 1949; Stark, Louis. \\"Murray Rejects Bridges' Proposal.\\" New York Times.

A few days later, the New York State CIO banned communists from being members, and expelled Gold from that body as well.Raskin, A.H. \\"State C.I.O. Votes Ban on Communists.\\" New York Times. November 17, 1949. The attacks on Gold's politics had collective bargaining consequences as well. In August 1949, a tanners' employers' association in Massachusetts refused to bargain with the IFLWU so long as Gold was president of the union, on the grounds that Gold was a communist.\\"Tanners' Group Bars 'A Union Led By Reds'.\\" New York Times.

December 28, 1949. before a new contract was signed in January 1950.\\"'Red' Union Barred From Labor Voting.\\" New York Times. November 24, 1949; \\"Peetz-M'Kay Resumes.\\" New York Times. January 4, 1950. These pressures took a considerable toll on Gold and the IFLWU. Gold told delegates to the union's convention in May 1950 that the communist political views of the union's leadership could cause the organization much difficulty,\\"Gold Warns Union of 'Difficulties'.\\" New York Times. May 22, 1950. yet he also defied the CIO and urged a united union front rather than caving in to redbaiting political pressure.\\"Fur Union Board Scores C.I.O. Chiefs.\\" New York Times. May 23, 1950. Nonetheless, the IFLWU agreed to order its leadership to sign the Taft-Hartley Act's non-communist affidavits.\\"Fur Union to Accept Noncommunist Oath.\\" New York Times. May 25, 1950. =Trial for communist beliefs= Gold resigned from the Communist Party on August 24, 1950,\\"Gold Quits Party to Hold Union Job.\\" New York Times. August 29, 1950. and signed the Taft-Hartley oath. However, he made it clear that he had resigned only so the Fur Workers could receive the protection of federal law.\\"The Road Back.\\" Time. September 4, 1950. The Justice Department argued that Gold had not really resigned, and indicted him for perjury in August 1953 one day before the statute of limitations ran out.\\"Near Thing.\\" Time. September 7, 1953; \\"Perjury Charged to Fur Union Head.\\" New York Times. August 29, 1953; \\"Ben Gold to Surrender.\\" New York Times. August 30, 1953; \\"Ben Gold Gives Up on Perjury Charge.\\" Associated Press. September 1, 1953. At trial, Gold was charged with three counts of perjury. He was accused of continuing to be a member of the Communist Party; accused of being affiliated with Communist party; and accused of being a supporter of an organization which advocated the overthrow of the United States government by force, illegal means, or unconstitutional methods. Numerous famous character witnesses appeared on Gold's behalf, including W. E. B. Du Bois.Du Bois, W. E. B. \\"Testifying at Ben Gold's Trial.\\" Jewish Life. May 1954. Nonetheless, Gold was convicted on the \\"membership\\" and \\"supporting\\" counts, and sentence to 1 to 3 years in prison.\\"Ben Gold Is Guilty in Denial He's Red.\\" Associated Press. April 3, 1954; \\"Ben Gold Jailed for 1 to 3 Years.\\" Associated Press. May 1, 1954. Gold appealed, and his conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States. Gold raised six grounds for reversal: 1) The trial court refused to apply the rules of evidence for perjury to the case; 2) The circumstantial evidence offered at trial was not sufficient to convict him under the rules of evidence; 3) The trial court's instructions to the jury regarding the definition of \\"support\\" were unsupported by law or common usage; 4) The trial court erred in permitting expert testimony regarding his resignation (e.g., the fact of his resignation was a matter for the jury, not expert witnesses, to decide); 5) Government employees on the grand and petit juries were biased (as they themselves had to take an anti-communist oath to retain their jobs); and 6) Law enforcement officers discussed anti-communist oaths with members of the jury while investigating an unrelated case. A deeply divided 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his conviction. The court of appeals then asked for an en banc rehearing sua sponte. An equally divided en banc court upheld his conviction. Gold appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned his conviction in Gold v. United States, 352 U.S. 985 (1957).Gold v. United States, 352 U.S. 985 (1957).\\"Ben Gold Gets A Hearing.\\" New York Times. January 13, 1956. An FBI agent, investigating another case in which falsity of a non- Communist affidavit was at issue, telephoned or visited three members of the Gold jury or their families during Gold's trial. The Supreme Court held that although the FBI intrusion was unintentional it prejudiced the case against Gold. Relying on its recent decision in Remmer v. United States, 350 U.S. 377 (1955), the Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case to the district court with instructions to grant a new trial.Huston, Luther A. \\"High Court Gives Gold A New Trial.\\" New York Times. January 29, 1957. Although the government initially expressed interest in prosecuting Gold further, all charges against him were dropped in May 1957.\\"New Gold Trial Set.\\" New York Times. March 19, 1957; \\"U.S. Abandons Case Against Ben Gold.\\" New York Times. May 10, 1957. =Aftereffects of the Gold trials= Gold's indictment and conviction led to two other U.S. Supreme Court cases as well. The first case was a major test of the National Labor Relations Board's (NLRB) enforcement of the Taft-Hartley Act. In 1951, Lannom Manufacturing Co. refused to honor its contract with the International Fur and Leather Workers Union on the grounds that the union's officers had lied when making their Taft-Hartley anti-communist oaths.Meat Cutters v. NLRB, 352 U.S. 153 (1956). The union filed an unfair labor practice charge against the employer with the NLRB. The Board found against the employer, but after Gold's conviction in April 1954 it reversed itself.Meat Cutters v. NLRB, 352 U.S. 153, 154-155.\\"N.L.R.B. Cites Fur Union.\\" United Press International. April 22, 1954. The union, already embroiled in a similar case,Farmer v. International Fur & Leather Workers Union, 221 F.2d 862 (1955); \\"N.L.R.B. Fights Suit on Non-Red Oaths.\\" New York Times. November 15, 1953; \\"N.L.R.B. to Fight Ruling.\\" New York Times. November 22, 1953; \\"N.L.R.B. Loses Plea on Non-Red Oaths.\\" United Press International. April 13, 1954; \\"N.L.R.B. Is Enjoined.\\" Associated Press. July 21, 1954. asked the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals for a stay; the court declined. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, granted certiorari. In Meat Cutters v. NLRB, 352 U.S. 153 (1956), the Supreme Court (relying on a decision released earlier that day, Leedom v. Mine Workers, 352 U.S. 145) held that the National Labor Relations Board had no authority to refuse to provide the protections of the NLRA to unions not in compliance with the Taft-Hartley Act. \\"[We] conclude that the sole sanction for the filing of a false affidavit under 9 (h) is the criminal penalty imposed on the officer who files a false affidavit, not decompliance of the union nor the withholding of the benefits of the Act,\\" the court ruled.Meat Cutters v. NLRB, 352 U.S. 153, 155. The second case led to a landmark Supreme Court ruling on whether an attorney was an \\"officer of the court.\\" After the grand jury had indicted Gold for perjury, Harold I. Cammer (an attorney noted for representing communists in the United States), took Gold's case. Within two days, Cammer mailed a letter and questionnaire to all members of the grand jury who were employees of the federal government. He told the grand jurors that he was Gold's attorney and that he was trying to learn the effect of the federal government's loyalty program on federal employees.Cammer v. United States, 350 U.S. 399 (1956), 399-400. Cammer undertook this action because of developments in another Taft-Hartley anti-communist oath case. In Emspak v. United States, 203 F.2d 54 (1952), the Justice Department convinced a district court that grand jurors who were federal employee were not biased. In particular, the government had argued that \\"there is not the slightest indication in the long motion and offer of proof that an attempt has been made to interview a single one of the persons.\\"Cammer v. United States, 350 U.S. 399 (1956), 402, quoting Government's Reply Brief in Emspak v. United States, 203 F.2d 54 (1952). The Supreme Court had previously held in Dennis v. United States, 339 U.S. 162 (1950), 171-172, that \\"Preservation of the opportunity to prove actual bias is a guarantee of a defendant's right to an impartial jury.\\" To prevent the government from making a similar claim in the Gold case, Cammer polled the jury. The Contempt Act of March 2, 1831 (4 Stat. 487) gave federal courts the authority to penalize officers of the court for misbehavior.Cammer v. United States, 350 U.S. 399 (1956), 403. For questioning the grand jurors, the district court found Cammer guilty of contempt and fined him $100.Cammer v. United States, 350 U.S. 399 (1956), 400.\\"Gold's Lawyer Fined.\\" New York Times. June 16, 1954. Cammer appealed. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his conviction.Cammer v. United States, 223 F.2d 322 (1955).\\"Ben Gold's Lawyer Loses on Contempt.\\" Associated Press. May 6, 1955. Cammer appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari. In a landmark ruling,Doyle, Charles.

Washington, D.C.: Congressional Research Service, December 27, 2007. a unanimous Supreme Court overturned Cammer's contempt citation, holding that a lawyer is not a court \\"officer\\" in the same category as marshals, bailiffs, court clerks or judges. The district court erred in subjecting Cammer to summary punishment, the Supreme Court concluded, and the high court order the contempt ruling reversed.Cammer v.

Merger with the Meat Cutters and retirement Gold was re-elected as IFLWU president in May 1954 despite his conviction for perjury.\\"Union Re-Elects Gold.\\" New York Times. May 9, 1954. But the problems created by the Taft-Hartley Act, expulsion from the CIO, and prosecutions of the IFLWU's top leadership led Gold to seek merger with another union to strengthen the union's finances and collective bargaining power. A month after his re-election, Gold announced that he was discussing merger with the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America, a labor union affiliated with the AFL that represented retail butchers and packinghouse workers.\\"Union Merger Discussed.\\" New York Times.

Political career At the height of his career as a labor leader, Gold resided in The Bronx, where he ran unsuccessfully for judge in 1928; he received one of the lowest vote-totals in the history of New York state judicial elections. He ran for the New York State Assembly in 1931 and 1936, and for president of the New York City Board of Aldermen in 1933.Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws.

In literature Throughout his life, Gold wrote short stories in Yiddish that often dealt with labor relations and Jewish immigrants. His 1944 novel Avreml Broide included illustrations by fellow communist William Gropper.Gold, Ben. Avreml Broide. New York: Prompt Press, 1944. In 1948, he wrote Mentshn, published by the Needle Trades Workers Committee.Gold, Ben. Mentshn. New York: Nodl treyds arbeter-komitet, 1948. His last work of fiction was The Storm in Riverville, published in 1972.

Over time, the Michelangelo effect causes individuals to develop towards what they consider their ‚Äúideal selves‚Äù. This happens because their partner sees them and acts around them in ways that promote this ideal. The phenomenon is referred to in contemporary marital therapy. Recent popular work in couples therapy and conflict resolution points to the importance of the Michelangelo phenomenon. Diana Kirschner reported that the phenomenon was common among couples reporting high levels of marital satisfaction. It is the opposite of the Blueberry phenomenon ‚Äúin which interdependent individuals bring out the worst in each other.‚Äù The Michelangelo phenomenon is related to the looking-glass self concept introduced by Charles Horton Cooley in his 1902 work Human Nature and the Social Order.  Description  = The model = The Michelangelo phenomenon describes a three-step confirmation process in which an individual affirms their partner's ideal self and thereby helps move them towards their ideal self. 1\\\\. An individual sees their partner as the partner's own ideal self 2\\\\. The individual behaves around their partner in a way that elicits qualities in the partner they themselves consider ideal 3\\\\. This leads to the partner moving towards and realising their ideal self The model posits a close romantic partner rather than a friend or acquaintance because they are \\"especially likely to yield strong confirmation effects.\\"  Partner affirmation  A couple of concepts are understood to constitute the Michelangelo phenomenon. The model relies on behavioural confirmation as the principle force that shapes the self. In interdependent relationships, behavioural confirmation takes place when the ideas and expectations an individual has of their partner come to be realised in the partner because of the individual's behaviour. The Michelangelo phenomenon requires that individuals see their partner as their partner's self-conceived ideal. This entails partner perceptual affirmation, or the degree to which an individual's perception of their partner corresponds with their partner's ideal self. It also requires partner behavioural affirmation which refers to whether the behaviour of an individual brings out qualities in their partner that the partner themselves see as ideal. Both perceptual and behavioural aspects of partner affirmation can take place consciously or unconsciously. For example, someone with a partner who wants to be more sociable may consciously encourage them to spend more time with their friends, in an effort to help them meet this goal. This is conscious behavioural affirmation. On the other hand, knowing that sociability is a goal of their partner, someone may feel less apprehension when organising a social gathering in their space. This would inadvertently give the partner an opportunity to socialise and is an example of unconscious behavioural affirmation.  Movement towards the ideal self  According to the Michelangelo phenomenon, affirmation from a partner helps individuals move towards their ideal self. Stephen Drigotas (et al.) uses insights from interdependence theory to explain how partner affirmation leads to movement towards the ideal self. An affirming partner may shape someone through a series of selection mechanisms: * Retroactive selection in which an individual reinforces behaviours of their partner by punishing or rewarding them * Preemptive selection wherein an individual initiates an interaction that promotes certain behaviours in their partner * Situation selection where an individual creates a situation in which the elicitation of desired partner behaviours is probable  Partner disaffirmation and movement away from the ideal self  alt=It is also possible for the inverse of the Michelangelo phenomenon to take place. A partner may in fact disaffirm their partner's ideal self and in doing so facilitate a movement away from their ideal self. An individual may disaffirm their partner ‚Äúby communicating indifference, pessimism, or disapproval, by undermining [their] ideal pursuits, or by affirming qualities that are antithetical to [their] ideal self.\\" This disaffirmation may occur passively, in the failure to affirm, or actively, in disaffirmation. = The metaphor = The phenomenon is named after the Italian Renaissance painter, sculptor, architect, poet and engineer Michelangelo (1475-1564). Michelangelo ‚Äúdescribed sculpting as a process whereby the artist released a hidden figure from the block of stone in which it slumbered.‚Äù The metaphor of chipping away at a block of stone to reveal the ‚Äòideal form‚Äô, which extends to close relationships. According to the Michelangelo phenomenon, a person will be ‚Äòsculpted‚Äô into their self-conceived ideal form by their partner. The metaphor and term was first introduced by the US psychologist Stephen Michael Drigotas (et al.) in 1999. = Personal and couple well-being = Evidence suggests the Michelangelo phenomenon is conducive to both personal well-being and the well-being of relationships. The increased personal well-being is believed to be due to individuals being in a gratifying relationship and enjoying higher self-esteem. Well-being hypotheses are often incorporated into models that test the Michelangelo phenomenon.  Related phenomena  = Growth-as-hell model = In contrast, it has been posited by Guggenb√ºhl-Craig that it is precisely through disaffirmation that we grow and move towards our ideal-selves. This is because it is through disaffirmation that we are made aware of our flaws and can overcome them. Much like the Michelangelo phenomenon, this growth-as-hell model of self-growth and movement towards the ideal self is understood to occur most potently in close, romantic relationships. = The Pygmalion phenomenon = The Pygmalion phenomenon, similar to a self-fulfilling prophecy, occurs when someone's belief about how a person should be informs their behaviour towards them, which in turn shapes the person's actual behaviour and self. This could take place in a close relationship. For example, an individual's ideal self might be someone who is conscientious and as a consequence affirm that conscientious quality in their partner and shape their behaviour. Where the Michelangelo phenomenon brings out the 'sculpture's ideal', the Pygmalion phenomenon instead brings the 'sculptor's ideal' into being. For the person being 'sculpted', this can be seen as a movement away from their own ideal self and therefore the process would not enhance personal or couple well-being according to the model of the Michelangelo phenomenon.

The Laie Hawaii Temple is the oldest operating LDS temple outside of Utah The first LDS Church missionary to have success among the Hawaiians was George Q. Cannon. Among his earliest converts were men well-versed in the Hawaiian language, such as Jonatana Napela and Uaua. After the construction of the Hawaii Temple, the Latter-day Saints founded the Church College of Hawaii, now Brigham Young University-Hawaii (BYU-Hawaii), along with the associated Polynesian Cultural Center (PCC), the state's largest living museum, and an entertainment center;Polynesian Cultural Center Official Site.

As the Latter-day Saint population in Hawaii continued to increase, a second church temple for the islands, the Kona Hawaii Temple, was completed in Kailua Kona on the island of Hawaii in 2000. As of September 1, 2018, there were 74,278 Latter-day Saints organized into 16 stakes, 125 wards, and 16 branches, in Hawaii, and there was one mission. In addition, there were 26 Family History Centers, used for genealogical research and study. Hawaii has the highest concentration of Latter-day Saints of U.S. states that do not border Utah. History Honolulu Sunday School ca 1902 The first ten LDS Church missionaries departed San Francisco for Hawaii during the California Gold Rush on the ship Imaum of Muscat, arriving on December 12, 1850, in Honolulu Harbor of what was then known as the Sandwich Islands.. With Hiram Clark presiding, the missionaries included Henry Bigler, Hiram Blackwell, George Q. Cannon, John Dixon, William Farrer, James Hawkins, James Keeler, Thomas Morris, and Thomas Whittle. A day after their arrival the group climbed a hill above Honolulu (Pacific Heights), constructed a small, makeshift altar and said a prayer. A week later, the ten missionaries received their assignments: Farrer and Dixon headed to the island of Kaua'i, Cannon, Keeler, and Bigler to Lahaina on the island of Maui, Blackwell and Hawkins to the Big Island of Hawaii, with Morris, Whittle, and Clark staying behind in Honolulu. This group formed the basis of the Sandwich Islands Mission. The church's first congregation in Hawaii was established on the island of Maui in 1851.. Among the early converts of Cannon were three prominent native Hawaiians: Napela, Uaua and Kaleohano who would later serve as prominent missionaries and leaders in the LDS Church.LDS Church Almanac 2010 Edition, p. 331 Missionaries lead a group of Hawaiian Latter-day Saints in establishing a colony on the island of LƒÅnai in 1854.. In 1857, the American missionaries left due to the Utah War. No new missionaries came until Walter M. Gibson arrived in 1861. Gibson instituted irregular activities such as selling the priesthood. Some local leaders, such as Napela, sent letters to Salt Lake City asking for Gibson to be replaced. In response, Ezra T. Benson and Lorenzo Snow of the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles were sent to take over the leadership of the mission, with the assistance of Joseph F. Smith, who had been a missionary in Hawaii for much of the 1850s. Most of the membership followed Benson, Snow, and Smith, but in the process ownership of the property on Lanai was lost.

Temples The Laie Hawaii Temple, formerly known as the Hawaiian Temple or the Hawaii Temple until a standard naming convention for LDS temples was adopted in the early 2000s, is located on the northeast shore of the island of Oahu. The temple sits on a small hill a half-mile from the Pacific Ocean in the town of Laie, from Honolulu. Along with BYU-Hawaii and the PCC, the temple plays an important role in the town of LƒÅ'ie, with the temple Visitors' Center attracting more than 100,000 people annually. The Hawaii Temple was the first temple the LDS Church built outside of the continental United States. The temple is also the oldest to operate outside of Utah, and the fifth-oldest still in operation. The site of the temple was dedicated by church president Joseph F. Smith on June 1, 1915, and the completed structure was dedicated by church president Heber J. Grant on November 27, 1919. The Kona Hawaii Temple became the church's seventieth temple, announced on May 7, 1998. Located in the town of Kailua-Kona on the island of Hawai‚Äòi, the site of Kona Hawaii Temple was dedicated on March 13, 1999. The structure itself was constructed in concrete, white marble and some native materials. Architects used a simple classical design featuring a single spire. The completion and official dedication was celebrated on January 23, 2000 by church president Gordon B. Hinckley. } See also * The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints membership statistics (United States) Notes References *. *. *.

It is part of the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. The church, designed by architect John Notman, was built in 1856. It originally incorporated a spire more than tall; this was found to be too heavy for the foundation and was removed in 1869. In 1929, the church building, which includes the parish house and rectory, and weighs 5000 tons, was lifted onto steel rollers and moved forty feet west to allow for the widening of 20th Street. On November 20, 1970, Saint Clement's Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.National Register of Historical Places ‚Äì PENNSYLVANIA (PA), Philadelphia County History St. Clement's in an 1863 photograph. Note original tower and spire. On September 13, 1855, a charter was granted to \\"The Rector, Churchwardens, and Vestrymen of St. Clement's Church in the City of Philadelphia\\". The first rector was the Rev. Henry S. Spackman, who was elected as soon as the first charter was received. His incumbency began officially on January 1, 1856. The cornerstone of the church building was laid on May 12, 1856, by the Rt. Rev. Alonzo Potter, third Bishop of the Diocese of Pennsylvania. The land on which St. Clement's was built was furnished by William S. Wilson, a Presbyterian and an Englishman, who with his two brothers came to this country and made a fortune as a manufacturer. He owned most of the land in the section of the city where St. Clement's now stands, and his interest was directed to the development of a residential area by building row houses on Arch, Race and Twentieth Streets. He was eager that a church should be built, not so much because of any religious devotion on his part, but because he felt the erection of a church would greatly enhance the attractiveness of his residential projects.\\"The Story of St Clement's Church\\", May Lilly/St Clement', privately published 1964, s St. Clement's was the third Episcopal church to be designed by architect John Notman and built in Philadelphia between 1847 and 1859. He also designed St. Mark's Church on Locust Street, the Church of the Holy Trinity on Rittenhouse Square and, with Napoleon Le Brun, was associate architect for the Roman Catholic Cathedral of SS. Peter and Paul on Logan Square. In accordance with the architectural wisdom of the time, Notman maintained that the Gothic Revival style was best suited towards the liturgical worship of High Church congregations, while Romanesque Revival architecture was better suited for the conventional Low Church worship of mainstream Episcopal congregations. Unlike St Mark's, which was erected for a High Church congregation and built in the Gothic Revival style, St. Clement's was originally designed for a typical Low Church Episcopal congregation, and like the Church of the Holy Trinity, was designed in the Romanesque Revival style. Like its two nearby sisters, St. Clement's was built entirely of brownstone. Its bell tower was originally topped by an impressive spire of over 200 feet in height. The weight of the spire was more than the foundation could support, and it was removed from the structure in 1869 in order to prevent damaging the foundation. When the cornerstone was laid St. Clement's was almost in the fields. The block between Arch and Race Streets had been, from about 1808 into the 1830s, the site of Sans Souci Garden, the largest for-profit botanical haven within the current-day confines of Center City. It had boasted a fine hotel at which visitors were furnished with fruit from the garden greenhouses as part of their refreshments. The garden was respected for its botanical collection; a portion of William Hamilton's private collection‚Äîdeveloped at the Woodlands in West Philadelphia‚Äîwound up there. The resort was also immediately south of the Magdalene Asylum (a private charitable organization for the redemption of prostitutes) and the Pennsylvania Asylum for the Blind‚Äîillustrating how such institutions were established outside of the populated sectors of the city.\\"Pleasure Gardens, without worry, in the City, HARRY KYRIAKODIS, Hidden City Philadelphia, http://hiddencityphila.org/2014/03/pleasure-gardens- without-worry-in-the-city/ In the mid-1850s, few houses yet existed nearby and large tracts of open lots surrounded the ground that had been secured for the church. The grid of streets had hardly expanded westward as far as 20th Street and there was no City Hall in the Center Square. The Pennsylvania Railroad Terminal was located at 11th and Market Streets, and there was a covered wooden bridge over the Schuylkill River. The building of St. Clement's Church lasted three years because of recurring financial difficulties. Contemporary evidence indicates that at one time all work was stopped and the building stood roofless for a long period. It was finally opened for services on the first Sunday in January 1859. There is no record of any services for the congregation before the opening of the new building. The Church was consecrated on April 12, 1864. Bishop Potter again officiated and was assisted by Bishop Stevens, Bishop Suffragan in the Diocese, and by Bishop Lee of Delaware. It was not until the arrival of Hermon Griswold Batterson in 1869 that the parish increasingly came to be influenced by the theology of the Oxford Movement. During Batterson's time as rector, the parish adopted many of the liturgical practices associated with the Catholic Revival then taking place within the Church of England.Extracts from the Minutes of the Vestry of S. Clement's Church in the City of Philadelphia: Made in accordance with a resolution passed February 23, 1871. Philadelphia: King & Baird, 1871. Project Canterbury. Web. Accessed 15 Jan 2013. These changes, which included liturgical practices such as the wearing of colored chasubles and stoles, placing lit candles on the altar during Mass, and genuflecting before the Blessed Sacrament, together with new theological emphases, including the encouragement of private auricular confession and absolution and encouraging prayer for the dead, were not uncontroversial. As conflict over Batterson's changes escalated, the parish became divided between two factions. The anti- Catholic low church faction was led by several vestrymen who had the public support of the diocesan bishop, William Bacon Stevens. The Anglo-Catholic faction rallied in support of Batterson as the anti-Catholic faction tried to remove him from office as rector.St. Clement's Church Case: A Complete Account of the Proceedings in the Court of Common Pleas for the County of Philadelphia in Equity before the Honorable James R. Ludlow, one of the judges of said Court, to restrain the Vestry of St. Clement's Church from dismissing the Rector and Assistant Minister without a Trial, and against the Protest of the Congregation of said Church together with an Appendix Containing Statements of Similar Cases in New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts and Maryland. Philadelphia: Bourquin and Welsh, 1871. Reprinted in The Making of Modern Law: 1800‚Äì1916. Anthology. New York: Gale, 2012. Despite having the support of the ordinary as well as that of the vast majority of the people and clergy of the diocese, the anti-Catholic faction was unable to use the judicial processes prescribed in the canons to remove Batterson from office as rector, and eventually the vestry, with the support of Bishop Stevens, voted to remove Batterson (and his curate) from office without the requisite canonical trial. The manner in which Batterson was dismissed, circumventing the proper procedures after forcing the parish to endure more than a year of internal conflict, caused the anti-Catholic faction to lose significant support among parishioners. As a result, control of the vestry shifted after the annual election of vestrymen when a number of Anglo-Catholic candidates defeated the incumbent anti-Catholic vestrymen. Later in the year, the vestry went on to elect Theodore M. Riley, an Anglo-Catholic, as the fourth rector of St. Clement's Church. The catholicization of the parish continued during the tenure of the Society of St. John the Evangelist (SSJE), more commonly known as the Cowley Fathers, who were responsible for the parish from 1876 to 1891. Some maintain that the work of the Fathers and the entire St. Clement's community among the poor and needy in Philadelphia may have influenced the diocesan authorities to moderate their criticism of the \\"high church\\" parish. Father Charles Neale Field, one of the assistant priests sent to St. Clement's from Cowley in 1882, established the Guild of the Iron Cross for Working Men and Boys during this time, eventually drawing thousands of working men from all over the United States into its membership. His intent was to create a \\"crusade against Blasphemy, Impurity and Intemperance among working men themselves\\" and posed the question \\"Are we by our lives and teachings preaching the gospel to the poor?\\" The guild was a recreational as well as a religious association. The jovial cleric from Yorkshire established the Iron Cross Parlor and Gymnasium in 1889, and he often took large groups of boys and men for outings at various parks and places out in the country. St. Clement's was located near the great Baldwin Locomotive Works on Spring Garden Street and other nearby factories and workshops, so its congregation was surely made up of many working families whose fathers and sons were members of the Iron Cross Guild.St Clement's Parish Magazine, various numbers 1882‚Äì1887 It has also been widely said that St. Clement's was one of the first Episcopal parishes in the city to be integrated. While direct evidence is scanty, unlike its neighboring parishes of St. Mark's and Holy Trinity and numerous other Philadelphia churches, St. Clement's never established a separate \\"mission church\\" for African-Americans. Also, Field had come to St. Clement's and established his outreach to the workers of the city having already become known for his ministry to people of color, so the church already had a long tradition of tolerance and inclusion. Meanwhile, one long cherished wish of Father Basil Maturin, rector from 1881 to 1889, and his assistant priests, was for the establishment of a hospital for adults. Beginning the work by opening a dispensary in a nearby house in 1885, the plan was to have evening hours so that the working people could benefit. The only requirement for treatment was to be poor and sick. By 1890, the hospital facility had moved to Cherry Street and expanded its services beyond the capacity of the parish to sustain them financially. After a brief period of retrenchment and use of the hospital exclusively to treat epileptics, in 1899 the building was sold to the Community of The All Saints Sisters of the Poor, to be used as a mission house. The Cowley Fathers had withdrawn from St. Clement's in 1891 to focus their American work and ministry in Boston and, in 1895, the Rev. George Moffett became rector. His coming ushered in a new era of prosperity for the church. He built the present clergy house; began perpetual reservation of the Blessed Sacrament in the crypt chapel; was the first to use the term \\"Mass\\" officially in the parish; put the first side altar in the church, and moved the baptistry from the head of the south aisle to the rear of the north aisle. Moffett served until his death in 1904. In 1895, Saint Clement's became the first parish in the Diocese of Pennsylvania to institute perpetual reservation of the Blessed Sacrament. The latter part of the 20th century saw a significant change in the church congregation as the nearby factories and other industrial and commercial establishments closed, families moved to the suburbs or farther away and the parish neighborhood changed profoundly. St. Clement's evolved from a parish church to a shrine church, its outreach and membership becoming more regional and its pews filled on great feast days with worshippers often traveling great distances to partake of the traditional Masses that have continued. Today, as its parish neighborhood is revitalized and new, young singles, students and families settle nearby, St. Clement's continues as an inclusive community rooted in the Anglo-Catholic tradition. The church still emphasizes the Episcopal Church's continuity with Catholicism prior to the English Reformation. St. Clement's therefore offers lavish worship and music with full Catholic ceremonial, including incense, bells, processions, chanting, and a professional choir. Mass is celebrated daily using the English Missal and the King James Bible, enhanced on Sundays and major feasts with classical music. Architecture The location and orientation of the site on which St. Clement's was built posed a significant problem for the design of the church. The west end of the site, where the main fa√ßade and doors would typically be located, was in the middle of a city block. For Notman, the easy solution would have been to reverse the church, erecting the main entrance on the east side of the lot and the apse on the west side. However, this would have altered the eastward orientation of the building. Instead, Notman retained the apse on the east side of the church and incorporated it into the main fa√ßade. The main fa√ßade is dominated by the bell tower and the assertive semi-circular apse, which features a blind arcade of simple columns and Romanesque arches. The blind arcade is broken at both ends by large stained glass windows. Just north of the apse exists the bell tower, which was originally topped by an impressive spire of over 200 feet in height. The weight of the spire was more than the foundation could support, and it was removed from the structure in 1869 in order to prevent damaging the foundation. The nave of the church is of rectangular floor plan and possesses impressive height. The windows are contained within arched bays in the Romanesque style. Buttresses, topped by gablets with decorative carved reverse Ogee arches, separate each bay. Both the roof of the nave and of the apse are of grey slate. Along the ridge of the nave roof at both the east and west ends exist cupolas of carved brownstone, each surmounted by a carved stone cross. In the early 20th century, the roof of the apse was raised some 15 feet with the installation of a clerestory. This renovation was necessary in order to accommodate the installation of the triptych that currently stands above the high altar. While the clerestory windows mirror the Romanesque arches of the blind arcade, the elaborate exterior stonework above the clerestory windows incorporates forms found in both Gothic and Romanesque styles. Also completed about this time was the complete rebuilding of the roof and roof trusses of the nave, the original having been proved to be significantly deteriorated and unsafe. In 1929 the City of Philadelphia undertook a project to widen North 20th Street by some forty feet. S. Clement's Church was in the middle of the proposed expansion. Facing the prospect of having to demolish the church, the vestry undertook a project to move it. The two houses to the immediate west of the church (at 2028 and 2030 Cherry St.) were acquired and demolished, and the 5,000 ton structure was raised onto steel beams, moved forty feet to the west, and placed onto a newly built foundation. The move itself took place between July 11 and July 16, 1929. The interior of the church is dominated by the large carved oak reredos and triptych, installed in 1908, which stand above the high altar. The central panel of the triptych depicts Christ on the cross, clothed in the vestments of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, with the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. John the Apostle at the foot of the cross. South of the sanctuary is the Lady Chapel, which features an altar and reredos of English red stone. The central niche of the reredos contains a statue of the Virgin and Child while the two side niches contain statues of St. Joseph and St. Elizabeth with St. John the Baptist. Located in the nave, the Shrine of Our Lady of Clemency climbs to a height of some twenty-five feet and features a statue of the Blessed Virgin depicted as Queen of Heaven replete with crown and sceptre. The nave also contains shrines dedicated to the church's major patron, Pope Clement I, pope from 88-97 AD, and to the church's minor patron, St. Catherine of Alexandria. The church's four manual, 51 rank pipe organ is Austin Organ Company Opus 507, which was originally installed in 1914.

Prostitution in Mexico is legal under Federal Law. Each of the 31 states enacts its own prostitution laws and policies. Thirteen of the states of Mexico allow and regulate prostitution.Weitzer, Ronald. 2013. Legalizing Prostitution: From Illicit Vice to Lawful Business. (Excerpt) Prostitution involving minors under 18 is illegal. Some Mexican cities have enacted \\"tolerance zones\\" (\\"zonas de tolerancia\\") which allow regulated prostitution and function as red light districts. In Tuxtla Guti√©rrez, capital of the state of Chiapas, there is a state-run brothel at the Zona Gal√°ctica. In most parts of the country, pimping is illegal, although pimp-worker relationships still occur, sometimes under female pimps called \\"madrotas\\". The government provides shelter for former prostitutes. UNAIDS estimated the number of prostitutes in the country at 236,930 in 2016. History Prostitution was known to exist during the Aztec Empire, although the details are relatively unknown as much Aztec history was chronicled later by Roman Catholics in pejorative manner based on strict European values and law. Following the Spanish conquest and establishment of New Spain, Spanish settlers created a demand for prostitution. Throughout the 15th and 16th centuries prostitution was tolerated provided it was kept out of sight. Although Philip IV banned the practice, this was generally unenforced. Prostitution was first regulated in Mexico during the French occupation in the 1860s.These regulations which consisted of registering oneself as a prostitute and of regular health care check ups were implemented to protect European soldiers from contracting sexually transmitted diseases, since sexually transmitted diseases particularly syphilis and gonorrea were spreading quickly. While in power, the French influenced the perception of sex work in various ways, as they categorized women based on their views of beauty and classified places where sex work was done depending on location and services available. Though the French enforced supervision of prostitutes as a way of protecting themselves from infections similar regulations remained when Mexico regained control of the country. During the authoritarian regime of Porfirio D√≠az in the late 19th century regulations in the forms of monthly quotas, medical examinations, and photographic documentation were imposed upon prostitutes. Regulatory practices were most severe on the eve of the Mexican export-mining economic collapse, and had been met with backlash from women's rights groups in Oaxaca, Yucat√°n, and Veracruz. According to a 1908 study, economic concerns were the main reason for turning to the sex trade in Porfirian Mexico, at which time 15 to 30 per cent of Mexico City's young female population was employed in the sex trade. During the Mexican Revolution and civil war, supplies to the cities were severely disrupted and many women prostituted themselves for food in the period 1913‚Äì1915. In the post-war period of reconstruction and consolidation during the 1920s and 1930s, many impoverished women in the cities turned to prostitution. Although morally pressured by the United States and the prevalent changes ongoing prostitution after World War I, El Paso's location served as a convenient place for prostitution to thrive. El Paso's proximity to the United States border allowed for quick and easy access by Americans after the abolishment of prostitution. The access to Mexico via the railroad from the United States and the economic success of prostitution gave way to a surge of Mexican women participating in this kind of labor. As prostitution increased so did the regulations. In translocal border cities such as Mexicali in Baja California, local brothels and vaudeville theatres became spaces for American tourists, Asian laborers, and Mexican-American sex workers to intermingle in the 1930s. In the mid-2000s American men make up a significant clientele sector for sex workers in border cities, specifically Ciudad Ju√°rez and Tijuana‚Äîmore than two-thirds of female sex workers in these two cities had had at least one male U.S. client in the prior two months.Steffanie A. Strathdee et al., \\"Characteristics of Female Sex Workers with U.S. Clients in Two Mexico-U.S. Border Cities\\", Sexually Transmitted Diseases 35 (2008): 3. The revolutionary political and social reforms under L√°zaro C√°rdenas led to the end of the regulation of prostitution in 1940. It has been argued that neoliberal reforms instituted in the late 1990s under the PRI administration of Carlos Salinas de Gortari‚Äîincluding the signing of NAFTA in 1994‚Äîincubated adverse economic conditions that caused the migration of indigenous women from southern Mexico to northern border locales to find work in the sex trade or in maquiladoras. Violence against sex workers in Ciudad Ju√°rez has been connected to similar atrocities committed against maquiladora workers. Child prostitution Child prostitution is a problem in the country, and Mexico continues to be a destination for pedophiles who engage in child sex tourism. Mexico is one of the leading hot spots of child sexual exploitation, along with Thailand, Cambodia, Colombia, India, and Brazil. A study by UNICEF Mexico and the DIF/National System for Integral Family Development estimated that more than 16,000 children in Mexico were involved in prostitution in June 2000. A 2004 study by researcher Elena Azaola estimated that some 17,000 children under the age of 18 are victims of the sex trade in Mexico; the State System of Integral Family Development (DIF) reported that more than 20,000 minors were victims of child prostitution in Mexico in 2005, an increase since the year 2000. Out of Mexico City's 13,000 street children, 95% have had at least one sexual encounter with an adult (many of them through prostitution). In the impoverished southern state of Chiapas, children are sold for $100 to $200, according to human rights groups. Chiapas is considered one of the worst places in the world in terms of child prostitution. Poverty forces many rural children, with or without their families, to migrate to urban cities to seek out employment, some of them also migrate across the border to the U.S. These children have little or no parental supervision and many are lured into the sex industry or abducted by child trafficking gangs. Child sex tourism persists in Mexico, especially in tourist areas such as Acapulco, Puerto Vallarta, and Cancun, and in northern border cities such as Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez. Some NGOs alleged that some corrupt local officials allowed commercial sexual exploitation of children to occur. Many child sex tourists are from the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, though some are Mexican citizens. Casa Alianza director Manuel Capellin is quoted as saying \\"More than 16,000 children are sexually exploited through networks involving foreigners and military, police, government and business officials.\\" Sex trafficking Mexico is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Groups considered most vulnerable to human trafficking in Mexico include women, children, indigenous persons, persons with mental and physical disabilities, migrants, and LGBTI individuals. Mexican women and children, and to a lesser extent men and transgender individuals, are exploited in sex trafficking in Mexico and the United States. Transgender Mexicans in commercial sex are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Residents at some substance addiction rehabilitation centers and women's shelters have been subjected to sex trafficking. Young female migrants recounted being robbed, beaten, and raped by members of criminal gangs and then forced to work in table dance bars or as prostitutes under threat of further harm to them or their families. The majority of non-Mexican trafficking victims come from Central America; lesser numbers come from Brazil, Cuba, Ecuador, China, Taiwan, South Korea, India, Uruguay, and Eastern European countries. Victims are also trafficked to the United States. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Mexico as a 'Tier 2' country (\\"does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so\\").

It has not been updated since 2018 and is not supported. Serena Software asked users to use ProjectLibre instead.  History and status  Marc O'Brien, Howard Katz, and Laurent Chretienneau developed OpenProj at Projity in 2007. It moved out of beta with Version 1.0 on January 10, 2008. In late 2008, Projity was acquired by Silver Lake Partners (the private equity firm) via its subsidiary at that time, Serena Software. In November 2008, support and development of OpenProj appeared suspended.https://sourceforge.net/p/openproj/discussion/708855/thread/03c9f822/ There were a few later commits to the CVS with regressions, but no improvements. It is no longer compatible with Microsoft Project. Serena/Projity also developed a software as a Service (SaaS) project software, Projects On Demand. (Projects On Demand service ended on June 11, 2011.) In 2012, the founders of OpenProj announced that they had forked the OpenProj codebase and started a different implementation. Serena announced and posted online to avoid downloading OpenProj and instead download ProjectLibre. The initial release of ProjectLibre occurred in August 2012. ProjectLibre has been completely rewritten and thus technically ceased to be a fork.  Features  The current version includes: * Earned value costing * Gantt charts * PERT graphs * Resource breakdown structure (RBS) charts * Task usage reports * Work breakdown structure (WBS) charts  Popularity  It has been downloaded over 4,000,000 times in over 142 countries. Three months after the beta version release, on SourceForge an average of 60,000 copies a month were downloaded.OpenProj: Download Statistics: All Files, SourceForge With a SourceForge activity percentile of 99.964, at number 15 it was listed just ahead of the popular messaging application Pidgin. In May 2008 the total number of downloads on SourceForge reached 500,000.  Bugs  OpenProj has not been supported for over 10 years. Serena software previously issued a warning and asked users to use ProjectLibre. As of version 1.4, bugs in the software generally only manifest for users who are attempting more advanced features. For example, tasks may mysteriously start at a certain time (they behave as if they have a 'Start no earlier than' constraint even though none exists, and the project start date is not a constraint), links show gaps, fixed cost for summary tasks neither sums nor is editable, etc. Sometimes these errors are solved by restarting the software, but others are persistent. Compared to Microsoft Project, which it closely emulates, OpenProj has a similar user interface (UI), and a similar approach to construction of a project plan: create an indented task list or work breakdown structure (WBS), set durations, create links (either by (a) mouse drag, (b) selection and then button-down, or (c) manually type in the \\"predecessor\\" column), assign resources. The columns (fields) are the same as for Microsoft Project. Users of either software should be broadly comfortable using the other. Costs are the same: labour, hourly rate, material usage, and fixed costs: these are all provided. However, there are small differences in the UI (comments apply to version 1.4), which take some adaptation for those familiar with Microsoft Project, i.e. OpenProj can't link upward with method (c), inserting tasks is more difficult than in Microsoft Project, and OpenProj can't create resources on the fly (have to create them first in the resource sheet). There are also several more serious limitations with OpenProj, the chief of these being the unavailability of more detailed views and reports typical of Microsoft Project. For example, though the fields exist for cost, there is no quick way to show them other than to manually insert them. This requires a relatively advanced user: someone who knows what the fields might be called and how to use them.  Licensing  Some features of OpenProj are limited to users acquiring a purchased license; for those users using OpenProj for free, a slightly limited feature set is provided. For example, OpenProj(v1.4) does not allow the in-house exporting of PDF output, though the usefulness of such a feature is questionable. It is possible to circumvent the reduced feature set using external software, though as with all paid software, donation or purchase is appreciated by the developers. = ProjectLibre = The original founders of OpenProj started to develop a complementary server for OpenProj in 2012, comparable to Microsoft Project Server for Microsoft Project. During development they realized, that the fact that OpenProj had not been updated anymore by Serena Software for years would become problematic to their goal, so they needed to first develop a significantly updated version of OpenProj.

He played for them through 1921, and served as their coach in 1922 and 1923. He joined the newly renamed Regina Roughriders as their executive in 1926. In 1934, he was named team president, a post he held until 1937, when he was briefly president of the Western Interprovincial Football Union. He presided over the WIFU again from 1941 to 1942, and served as president of the Canadian Rugby Union in 1946 before his sudden death the same year. He was posthumously inducted to the Order of the British Empire. The home of the Roughriders, Park de Young, was renamed the now-defunct Taylor Field in his honour in 1947, and the Hugo Ross Trophy, awarded annually to the champions of the WIFU, was replaced with the N.

The Habeas Corpus Act 1679 confirmed the common law tradition that subjects had a right to a writ of habeas corpus. However judges ruled that those impressed were exempt from the right to habeas corpus. The Chief Justice Lord Mansfield was in favour of this exemption but the Attorney- General Charles Pratt was not. Pratt, a \\"uniform Whig\\",Horace Walpole, Memoirs of King George II. Volume III (London: Yale University Press, 1985), p. 11. prepared a bill for expanding habeas corpus, the object of which, according to William Holdsworth, \\"was to extend the Act of 1679 so as to give the benefit of the writ of Habeas Corpus ad subjiciendum, as improved by that Act, to persons who were imprisoned otherwise than on a criminal charge\\".Holdsworth, History of English Law, ix., p. 119. It was introduced into the House of Commons (with its first reading on 8 March) where William Pitt the Elder and the Speaker Arthur Onslow supported it and, according to Horace Walpole, \\"the majority of the house cheerfully promoted it\\".Walpole, p. 11.

The Great Commoner (London: Allen & Unwin, 1978), p. 168. It passed easily through the Commons, with its third reading on 24 April, but there was no division at any stage. It reached the House of Lords, where it was read for the first time on 25 April and ordered to be printed, with its second reading on 9 May. Lord Hardwicke asked the judges for their opinions. Lord Temple protested that it was improper to inquire into the opinions of judges because such an opinion would be effected by the bill's proposal to inflict penalties on judges if they refused the writ. Hardwicke said that at a time when civil authority wanted the utmost support it would be wrong to pass the bill. Lord Granville initially spoke for the bill until (according to Walpole) he learned \\"how unwelcoming it was at St James's\\". Lord Mansfield and the Duke of Newcastle opposed it.Walpole, p. 19. The rest of the judges' views were inconclusive and so on 2 June Mansfield made a 2¬Ω hours' speech against the bill, which Horace Walpole described: > I am not averse to own, that I never heard so much argument, so much sense, > so much oratory, united. His deviations into the abstruse minutiae of the > law, served but as a foil to the luminous parts of the oration. Perhaps it > was the only speech, that, in my time at least, had real effect, that is, > convinced many persons. Nor did I ever know how true a votary I was to > liberty, till I found that I was not one of the number staggered by that > speech.Walpole, p. 21. Hardwicke argued that all judges should have power to issue the writ and, according to Walpole, \\"said that he would move to order the judges to bring in such a bill against the next session. Lord Temple's friends seemed glad to catch at this proposal; and bill was heard of no more!\\"Walpole, pp. 21-22.

Puckaster Cove sits on the coastline beneath the hamlet, immediately east of Reeth Bay and west of Binnel Bay. It is a small remote cove that is now largely inaccessible and dangerous due to landslides. It has a narrow and rocky shoreline with a small shingle beach. The remains of several wooden structures and cleared sand channels can be seen offshore, these originate from the small fishing community that once existed at the cove, which was subsequently destroyed by landslides during the 20th century. As at Reeth Bay the cove is backed by in-situ cliffs of Lower Greensand, with superficial mudflows and landslide debris from the Gault Clay (known locally as 'Blue Slipper') and Upper Greensand.

Health Education Research, 2013; doi: 10.1093/her/cyt001. Dr. Wendell C. Taylor is recognized as the architect of the Booster Break concept. The intent of Booster Breaks is to encourage health-enhancing breaks during the work day as a corrective to job stress and sedentary behavior. Examples of Booster Breaks are physical activity (e.g., a brief sequence of stretching and toning movements), meditation, or breath training. Even for brief sessions of 10 to 15 minutes, a routine practice of any of the preceding examples can produce physical, psychological, and/or mental benefits.Taylor, WC et al. Impact of Booster Breaks and Computer Prompts on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Among Desk-Based Workers: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial. Preventing Chronic Disease: Public Health Research, Practice, and Policy, November 2016; Vol. 13 E155 One objective of Booster Breaks is to transform work place culture so that management supports and encourages Booster Breaks during the work day and that groups of co-workers regularly participate in Booster Break sessions to promote enjoyment, social support, and team building. In many work places, the usual 10- to 15-minute work breaks in the morning and afternoon can be organized as Booster Breaks to enable a regular practice of a health-promoting behavior at the work place in work clothes during the work day. Ideally, each company would have facilitators, company employees trained to lead the activity, who guide each session. Booster Break Ripple Effects Model A Booster Break program can transform workplace policies to improve organizational morale and lower health care costs with favorable ripple effects for society. To illustrate the impact of the Booster Break program, the Booster Break Ripple Effects Model was developed and has six levels: Booster Break practices, health effects, organizational morale, productivity, health care costs, and organizational image. The first level provides examples of Booster Break behaviors (e.g., physical activity, meditation, and breath training). The second level presents the immediate proximal effects of Booster Break practices (e.g., improved health, reduced stress, increased energy, and fun). The third level, organizational morale, is a proximal effect of the second level related to practice and policy. The fourth, fifth, and sixth levels are increasingly distal but substantial effects of Booster Break practices and policies (i.e., increased productivity, decreased health care costs, and improved organizational image). The first waves of the ripple effects are the strongest, and each successive wave is less robust than the previous waves. The levels are interconnected and synergistic. The strength and robustness of each level affects the impact of each successive level.

Biliary reflux can be confused with acid reflux, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). While bile reflux involves fluid from the small intestine flowing into the stomach and esophagus, acid reflux is backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus. These conditions are often related, and differentiating between the two can be difficult. Bile is a digestive fluid made by the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and discharged into duodenum after food is ingested to aid in the digestion of fat. Normally, the pyloric sphincter prevents bile from entering the stomach. When the pyloric sphincter is damaged or fails to work correctly, bile can enter the stomach and then be transported into the esophagus as in gastric reflux. The presence of small amounts of bile in the stomach is relatively common and usually asymptomatic, but excessive refluxed bile causes irritation and inflammation.Distinguishing Between Bile Reflux and Acid Reflux can be Difficult Bile reflux has been associated with gastric cancer, chemical gastritis and the development of ulcers. Symptoms * Frequent heartburn * Pain in the upper part of the abdomen * Vomiting bile and or Regurgitation (digestion) * Hypersalivation Bile reflux can be asymptomatic when laying down or after eating, as bile reflux occurs physiologically. Causes Bile reflux gastritis can result from excess bile in the duodenum, lack of a pylorus as a barrier to retrograde flow, and/or decreased anterograde peristalsis of the stomach and duodenum. This can occur following gastric or biliary surgery or as primary biliary reflux. The most common predisposing surgeries are those that either remove, disrupt or bypass the pylorus, resulting in unopposed reflux of duodenal contents. Primary biliary reflux occurs in the absence of gastric surgery. Risk factors include gallbladder dysfunction and gastric or duodenal dysmotility. Epidemiology Obesity is an independent risk factor for development of bile reflux. Bile reflux is very infrequent in healthy individuals. Diagnosis At this time, whilst no gold standard exists, cholescintigraphy HIDA scan, is the least invasive investigation with good- patient tolerability, sensitivity, and reproducibility to be considered first- line for diagnosis of bile reflux. An unpractical diagnosis method consists of identifying esophageal content when there is reflux, to test the presence of bile in the liquid that refluxed into the esophagus. Bile should not be in the esophagus; the presence of bile indicates the presence of bile reflux. Another method is the Bilitec monitoring system, it helps identify changes in the color of the refluxate in the esophagus. Because bile has a specific color range, this photo-colorimetric device enables a physician to determine whether there is bile in the refluxate and, if so, how much and for how long it was in the esophagus. Bile reflux is usually associated with: * Erosive esophagitis * Barrett's esophagus Management Ursodeoxycholic acid is an adequate treatment of bile reflux gastritis. The dosage is usually of 1000 mg/day and for a 4 weeks treatment. Drugs that reduce the secretion of gastric acid (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) or that reduce gastric contents or volume can be used to treat acidic bile reflux. Because prokinetic drugs increase the motility of the stomach and accelerate gastric emptying, they can also reduce bile reflux. Other drugs that reduce the relaxations of the lower esophageal sphincter, such as baclofen, have also proven to reduce bile reflux, particularly in patients who are refractory to (medically unresponsive to) proton pump inhibitor therapy. It is important to note that proton pump inhibitors do not reduce the presence of bile acid. Lifestyle modification, weight reduction, and the avoidance of eating immediately before sleep or being in the supine position immediately after meals. Medications used in managing biliary reflux include bile acid sequestrants, particularly cholestyramine, which disrupt the circulation of bile in the digestive tract and sequester bile that would otherwise cause symptoms when refluxed; and prokinetic agents, to move material from the stomach to the small bowel more rapidly and prevent reflux. =Surgery= Biliary reflux may also be treated surgically, if medications are ineffective or if precancerous tissue is present in the esophagus.http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bile- reflux/basics/definition/con-20025548 Surgical management of bile reflux aims to divert bile away from the stomach. The most commonly utilized procedures include interposed isoperistaltic jejunal (Henley) loop, Braun enteroenterostomy and a roux-en-Y procedure. A roux-en-y choledochojejunostomy can be used to divert bile directly from the biliary tree after cholecystectomy. These procedures are effective in relieving symptoms but can be complicated by stomal ulcerations, roux stasis syndrome, and bezoar formation.

Guards units (, , ) are elite units and formations in the armed forces of the former Soviet Union and currently in the armed forces of Belarus and Russia. These units were awarded Guards status after distinguishing themselves in service, and are considered to have elite status. The Guards designation originated during the Great Patriotic War of 1941‚Äì45, its name coming from the Russian Empire Imperial Guard.Overy 1997, p 188. History The title of Soviet Guards was first introduced on September 18, 1941, at the direction of the Headquarters of the Soviet Supreme Commander-in- Chief (Stavka Verkhovnogo Glavnokomanduyuschego). By order ‚Ññ308 of the People's Commissar of Defense, the 100th, 127th, 153rd and 161st Rifle Divisions were renamed the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Guards Divisions, respectively, for their distinguished service during the 1941 Yelnya Offensive. The Soviet 316th Rifle Division was renamed the 8th Guards Rifle Division on November 18, 1941, following the actions of the Panfilovtsy and was given the Panfilovskaya title in honor of its late commander Ivan Panfilov. By December 31, 1941, the 107th, 120th, 64th, 316th, 78th, and 52nd Rifle Divisions had become the 5th through 10th Guards Rifle Divisions.Glantz 2005, p 181. All artillery units equipped with Katyusha multiple rocket launchers were designated Guards Mortars Units.Zaloga 1984, p 154. Some twenty Guards Airborne Brigades were converted into the 11th‚Äì16th Guards Rifle Divisions in December 1943.Glantz 2005, p 188. The units and formations nominated for the Soviet Guard title received special Guards banners in accordance with the decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. On May 21, 1942, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR introduced Guards ranks and Guards badges to be worn of the right side of the chest. In June 1943, they introduced the Guards Red Banners for the land forces, and in February 1944 for the naval forces. After the Second World War a number of Guards troops were stationed in Eastern Europe, for example, in the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, Guards designations for military units have been retained by Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan. Ukraine retained the Guards designations until 2016. A number of former Soviet republics have national guard branches of their armed forces, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan (2,500 Republican Guards in 1994), Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.

He played college football at the University of Tennessee. Early years Shaw attended Joseph Wheeler High School and played varsity football for three years, receiving All-American, state football lineman of the year and All-state honors in his senior season of 1975. He also practiced basketball and swimming. He went on to play college football at Tennessee University, where he was a three-year starter at center, and earned second- team All-SEC honors in 1977 and 1978. Future Dallas Cowboys special teams coach Joe Avezzano, was his offensive coordinator. As a senior, he was named one of the co-captains and received the team's Mickey O‚ÄôBrien award. He also started in the East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game and the Senior Bowl. Professional career Shaw was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round (27th overall) of the 1979 NFL Draft. This was only the second time the Cowboys used a first round pick on an offensive lineman. The first time was in the 1966 NFL Draft when the team selected John Niland. As a rookie in 1980, he started the season as a backup to John Fitzgerald at center and played mainly on special teams. After Fitzgerald injured his knee in the first half against the Washington Redskins, Shaw finished the game and played well enough to be named the starter for the next game against the Houston Oilers in Thanksgiving, while Fitzgerald recovered. He went on to become the starting center for the last five regular season games and three contests in the playoffs where he excelled. Two games into his third season in 1981, he sprained his right knee against the Saint Louis Cardinals. He returned after sitting out three weeks, only to injure the same knee in the sixth game of the season against the San Francisco 49ers. He prepared and trained for a come back over 20 months, but was never able to pass the team's physical and subsequently retired. Shaw was expected to anchor the Cowboys offensive line for 1980s, but his ongoing injuries and their effects brought an end to his promising career. He played in just 33 games over a 3-year career with the Cowboys. After Shaw's injury, Tom Rafferty was moved from guard and was named the starting center. Personal life After the end of his football career, he went back to college and earned a degree in architectural design and management. He became a vice president, working directly under Bob Breunig in the SBC development company. In the late-1980s and early 1990s, he became President of Memphis Real Estate and Columbus Realty Holdings. Along with business partner Roger Staubach, his company helped begin the transformation of a blighted area west of the North Central Expressway and north of the Woodall-Rogers Freeway into what is now known as Uptown Dallas. The first apartment community, positioned between State and Thomas streets, would be the first of many developed using a tax increment financing program with the City of Dallas. Shaw was named to the Dallas Business Journal's \\"Top 40 Under 40\\". His real estate development prowess has continued, and - in 2014 - it was announced that Shaw and Staubach would work with restaurateur Phil Romano to develop an apartment community in Trinity Groves, a project expected to cost in excess of $100 million. In 2017, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones announced that the Shaw/Staubach team would enter into a joint venture to build a 17-story luxury high rise at The Star in Frisco, a mere walking distance from the Dallas Cowboys' world headquarters.

He is a coach at Droylsden Football Club Early career Cameron began his career with local side Dunipace Juniors before moving to Falkirk. In the summer of 1995, he linked up with East Stirlingshire spending a season there before joining the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders as driver. He spent three years in the military, combining this career with appearances in the East of Scotland Football League with the likes of Pencaitland & Ormiston and Whitehill Welfare. In February 1999 he joined St Mirren where he scored twice in ten appearances. Brighton & Hove Albion Cameron paid ¬£1,400 in the summer of 1999 to buy himself out of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in order to join Brighton & Hove Albion on a two-year contract. However, he struggled with the initial demands on full-time football, particularly his fitness and weight levels. However, having been threatened with the axe by manager Micky Adams, he began to come into form particularly impressing in the 2-2 home draw with Lincoln City on 23 November 1999. Finding goals elusive, his final game for Brighton against Hull City on 5 February 2000 saw him substituted after just twenty minutes and then be the subject of severe criticism from Brighton's assistant manager Alan Cork who stated that \\"Cameron was useless, full stop. If he wants to be a professional footballer he has got to liven up. On that performance it will be a long time before he plays again.\\" Cork's comments caused controversy in the local media and Brighton manager Micky Adams was forced to defend Cork. At the end of February, Cameron spent a week on trial with Raith Rovers before moving to Worthing at the end of March. He would mark his home debut in spectacular fashion, scoring five times against Barton Rovers on 11 April 2000. His form for Worthing attracted attention and Lincoln City, remembering his performance against them the previous November, invited Cameron to trial for them in Grant Brown's testimonial game against Middlesbrough in May 2000. An impressive performance saw Cameron secure a two-year contract with the Imps. Managerial career He served as Bradford Park Avenue manager in 2008, helping the team to win the Northern Premier League Division One North and promotion to Northern Premier League Premier Division. However, he resigned in November 2008 after a defeat to bottom-place side Witton Albion. In March 2010 Cameron joined the coaching staff at Droylsden where he played for 2 years.

A business coach until he retired on 24 November 2008, in the past he has also worked for the British Army, Ministry of Defence and the Church of England. His biggest selling book to date is \\"Do It Tomorrow and Other Secrets of Time Management,\\" which challenges some traditional practices in time management with four simple tasks and seven principles. The four tasks of his \\"quick start guide\\" are: # to assemble all delayed work into \\"backlog folders\\" where it cannot be seen, # collect all new work into related \\"batches\\" for the following day, # write down ALL things too urgent to wait until tomorrow before doing them, and then # start each day catching up on backlogged work. The seven principles are: # to have a clear vision, # do one thing at a time, # do small amounts of work often, # define realistic limits using... # \\"closed lists\\" of finite tasks that are not added to, # reduction of interruptions, and # clarifying solid commitments as opposed to vague \\"interests.\\" Together, these form the foundation for what is the \\"do it tomorrow\\" (DIT) time management system. Forster compares time management choices to those made when ordering from a menu in a restaurant. There is only a finite amount of food one can eat and a finite amount of time in a day, so each choice has a logical opportunity cost. The amount of work accomplished is a combination of creativity and efficiency, and can only be increased by (A) improving efficiency, (B) reducing the total number of tasks, or (C) increasing available time. Prioritized task lists only postpone problems of efficiency, which Forster asserts are the major factor in time management. By reducing \\"busy work,\\" more time is made available for \\"real work\\" but many workers have an unrealistic sense of how much is possible. Improved efficiency alone cannot solve fundamental problems of work-life balance. Forster asserts that \\"goals are as much about what we are not going to do as they are about what we are going to do.\\", Chapter 5, p. 68. Proper attention to minor tasks prevents emergencies. Same-day or next-day responses are perfectly adequate in many cases, and judicious use of \\"closed lists\\" increases efficiency, regardless of the order in which finite tasks are completed. Strategic use of delay and closed lists is what Forster calls \\"the ma√±ana principle.\\" Incoming tasks are thus \\"scheduled forward.\\" Important, non-routine projects are identified as the \\"current initiative\\" for some action each and every day. Backlogs may be a current initiative until completed, but the goal is to take breaks and complete a full day's tasks each day with efficient focus. Since late 2008, Mark has developed several variations of a new time management system called AutoFocus. The system instructs the individual to simply write tasks sequentially in a notebook, and then follow mechanical rules to go through the list choosing tasks to work on. The process is designed to promote intuitive decision making and evaluation of what tasks to work on.

Her most successful work, as a novel and as a play, was The Constant Nymph. She was a productive writer and several of her works were made into films. Three of her novels were reprinted in 2011. Family and education Margaret Kennedy was born in Hyde Park Gate, London, the eldest of the four children of Charles Moore Kennedy (1857‚Äì1934), a barrister, and his wife Ellinor Edith Marwood (1861‚Äì1928). The novelist Joyce Cary was a cousin on her father's side. She attended Cheltenham Ladies' College, where she began writing, and then went up to Somerville College, Oxford in 1915 to read history. Other literary contemporaries at Somerville College included Winifred Holtby, Vera Brittain, Hilda Reid, Naomi Mitchison and Sylvia Thompson. She also became close friends with the Welsh author Flora Forster. Her first publication was a history book, A Century of Revolution (1922). Margaret Kennedy was married on 20 June 1925 to the barrister David Davies (1889‚Äì1964), who later became a county-court judge and a national insurance commissioner. He was knighted in 1952. They had a son and two daughters, one of whom was the novelist Julia Birley,ODNB entry. Retrieved 23 March 2011. Subscription required.

Margaret Kennedy died at Flora Forsters's house at Adderbury, Oxfordshire on 31 July 1967. Novels and plays Margaret Kennedy is best appreciated today for her second novel, The Constant Nymph, which she adapted into a highly successful West End play that opened at the New Theatre, with No√´l Coward and Edna Best in September 1926. Coward was replaced by John Gielgud during the run.ODNB entry. A French translation entitled Tessa by Jean Giraudoux appeared in 1924: Retrieved 24 March 2011l. It was also successfully filmed in 1928 by Adrian Brunel and Alma Reville, directed by Brunel and Basil Dean, and starring Ivor Novello, Mabel Poulton and Benita Hume, and again in 1933, 1938 (for television), and 1943. Kennedy's first novel had been The Ladies of Lyndon (1923). Among her later successes were The Fool of the Family (1930), a sequel to The Constant Nymph, and the psychological novel A Long Time Ago (1932). The Midas Touch (1938) was a Daily Mail book of the month, The Feast (1950) a Literary Guild choice in the United States, and Troy Chimneys (1953) the winner of the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. The darkly humorous The Heroes of Clone (1957) drew on Kennedy's experience as a screenplay writer. She also published a biography of Jane Austen and a study of the art of fiction, Outlaws on Parnassus. Kennedy followed the stage success of The Constant Nymph (adapted in conjunction with Basil Dean) with three more co-written plays. The most successful was Escape Me Never (1934), adapting The Fool of the Family, which was also filmed twice.ODNB entry. IMDB: (1935); Retrieved 24 March 2011. (1947). Of her postwar novels, The Feast (1950) introduces the disaster first and the characters who may or may not have perished in it afterwards, as in Thornton Wilder's The Bridge of San Luis Rey. The seaside hotel annihilated by the collapse of the cliff is replete with dysfunctional characters of all ages and sizes, so providing a fine balance of suspense, sympathy and even humour. Still, it works on other levels too. Her novelist granddaughter Serena Mackesy has called it \\"one of the cleverest bits of metaphor-working ever.\\"Mackesy's website: Retrieved 2 April 2011.
