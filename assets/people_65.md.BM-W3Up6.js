Since 2011, AKT-ZENT has operated as the principle research centre for training methods of the International Theatre Institute (ITI) ‚Äì the World Organisation for the Performing Arts. In 2017, the centre was renamed the World Theatre Training Institute to reflect new tasks and objectives within their broader educational remit and sphere of influence.  History and Mode of Operation  Since its foundation, AKT-ZENT has focused on developing new training methods and educational programmes aimed at professional actors and directors. Between 1995 and 2009, AKT-ZENT conducted a three-year modular postgraduate programme in close partnership with the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts in Moscow (GITIS). The programme was implemented in Germany, Russia and across European partner institutions in Estonia, Italy, Sweden, Norway and Greece. From 1996 onwards, the organisation has since expanded to create a comprehensive training methodology including seminars, summer school academies, practical experimentation through laboratories, festival showcases and live performances. These projects were enabled to a large extent by the European Cultural Programmes Caleidoscope, Culture 2000 and Culture 2007-2013. Specialised training programmes for acting teachers and theatre pedagogues have been advanced to create a new methodological awareness of the teaching process itself thereby helping to foster innovation in the field of theatre education and to contribute to the upgrading of drama school teaching as a profession. The bi-annual International Festival for Theatre Training Methods METHODIKA brings theatre makers together to exchange and discuss new training methods regarding teaching and rehearsal practice. Since its inception in 1999, masters of directing and teaching like C√©sar Brie, Grigory Hlady, Oleg Koudriachov, Oleg Liptsin, Iwana Masaki, Peter Oskarson, Rimas Tuminas, Anatoly Vasiliev have shared their specific approaches of actors training with colleagues.  Research Projects  * The World Theatre Training Library - from 2011 onwards, this project has been exploring educational traditions in their day-to-day practical forms throughout the world. On this basis, new rehearsal, teaching and training methods are collectively developed in international group laboratories and made accessible to the international theatre community. * Teaching Professional Theatre Practice - the MA Programme for Acting and Directing Teachers was first implemented in 2012-2014 in collaboration with the Centro Universitario de Teatro at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. The course forms the basis for further methodological development to be implemented in various formats. * Hybrid Theatre Training - in 2017, the institute created an online learning platform to test innovative new training formats including a specialised combination of online training and practical rehearsal tasks. The focus of methodological investigation lies on the research of specific exercises and tasks dedicated to self-education and the development of creativity. Courses on the training platform grant subscribers global access to the professional portfolio of training knowledge, as well as direct contact with the international team of teachers.

The debut novel was published on May 7, 2019 by Random House. It is set in a fictional facility named Golden Oaks, also called \\"The Farm\\", where women serve as surrogates for wealthy clients. The novel switches between four perspectives of the women involved, including Jane Reyes, Evelyn \\"Ate\\" Arroyo, Reagan McCarthy, and Mae Yu. Writing The idea for the novel struck Ramos when she came across a magazine advert for surrogacy services in India. The characters in the book were partly inspired by the many Filipina domestic workers she met who shared her ethnic background but lacked the opportunities she herself had. She said that she chose to switch narrators throughout the novel because \\"otherwise it was one person‚Äôs perspective and one view. I wanted to question the society we‚Äôve collectively chosen\\". The book has been widely compared to Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. She has stated that she did not consider the novel a dystopia but rather a story set \\"where we are today, but pushed forward just a few inches\\". Plot Jane Reyes is a Filipino domestic worker and single mother living in a dormitory in New York, with her infant daughter Amalia. When Jane loses her job as a baby nurse, her elderly cousin Evelyn Arroyo, whom she refers to as \\"Ate,\\" convinces her to join Golden Oaks. Golden Oaks is a commercial facility that uses women, called ‚Äúhosts‚Äù, as surrogates for wealthy clients for handsome bonuses. Jane moves in to the Golden Oaks‚Äô residence, begrudgingly leaving behind Amalia in Evelyn‚Äôs care. Once there, she befriends other Hosts like Reagan McCarthy, a white college- graduate who agrees to be a Host to achieve a sense of meaning in her life, and Lisa Raines, a 3rd-time Host who is increasingly disillusioned with Golden Oaks. As months pass, Jane becomes increasingly worried about Amalia‚Äôs well- being as Evelyn does not return her calls. Moreover, she gets into trouble with Mae Yu, Golden Oak‚Äôs executive manager, resulting in a cancellation of Jane‚Äôs scheduled visit with Amalia. Jane is also betrayed to learn that Evelyn had received a commission for recommending Golden Oaks to Jane. Meanwhile, Reagan is angered by the fact that they used an actor to pretend to be Reagan‚Äôs client in order to give her a false sense of purpose. Lisa and Reagan help Jane escape the residence, and Jane rushes to find Amalia. She is directed to a nearby hospital, where she finds that it is not Amalia but Evelyn who is critically ill. On returning to her dorm, she finds Mae there, as she had correctly guessed that she would return. Mae cancels Jane‚Äôs sizable bonus but, feeling sorry for her, hires her to be a Host for Mae‚Äôs own child. The epilogue cuts to about three years later, where Jane is a nanny to Mae‚Äôs son, Victor. Evelyn has passed away, and Jane and Amalia live above Mae‚Äôs house. Reagan, meanwhile, is still good friends with Jane and is getting her Master's degree. Themes The novel examines motherhood within an intricate web of class, gender and race. Its characters articulate both sides of the surrogacy argument: one, that it is commodification of women, and the other, that it is an act of benevolence. Ramos herself states that she is not against surrogacy but questioned \\"how far we‚Äôve pushed so many things into the realm of markets\\". The novel examines how feminism works differently across class lines: Clients are extremely wealthy, successful women, while the Hosts are largely financially weak women of color. The novel also dwells on how some women ‚Äúchoose‚Äù to take on the task of childbearing because it is their best option for survival in capitalist America. Additionally, the novel re-examines the idea of the American Dream and how success in America also depends on happenstance and luck, which many immigrants never experience. Reception The Farm received mostly positive reviews upon its release. The novel was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for \\"Outstanding Literary Work-Debut Author\\", as well as long-listed for the Center for Fiction‚Äôs First Novel Prize. It was chosen as a \\"must-read novel\\" by various publications such as O, The Oprah Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, and New York Magazine. Time Magazine wrote that \\"At first glance, Joanne Ramos‚Äô The Farm may seem like a predictable thriller about pregnancy...But instead of relying on easy villains in a story that quickly turns sinister, Ramos turns to three of the issues that divide America: race, class and immigration. Nuanced characters and a fast-paced narrative elevate a story that might otherwise feel weighed down by its themes.\\" Similarly, The New Yorker wrote: \\"For a novel about the ruthlessness of capitalism, Ramos demonstrates remarkable tenderness for her characters.\\" NPR wrote that \\"the novel's complex m√©lange of personalities brings a somewhat improbable story stirringly to life\\". Dina Nayeri of The Guardian wrote that Ramos \\"has the acute gaze of the immigrant girl made good. Her book is a necessary one ‚Äì we need a mass-market novel that shows the impact of colonisation, with flawed white people failing to save the day.\\" The New York Times called it \\"an 'issue' book, but it wears the mantle lightly. It's a breezy novel full of types (the Shark, the Dreamer, the Rebel, the Saint), and veers, not always successfully, from earnestness into satire. That shift in voice can obscure the novel's intent ‚Äî though to be fair, ambiguity may be the point.\\" Los Angeles Review of Books criticized the ending as \\"too easy and ultimately unsatisfying\\" but praised Ramos' \\"ability to explore the nuances of these questions in the first place ‚Äî in tight, spare prose, with well-placed plotting, no less\\".

Built between 1976-83, it is considered one of the primary works of the Dutch architect Theo Bosch, completed in association with Aldo Van Eyck.https://web.archive.org/web/20150226201756/http://onsamsterdam.nl/tijdschrift/jaargang-2006/488-nummer-10-oktober-2006?showall=1 Ons Amsterdam, oktober 2006] It currently houses lecture halls for the Faculty of Humanities, much like the historic Bungehuis building down the street on the Spuistraat. It is named after the historian, poet and playwright Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft (1581-1647), because the former home In den Huypot of the Hooft family stood at this location. History and Design Until 1979, the site of the PC Hoofthuis was occupied by the former Twentsche Bank, built in 1874, which merged in 1964 with the Algemene Bank Nederland. Van Eyck and Bosch worked on the building together until they dissolved their partnership under design disagreements in 1982; Bosch subsequently finished the building the next year alone. Among students, the building is popularly nicknamed ‚ÄúHet huis van de kobolden‚Äù (The home of the goblins). The building is controversial. Enthusiasts insist that it is open and accessible, while others have reputedly called it ‚Äúthe ugliest building on the street.‚Äù The interior is striking for its open original plan. Lecture rooms sit on either side of the corridors and are separated from the hallways by a glass wall, which makes them easy to see into. In fact, the glass partitions between the lecture halls and corridors did not exist originally, as the intention was that one could catch various fragments of lectures while walking down the corridors and decide whether one wanted to keep listening. This scheme was abandoned when it became apparent that the lectures would be disturbed by the noise in the corridors, which must have also made it more difficult for the audience to hear the lecture. Lecture halls are located on the first to the seventh floors and the offices of various departments are also located in the building. The first and second floors also contain a portion of the Arts Library, which a study center is located on the ground floor and the third floor contains a canteen. In the basement is a bicycle storage and fitness center. As part of the University of Amsterdam protests in the fall of 2018, on 28 September the PC Hoofthuis was occupied by belligerent students.Archipedia PCHoofthuis2018-8.jpg PCHoofthuis2018-2.jpg PCHoofthuis2018-7.jpg PCHoofthuis2018-3.jpg PCHoofthuis2018-5.jpg External links * Website of the University of Amsterdam References Category:University of Amsterdam ","title":"PC Hoofthuis"},{"id":"62670711","text":"Kiruna porphyry () is a group of igneous rocks found near Kiruna in northernmost Sweden.

Hare worked in Australia and was medical superintendent of Charters Towers Hospital and resident medical officer of the Brisbane General Hospital. He returned to England in 1904 and was medical superintendent of Norwood Sanatorium for over twenty years. Hare died in Beckenham on December 9, 1928. The Food Factor in Disease Hare authored the two-volume The Food Factor in Disease (1905), which suggested that excessive consumption of carbohydrate foods could result in a condition he termed \\"hyperpyraemia\\".Reviewed Work: The Food Factor In Disease by Francis Hare.

He attributed hyperpyraemia to the occurrence of many disorders including asthma, gout, hypertension, obesity and migraines. Hare defined hyperpyraemia as an excess of carbonaceous material or fuel to the bloodstream from consuming too many carbohydrate foods.Hutchison, Robert. (1917). Dr. Hare's System. In Food and the Principles of Dietetics. New York: W. Wood and Co. pp. 552-553 He recommended a high-protein low-carbohydrate diet that was high in animal protein and restricted starch, sugar and alcohol.Eagle, Robert. (1981). Eating and Allergy. Doubleday. p. 150. He was influenced by the diet of James Salisbury. Hare believed that some instances of migraine were a \\"food disease\\" and his diet could alleviate \\"migrainous\\" headaches. In the second volume he documented cases of patients being cured by carbohydrate restriction. However, medical experts criticized the concept of hyperpyraemia because it was not clearly defined and Hare provided no direct evidence for its existence.The Food Factor in Disease. By Francis Hare, M.D. (1906). Edinburgh Medical Journal 19: 64. In 1906, a review in the British Medical Journal concluded that \\"we cannot regard the theory of hyperpyraemia as possessing any sound basis, nor can the author expect it to be considered seriously until he has given a clearer definition of what he means by excess of fuel substances in the blood, and has produced some direct evidence of their presence.\\" Hare's book was criticized in the Edinburgh Medical Journal. The reviewer noted that hyperpyraemia has no chemical basis or evidence to support it and that he did not have a proper theory, only an assumption. A mixed-review in the Bristol Medico-Chirurgical Journal concluded that \\"the work is one of very great interest, and contains much that is original in thought, although some of the hypotheses prove untenable.\\"The Food Factor in Disease.

Located near what was‚Äîat the time‚Äîthe small town of Tulsa, Oklahoma, the resultant establishment of the oil fields in the area contributed greatly to the early growth and success of the city, as Tulsa became the petroleum and transportation center of the state, and the world. Several Creek Indian land allotment owners became millionaires; Oklahoma became the world's largest oil producer for years; and the area benefited from the generation of more wealth than the California Gold Rush and Nevada Silver Rush combined, as well as the increased investment capital and industrial infrastructure the boom brought with it. The town of Glenpool, Oklahoma was founded in 1906 as a direct result of the oil reserve's discovery. History =Background= Oil speculation was already rampant in the Tulsa region following the Red Fork discovery in 1901. One of the early successes was Galbreath's 125 barrel per day well, northeast of Red Fork. On 3 July 1901, Galbreath camped on the Glenn farm, when Bob Glenn showed Galbreath a limestone outcrop with traces of oil. Further progress awaited federal approval of an oil lease. At the turn of the 20th century, the federal government dissolved tribal land claims of the Indian Territory in favor of a distribution of parcels to private owners. Robert Galbreath, a speculator and wildcatter, began prospecting in the area in 1901, and made an initial agreement that year with the recipient of one of these land allotments, Ida Glenn (she being a Creek native) and her husband, Robert, to drill for oil on their farmland. Due to federal regulations of the time, however, it would be years before such drilling commenced.Glenn Pool Field; Bobby D. Weaver; The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture; article; Oklahoma Historical Society online; accessed December 2019 Following the change of oil leasing regulations affecting Native American land allotments enacted due to Oklahoma's pending statehood, Galbreath and a partner, Frank Chesley, finally began drilling on the Ida E. Glenn Number One drill-site in autumn of 1905. Roy Dodd and Shorty Miller made up the cable-tool drilling crew. =Discovery= After almost giving up and conceding the well to probably be a \\"dry hole\\", Galbreath noticed signs of gas flow in early NovemberMaking Tulsa the Oil Capital of the World; AOGHS; retrieved December 27, 2019 and continued drilling. Due to the depth they had drilled by mid-November, the success of the well was doubtful. After seeing signs of oil in the well debris, however, the pair were encouraged and, once more, continued on. On November 22, at 5 AM, with the well deep into the layer of Bartlesville (or \\"Glenn\\") sandstone of the Boggy Formation, the two struck oil at a depth of . The oil soon flowed over the top of the derrick, and the \\"gusher\\" marked the discovery of Oklahoma's first major oil field. Galbreath, Chesley, Charles Colcord, and John Mitchell then formed the Creek Oil Company, and Chesley soon leased an additional 600 acres. Galbreath went on to drill 69 successful wells, with only one dry hole. The Ida E. Glenn Number One soon regularly produced 75‚Äì85 barrels of light, sweet crude oil a day. Gilbreath, a veteran of the earlier Red Fork boom, wished to avoid the chaos which had followed that prior discovery and attempted to keep the drilling and subsequent discovery a secret, but to no avail. Several other speculators operating in the area noticed the activity at the farm. The area was immediately swarmed by oil and land speculators. Within a year, the approximately Glenn Pool held over 125 oil or gas producing wells. Characteristics Wildcat drilling took place over a wide area, which had the effect of quickly defining the core lay-out of the reserve, an area roughly four miles by two miles with a slope of about 40 feet per mile, and an average field thickness of 100 feet. The Glenn Pool Oil Reserve held an estimated 1 billion bbls of oil in place, with ultimate recoverable reserves of 400+ million bbls. The field grew from 80 acres to 8,000 acres during the first year. By 1907, natural flowing oil production ranged from to per year. 'Black Gold Days' festival celebrates Glenpool's oil heritage; article; June 16, 2011; Tulsa World online; retrieved December 26, 2019 Gas depletion caused by massive venting, however, decreased the gas pressure over the same period and the pumping for oil collection then became necessary. Total field production by 1907 exceeded , making Oklahoma that year the leading producer of oil, not only in the US, but any country in the world. The area experienced a huge economic boom. Prices for basic goods and services, however, soared in the area. Consequences Oil spills, due to a lack of storage facilities, were common early on. Often, open pits were dug and filled with the oil, forming huge \\"oil lakes\\"History of the Oil Boom ‚Äì Glenn Fact Sheet; website; Glen Pool Oil Field; accessed December 26, 2019 which sometimes escaped their banks and flooded the countryside. During thunderstorms, these \\"lakes\\" sometimes caught fire following lightning strikes. Due to this unclean method of storage, the product from the reserve often sold for as little as 25 cents per barrel. Oklahoma Natural Gas, Prairie Oil and Gas Company, Gulf Oil Company, and the Texas Company quickly built large-diameter pipelines into the area which by 1908 alleviated much of the infrastructure problems the rapid boom had caused. gusher\\") The Oklahoma oil boom created more wealth for speculators than the California gold rush and Colorado silver rush combined.History of the Oil Boom ‚Äì Ida E. Glenn Discovery; website; Glen Pool Oil Field; accessed December 26, 2019 Several of the Creek Nation land allotment owners in the vicinity became rich, almost overnight, and received regular royalty payments of over a million dollars a year following the discovery. One next-door neighbor of the Glenns, Thomas Gilcrease, became a multi-millionaire as a result of the oil production, and had 32 producing wells on his farm by 1917.Gilcrease, William Thomas (1890 - 1962); Self, Burl E.; Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture; Oklahoma Historical Society online; retrieved December 26, 2019 Aftermath Harry Ford Sinclair (founder of Sinclair Oil and Refining Company) and J.

He was awarded the 1989 United Nations Environment Programme Global 500 Roll of Honour and the 1994 Goldman Environmental Prize.  Early life and education  Simmons is from Enhams, Saint Vincent. He originally trained in education. He completed a master's degree in economic development. In 2019 Simmons earned his doctoral degree at De Montfort University. His PhD considered the impact of climate change on young people and how communities can build resilience to mitigate its effects.  Activism and career  Simmons launched the JEMS Progressive Community Organization in 1978. At the time he was a teacher and the only employed teenager in his community. He formed the environmental movement after Caribbean residents started to exploit the King's Hill Forest Reserve in response to increasing unemployment. Prior to 1972, 95% of the island were employed, but after the 1973 oil crisis hit and fuel costs increased the agricultural estates closed down. The King's Hill Forest Reserve was established in 1791, and is one of the oldest forest reserves in the Western hemisphere. It is of particular significance to Simmons as the Caribbean economy relies heavily on agriculture and tourism. To explain the importance of the reserve to the local community Simmons used festivals, plays and music. JEMS started a literacy programme and offered training to women in electrical wiring and construction. In 1989 Simmons was included in the United Nations Environment Programme Global 500 Roll of Honour. He helped to initiate several projects relating to clean water and conservation, including teaching children at a local daycare centre and leading them on clean up campaigns. In the early nineties Simmons launched the Caribbean Youth Environment Network (CYEN). The CYEN has continued to develop, teaching young people from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to be more vocal advocates for the protection of their islands. Together Simmons and the CYEN have monitored the changing environment of the Caribbean, with an increase in hurricanes, more intense rainy seasons and bleaching of coral reefs. CYEN have gone on to hold annual congresses; which have become the largest and most consistent young environmental conventions in the Caribbean. In 2008 Simmons became the first person to be inducted into the CYEN Hall of Fame. He has worked with the United Nations Environment Programme on similar initiatives, encouraging young people all around the world to be more environmentally conscious. He has said that he focussed on young people because \\"the future of the earth itself is on the side of the children\\". In 2016 he hosted a workshop to empower local communities to strengthen their resilience to climate change. For this workshop Simmons worked with Otis Joslyn, technical director of the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre. Simmons moved to London in 1997 where he worked as the Deputy Director of Youth Affairs at the Commonwealth Office. He was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize.

It was a one-off race car purpose-built for the second edition of the 500 Miles of Monza. It was the first single-seater in Europe to be sponsored by a brand not attached to an automobile industry. The internal Maserati classification was the Tipo 4, behind the 250F variants, and also referred to as the 420/M/58 for 4.2-litre displacement, Monoposto or a single-seater and 1958 year, or simply as the \\"Eldorado\\". Development Maserati was the last manufacturer from Europe to win Indianapolis 500 races in 1939 and 1940. In 1957 and 1958 Tony Parravano entered Maserati-engined racers in this race. Their engine, based on the V8 from 450S was also a basis for the Race of Two Worlds Maserati race car but with a shorter stroke to fit the Indy regulations. By the end of the 1957 Formula One season, after securing World Championship won with Juan Manuel Fangio, Maserati withdrew from racing as a factory entrant. This decision was mainly dictated by financial situation but allowed Maserati to pursue building road and racing cars for private customers. For the second edition of the 500 Miles of Monza, Maserati was commissioned the creation of a suitable car to compete against American entries. This lucrative order was an idea of Eldorado Sud, ice-cream company as a sponsorship venture. The race car was built from parts of already existing racing projects, mainly the Maserati 250F. Within a space of a couple months, the chief-engineer Giulio Alfieri was responsible for creating the \\"Eldorado\\". It would use the modified Maserati 250F chassis with 450S-sourced engine. The unique Maserati 420M/58 was to be driven by a former works driver Stirling Moss. His opposition for the race was made up mainly of American Indy racers with three Ferraris, a pair of Jaguar D-Types and the unique Lister-Jaguar. Currently, the Maserati \\"Eldorado\\", with bodywork and livery restored to its 1958 specification, resides in the Panini Collection in Modena. =Sponsorship= The change towards race cars commissions was ideal for privateer such as Gino Zanetti as it would allow him to promote his business and meant a lucrative deal for Maserati. Zanetti was the owner of the Eldorado Sud ice-cream company and had pioneered a racing world sponsorship. He would become the first major sponsor of a European racing team that was not related to any automobile industry. The race car was not only adorned with a sponsor's logo but the entire car was painted in desired, company colours with the company trademarks added along the sides and front, with the company names and young cowboy logos featured in multiple locations on the car. Also a bright racing red \\"Italia\\" script was added to denote the nationality of the sponsor and that of the car's manufacturer. This was the first instance when a sponsorship colours replaced the traditional, national colour assigned by the International Federation. This decision was monumental in motorsport history and would soon open the flood-gates for sponsorship deals and financial bakers from outside the race car world. =Bodywork= The bodywork was created out of aluminium as an open-wheel single-seater and was hand-crafted by Medardo Fantuzzi in Modena. The characteristic vertical tail-fin was added, just behind the driver's head for stability as the speeds achieved could reach . Also an additional offset hood scoop for carburetors and a long and low nose. The small deflector was installed to serve as a windshield. The bodywork was later modified after the first race and the original fin and the headrest were removed. Further the hood scoop was reduced and an additional, mandatory roll bar installed when the car raced at the Indianapolis 500. Specifications =Engine and gearbox= The 420M/58 engine was derived from the Maserati 450S sports car. The twin cam 90¬∞ V8 was modified with a shorter stroke to reduce the displacement to so it could also meet the Indy 500 technical regulations. The fuel was fed by four twin-choke Weber carburetors to produce at 8,000 rpm with 12:1 compression ratio. The engine was lubricated via dry sump system and was equipped with twin spark plugs per cylinder. The engine produced so much power and torque that only a two-speed gearbox was used. The first gear was only used to start from the pits. Additionally, the De Dion rear axle had no differential at all, as the final drive was solid. Both the engine and transmission were offset to the left by , with a better weight distribution in mind, taking into account the high banked corners at Monza. =Chassis and suspension= The chassis was derived from the final evolution of the highly successful Maserati 250F Formula One racer. The tubular steel space frame construction was further reinforced to withstand the high-speed cornering on the concrete banks at Monza. The car received the chassis number 4203. The typical wire wheels were replaced by Halibrand alloys to withstand the high cornering forces. To reduce the weight, the alloy used was magnesium, along with Firestone 18-inch braided tread tires filled with helium to save as much weight as possible. The front suspension consisted of double wishbones and the rear of a De Dion axle. The hydraulic drum brakes were identical as those on the 250F. The whole car weighed . Racing =Race of Two Worlds= The Race of Two Worlds was first held in 1957, as an attempt for the European and American race cars to compete on the same track. Even though the Indianapolis 500 had been part of the World Championship, not many European entries were seen there. After 1955, the Monza circuit had been reconfigured and new concrete oval banking erected in an image of Indy 500. The race was run under the Indianapolis 500 regulations and the first edition was dominated by American entries. The Race of Two World would be the first outing for the 420M/58. During the qualification the Maserati, driven by Stirling Moss ended up in eleventh place for the start. The actual race held on 29th June 1958, at the Monza track, was divided into three heats. After the first heat Moss elevated his position to a fourth place. The second heat he finished as the fifth driver. During the final heat, being fourth overall, his steering broke on 41st lap and the car went into the rails at around . Luckily Moss walked away from the accident and the car was only lightly damaged. Even though he could achieve a third place on the podium the overall score was a seventh place overall, taking into account all the heats and the total number of laps finished. Once again the American cars proved superior on the oval track. The race itself was partially a success in terms of a spectator numbers but it was not organised for the 1959 season. =Indianapolis 500= The Indianapolis 500 race was won by Maserati 8CTF in 1939 and 1940. Wilbur Shaw almost scored a victory for the third time in 1941, but was forced to withdraw with a broken wheel. Maserati would return to Indy 500 with a 420M/58 for its 1959 edition. The damaged car was repaired and slighly rebodied. The Gentilini bodybuilder removed the rear fin and lowered the hood scoop. The oil tank was repositioned to the left for better weight balance. The car was finished in Italian racing red but still retained the Eldorado sponsorship name and logos. The intended driver was Ralph Liguori of a privateer Eldorado Racing team. The car had problems during qualifying stage and set the 36th fastest time out of only the first 33 qualifying. The faulty fuel pick-up prevented it from entering the actual race. This also proved to be the car's last outing.

It was established in 2015 under the Manitoba Ecological Reserves Act. It is in size. Geography Armit Meadows Ecological Reserve is located about northwest of Swan River, Manitoba near the Manitoba Saskatchewan border. The reserve is situated within the Porcupine Hills, the northernmost area of hills associated with the Manitoba Escarpment within Manitoba. The hills lie within the eastern portion of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in an area where the Souris River Formation overlays the Precambrian bedrock. This layer of shale and limestone was deposited by a shallow sea during the Devonian period. The bedrock underneath the hills is higher than in the surrounding region. During the Quaternary period, when the ice sheets advanced and retreated, these raised areas of bedrock snagged more glacial till than their surroundings, further increasing their height. The reserve contains part of the course of the Armit River as it flows north through the Armit River Canyon. This canyon cuts through the layers of glacial till and the Devonian sediments creating substantial cliffs parallel to the river. Ecology The reserve protects the riparian zone of the Armit River and the adjacent uplands containing spruce forest, sphagnum meadows and fescue prairie. This area marks the most northerly location of fescue prairie in Manitoba. Fescue bunchgrasses found in the reserve provide winter forage for elk. Leatherleaf and cottongrass bloom in dry sphagnum meadows within the reserve. The reserve is within the Porcupine Hills Ecodistrict in the Mid-Boreal Uplands Ecoregion within the Boreal Plains Ecozone. This eco-district has significant forested areas with mixed stands of white spruce and balsam fir. Trembling aspen, balsam poplar, and jack pine are found on drier sites. Black spruce and tamarack grow in poorly drained areas.

It produced a report in eight volumes published in 1905 and made recommendations on the character, administration and routing of traffic in London. Establishment The Royal Commission on London Traffic was established on 10 February 1903. It had 13 commissioners and was chaired by Sir David Barbour. Its secretary was Lynden Macassey and the other commissioners were: *Earl Cawdor, Chairman of the Great Western Railway *Viscount Cobham *Baron Ribblesdale *Sir Joseph Dimsdale MP, member of parliament for the City of London and former Lord Mayor of London *Sir Robert Reid MP, former Attorney General *Sir John Dickson-Poynder MP, member of the London County Council *Sir John Wolfe Barry, former President of the Institution of Civil Engineers *Sir Francis Hopwood, Permanent Secretary to the Board of Trade *Sir George Trout Bartley MP, member of parliament for Islington North *Charles Murdoch, Assistant Under Secretary at the Home Department *Felix Schuster, Banker *George Gibb, General Manager of the North Eastern Railway =Remit= The Commission's remit was to report on London's traffic arrangements and: (a) as to measures which the Commission deem most effectual for the improvement of the same by the development and inter-connexion of Railways and Tramways on, or below, the surface; by increasing the facilities for other forms of mechanical locomotion; by better provision for the organization and regulation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, or otherwise; (b) as to the desirability of establishing some authority or tribunal to which all schemes of Railway or Tramway construction of a local character should be referred, and the powers which it could be advisable to confer on such a body. The area of the Commission's scope covered the Metropolitan Police District, an area of and a population of more than 6.5 million in 1901. In its report the Commission described this as \\"Greater London\\" and the urban developed area at its centre as \\"the Metropolis\\". The area beyond the Metropolis was described as \\"Extra London\\". Investigation The Commission held 112 meetings and interviewed 134 witnesses. Members of the Commission carried out fact-finding visits to New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington in 1903 and to Vienna, Budapest, Prague, Cologne, Dresden, Berlin, Brussels and Paris in 1904. An Advisory Board of three engineers was appointed to give the Commission technical advice. The board consisted of Sir John Wolfe Barry (also a member of the Commission), Sir Benjamin Baker, former President of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and William Barclay Parsons, Chief Engineer to the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners of the City of New York. Report and recommendations The Commission's Report, Report of the Royal Commission Appointed to Inquire Into and Report Upon the Means of Locomotion and Transport in London, was published in eight volumes on 17 July 1905. The Report examined the historic development of road, rail and tram transportation and the current condition. It made recommendations for improvements to roads within London's central area and arterial roads; for improvements in tramways including new routes and for improvements in railways of all types including their connections to one another. Recommendations were made as on road traffic regulations and the Commission recommended the establishment of a Traffic Board to manage traffic developments in the Greater London area and carry out preliminary reviews of bills for traffic schemes before they were submitted to parliament. =Roads= The Report identified that road traffic was constrained by the narrowness of many of London's roads which reflected the historic development of the city. The Report recommended that a comprehensive plan should be developed to improve road provision and routing to be carried out over the long term and that new roads should be constructed to standard widths depending on their importance and that existing main routes should be widened when possible. Recommended road improvements Sketch from the Report showing a cross section through one of the proposed Main Avenues with trams and road traffic on the surface and railway lines beneath The Advisory Board recommended construction of two \\"Main Avenues\\". These would be wide between buildings with four tram lines on the road and four railway lines in a sub-surface tunnel immediately beneath. Two of the tram lines and two of the railway lines would be for express services and service tunnels would be provided for utilities beneath the wide pavements. The Main Avenues would connect areas on the outskirts of the main urban area and tramways and railway lines would be connected to these at both ends: *A: New Main Avenue, West to East ‚Äì Bayswater Road to Whitechapel running from Victoria Gate of Hyde Park, through Portman Square, Russell Square, London Wall to the junction of Commercial Road and Whitechapel High Street. *B: New Main Avenue, North to South ‚Äì Holloway to Elephant & Castle running via Caledonian Road and Gray's Inn Road and including a new bridge over the River Thames to the west of Blackfriars Bridge. The Main Avenues would cross at Gray's Inn Road. Definitive routes were not proposed, but the Report recognised that the scale of the projects would require them to be carried out as a complete exercise. The cost of both Main Avenues was estimated to be ¬£30 million (equivalent to approximately ¬£ today) for the of new roads, tramways and railways. Map showing the routes recommended for improvement (Red: Main Avenues, Blue Other Recommendations) Other main road improvements recommended by the Advisory Board were: *C: Widening of Marylebone Road and Euston Road. *D: Construction of a new street between Marylebone Road and Edgware Road. *E: Extension of The Mall to Charing Cross (now the north end of Whitehall). *F: Widening of Constitution Hill. *G: Widening of Princes Street, Westminster and construction of a new street along the east side of St James's Park to Waterloo Place and Duke of York's Column. *H: Widening of Broad Sanctuary, Westminster. *I: Widening of Uxbridge Road and Bayswater Road. *J: Widening of Hammersmith Road and Kensington Road. *K: Widening of Fulham Road and Brompton Road. *L: Widening of King's Road, Chelsea. *M: Extension of West Cromwell Road. *N: Widening of King Street, Hammersmith. *O: Widening of Wandsworth Road, Lavender Hill, St John's Hill and Wandsworth High Street from Lambeth to Putney. *P: Widening of Brentford High Street or construction of a new street. *Q: Viaduct from Blackfriars Bridge to Farringdon Street. The viaduct would start in the centre of the bridge and run to just south of Holborn Viaduct to relieve congestion at the north end of the bridge and at Ludgate Circus. *R: Viaduct from Waterloo Bridge to Wellington Street to segregate traffic from the bridge from east-west traffic along Strand. *S: Construction of a new street from Berkeley Square to the Mall via the eastern side of Green Park with branches to connect to Jermyn Street and Pall Mall. *T: Widening Marble Arch between Edgware Road and Park Lane. The Report indicated that there were many other roads and junctions that required improvements including for main roads leading out of London. For the latter the Report recommended that this should be a responsibility for the Traffic Board to report on when established. Although it did not make any recommendations on the subjects, the Report noted that submissions made to the Commission, included suggestions for \\"making roads in different directions out of London\\", \\"constructing a circular road about 75 miles in length at a radius of 12 miles from St Paul's\\", \\"providing alternative streets parallel to crowded thoroughfares, and new streets\\" and \\"removing factories from London\\". =Tramways= The Report identified that the existing tramway systems were fragmented and lacked connections. Compared to other British cities, Greater London's tramway systems were significantly under-developed. The report criticised the London County Council's (LCC's) policy of refusing to allow the privately owned tramways operating outside the county's boundary to connect to and operate over its municipally owned system within. It also criticised the failure of the County to join its three separate systems together and to allow trams in the central areas of the City of London and the West End. The Report recommended that interconnection of the existing tramways be undertaken and recommended construction of many new routes in areas not served and that through running of services between different operators be allowed. The Report recommended that vetos held by the London County Council and the municipal boroughs within it over the construction of new tramways should be abolished. The Advisory Board recommended the construction of 23 new tramways to connect the separate systems and bring trams to unserved areas. It estimated that the cost of constructing double line tramways was four to five per cent of the cost of constructing a cut and cover line such as the Metropolitan Railway or 13 to 17 per cent of the cost of a deep-level tube line such as the Central London Railway. Recommended tramway improvements Map showing the routes recommended for new tramways to connect existing or planned routes The new routes recommended by the Advisory Board were: * Route 1: Across Hammersmith Bridge ‚Äì to connect the London County Council Tramways' ('s) planned terminus at the north end to the London United Tramways' (LUT's) terminus at the south end. * Route 2: Hammersmith to Knightsbridge ‚Äì Hammersmith Broadway running via Hammersmith Road, Kensington Road and Knightsbridge to the north end of Sloane Street. * Route 3: Knightsbridge to Aldgate ‚Äì continuing Route 2 and running below ground in a subway from the junction of Albert Gate and Knightsbridge via Hyde Park Corner, Piccadilly, Coventry Street, Leicester Square, King William Street, Strand, Fleet Street, Ludgate Hill, Cheapside, Cornhill, Leadenhall Street to the 's terminus in Aldgate High Street. * Route 4: Fulham and Brompton Road ‚Äì running from a junction with the 's planned terminus in Fulham Palace Road and Fulham High Street via Fulham Road and Brompton Road and ending at a junction with Routes 2 and 3 at the north end of Sloane Street. * Route 5: Grosvenor Place and Hyde Park ‚Äì running from the 's terminus in Vauxhall Bridge Road via Victoria Street, Grosvenor Gardens, Grosvenor Place and Hyde Park to the southern end of Edgware Road.

A branch along Waterloo Road would connect with the 's terminus there. * Route 16: Tower Subway ‚Äì running from a junction with the 's terminus at Leman Street then in a tunnel under the River Thames on the east side of St Katharine Docks to a junction with the 's terminus at the south end of Tower Bridge. * Route 17: Tottenham Court Road and Whitehall ‚Äì running from a junction with the 's terminus at the southern end of Hampstead Road via Tottenham Court Road, Charing Cross Road, the east side of Trafalgar Square, Charing Cross, Whitehall, Parliament Street and Bridge Street to a junction with Route 10 at the west end of Westminster Bridge. * Route 18: Moorgate, Liverpool Street and Norton Folgate ‚Äì running from a junction with the 's terminus at South Place via Finsbury Pavement, Finsbury Circus, Liverpool Street and Bishopsgate to a junction with the 's terminus in Norton Folgate. * Route 19: Aldersgate Street to Post Office ‚Äì running from a junction with the 's terminus near Charterhouse Square and then in a subway under Aldersgate Street and St. Martin's Le Grand to a terminus near the General Post Office. * Route 20: King's Road, Chelsea and Buckingham Palace Road ‚Äì running from a junction with the 's terminus in Fulham High Street at the north end of Putney Bridge via New King's Road, King's Road, Sloane Square, Lower Sloane Street, Pimlico Road and Buckingham Palace Road to a junction with Route 4 at the junction of Victoria Street and Grosvenor Gardens. * Route 21: Victoria Street, Westminster ‚Äì running from a junction with Route 5 at the north end of Vauxhall Bridge Road via Victoria Street, Broad Sanctuary and Parliament Square to a junction with Route 17 in Parliament Street. * Route 22: Marylebone Road and Euston Road ‚Äì running from a junction with Route 7 at Edgware Road via a proposed new road, Marylebone Road, Euston Road to a junction with the 's terminus at King's Cross station. * Route 23: Finchley Road ‚Äì running from a junction with Route 22 at Upper Baker Street via Park Road, Wellington Road and Finchley Road to a junction with the Middlesex County Council's Light Railways' planned terminus at Childs Hill. With the exception of Route 8 and the southern end of Route 1 and the northern parts of Routes 6 and 23 which crossed the county boundary, all of the routes were in the County of London. =Railways= 1899 Map of railways around central London, showing termini and connecting lines The Report noted that the Commission considered that the purpose of railways was to bring passengers from the residential districts into the urban centre. A survey of traffic usage calculated the estimated total number of journeys for 1903 as 310,662,501 (27,364,209 from the west, 51,838,742 from the north, 89,224,298 from the east, 75,487,731 from the south-east and 66,717,521 from the south- west). Within the urban centre, trams and buses were considered to be the most convenient form of mass transport. The Commission excluded railway goods traffic from its consideration noting only that the distribution of most retail goods within the centre on London was by road as the railways could not compete due to convenience and cost. A desire was expressed that this was better organised to reduce its contribution on traffic congestion, but no solution was proposed. The Report noted that most suburban and long distance passengers arrived at the same termini and that government policy of prohibiting railways from entering central London meant that the many railway companies then in operation had developed a messy network of lines in the periphery to connect to one another. The Report noted that the Commission considered the way in which the termini had been located around the central area and the way that the railway companies' lines had been connected to one another were the main causes of deficiencies in the railways. The Commission set itself three questions with regard to the provision of railways: were additional railways needed in the London area and should they be deep-level, sub-surface or surface lines; were the existing suburban rail services sufficient and was special encouragement or assistance needed for future railway construction. Recommended railway improvements The Report noted that deep-level underground lines under construction (Baker Street and Waterloo Railway, Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway and Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway) or planned would provide additional connections with many of the termini not already connected which would facilitate passengers' onward journeys into the central area. It considered that these new lines would mitigate many of the existing problems, but recommended that connections between north-south and east-west lines be provided and that connections between the suburban networks on the east and west sides of the central area be improved including by way of the Main Avenues proposed for the road and tram improvements. The only new deep-level line recommended was from Victoria station northwards to alleviate what was expected to remain a problem for passengers travelling into the central area. The Report recommended that a north-south line be provided from Victoria to Marble Arch where the approved but unbuilt North West London Railway was to terminate. To improve east-west connections, the Advisory Board recommended connecting Hammersmith to the City of London via Kensington, Piccadilly and the Strand either by an underground railway or as a tramway (Routes 2 and 3 above). The other main recommendation was that construction of railways in London should continue to be funded by private enterprise, but that parliament should provide a favourable system of procedures to encourage bills to be promoted as easily as possible. The commission also recommended that parliament should avoid imposing additional financial burdens on the proposals, such as the cost of reconstructing roads and should allow railway companies to buy land around their proposed new extensions in order to benefit from the increase in land prices and to profit from the new services they provide. =Traffic Board= The Report identified the need for a unified system for the \\"general control of measures affecting locomotion and transport in London\\", but considered it inappropriate for any of the existing authorities within the region to fulfil this role or for it to be established as a committee composed of representatives of the multiple authorities. It, therefore, recommended that a new authority, a \\"Traffic Board\\", be established. The Report recommended that the board partially replace the existing parliamentary process of scrutinising private bills for transport proposals in the Greater London area. The Report's recommendation was that the board should have the powers for: * Control of traffic * Regulation of the opening up of streets * Removal of obstructions to traffic * Provision of new railway lines and tramways * Monitoring of road maintenance by local authorities and identification of failures * Preliminary examination and reporting on of private bills before submission to Parliament * Hold annual sessions and produce an annual report but be generally in continuous operation With regards to the construction of new transport systems, The Report considered that the Traffic Board might function in a similar supervisory capacity to the Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners of New York or the Rapid Transit Commission of Boston. The Report recommended that The Traffic Board should have a chairman and two to three other members. Because of the small number of members, The Report considered nomination by the local authorities within the Greater London area to be inappropriate as not all would be represented. Therefore the board's members should be directly appointed by the government. The costs of the board should be covered by a fees and a levy on the local authorities within the Greater London area paid from the local rates. =Minority reports= Two of the Commission's members issued their own reports; a third member issued an additional recommendation. Bartley felt that the main report did not go far enough in its recommendations and he wanted the full adoption of the Advisory Board's recommendation for the construction of a pair of grand avenues. Dimsdale, rejected the main report's recommendation for tram routes in central London. Gibb's additional recommendation was that part of the route of the then under construction Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway should be merged with a planned route from the Central London Railway to form a looping line. Afterwards The Report's recommendations were acted on in a limited manner. The recommendation for an all-encompassing Traffic Board was not adopted, although the London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee was established in 1924 to oversee road traffic in the London Traffic Area. Amongst the recommendations for road improvements, the new east-west and north-south Main Avenues were not constructed. A number of the proposed road improvements were carried out: * Marylebone Road was extended west to a new junction with Edgware Road in the 1960s in conjunction with the construction of the Marylebone Flyover and the Westway * The Mall was extended to Charing Cross in 1912 when Admiralty Arch was constructed * The western end of Constitution Hill was rearranged when Hyde Park Corner was replanned in the 1960s for the Hyde Park Underpass * The extension of West Cromwell Road and widening of King Street, Hammersmith were dealt with in the 1960s by the construction of the new A4 road starting at West Cromwell Road, including widening of Talgarth Road and construction of the Hammersmith Flyover * The widening or replacement of Brentford High Street was dealt with in the 1920s by the construction of the Great West Road starting at Chiswick * Instead of a viaduct from Waterloo Bridge to Wellington Street the disused Kingsway tramway subway was converted in 1964 to the Strand Underpass connecting northbound traffic from Waterloo Bridge to Kingsway * Marble Arch was widened in the 1960s when Park Lane was widened The tramway system was gradually improved into a more integrated system. By the mid-1910s, the three independent tram companies were owned by the London and Suburban Traction Company which was jointly owned by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) and British Electric Traction. Review and approval of all new railway lines or extensions to existing lines continued to be carried out by parliament. The three underground lines under construction at the time the Commission sat opened in 1906 and 1907 and were owned, along with the District Railway, by the . From 1913, the also controlled the Central London Railway and the City and South London Railway. Extensions of all of the lines were proposed and built during the 1910s to 1930s. From 1910, the also owned the largest bus company in London, the London General Omnibus Company. Consolidation of the mainline railway companies continued and under the Railways Act 1921 they were merged into the Big Four in 1923. Under the London Passenger Transport Act 1933, the , the Metropolitan Railway, the municipal tram operators and all bus operators in the London region were amalgamated under the single control of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1934. Further studies that considered the improvement of traffic in London were carried out. Sir Charles Bressey with Sir Edwin Lutyens considered road improvements in The Highway Development Survey (1938) and Sir Patrick Abercrombie's County of London Plan (1943) and Greater London Plan (1944) included recommendations on rail and road transport.

Estero Bluffs State Park, Calif. Tetraclita rubescens , the pink volcano barnacle, is a species of sessile barnacle in the family Tetraclitidae. T. rubescens is a sessile barnacle with a diameter usually to 30 mm, rarely to 50 mm. Exoskeletal wall consists of four plates with no basal plate (all other local acorn barnacles have 6 plates). The shells of adults are pink to reddish and appear thatched, while the shells of (uneroded) juveniles are white (Morris et al. 1980). Tetraclita rubescens (Darwin 1854) UC Santa Cruz MARINe database, accessed 5/14/2020 Habitat and Geographic Range Common in middle to low intertidal zones on rocks exposed to strong surf from Cape Mendocino, Northern California to Baja California (Carlton 2007). Natural History Volcano barnacle, Channel Islands National Park Thatched barnacles are usually found growing as solitary individuals rather than in aggregations, like acorn barnacles (Engle and Davis 1996). Thatched barnacles are brooders, and do not become reproductive until they are about 2 years old (18mm in diameter). In California, as many as 3 broods of 1,000-50,000 nauplius larvae (depending on parent size) can be released by an individual in one summer (Morris et al. 1980). Tetraclita rubescens may live as long as 15 years (Hines 1978). These barnacles are effective competitors for space, and may influence the distribution of mussels and other species (Foster et al. 1988). In the lower intertidal zone, individuals may grow large enough to avoid predation by sea stars and gastropods (Morris et al. 1980). Up until the 1990s the northern range limit was thought to be San Francisco; however; more recent studies have placed the northern limit several hundred kilometers farther north into Northern California (Connolly and Roughgarden 1998), possibly in response to global climate change (Dawson et al. 2010).

His reign is omitted from the Rajmala, the royal chronicle of Tripura, though a copper plate produced in 1488 which is inscribed with his name provides a timeframe for his rule. It is also believed that the Rajmala confused Vijaya with his more famous relative of the same name, Vijaya Manikya II, conflicting some details of his life with the latter. He appears to have spent his reign under the control of his maternal uncle, the army chief Daityanarayan, who was the true power in the kingdom. The latter also had his daughter married to the young king. However, Vijaya seems to have only held the throne briefly and died young, with the coinage minted the following year bearing the name of Pratap's younger brother Mukut Manikya.

He joined the Mexican Army in 1987, specializing in explosives, martial arts and grenade launchers. In 1999, he deserted the military and joined the Gulf Cartel under kingpin Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, becoming one of the first members of its newly formed paramilitary wing, Los Zetas. Like Guerrero Reyes, most of the first members of Los Zetas were ex- military. Los Zetas was responsible for providing security services to C√°rdenas Guill√©n and carrying out executions on the cartel's behalf. Known for his arrogance and violent behavior, Guerrero Reyes was a suspect in multiple murders, including those of his girlfriend and wife. Investigators suspect he was part of the commando group that assassinated kingpin Edelio L√≥pez Falc√≥n. Guerrero Reyes was also an instructor to new Zetas members, training them in combat and counter-insurgency. In 2004, he was killed in a drive-by shooting by unknown assailants along with four other people after he left a discotheque in Matamoros. His murder remains unsolved; it is not known if he was killed by his own cartel or by rival gangsters. Early life and career Guerrero Reyes joined the Mexican Army on 1 March 1987, as an infantry soldier in the 70th Infantry Battalion. From 11 April to 17 June 1989, he served as a paratrooper in the Parachute Rifle Brigade (BFP). In the BFP, he became a specialist in explosives, martial arts and grenade launchers. Guerrero Reyes was promoted to the rank of corporal in the infantry division on 1 November 1990 and was assigned to lead a small squadron of five soldiers. On 1 March 1992, he was promoted to second degree sergeant. Guerrero Reyes reportedly received military and counter-drug training in the United States. He also received special forces training as a member of the elite Grupo Aerom√≥vil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE). In addition to his military duties, he was also assigned to work temporarily in the National Counter-Narcotics Institute (INCD). He deserted from the military on 4 January 1999. After this, Guerrero Reyes joined the Gulf Cartel, a criminal group based in Tamaulipas. He became a member of the cartel's newly created paramilitary group, Los Zetas, which was largely composed of ex-commandos. He was hired to work for the cartel boss Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, and was assigned under Zetas leader Arturo Guzm√°n Decena (\\"Z-1\\"). When Guerrero Reyes joined Los Zetas, the group's purpose was to provide security services to C√°rdenas Guill√©n and conduct executions for the cartel. Over the years, Los Zetas underwent organizational changes and became increasingly involved in other criminal activities alongside the Gulf Cartel, including drug trafficking. With the collaboration of several Gulf Cartel and Zetas members, Guerrero Reyes forged alliances with South American drug suppliers like Andrea Posada Williamson, Rub√©n Dar√≠o Nieto Benjumea, Elkin Fernando Cano Villa and Edwin Torrado. In the cartel, Guerrero Reyes went by the alias \\"El Guerrero\\" (English: The Warrior), which derived from his surname Guerrero, and as \\"Beto\\", derived from his middle name, Alberto. He also held the code names of \\"Z-5\\" and \\"Z12-HK44\\". Guerrero Reyes is cited as one of the founding members of Los Zetas. He was reportedly part of the Grupo de los 14 (English: Group of 14), who were the first fourteen Zetas members. He was based out of Matamoros. According to the testimony of Agust√≠n Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez, a close associate of C√°rdenas Guill√©n, who later became a protected witness under the code name \\"Rafael\\", Guerrero Reyes was also an instructor for new Zetas recruits. Under the instruction of Guzm√°n Decena, Guerrero Reyes and former Army lieutenant Carlos Hau Casta√±eda led Los Zetas's first training course at a farm known as Punta Selva in Matamoros. Guerrero Reyes provided instruction on how to use AK-47s, AR-15s with grenade launchers, and .50-calibre machine guns. He also taught how to conduct ambushes, rapid deployments, prisoner rescues, counter-insurgencies, intelligence gathering, marksmanship, aerial assault tactics, surveillance, and advanced communication techniques. The course included an intimidation tactics class and rigorous physical fitness tests. The training program lasted about a month. These sessions in Matamoros lasted until September 2001, when C√°rdenas Guill√©n ordered them to be moved to Nuevo Le√≥n and other parts of Tamaulipas. Guerrero Reyes was also reportedly responsible for participating in two prison breaks in Tamaulipas and Michoac√°n. The first one occurred in Matamoros on 27 December 2002, when approximately fifty Zetas members stormed the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 3 (\\"Noroeste\\") and released four inmates linked to the Gulf Cartel. Investigators stated that the Zetas went into the prison dressed in police uniforms and driving vehicles similar to those from the Army. Once inside the prison, they identified themselves as federal officers and showed the prison staff a forged document ordering the release of four individuals. When the staff reviewed the document, they were disarmed by the gunmen, who then forcibly retrieved the four prisoners. The second incident occurred in Apatzing√°n on 4 January 2004, when approximately forty Zetas members stormed the penitentiary to release five imprisoned Gulf Cartel members linked to Carlos Rosales Mendoza (\\"El T√≠sico\\"). They entered the prison wearing police uniforms and simulated carrying out a routine inspection. Once inside the prison, they overwhelmed the guards and penetrated the security doors. During the raid, around twenty other inmates managed to escape. = Criminal charges = On 18 June 2003, Mexico's Attorney General's Office (PGR) placed an unspecified bounty on 31 members of Los Zetas, including Guerrero Reyes. Authorities stated that he was \\"highly dangerous\\" given his military background and his suspected role in homicides, drug trafficking, kidnappings, and carjackings. This announcement was made after the Specialized Unit Against Organized Crime (UEDO) identified him as a high- ranking member of Los Zetas following the 14 March 2003 arrest of C√°rdenas Guill√©n. Unlike other Zetas members who voluntarily requested their release from the military, Guerrero Reyes had deserted and joined organized crime, which is considered high treason in a military court. Guerrero Reyes was wanted by the PGR, the Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA) and the Secretariat of Public Security (SSP) for his outstanding charges. Known for his arrogance and violent behavior, Guerrero Reyes had an arrest warrant issued for his suspected involvement in multiple killings from 12 February to 10 March 2003. He was suspected of killing his girlfriend Erica Edith Gonz√°lez, who was found dead in the rural community of La Venada along with two other people, and of his wife Jovanna Lizbeth Melchor Ceballos, who was killed with another man. According to the PGR and SEDENA, Guerrero Reyes was also a main suspect in the murder of kingpin Edelio L√≥pez Falc√≥n (\\"El Yeyo\\"). L√≥pez Falc√≥n was a former member of the Gulf Cartel, but left to join a rival criminal group after he encountered differences with the cartel after senior cartel member Gilberto Garc√≠a Mena was arrested in 2001. Several within the cartel blamed L√≥pez Falc√≥n for his arrest. C√°rdenas Guill√©n reportedly commissioned Guerrero Reyes and others, including Zetas members Jes√∫s Enrique Rej√≥n Aguilar (\\"El Mamito\\"), Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano (\\"El Lazca\\") and/or √ìscar Guerrero Silva (\\"El Winniepooh\\"), to execute him. L√≥pez Falc√≥n was killed inside a restaurant on 6 May 2003.  Death  At around 4:30 a.m. on 10 May 2004, Guerrero Reyes was killed by unknown assailants in a drive-by shooting in Matamoros. The attack occurred before dawn near the Wild West discotheque while Guerrero Reyes was inside a silver Jeep Liberty between Michoac√°n and 16 de Septiembre streets in Colonia Modelo, an industrial neighborhood. Guerrero Reyes had just left the discotheque and was described by authorities as a regular in strip clubs and night clubs in Matamoros. Besides Guerrero Reyes, four other people were killed. One of them was Leonardo Garc√≠a Gonz√°lez, a former Matamoros Municipal Police officer and alleged cartel member. The other victims were female and identified as Perla Lourdes Garc√≠a Torres, Rosa Isela Purata C√°rdenas and Nancy L√≥pez Gonz√°lez. Four of them died at the scene, but the last one was taken alive to the Dr. Alfredo Pumarejo Hospital, where she eventually succumbed to her wounds. The victims' ages and addresses were not revealed to the press. Neighbors and witnesses stated that the shootout lasted between three and five minutes. One resident stated that at first he thought the noise was caused by the muffler of a vehicle, but as the attack progressed, he realized it was a shootout. The Mexican Federal Police arrived at the scene along with the Tamaulipas State Police and municipal police officers. Onlookers arrived at the scene to observe the aftermath hours later. Investigators discovered that Garcia's corpse was holding a grenade in his hand. Guerrero Reyes was wearing a grenade as a necklace. Matamoros fire fighters and bomb specialists were called to the scene to remove the grenades from Garcia's hand and from Guerrero Reyes' corpse. They were able to remove it without causing a detonation, but it took them around eight hours to defuse Guerrero Reyes's grenade. The vehicle was hit over 100 times with automatic and semi-automatic firearms; many made it through the windshield. Inside the vehicle, the police found two handguns and a machine gun. The vehicle was sent to the Tamaulipas State Police headquarters in southern Matamoros for further investigation. Near the crime scene, the police arrested Jos√© Jes√∫s Quintanilla (aged 19). He was driving a white Ford Mustang that authorities suspected was used by the shooters as a getaway vehicle. The vehicle was also taken to the state police headquarters. A police officer identified Quintanilla as a local customs broker; authorities did not reveal what charges he was arrested for, but they did confirm that he was captured for driving the vehicle that was presumably used by the assassins. It was later revealed that Guerrero Reyes was killed by four unidentified hitmen who carried out the attack in a white taxi. The motive behind the attack was not revealed, and state police chief Arturo Pedroza Aguirre said it was too early to determine if a drug cartel was involved. However, Mexican investigators not authorized to speak with the press stated that it was organized crime-related. U.S. and Mexican authorities did not confirm if the attack was carried out by the Gulf Cartel or conducted by a rival gang which had sprung up in high numbers after the arrest of C√°rdenas Guill√©n. Guerrero Reyes's code name Z-5 was vacated after his death and taken by Zetas member Braulio Arellano Dom√≠nguez, who initially held the code name Z-20.

He is engaged in Alternative for Germany state organization of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.  Property-business  Steinbeck is natively from Hamburg and lives in Southern Mecklenburg. He owns several properties in L√ºbtheen in southern Mecklenburg. He lives in his manor- house Jessenitz (Herrenhaus); he rents at least ten more houses. In the Volkshaus L√ºbtheen bought by Steinbeck in 2008, an AfD district party conference took place in December 2016, and his Herrenhaus had previously been used for a party event.  Right-wing politics and patronage  Steinbeck is considered to be well networked in the right-wing scene and as a puller for the right wing faction of AfD in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. He made contacts from the AfD to the far-right nationalistic Nationaldemocratic Party of Germany (NPD). Steinbeck worked in the 1990s for the parliamentary group of the right-wing extremist party German League for People and Homeland in Schleswig-Holstein. He and his business partner Christian Sch√∂ppe were members of the Hamburg fraternity Hansea until 2008. Both were known to the Hamburg intelligence agency as actors in right-wing circles. Steinbeck also had well contacts to the NPD, such as the former NPD Federal Chairman Udo Past√∂rs. Steinbeck was on a donation list of the NPD in 2011.Reiko Pinkert, Andrea R√∂pke, Peter Burghardt: . In: . 30. August 2016, ISSN 0174-4917 (sueddeutsche.de [checked June 24, 2019]). Steinbeck has been involved in the AfD since 2015. He was active for them in the state election campaign, but has so far not run for any position in the party. Right-wing AfD politicians like Dennis Augustin were supported by Steinbeck. Augustin ran for 4th place on the AfD state list in the 2017 federal election, but failed to enter state- parlament. Augustin was considered the preferred candidate Steinbeck. In November 2018, Steinbeck appeared as a speaker at a joint demonstration by the NPD, AfD and Reichsb√ºrger.  \\"Castle-group\\"  About 2017 Steinbeck and others founded in the Herrenhaus a AfD-internal group referring to medieval crusaders with an Islamophobic attitude. Accordingly, the group has existed for around two years and its members wear small red crosses on the lapels of their suits. The symbol apparently refers to the Santiago Order of battle, which existed in the Middle Ages and fought in the Reconquista to recapture the Iberian Peninsula. The Christian struggle against the Islamic occupiers. Party members report that the castle group is said to have had several influences on the fate of the AfD state association in recent years. Merely because of their mere membership, the crusaders are able to influence personnel elections in their sense. This had been achieved, for example, when in November 2017 the almost certain election of today's AfD Bundestag member Enrico Komning as the second state chairman alongside Leif-Erik Holm was prevented - instead, the party congress at that time chose the previously largely unknown Dennis Augustin.

After the end of the Spanish Civil War, the government of General Franco decided to build a defensive line in the Pyrenees, that would go from the Mediterranean to the Cantabrian Sea, approximately of fortified defensive points, stretching up to a depth of from the border. Some 8,000 ‚Äì 10,000 bunkers were planned, of which approximately half were completed. Their garrison would have theoretically consist of about 75,000 men. There is no evidence that it was ever fully armed and operational. The defensive points of the L√≠nea P and its access roads were built by war prisoners and jailed political opponents of the Francoist regime grouped in (Workers‚Äô Battalions) immediately after the end of the Spanish Civil War and from 1940 to December 1942, in (Disciplinary Battalions of Workers-Soldiers) In a broader sense, L√≠nea P also refers to the successive Pyrenean fortifications built after the Spanish Civil War that would previous fortifications (1939‚Äì1940), the counter-tank defense (1950‚Äì1954) and other fortifications, such as those at Cape Higuer in Fuenterrab√≠a, Guip√∫zcoa finished in 1957. The L√≠nea P was definitively abandoned after the Spanish army performed its last inspection in the 1980s.  Origin of the name  Military historians often refer to this line of defensive fortifications along the French border as the \\"P Line\\" or the Pyrenees Line, in analogy with the French Maginot Line or the German Siegfried Line. However, at no time does \\"L√≠nea P\\" appear in the official Spanish military archives. The L√≠nea P was also known pejoratively as \\"P√©rez Line\\" and, in Catalonia, as the \\"Guti√©rrez Line\\". However, the origin of such denominations have not been convincingly explained so far. It was also known in Catalonia as the \\"Garc√≠a Line\\", named after General Rafael Garc√≠a Vali√±o who participated in the fighting against the Valle de Aran's invasion by the Spanish Maquis.  History  After the end of the Spanish Civil War, hundreds of thousands of Republican soldiers and civilians crossed the French border ahead of the advancing Nationalist troops. Many Republican soldiers settled in the mountains of the Pyrenees and the Spanish Republican government in exile was formed in France. They continued to fight against Francoist Spain until the early 1960s, carrying out sabotage, robberies to help fund guerrilla activity, occupations of Spanish embassies in France and assassinations of Francoists, as well as contributing to the fight against Nazi Germany and the Vichy regime in France during World War II. Following the Allied landing in French North Africa, Nazi Germany carried out \\"Operation Anton\\" on 11 November 1942, invading the southern zone of France for fear of a landing on the French Mediterranean coast. Beginning 1943, Nazi Germany started to build a line of fortifications in the Pyrenees, called , from Cerbere to Hendaye, along Le Perthus, Maurell√†s, Las Illas, Prats-de- Mollo-la-Preste and the French Cerdagne and built coastal batteries in Le Barcar√®s, Torreilles, Sainte-Marie-la-Mer, Collioure et Port-Vendres which became part of the S√ºdwall. In August 1944, the liberation of France entered a decisive phase with the liberation of Toulouse and the south of France, giving the Spanish border a special significance. Neither General Franco nor Nazi Germany could ever manage to close the border effectively, as alternative routes to the usual ones were sought to cross it. The exiled Republicans had high hopes that at the end of World War II in Europe, Franco would be removed from power by the victorious Allies and that they would be able to return to Spain. The (J.E.L.) in Mexico was first formed in November 1943, in an attempt to build a national committee inspired by the French Committee of National Liberation, and in Toulouse in August 1944. The French provisional government was in a difficult situation in the autumn of 1944. While the war against Nazi Germany was continuing in the north of France, large areas of the liberated territory were not under its direct control and were in practice controlled by the Resistance and other guerrilla groups. Therefore, when Charles de Gaulle, head of the French provisional government, traveled to Toulouse on 16 September 1944 to pay tribute to the French Resistance and Spanish republican fighters that liberated Toulouse, the real objective of De Gaulle's visit was to bring Toulouse under the control of the French state. It was not in De Gaulle's best interest the Spanish republicans opened a second front in the Pyrenees and expressed his disagreement with any attempt to cross the Spanish border and return to the maquis. The Spanish Maquis and exiled members of the Partido Comunista de Espana (PCE) started on 19 October 1944 the Invasion of Val d'Aran, known under the code name \\"Operation Reconquest of Spain\\" ().

Editorial Temas de Hoy, Madrid, 2001. guerrillas, well equipped and with heavy weapons, entered Spanish territory through Val d'Aran and other parts of the Pyrenees. The objective of the offensive was to retake the sector of Spanish territory comprising the land between the Cinca and Segre Rivers and the French border. The zone was later declared conquered by the Spanish Republican government in exile to provoke a general uprising against Franco throughout Spain. It was hoped that it would force the Allies to \\"liberate\\" Spain the same way it was \\"liberating\\" the rest of Europe and that it would make the Spaniards who were against the regime revolt to end General Franco's dictatorship. The main attack in the valley was accompanied by operations in other valleys of the Pyrenees during the previous weeks to distract Franco's forces. These other attacks were intended also to evaluate the situation in the interior of Spain and make contact with other groups of exiles. The most important points of penetration in the long chain of mountains were Roncesvalles, Roncal, Hecho, Canfranc, Val d'Aran, Andorra, and Cerdanya, though there were also operations at smaller points. The offensives were repelled by a great force that was moved into the area by Franco, made up of the Civil Guard, Armed Police Corps, battalions of the Spanish Army, and 40,000 Moroccan (Army of Africa) troops. The invasion of the Val d'Aran ended on 28 October 1944 in a complete failure for the Republican side, when the last guerrillas re-crossed the border back into France, without the hoped-for uprising. These attacks forced Franco to prepare for future similar attacks by deciding to fortify the Pyrenees. In 1945, de Gaulle had all the Spanish Republican flags in France removed and definitively disowned the Junta Espa√±ola de Liberaci√≥n. Spanish republicans, after France and the Allies' rejection, were forced into a guerrilla war, known as the Spanish Maquis, and the Spanish Republic government-in-exile faded away to a symbolic role. In an attempt to isolate the Franco regime, F√©lix Gouin, de Gaulle's successor as head of the French provisional government, decided on 26 February 1946 to close the border with Spain on 1 March 1946. On April 18, 1946, Polish ambassador Oskar Lange, supported by the Soviet Union, France and Mexico, asked the United Nations to condemn Spain as an aggressive country based on information that Franco was accumulating troops on the French border and fortifying the Pyrenees, but nobody knew that these works had already begun in 1939 earlier in the whole mountain range. This request was rejected thanks to Sir Alexander Cadogan, the British representative to the UN. Finally, the United States government communicated the results of a survey \\"that the fortifications in the Pyrenees were essentially defensive\\". On December 12, 1946, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 39, which excluded the Spanish government from international organizations and conferences established by the United Nations. However, the Cold War caused the US government to change its attitude towards Francoist Spain, considering that Spain, due to its geographical situation and anti-communist government, would be a valuable asset to the so-called \\"free world\\" plans. Under these conditions, Spain was gaining sympathy among several member countries of the UN. In January 1950, Secretary of State Dean Acheson admitted that the Resolution 39 had been a failure, mentioning that the government was able to support a resolution that would end both issues. On 4 November 1950, the UN General Assembly adopted resolution 386, repealing the recommendation that prevented Spain from being a member of the International agencies established or linked by the United Nations. This resolution paved the way for Spain to join the United Nations system, which began in 1951 with the incorporation of UN agencies such as UPU, ITU, FAO and WHO, and completed with the accession of Spain to the United Nations in 1955.  Construction  Machine gun position at C.R. 76 in La Guingueta d'√Äneu. The nationalist dictatorship of Franco thought of landscapes and mountain ranges as an integral part of the Spanish nation. The Spanish army was convinced at the end of the 1930s that fortifications in the Pyrenees could stop an army from entering through one of the mountain passes into Spain. Fortified defense lines were typical of Europe before World War II in the style of the Maginot, Siegfried, Mannerheim, Metax√°s Lines. In 1936, months before the Civil war, cavalry commander Sanju√°n Ca√±ete published a book on the Pyrenean border giving indications of possible defensive works to be done. More specifically Sanju√°n Ca√±ete carried out a detailed analysis of the network of trails and roads on the Pyrenees, adding considerations and proposals of a strategic nature. The thoroughness of this study was of great importance for the establishment of the bases of future defensive systems in the Pyrenees. Since September 1940 there had been plans to fortify the Eastern Pyrenees (Catalonia) in the event of a possible invasion through Le Perthus with motorized troops. The plans were finalized in 1943. In August 1944, the Spanish Chief of Staff signed Instruction C-15 ordering the fortifications of the Pyrenees. The border area was to be divided into three sectors: Eastern Pyrenees (Catalonia), Central Pyrenees (Aragon) and Western Pyrenees (Navarra and Basque Country). Fortifications had not only to become part of the landscape but also to take advantage of the protection offered by nature. Defensive points were to be excavated in the rock and concealed with camouflage. Started in the autumn of 1944, the construction of the L√≠nea P was entrusted to the former military regions IV ( Catalonia and Valencia), V (Arag√≥n and Soria) and VI (Navarra, Pa√≠s Vasco, Santander, Burgos, and Logro√±o) that bordered France. A large number of means and men (essentially conscript soldiers and forced labor) were mobilized for its construction. To coordinate and carry out these building works, a center of operations was chosen within each zone to be fortified. In recent years, research has been published on the links between these works and the network of Francoist concentration camps. Every sector was subdivided in Centers of Resistance ( in Spanish, N.R.), which, in turn, included a large number of defensive points with reinforced concrete bunkers. This centers of resistance were intended to cover the main lines of penetrations, inside Spanish territory, while capable of defending themselves autonomously. Spanish military strategists needed also to compensate for the defensive weaknesses of the two extremities of the Pyrenees: the Basque Country and Navarra in the west and Catalonia in the east. The fortification efforts were determined by the topography of the Pyrenees. Consequently, no less than 100 Centers of Resistance were built in Catalonia, 56 in the Basque Country and Navarra and 20 in Arag√≥n. Each Center of Resistance had a large number of defense points grouped in support points, and these in turn in Units and they in Sub-Units. The defense points would typically house a machine gun, an anti-tank gun, an infantry cannon, an anti-aircraft gun, a 81 mm mortar or a 50 mm mortar. Observatories were also built, as well as shelters and ammunition or food stores. The original plan was that each defense point would be surrounded by trenches with a shooter's well placed at each end. The whole complex would be surrounded by a wire fence. The Francoist project for the 500-km fortified line across the Pyrenees consisted of some 8,000 ‚Äì 10,000 defensive points of which approximately half were built, stretching up to a depth of from the border. Their garrison would have theoretically consist of about 75,000 men. In spite of the effort made in its construction, there is no evidence that it was ever fully operational and armed, nor the armored doors that were manufactured to close the bunkers were placed or the barbed wire fences were deployed. The wire fences and armored doors that were produced to protect these settlements remained in storage in Figueras, Pamplona, and Jaca and eventually sent to the Spanish Sahara. Even if the works on the defensive were never finished, several military inspections took place over the years to check the settlements, as the military command considered these works to be strategic in the military defense of the national territory. The last inspection of these fortifications in the valley of the Arag√≥n River date from 1986. The integration of Spain into the then European Economic Community and NATO in 1986 lead to the definitive abandonment of the Pyrenean fortification line as a defensive military infrastructure, becoming, in some cases, another tourist attraction in the Pyrenees. = The L√≠nea P in the Basque Country and Navarra = Burguetealt= When the Third Carlist War ended in 1876, the Spanish military authorities came with an ambitious plan to defend the French border in the central and western Pyrenees. Around Irun, a group of defensive forts was proposed and the construction of the (Entrenched camp at Oyarzun) started. Six forts were planned to form the first line of defense around Irun and another two would form a second line of defense, which could be used to defend San Sebasti√°n and the port of Pasajes. Economic problems and military obsolescence led to the cancellation of the project. Only the forts of San Marcos (1888), Txoritokieta (1890) and Guadalupe (1900) on the Jaizkibel mountain range were finally built. Between June 1939 and June 1940, a remarkable group of fortifications, known as the \\"Vallesp√≠n Fortification\\", was built in the western Pyrenees, stretching from Guip√∫zcoa to Navarra. It was named after the colonel Jos√© Vallesp√≠n who designed them. When its construction ended in 1940, the construction of the roads around it continued. These fortifications were later partially integrated into the L√≠nea P. Entrance to the Alkurruntz fortress (Navarre, Spain) In Guip√∫zcoa and Navarra, 2,900 defensive points were planned and 1,800 completed. The Center of Resistance N.R. 245 was built next to the fort of Guadeloupe on the Jaizkibel mountain range. With a total of 59 bunkers initially planned, 16 defensive points for machine guns and 27 for automatic weapons were completed. The valleys of the Baztan river and the Bidasoa river in Bera were also heavily fortified. Grouped in (Workers‚Äô Battalions) and from 1940 to December 1942, in (Disciplinary Battalions of Workers-Soldiers), prisoners were used to building defensive points of the L√≠nea P and its access roads. Between 1939 and 1945, over 21,000 prisoners carried out fortification and road construction works in Navarra, in Gipuzkoa, and to a lesser extent in Bizkaia, with the coastal fortifications between Getxo and Gorliz. = The L√≠nea P in Arag√≥n = In Arag√≥n, the Spanish army built 20 centers of Resistance, divided into five sectors. Arag√≥n was the region with the lowest density of Centers of Resistance, probably since in many parts, the mountains are over 2,500 meters above sea level, which makes most of the region inaccessible. Numbered from N.R. 101 to N.R. 120, they covered the whole of the Arag√≥nese Pyrenees from the valley of Zuriza to the border with L√©rida. In the Alto G√°llego they were called from north to south: N.R. 110 \\"El Furco\\", N.R. 109 \\"Sallent\\", N.R. 108 \\"Las Grampas\\", N.R. 107 \\"Panticosa\\", N.R. 106 \\"Hoz\\" and N.R. 120 \\"Biescas\\". Centers of Resistance could house more than fifty defensive works, depending on their importance. In the Valley of the Arag√≥n River, the Canfranc railway station was chosen for the center of operations because of its central location. This was the place where the carpentry work was carried out and the construction material stored. At the same time, it served as a place to lodge the soldiers who worked there. From this point, everything was taken to the construction sites. In many cases part of the transport was done by mules, arriving in up to six hours to the destination, such as the Center of Resistance N.R. 114 in La Raca, Canfranc. = The L√≠nea P in Catalonia = The region of Cerdanya was considered of high strategic value and therefore concentrated a large number of defensive points and bunkers built to stop an intrusion at one of the most important penetration routes through the Pyrenees. Every twelve or sixteen kilometers of border, four centers of resistance were built to allow an effective defense against a possible frontal attack but have also thought to protect against flank attacks.  Preservation and restoration  The very nature of the project has led to almost 80% of the military archives being classified as restricted, confidential or secret. Their accessibility is therefore subject to the provisions of the Spanish Historical Heritage Law and the Military Archives Regulations of 1998 and the Spanish Law on Official Secrets. As a consequence, the Francoist fortification of the Pyrenees began only to attract the attention of scholars in the mid of 1990s. After years left unattended, different restoration works were started in various sections of the line during the mid-2000s. In 2007, the Park of bunkers of Montell√† i Martinet was the first initiative to present a center of resistance (N.R. 52) to the general public and the period in which they were built. In Canfranc, the center of resistance N.R. 111 \\"Ara√±ones\\" (sector 24) was restored in 2008. N.R. 111 was made up of 13 fortified defensive points located in the southern area of the Paseo de los Melanc√≥licos in Canfranc. Its objective was to defend the Canfranc International railway station and the southern access tunnel to Spain. The largest bunkers are fitted out as shelters for pilgrims and mountaineers. On September 12, 2010, a marked outdoor itinerary was inaugurated in La Guingueta d'√Äneu, consisting of a walk in the valley of the Noguera Pallaresa river, on the shore of the reservoir of La Torrassa, to visit four bunkers belonging to the center of resistance N.R. 76. On 8 January 2011, the \\"Route of the Bunkers\\" was inaugurated in the municipality of Biescas (Huesca). The route starts from the low battery of the fort of Santa Elena and some settlements belonging to the Center of Resistance 106 (Hoz de Jaca) can be visited.

Creation and structure The Wassila network was created in October 2000, near the end of the Algerian Civil War, a context within which women's rights were under attack both practically and legally. The network is named after a girl called Wassila who was adopted and abandoned and became a single mother. In 2011, the network included 28 citizens' associations and institutions. Member groups in 2013 included SOS Children's Villages, Atustep, Tharwa Fadhma n‚ÄôSoumer, the Association pour l'√©mancipation des femmes, Sarp, Amusnaw, Djaza√Ørouna, medical and mental health professionals, lawyers and human rights activists. Aims The Wassila network aims to obtain equal rights for women both in the legal system and in fighting against rape and other violence against women, including \\"massive marital violence\\". The network also handles sexual abuse of children. According to the Wassila network, 80% of its documented cases concern violence within the home. Actions The Wassila network published a \\"White paper of testimonies\\" of women victims of violence. According to the network, immolation, torture and murder became commonplace against Algerian women. The network has three branches of action: developing practical help for victims (including a telephone support helpline and legal aid), training of medical, legal and media personnel, and legal approaches (include criminal law against sexual violence). The network received between 800 and 2000 calls for help on its telephone helpline during 2011‚Äì2013. The Wassila network published a statement following the \\"punitive expedition\\" attacks on women workers in Hassi Messaoud, known for the 2001 Hassi Messaoud mob attacks against women. The network stated that neither local nor national authorities protected the women from a systematic pattern of violence. =Hirak= On 16 March 2019, during the \\"Hirak\\" 2019 Algerian protests, Saadia Gacem and Fa√Øka Medjahed, members of the Wassila network, together with other women, signed a declaration establishing Femmes alg√©riennes pour un changement vers l'√©galit√© (Algerian women for a shift towards equality), calling for \\"full and complete equality between female and male citizens, without distinction of gender, class, regional origin of beliefs\\", announcing the creation of a \\"feminist square which will be located each Friday in front of the main gate of the Algiers 1 University starting from 13:00\\" and calling for \\"taking into account equal representation of women in any citizens' initiative aiming to solve\\" the issues of the Hirak protests. Later during the Hirak protests, an alliance of trade unions, citizens' groups and individuals, the Dynamiques de la soci√©t√© civile, was created in a meeting on 15 June 2019, with the aim of coordinating with other Algerian citizens' networks in fundamentally reorganising the Algerian state. The Wassila network withdrew from the 15 June conference, on the grounds that the meeting \\"'did not stated clearly and unambiguously the fundamental and non-negotiable political principle of equality between men and women.

Ahmed attended Government High School in village Mona which is also located in Mandi Bahaudduin district, that is where he passed his metriculation exam. In 1976, he gained his Faculty of Arts degree from Government Degree College located in Bhalwal. For Bachelor of Arts, he attended Government Degree College in Sargodha and got his degree in 1978. In 1984, he got his LLB from Federal Law College located in Islamabad, an institution affiliated with University of the Punjab. Judicial career In 1985, he started legal practice as an advocate and became member of Rawalpindi's District Bar Association. In 1987, he started practicing as an advocate in the high court and continued as a lawyer until 1998. On 2 January 1999, he was elevated to an Additional District and Sessions Judge (AD&SJ;) post in Multan. After Multan, he had dispensed his duties as AD&SJ; in Okara, Dipalpur, Sargodha, and Narowal. In February 2007, he became District and Sessions Judge (D&SJ;) and remained Special Judge for anti-corruption in Bahawalpur for three years then he was transferred to Rajanpur as D&SJ.; Then, he was posted as Special Judge for Anti-Terrorism Court Number 1 in Gujranwala, then again as D&SJ; in Toba Tek Singh.

Notable decisions In an unprecedented decision on 24 December 2019, Ahmed issued the bail to Rana Sanaullah who was arrested by Anti Narcotics Force (ANF), a body associated with Pakistani military and headed by active duty military officers. ANF officers claimed that they recovered 15 kilograms of heroin from Sanaullah. Possession of over 10 kilograms of heroin carries a death penalty in Pakistan and is considered a non-bailable offence. Ahmed issued his detailed judgement in this case on 26 December 2019. In the detailed judgement, Ahmed noted the reasons for granting the bail to Sanaullah, he noted that accused accomplices of Sanaullah were granted bail by the trial court while Sanaullah was not granted the same. He noted that ANF did not file an appeal in Lahore High Court for cancellation of the bail to accused accomplices of Sanaullah. Ahmed also noted that ANF did not request the physical remand of Sanaullah for further investigation into the matter. He also noted the possible \\"political victimization\\" for Sanaullah's arrest as he belonged to the opposition Pakistan Muslim League (N) and was very vocal in criticism of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf led government. Ahmed also noted that there was no recovery memo prepared by ANF at the time of recovery.

Polychrome majolica dish with paintings of a fish, flowers and fruit. Lodi, 1751.  History  = From the origins to the 17th century = The production of ceramic in the Lodi region has ancient origins. Findings include fragments from pre-historic period and amphoras, little votive statues and lamps decorated in relief from the Roman period. A large production of terracotta for architectural decorations was developed in the 14th century, such as in the facades of the churches of Lodi, and in particular in the ornaments of the cloister of the Ospedale Maggiore, in the decorations of Palazzo Mozzanica, and in Piazza Broletto and Piazza Mercato. The first written documents testifying to the presence of furnaces in the Lodi area date back to the 16th century and then to the 17th century. The production of ceramics had little economic importance. This was due to the little dimension of the local market, which mostly required ceramics for ordinary use; moreover the production of ceramics was hindered by the many taxes, both on the import of the raw material, the earth from Stradella, and on the export of the products. Finally, furnaces could not be built in the city, because of fire risk and the nuisance of fumes. However, the presence of at least 3 furnaces in Lodi in the 17th century is well documented. = 18th and 19th century = Following the war of the Spanish Succession, at the beginning of the 18th century the territory of Lodi was annexed, with the Duchy of Milan, to the realm of the House of Habsburg of Austria. Economic reforms were introduced that boosted economy and trade. In the field of ceramics, many duties on raw materials and exports remained. However a few factories were established in Lodi, including that of Coppellotti, already active in the 17th century, Rossetti and Ferretti. Artists and decorators were able to move more freely than before and this enabled the production of ceramics in Lodi to acquire techniques and decorations from Northern Europe and France, such as a third, lower temperature firing and the B√©rain decoration. In 1796, the battle of Lodi between Napoleon Bonaparte and the Austrian troops marked the decline of ceramic production in Lodi, due both to the material damage suffered by the factories located near the battleground by the Adda river, and to the economic decline during the period of the Napoleonic wars and the following restoration. In 1823 the Ferretti furnace was taken over by Dossena, who managed it as a modern business. Ceramics were no longer handcrafted on commission, but produced to be sold on the market. After a period of relative success, the furnace closed in the late 19th century. Materials and techniques Maiolica stand, Coppellotti factory, 18th century, gran fuoco The main material for the production of ceramics was the earth of Stradella, a clay rich in limestone, which, thanks to its malleability, made the ceramics very thin and light. The main component for the glaze was sand from San Colombano al Lambro, rich in silicon, but tin was also added to the glaze. Tin-glazing made the ceramics uniform. Having a tin based glaze, Lodi ceramics are to be considered maiolica. The firing technique was based on gran fuoco (double firing) or on piccolo fuoco (third firing). =Gran fuoco= The gran fuoco technique, also known as underglaze decoration, was the only one in use until the mid 18th century, but was still used even after the introduction of the piccolo fuoco (third fire) technique around 1750. Two firings were carried out at about 950 ¬∞C. With the first firing, the product was hardened and could then be glazed and painted, with the glaze not fixed yet by the second firing. The colours spread into the un-fired glaze.. Since colours were painted over un-fired glaze, which was porous and absorbent, any errors could not be amended.. Only those colours that could withstand the high temperature of the second firing could be used: manganese for violet, antimony for yellow, iron for a reddish colour, cobalt for blue, copper for green. Cobalt blue tended to spread to the glaze, creating blue hues, and this also happened when it was mixed with yellow to create green. Proper red colour was rare, given the high chances of burning during firing at high temperature. Strong shades of orange or manganese brown were often used instead =Piccolo fuoco= Maiolica dish, Oriental style, Ferretti factory, 1775, piccolo fuoco In the second half of the 18th century the technique of third fire ‚Äì piccolo fuoco, also known as overglaze decoration, was introduced, which made it possible to obtain a greater range of more vibrant colours. After two firings at about 950 ¬∞C, identical to those of the technique of gran fuoco, the glaze, already vitrified, was painted with colours that would have degraded at higher temperature and a third firing was carried out at about 600-650 ¬∞C. The fact that colours were painted on a surface already vitrified meant that errors could be corrected.. One of the new pigments that could be used thanks to the third firing was Purple of Cassius, a red obtained from gold chloride, which made it possible to introduce various shades of red, from pink to purple. The first European factory where the piccolo fuoco technique was developed was that of Paul Hannong in Strasbourg. Antonio Ferretti was one of the first artisans to introduce this technique in Italy  Factories  =Coppellotti= Ceramic dish with fruit decor, underglaze firing, Coppellotti factory, 1740 circa The Coppellotti factory was active from 1641 to the end of the 18th century; the best ceramics date back to the period 1735-1740 and were produced with the gran fuoco technique: plates, centerpieces, teapots, coffeemakers, sugar bowls. Some of the decorative motives were influenced by French ceramics, in particular the decoration known as 'De lambrequins et rayonnants', introduced from Rouen, with arabesques, draperies and geometric-floral compositions arranged in a radial pattern. Most of these ceramics are in turquoise monochrome. There are also many other original polychrome decorations representing fruit, fish, landscapes, castles, peasants, wayfarers, music players, oriental figures, accompanied by animals, such as birds and dogs =Rossetti= The Rossetti factory was active in Lodi between 1729 and 1736.. Rossetti ceramics were fired with the Gran fuoco technique . and most are in monochromatic turquoise. Rossetti excelled in the decoration known as the 'B√©rain' style, which takes its name from the French decorator Jean B√©rain the Elder, with pillars, balustrades, capitals, urns, shells, stylized leaves garlands, divinities and satyrs;.. Some ceramics feature landscapes in the center, with views of cities and castles, hills, lakes, clouds and birds. There are also two examples of polycrome Rossetti ceramics, representing scenes of a lake and a town. =Ferretti= Maiolica dish with flower decoration, overglaze firing, Ferretti factory, 1770-75 The Ferretti factory was active in Lodi in the 18th century until the beginning of the 19th century. At the start of the second half of the eighteenth century, the piccolo fuoco technique was introduced. It is believed that Antonio Ferretti was one of the first to introduce this technique in Italy. The best known decoration of the Ferretti ceramics is the one with naturalistic flowers, with very bright and lively colours, which could be obtained thanks to the piccolo fuoco technique. The most commonly painted flowers were wild flowers, such as forget-me-not, buttercups, Centaurea cyanus, campanula, primroses and dog rose; but also cultivated varieties were represented, such as roses, tulips and carnations.. Other decorations included Chinese and Oriental figures, and some fruit decorations, with the technique of the piccolo fuoco; and still lifes with fruit and fish with the technique of gran fuoco  Museums  Maiolica sugar castor, attributed to Rossetti factory, 1729-36, geometric floral decor in blue, gran fuoco These are some of the museums where Lodi ceramics are on display. * Museo civico di Lodi * Victoria and Albert Museum, London * Mus√©e national Adrien Dubouch√© a Limoges * Mus√©e des Arts d√©coratifs, Strasbourg * Mus√©e national de C√©ramique (S√®vres) * Museo internazionale delle ceramiche in Faenza * Turin City Museum of Ancient Art in Palazzo Madama, Turin * Musei del Castello Sforzesco, Sforza Castle, in Milan * Musei di Strada Nuova, in Genoa * Museo Gianetti, Saronno * Accademia di Belle Arti Tadini, Lovere Notes  Bibliography     Category:Italian pottery Category:Ceramics manufacturers of Italy ","title":"Lodi ceramics"},{"id":"62671763","text":"Mohammad Reza Nasehi Arjomand (, born 4 March 1944) is an Iranian weightlifter.

Following the war, the collection, largely neglected, was stored in the attic of the hospital. In 1973 a conservation effort was undertaken that led to the restoration and cataloguing of the collection.

Altman and Company Building is a commercial building in Midtown Manhattan in New York City, that formerly served as B. Altman and Company's flagship department store. It occupies an entire city block between Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue, 34th Street, and 35th Street, directly opposite the Empire State Building, with a primary address at 355‚Äì371 Fifth Avenue. The B. Altman and Company Building was designed by Trowbridge & Livingston in the Italian Renaissance Revival style. Most of the building is eight stories tall, though the Madison Avenue end rises to thirteen stories. It contains a facade made largely of French limestone, except at the Madison Avenue end, where the ninth through thirteenth stories and most of the Madison Avenue side is faced with white brick. The facade contains a large arcade with a colonnade at its two-story base. Altman's was the first big department store to make the move from the Ladies' Mile shopping district to Fifth Avenue, which at the time was still primarily residential. The building was opened in stages between 1906 and 1914, due to the difficulty in acquiring real estate. The store closed in 1989, and was vacant until 1996, when it was renovated. The building was reconfigured to house the City University of New York's Graduate Center, the New York Public Library's Science, Industry and Business Library, and the Oxford University Press. The B. Altman and Company Building was made a New York City designated landmark in 1985. Site The B. Altman and Company Building occupies a full city block in Midtown Manhattan, bounded by Fifth Avenue on the west, 34th Street on the south, Madison Avenue on the east, and 35th Street on the north. The building's land lot has a total area of ; it measures from north to south and from west to east. Because of the topography of the region, the northern ends of the Fifth and Madison Avenue facades are slightly higher than the southern ends. The B. Altman Building is close to the Empire State Building to the southwest, the Church of the Incarnation to the northeast, the Collectors Club of New York to the east, and the Madison Belmont Building to the southeast. It is one of several former major retail buildings on the surrounding stretch of Fifth Avenue. Within four blocks to the north are the Gorham Building at 390 Fifth Avenue, the Tiffany and Company Building at 401 Fifth Avenue, the Stewart & Company Building at 402 Fifth Avenue, and the Lord & Taylor Building at 424 Fifth Avenue. Design The B. Altman and Company Building was designed by Trowbridge & Livingston in the Italian Renaissance Revival style, and opened in three phases in 1906, 1911, and 1914. The main section on Fifth Avenue, opened in 1906 and expanded in 1911, has its facade designed as an arcade. The Madison Avenue annex, completed in 1914, has more design motifs than the original Fifth Avenue structure and its addition. The majority of the building is eight stories tall, but the Madison Avenue side rises to 13 stories. The original section of the building contained entrances on Fifth Avenue, 34th Street, and 35th Street, while the annex contained two additional entrances on Madison Avenue and 35th Street. = Facade = The structure's facade was generally intended to harmonize with the designs of mansions on Fifth Avenue, which at the time of the building's completion was largely residential. The design, across the street from the grand residence of department-store rival A. T. Stewart and diagonally across the avenue from the residence of Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, was planned to complement the surrounding palatial mansions. The design was characterized in The New York Times as \\"classic\\", using imported French limestone. The B. Altman Building was the first commercial structure in New York City to use the material, which had previously been used only on residential buildings. The four elevations or sides are largely similar to each other. On all sides, the first two floors comprise an arcaded base, the third through sixth floors contain square windows, and the seventh and eighth floors comprise an arched arcade. The Fifth and Madison Avenue facades both contain nine bays, but the Fifth Avenue side is eight stories tall, while the Madison Avenue side is 13 stories. The 34th and 35th Street sides are both seventeen bays wide and are mostly eight stories tall, although the easternmost four bays rise to the thirteenth story. The facade is mostly unchanged from the building's completion, although some spalling in the facade was patched with cast stone, and some design elements were removed or simplified.  Base  On Fifth Avenue, the lowest two stories contain a colonnade with double-height engaged columns in the Ionic order, raised upon pedestals and supporting a plain architrave. The columns are largely plain, except the center four, which are fluted and flank a slightly projecting entrance portico in the center three bays. Inside each bay of the colonnade, the first- and second-floor window openings are separated by horizontal stone architraves. The windows on the first floor are large display windows while those on the second floor are semicircular Diocletian windows. In the entrance portico, small stone steps lead to the doors in each bay, which are located underneath glass turtle-shell canopies. This entrance portico leads to the CUNY Graduate Center. On 34th Street, the first two stories mostly contain rectangular pilasters instead of columns. There is an entrance portico in the sixth, seventh, and eighth bays from west, with fluted columns similar to those on Fifth Avenue, though only the seventh bay has a glass canopy and stone steps. Additionally, on the first story, only the westernmost four bays and the easternmost two bays have display windows, while the other windows are wide rectangular sash windows behind a grille. A service entrance is in the eleventh and twelfth bays from west. The second floor openings are semicircular. The Madison Avenue side contains a colonnade in the center seven bays, supported by engaged plain columns. The outermost bay on either side projects slightly, with rectangular pilasters. The central bay led to the former library entrance. The 35th Street side is similar to, but less elaborate than, the 34th Street side. The westernmost three bays and the easternmost bay contain display windows, while most of the remaining bays contain rectangular sash windows behind a grille. The fourth bay from west contains a metal entrance structure that projects slightly and has a frieze running on top. There is a delivery entrance nearer the Madison Avenue end.  Upper stories  The layout of the third through eighth stories is identical on Fifth Avenue, 34th Street, and 35th Street. The third story has one square-headed opening in each bay and keystones above the windows, as well as a horizontal band course above the windows. The fourth through sixth stories have square-headed openings, with no keystones, and a frieze runs above the sixth floor. The seventh and eighth stories are designed as a double-height arcade, similar to the base; each bay has a square-headed window under a semicircular window, separated by a transom. A heavy cornice runs above the eighth story on Fifth Avenue and on most of the 34th and 35th Street facades. The four eastern bays on 34th and 35th Streets are thirteen stories tall, though the upper five stories are made of brick instead of limestone. The ninth story has two double-hung windows in each bay is topped by a band course. The windows on the tenth and eleventh stories are recessed within a large opening; each set of windows is separated by small cast iron Ionic columns, with architraves above the tenth-story windows and a pair of small arches above the eleventh-story windows. The top two stories contain double- hung windows similar to the ninth story. A band course supported by corbels runs above the twelfth story, and a small cornice runs above the thirteenth story. On Madison Avenue, the outermost bays are faced with limestone up to the eighth story, while the inner bays and the ninth through thirteenth stories are faced with brick. The outer bays are similar in design to the easternmost bays on 34th Street. The inner bays contain double-hung window pairs on the third floor, and triple-height window openings on the fourth through sixth stories. Each of the triple height openings contains a pair of Ionic columns, supporting an architrave and small pediment on the fourth floor; an architrave on the fifth floor; and brackets on the sixth floor. The seventh and eighth floors of the inner bays are designed as an arcade, similarly to on the other elevations, except that it has cast-iron columns and architrave. The ninth through thirteenth floors are the same as on the other elevations. = Features =  B. Altman store  There were 39 elevators in the building when completed: 22 passenger elevators, 10 employee elevators, as well as two massive truck elevators and five smaller private elevators. The building also contained an electric power plant, described as the city's largest. The ventilation system was able to handle intake and exhaust volumes of per minute. To accommodate packages and message deliveries, the building used an extensive system of brass tubing and canvas belting. At ground level, the building had a large entrance rotunda on Fifth Avenue, and open plan selling floors. The rotunda had a glass dome with indirect lighting. The rotunda was replaced with escalators in the 1930s. The interiors had high ceilings: the first floor had a ceiling height of while the second and third floors had ceilings of . When the store opened in 1906, the first through fourth floors were used as selling floors, while the upper floors were used as workshops, offices, and stockrooms. On the third floor, which sold suits and linens, there was a large room with mirrors. The fourth floor had a waiting room with wooden desks and chairs, and telephones. With the opening of the Madison Avenue expansion, the public areas of the store were expanded to the fifth floor, which contained a women's writing room, an information bureau, telephones, and a general store. The eighth floor contained the Charleston Gardens restaurant. The ninth floor contained vaults for fur storage, encased in cork thick. Employees' facilities, including restrooms, dining rooms, and medical aid rooms, were on the twelfth floor.  Current usage  The entrance to the CUNY Graduate Center is on the Fifth Avenue side of the building. Since its refurbishment in the 1990s, the B. Altman Building has been shared by the City University of New York (CUNY)'s Graduate Center and Oxford University Press (OUP). The space of a third occupant, New York Public Library (NYPL), was sold off to several other condominium owners in the 2010s. The Graduate Center is on the Fifth Avenue side of the building. The first through seventh floors contain classrooms, student spaces, and offices. The Mina Rees Library of the Graduate Center occupies parts of the building's first floor, concourse, and second floor. The Graduate Center section of the building contains three performance spaces: the 389-seat Harold M. Proshansky Auditorium on the concourse, the 180-seat Baisley Powell Elebash Recital Hall on the first floor, and the 70-seat Martin E. Segal Theatre on the first floor. The ground floor also houses the Amie and Tony James Gallery. An eighth-floor dining room contains ceilings of as well as a skylight from which the Empire State Building is visible. On the Madison Avenue side of the building, the NYPL occupied an eight-floor condominium spanning from the 1990s. The NYPL condominium was split up into four units in 2012. Prior to 2020, the NYPL's Science, Industry and Business Library (SIBL) occupied five floors in the building, with a research library in the basement, a lobby and circulating library at ground level, and offices on three upper levels. The branch contained various business and training centers, as well as conference rooms and stacks. OUP occupies a five-floor condominium spanning . History Sixth Avenue in the Ladies' Mile shopping district B. Altman and Company originated from a store in the Lower East Side operated by the Altman family. The store was solely owned by Benjamin Altman and was located at Third Avenue and 10th Street by 1865. The residential core of Manhattan, once concentrated in lower Manhattan, moved uptown during the late 19th century. By the 1870s, stores were being established between 14th and 23rd Streets in the Ladies' Mile area, including B. Altman and Company, which opened a store at Sixth Avenue between 18th and 19th Streets. However, the Sixth Avenue location had become undesirable by the end of the 19th century, partially due to the shadows and noise created by the Sixth Avenue elevated line. Altman initially contemplated moving his store to Herald Square, at the northeastern corner of 34th Street and Sixth Avenue, directly across from Macy's Herald Square. He ultimately decided on a site on Fifth Avenue, one block to the east, because of the presence of the Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria hotel at that intersection and because Fifth Avenue was not overshadowed by an elevated line. At the beginning of the 20th century, development was centered on Fifth Avenue north of 34th Street, and many stores on that avenue were situated inside rebuilt 19th-century residences. = New building =  Initial land acquisition  Benjamin Altman began acquiring land for his Fifth Avenue store in 1896, acquiring a four-story building at the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 35th Street. Altman initially did not reveal the purpose of these purchases. He did not make another purchase until 1901, when he was listed as the buyer of a five- story building at 365 Fifth Avenue. Purchases of property on the block accelerated after plans for Pennsylvania Station and Grand Central Terminal, two major transport hubs nearby, were respectively announced in 1902 and 1903. The five-story building at 361 Fifth Avenue was sold in January 1904, and the buyer paid such a high price for the relatively small lot that the Real Estate Record and Guide presumed that the buyer was acting on Altman's behalf. Altman was initially unable to acquire some holdout properties, as many owners \\"declined even to entertain offers\\" and some lessees \\"became as violent obstructionists as the owners themselves\\". However, these individuals did not form any alliances to specifically prevent the building's construction. Plans for the new Altman's flagship building were officially announced in December 1904, after Altman had bought many of the properties on the block. The Real Estate Record at the time characterized Altman's plans as having been \\"an open secret for some years\\". The announcement resulted in an increase in real estate transactions on the surrounding blocks of Fifth Avenue. Trowbridge and Livingston were formally selected as architects the next month. A representative for B. Altman and Company indicated that the Fifth Avenue section of the building would be completed first, followed by the Madison Avenue section. Plans for the building were filed in March 1905, and Marc Eidlitz & Son was hired as general contractor.  Construction and opening  1914 lithograph In April 1905, Altman received a $4.5 million mortgage loan from the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, which covered several properties on the flagship's site. That May, The New York Times reported that the row house at Fifth Avenue and 34th Street was still being leased by art dealer Knoedler. The lease did not expire for \\"five or six more years\\" and negotiations between Knoedler and Altman had reached an impasse. Additionally, there were several incidents during construction. Three workers were killed and several were injured in a December 1905 dynamite explosion, and there was an attempt the same month to sabotage the building's hoisting engines. In January 1906, a worker was killed and six others were injured when a girder fell from the eighth floor. In anticipation of the new store's opening, Altman sold the old Sixth Avenue store in April 1906. The first section of the Fifth Avenue building was opened on October 15, 1906, with entrances on 34th Street, 35th Street, and Fifth Avenue; the previous store on Sixth Avenue was closed at that time. Although the original design entailed building upon Knoedler's holdout lot, the initial section of the building wrapped around the lot. In December 1910, shortly before Knoedler's lease expired, Trowbridge and Livingston filed plans for the second section of the building, to be erected on Knoedler's old lot. The section at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street opened in September 1911. After the second section opened, the building had a floor area of . Altman acquired the lots on Madison Avenue in October 1910 for $1.2 million, after several years of negotiations, rounding out his holdings on the block. The buildings on the site included several townhouses. Trowbridge & Livingston filed plans for the annex in June 1913, which would expand the building's floor area to . By the time Benjamin Altman died in October 1913, the buildings on Madison Avenue were being torn down for the construction of the B. Altman Building's final section. In his will, Altman bequeathed all of his property (including the Fifth Avenue store) to his company, of which all capital stock was to be held by the Altman Foundation, essentially transferring the building to the foundation. The final section on Madison Avenue opened on October 5, 1914. = Flagship operation = Fifth Avenue facade near 34th Street In 1924, Altman's acquired the final land lease for the building, consisting of two lots at Fifth Avenue and 34th Street. Altman's thus had ownership of all lots on the block. Alteration plans for the building were filed in 1938, with an estimated cost of $250,000. Two years later, Altman's refurbished the third floor, and six departments were added to the Fifth Avenue side, in what was referred to as the \\"Fifth Avenue Walk\\". Rumors of a new structure on the site started circulating in 1970, to which Altman's distributed letters announcing their intention to stay in the same location. By 1984, the store's owner Altman Foundation indicated its intention to downsize the Altman's location and sell off the upper floors at the Madison Avenue end to an investment syndicate, which would convert the space to residences and offices. The plans entailed removing of retail space on each of seven floors. The syndicate that owned the building, KMO-361 Realty Associates, was named for the initials of its principals, Earle W. Kazis, Peter L. Malkin, and Morton L. Olshan, as well as the building's Fifth Avenue address. The chain itself was acquired by L.J. Hooker in 1987. On March 12, 1985, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated the B. Altman and Company Building's exterior as a New York City landmark. Altman's owners announced plans to add six floors at the Madison Avenue end of the building in 1987, with the store occupying on five floors. The LPC approved the expansion plans in 1988. The second floor of the store, which contained the fashion department, was remodeled in 1988. The project was planned to be the first phase of a total renovation of the building. By late 1989, Altman's had filed for bankruptcy, and the flagship was set to close. The building had been placed at auction for one month, but no bidders made an offer for the building. Altman's liquidated its merchandise, and the store within the building permanently closed on December 31, 1989. = Renovation = Although the B. Altman Building's landmark status prevented the store from being torn down, KMO's plans to add six stories had stalled with the announcement of the store's closure. In late 1991, KMO proposed that of the building be converted to the New York Resource Center, a furniture and appliances showroom. Another would be used by the New York Public Library (NYPL), which would open the Science, Industry and Business Library (SIBL) there. The NYPL issued bonds to pay for the space. The New York Resource Center plans were ultimately postponed indefinitely because of a lack of interest in the project. Richard P. Steinberg, one of Olshan's partners, stated in 1994 that three \\"significant\\" museums and two educational institutions had expressed interest in the building, but that there was no definite commitment. Several other companies expressed interest in the building's space, including Sotheby's and J. C. Penney. Nearby, Oxford University Press was looking to move from their space at 200 Madison Avenue. The NYPL bought an eight-floor condominium on the Madison Avenue side of the B. Altman Building in February 1993, and OUP contracted to buy a five-floor condominium the following January. The City University of New York (CUNY) also announced plans to move its Graduate Center to the Altman Building from the Aeolian Hall on West 42nd Street, and sell the Aeolian Hall to the State University of New York College of Optometry, which was finalized in 1995. Starting in 1996, the exterior was restored by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer and the interior reconfigured by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates. The OUP offices were designed by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum. The renovations involved restoring many old design elements, such as the lobby porticoes, bronze elevator cabs, and cast-iron staircases. The renovation cost over $170 million. The SIBL opened within the building in 1996. CUNY was scheduled to move the Graduate Center there in late 1999, but the relocation was delayed due to setbacks in construction. The CUNY Graduate Center moved to the B. Altman Building in 2000. In 2012, because of the NYPL's budgetary issues, the library arranged to sell off five of the upper floors that it had used as office space. The NYPL's eight-floor condominium was divided four ways in 2012, and the five upper floors were sold that year for $60.8 million to the Church Pension Fund. The NYPL announced in 2016 that the SIBL would close after the completion of an upcoming renovation of the Mid-Manhattan Library. The same year, it sold the remaining office condominium unit to Seattle developer Vulcan Inc., headed by Paul Allen, for $93 million. The Museum of Pop Culture, which had been founded by Allen, indicated in 2018 that it was considering opening a location in the SIBL space. The SIBL was permanently closed after the Mid-Manhattan Library reopened in 2020 as the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library, with a business center that replaced the SIBL's collection.  Impact  At the building's opening, a Times critic wrote that \\"the store adds materially to the beauty of Fifth Avenue\\". Altman's had been the first big department store to make the move from Ladies' Mile to Fifth Avenue, which at the time was still primarily residential. Following Altman's example, other major stores made the move uptown to the \\"middle\\" portion of Fifth Avenue, including Best & Co., W. & J. Sloane, Lord & Taylor, Arnold Constable & Company, and Bergdorf Goodman. The B. Altman Building's stature made it a \\"three-ring circus\\", according to The New York Times. The running track on the building's roof was used for training by the United States Olympic team, as depicted in the 1981 film Chariots of Fire. The building was also used for exterior filming in the 2017 Amazon Studios television series The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.

She studies aquatic ecosystems and conservation. Pringle has previously served as President of the Society for Freshwater Science. She is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Ecological Society of America.  Early life and education  Pringle studied environmental science at the University of Michigan. She earned her bachelor's degree in 1976, her Master's in 1979 and her doctorate in 1986. After earning her PhD Pringle joined the University of California, Berkeley as a postdoctoral scholar. She moved to Cornell University in 1991, where she stayed for two years before moving to the University of Georgia.  Research and career  Pringle joined the University of Georgia in 1993 where she works on aquatic ecology. Her research involves studying the impact of climate change on neotropical streams. Working at the Organization for Tropical Studies La Selva Biological Station, Pringle he has collected almost three decades of data collected from lowland streams in Costa Rica. Pringle was awarded her first National Science Foundation Long Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTERB) in Costa Rica in 1985 and has continued to collect data since. She looks to understand the relationship between ecosystem processes in lowland tropical systems and surface‚Äìsubsurface water interactions. In streams around La Selva solute-rich groundwater is transferred through subsurface flow, which alters nearby ecosystems. She showed that this solute-rich ground water is responsible for almost half of stream discharge and can cause the build up of cations in streams during the dry season. Solute-rich groundwater is associated with underlying volcanic activity, which alters the chemistry of the water through geothermal modification in Puerto Viejo Sarapiqu√≠, a town near La Selva Biological Station. The town has undergone explosive population growth, which places increased demands on local water supplies, and pesticides from the banana plantations can result in contamination. Pringle and her graduate students developed the environmental outreach program Water for Life, which focuses on water quality and quantity. The program involved volunteer stream monitoring (Adopt-a-Stream), posters to promote awareness of watershed protection and the development of teaching materials. In 2008 she was made a Distinguished Research Professor. She has investigated the role of specific species in maintaining the function of ecosystems, and how freshwater ecosystems adapt when certain species are lost. She has evaluated the impact of frog extinction in Panama's mountain streams and shrimp extirpation (local extinction) in Puerto Rico. Alongside her research, Pringle is involved with the design of innovative graduate education programmes. At the University of Georgia she serves as a Distinguished Research Professor and Chair of the Odum School of Ecology Master's degree Conservation Ecology & Sustainable Development. In 2019 Pringle was made a Fellow of the Ecological Society of America for her contribution to stream ecosystems and mentoring of students in aquatic conservation ecology. She has taught on the Semester at Sea program. = Awards and honours = Her awards and honours include: * 2000 University of Georgia Creative Research Medal * 2009 Elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science * 2013 International Society of Limnology Kilham Memorial Award * 2017 Elected to the Council of the American Association for the Advancement of Science * 2019 Elected Fellow of the Ecological Society of America = Selected publications = Her publications include:  *  References  Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:American ecologists Category:Women ecologists Category:University of Georgia faculty Category:Fellows of the Ecological Society of America Category:Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Category:University of Michigan alumni ","title":"Catherine Pringle"},{"id":"62672081","text":"Cowan Bog Ecological Reserve is an ecological reserve located northeast of the Duck Mountain Provincial Forest, Manitoba, Canada.

He studied their society and helped to revise an early Tshiluba- English dictionary. Anderson later served as interim General Secretary of the Congo Protestant Council, a legal representative for the American Presbyterian Congo Mission and an inspector of its schools. He returned to the United States in 1959 and became a minister in Texas.  Early life  Vernon Andy Anderson was born in Chicago, Illinois on August 23, 1896 but his family moved soon afterwards to Alabama. Anderson graduated from the Alabama Presbyterian College in 1917 and in 1920 received a Bachelor of Divinity degree from the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky.  Missionary work  Anderson joined the American Presbyterian Congo Mission after graduation and was posted to the Kasa√Ø region of the Belgian Congo. Anderson lived amongst the Baluba people from 1921 to 1946, and was one of the first missionaries to work with the Baluba-lubilashi sub-group. During his time with the Baluba Anderson studied their society and, in 1942, received a PhD degree from the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary for a dissertation titled Witchcraft in Africa: a missionary problem. In this work he noted that most accused witches were women over the age of 55 and were at risk of being murdered by vigilantes. For seven years Anderson chaired a committee that revised an early edition of a Tshiluba-English dictionary. Anderson afterwards served as interim General Secretary of the Congo Protestant Council in Leopoldville for two years and from 1947 served on the Belgian government's Commission for the Protection of Indigenous People. He also acted as legal representative for the American Presbyterian Congo Mission in 1948. Anderson also served a 10-year term as that mission's inspector of schools from 1949.

She was the daughter of Rhoda May Knight Rindge and Frederick Hastings Rindge and wife to Merritt Huntley Adamson. She was alleged to be one the leading proponents of excluding African Americans and specifically Nat King Cole's family from Hancock Park, Los Angeles, according to \\"persistent rumors\\" reported by The Los Angeles Sentinel newspaper; an Adohr spokesman denied the rumors. Early life Adamson was born Rhoda Agatha Rindge, the middle child of Rhoda May Knight Rindge and Frederick Hastings Rindge, transplants to California from Michigan and Massachusetts, respectively. The family lived in Santa Monica as well as a Victorian mansion in Malibu Canyon, on the Rindge's 13,315-acre ranch. The ranch home was destroyed in 1903 fire; from there on out, the family only camped in Malibu when visiting the family ranch. Otherwise, they no longer lived in Santa Monica, but rather a 25-room mansion in West Adams Heights, known as the Frederick Hastings Rindge House. Adamson was raised to love the outdoors, and, riding horseback, she partook of activities such as sheep- herding with her father on the Malibu Ranch. She also enjoyed recreational horseback riding and race-car driving. The former she often partook of with her best friend, Jesse Ellen Matheson, to whom she had gifted a horse named Robin. The pair rode their horses across Malibu's Santa Monica Mountains, usually armed with shotguns should a rattlesnake have presented a threat. Adamson's car racing, meanwhile, took the shape of annual races, such as those held in Santa Monica. Education For high school, Adamson attended a private girls' school called Casa de Rosas. The graduation ceremony in June 1910, accommodating 29 graduates, was held at Los Angeles's Ebell Club. Adamson attended Wellesley for a year, from 1910-1911, before returning to California, missing her home state too much to stay away. Marriage, businesses, homes, and children =Marriage, Adohr Farms, and Adohr Creamery Co.= Rhoda met her husband, Merritt Huntley Adamson, by way of the family ranch; Merritt had been appointed ranch foreman. He was temporarily injured on the job, and Rhoda nursed him back to health. They were married on Nov. 18, 1915. A year later, as they shared an interest in animal husbandry, they began a small beef ranching operation, though it took a backseat to their primary business: Adohr Stock Farms at 18000 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana, CA, located next to Times-Mirror publisher Harrison Gray Otis's ranch. Merritt Adamson assumed the office of the president of Adohr, while Rhoda served as secretary- treasurer. Adohr Stock Farms was the umbrella organization from which the Adamsons would grow Adohr Farms and Adohr Dairy & Creamery, the latter of which was headquartered at 1801 S. La Cienega Boulevard and Sawyer Street. A giant milkmaid and cow sculpture, created by Art-Vertising of Los Angeles, stood at the Adohr locations. The business was named Adohr for Rhoda, as Adohr is Rhoda spelled backward. Their ad campaign \\"Adohr-able Babies\\" featured their daughter, Rhoda-May, as the first Adohr-able Baby. In addition to becoming one of the biggest dairies in the United States, Adohr would come to be one of the largest certified dairies in the world, and come to boast the world's largest herd of Guernsey and Holstein-Friesian cows, tallying in at 1,650 head of cattle. The milk was certified by the Milk Commission of the Los Angeles County Medical Association and was a \\"consistent winner\\" in contests ranging from the California State Fair in Sacramento to the Pacific International Live Stock Exposition in Portland, Oregon, and more. The organization thrived throughout the Great Depression, as milk consumption was bolstered by Prohibition, though the beef ranch side of the enterprise was forced into bankruptcy. Darling of the Depression era, Shirley Temple, became an Adohr promotional figure, naming Adohr cows like Tillie Temple from Tillamook and Dinah. Clarence \\"Ducky\\" Nash, the original voice of Donald Duck and countless other cartoon characters, also promoted Adohr products as Whistling Clarence, the Adohr Bird Man. He was a mere milkman with Adohr, yet became known for the funny voices and sound effects he produced to the delight of children on his delivery route. He hence became Whistling Clarence, and was tasked with riding in a wagon drawn by miniature horses through the streets of Los Angeles, dispensing treats to children. His Adohr resume and other voice work impressed Walt Disney, and Nash was brought into the Disney family in this way. Other dairy promotionals included cow milking contests to the benefit of Warner Bros. Theatre. The dairy ran on a 24-hours-a-day schedule, with 100 employees carrying out the operation of the plant itself, while scores of additional employeesAdohr milkmenwere deployed across hundred of routes to deliver milk straight to clients' doorsteps, and sometimes, straight to their refrigerators, as did long-time milkman Elmer Moss. And the company offered not only milk but buttermilk, butter, cream, ice cream, cottage cheese, eggs, and other milk products like whipping cream. The Tarzana farm and additional farmland in Kern County, California, meanwhile, provided the room necessary to grow feed for the livestock and allow them out to pasture. This branch of the business entailed growing 150 acres of corn and 300 acres of alfalfa. Simultaneous to the dairy operations, Rhoda managed Kentucky-bred prize horses of the Saddlebred and draft varieties. =Homes and children= The couple settled into an Elmer Grey-designed home in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles and started a family. They had three children Rhoda-May (b.1917), Sylvia (b.1921), and Merritt Jr. (b.1926). In 1929, the couple commissioned Stiles O. Clements to build them a weekend and summer home on 13 acres in Malibu that Rhoda's mother had gifted them. Two Danish painter, Ejnar Hansen and Peter Nielsen, hand-painted doors, cupboards, and other surfaces in the house, while John Holtzclaw, an interior decorator, worked to create a cohesive home for the Adamsons, coordinating furnishings with textiles, the Danish painters' work, and the abundant Malibu tile. The home, the Adamson House, was completed in 1929, and the family moved in during June of 1930. They loved it so much that by 1936, they had moved in full-time. There, the family raised prized chickens, tended bees, and accommodated a variety of pet animals, including goats, dogs (Saint Bernards being one of the breeds), a sheep named Bohunkus and a donkey named Don Quixote. The family was friends with cowboy-humorist Will Rogers, and Rogers was known to ride his horse from his ranch in Pacific Palisades to the Adamson house where he would perform rope tricks for the Adamson children. The home's downstairs guest room was reserved for Rhoda's mother, Rhoda May Knight Rindge. Not only had May Rindge gifted the land upon which the Adamson House was built, she also provided the home's extensive tile from her own tile factory, Malibu Potteries. The home contains such an extensive display of the tile that it is referred to as the \\"tile Taj Mahal\\" or \\"Taj Mahal of tile.\\" =World War II, Merritt's death, and Adohr changes= During World War II, the Coast Guard wanted to take over the Adamson House, hoping to use it as an outpost. The family declined, but did allow officers to stay in the poolhouse as well as semi-permanent tents along their stretch of beach. This arrangement became the Coast Guard's Command Post No. 5. The home, like most buildings during the war, was required to make use of blackout shadeslight-blocking shades covering all windows in the home so that enemy aircraft or submarine would have difficulty making sense of the landscape at night. Merritt Adamson volunteered as an air-raid warden, riding his horse from the Adamson House down to the Malibu Pier and back on patrol. Rhoda, like many heads of house, did a lot of canning in the war years, creating edible preserves of all kinds. In 1942, the Adamson family heard about the bombing of Pearl Harbor on what was a luxury to most families thena large Scott radio in their living room. They sat around the same radio to hear President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's fireside chats. In 1948, imminent post-war suburbia began infringing on the Tarzana dairy operation, and the Adamsons owed money to creditors. Merritt hence sold the Tarzana dairy property to builders who planned to divide the land into parcels for construction of low-cost housing for veterans. In preparation, original dairy structures were dismantled, including its three 31-year-old silos, which had to be razed with the help of the Los Angeles County Fire Department Demolition Squad and a significant amount of dynamite. The dairy operations were moved to Camarillo. A year later, Merritt Adamson died, leaving Adohr completely up to Rhoda to operate. The same year, Adohr published a cookbook called Milk-Maid Recipes from Adohr, with recipes ranging from Butter Crunch Cake, Southern Spoon Bread, Hot Peppermint Chocolate, Purple Cow Soda, Sour Cream Raisin Pudding, and Cornmeal Souffl√© to Boston- Style Scalloped Fish, Asparagus With Lemon Sauce, Cheese Salmon Loaf, English Lamb Chops, and Cheese Ham Casserole. The dairy's radio program, an opera show called Adohr Opera of the Air,https://www.sutori.com/item/radio-broadcasts- included-news-music-sports-weather-lectures-and-stock-mark continued; opera singers for the program were auditioned in none other than the Adamson House living room. Death and legacy Rhoda Adamson died in 1962. She is buried with her husband, Merritt, in crypt 10291 at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, in the cemetery's Great Mausoleum, Sanctuary of Ascension. Rhoda's dairy continued under the Adohr Farms name into the 1990s or early 2000s, though the original buildings in the San Fernando Valley had long-since been demolished, starting in 1948, and the family had sold the business in 1966. As a ubiquitous model dairy in its time, it set a high standard for all dairies that followed. Rhoda-May, the eldest Adamson child, continued to run the dairy business quite closely after her mother's passing. Additionally, Rhoda-May formed the Adamson Company with her siblings, Sylvia and Merritt, an organization to manage the family's real estate holdings. It was a continuation, in effect, of their grandmother and mother's Marblehead Land Co., which had been formed to manage the original Rindge real estate holdings. It was through their family's holdings that they continued to shape the City of Malibu's development. For example, Merritt Jr. was part of a successful fight against the prospective construction of a nuclear power plant in Malibu's Corral Canyon. Also in the '60s, he wanted to \\"carry out a master plan he and his partnershis two sisterssecretly commissioned in 1965: a proposal by prominent architect William L. Pereira to develop much of Malibu with clusters of houses set off by huge natural preserves from surrounding large estates.\\" Though the plan never came to pass due to ill-fated timing and exorbitant property taxes, Merrit Jr. went on to build \\"a mobile home park, a recreational vehicle park, and condominiums\\" and \\"subdivided land and sold it for homes,\\" such as the Horizon Hills subdivision. He also \\"sold thousands of acres to the state and federal governments for open parkland that would both preserve wildlife and attract tourists.\\" It was through this action that original Rindge property helped create the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. As for the Adamson House, it remained and, as of 2019, remains the best extant example of Malibu Potteries offerings. As the potteries was Rhoda's mother's business, it stands testament to both the Rindge and Adamson legacies. Rhoda Adamson lived at the Adamson House until she died. Upon her death, the property went into a state of limbo. The State of California was calling eminent domain on the property, and the Adamson descendants could not afford the high property taxes on it. Hence, they sold it to the State of California in 1968. No sooner had the transaction been completed, then the state declared they would be demolishing the home to make it a parking lot for the surfers, as surf culture had exploded in the 1950s and '60s, creating a demand for automobile access to the area. Horrified, Malibu citizens formed the Malibu Historical Society expressly to save the home. It made no difference that the home was a masterpiece of Stiles O. Clements, nor was it considered remarkable, in the state's eyes, in its lineage tied to the Rindge family. What saved it was the provenance of its tile: the tile had been a product of Malibu's first business, the Malibu Potteries; it had been made using local clays; and its glazes were not reproducible, as creator and glaze expert Rufus Keeler died of cyanide poisoning shortly after the Malibu Potteries closed, and he had taken measures to commit his recipes to memory alone. It took approximately ten years for the historical society to hash out the case with the state. In the interim, Pepperdine University's chancellor, Norvel Young, moved into the home with his family. Also during this time, the Adamson family donated 138 acres of their land to Pepperdine, so that Pepperdine, which was outgrowing its Watts campus, and whose campus had been badly damaged during the Watts Riots of 1965, could move its campus to Malibu. The 138 acres were foundational, as they were the first 138 of the new campus. Finally, in 1977, the Adamson House was designated California landmark No. 966. In 1985, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Rhoda's home of 33 years, it has been open for public tours since 1982 and is home to the Malibu Lagoon Museum. It is also the site of weddings and special events, yet remains completely intact, as it was in the Adamson Family's tenure, complete with their belongings, from Rhoda's I. Magnin's and Bullock's dresses, Haviland & Co. dishware, and Adohr Farms milk bottles, to original bedspreads, Barker Bros. furniture, and Merritt Adamson's map collection.

After being with Odin of London for some years in the late 70s and early 80s, he founded BunChakeze, who recorded a progressive rock album. Because that genre was not commercially interesting at the time, no record label could be found to release it. In 2010, after not playing in any bands for 25 years, encouraged by friends he met on the internet, Colin released the BunChakeze album. The album was received very well, and led him into releasing a string of albums with his own projects, of which Corvus Stone and Colin Tench Project were most important, and as a guest musician for other acts. He also produced albums for these same other acts, building him a cult following around the world. Colin died unexpectedly of natural causes on December 27, 2017, 3 days after the release of his second album with the Colin Tench Project.  Career  = Australia and Odin of London = At the age of 22*, Tench left England to live in Sydney, Australia for three years. During his stay, he decided to take up playing the guitar. Together with other English expats and sons of expats, he formed The Pommie Gentlemen. The group played local clubs and joined Battle of the Bands contests, but by Tench's own admission, they were not particularly very good. At one gig, however, he spotted legendary AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott in the audience and afterwards spoke briefly with him, Scott reportedly saying that he thought the band was alright. After leaving Australia, Tench forgot about guitar playing and returned home to London via a journey of several months through Asia. Originally he had no aspirations to continue playing the guitar, but then he decided to audition for a new band named Odin of London. At the time of the auditions, former Black Widow and Cressida guitarist John Culley had also tried out for the band. According to bassist Gary Derrick, Tench called every day to ask if he had passed the audition. Someone suggested having two lead guitarists, and both Tench and Culley were hired. The band was born in 1981 and was composed of Gary Derrick (bass), Derek Sanderson (keyboards), John Culley (guitars), Colin Tench (guitars), and Cliff Deighton (drums). Carl Lucas was hired to replace the former vocalist, and Anne Tench designed the artwork for the band's poster. Odin of London recorded several original songs at a studio belonging to Alex Foulcher, with one song, \\"Catherine\\", featuring Tench on vocals. Their song \\"Alcatraz\\" was chosen to be included on a compilation LP, but the company desired a different vocalist. Tench discovered Tony Butler, and the song was rerecorded with Butler's vocals. The contract with the label, however, did not favour the band and they declined to permit the use of their song. Odin of London sent out their recordings on cassette to record companies but were repeatedly rejected. In 1984, the band simply stopped doing anything and three members decided to start a new project. = BunChakeze = Tench, Derrick, and Deighton formed a new band in 1984. One of the first compositions, a short instrumental piece with many key changes, was brought forward by Tench. When asked by his band members about the composition, he allegedly replied that it was a \\"bunch of keys\\". This led to the band being named BunChakeze, a rough homophone of \\"bunch of keys\\". The trio began writing new music but needed a place to record. The band turned to Alex Foulcer at whose studio they had recorded Odin of London's tracks. Foulcer was building a new studio and, according to Tench, a deal was made over a card game one night; the three musicians would help build the studio during the day in exchange for recording time at night. Between 1984 and 1985, the studio and BunChakeze's songs came together. With an album's worth of music ready, the band decided to audition a singer. After a few months, American singer Joey Lugassy from Los Angeles arrived in London on his first visit to the United Kingdom and advertised that he was looking for a band. He was called to meet with BunChakeze and was hired to sing the songs, a challenge for him as the music had already been recorded and he had to make his vocals fit the music. With the album Whose Dream completed at last, the band was satisfied with the results, the purpose having been to record an album of music on their own terms. A few record companies were contacted but no one expected any positive results and none came. At last, the band split up, and Tench once more took to traveling. The band reformed once in 1992, remixed their recordings, and once more attempted to garner record label interest. However, after a few more rejections the members each went their separate ways once more. = Corvus Stone, Minstrel's Ghost, and Oceans 5 = In 2009*, Tench moved into a house in (town), Sweden and decided to contact his old Odin of London bandmate, John Culley. Not knowing where to find him, Tench looked up Black Widow's web site and contacted the site manager, a Finnish keyboard player and composer named Pasi Koivu. Tench told Koivu about the Odin of London and BunChakeze recordings and Koivu asked to hear them. Impressed, he encouraged Tench to release both albums. Odin of London's recordings were released as a digital download only and BunChakeze was released digitally and on CD in 2010. Via chatrooms and Facebook, he began acquainting himself with a number of artists who would soon play important roles in his recording career, including American multi-instrumentalist and singer Blake Carpenter, British singer/songwriter Andy John Bradford, Belgian singer and guitarist Stef Flaming, Argentinian composer Andres Guazzelli, and illustrating artist Sonia Mota of Mozambique. In 2011, Koivu asked Tench if he would play on a piece he had written called \\"Iron Pillows\\". Tench had not played guitar since 1985 and found the piece very challenging but agreed to collaborate. The music attracted the attention of Finnish bass player, Petri Lindstrom who contributed to the recording. A year later, Koivu presented Tench and Lindstrom with a piece titled \\"The Ice King\\". This was followed by \\"Corvus Stone\\". The trio were now committed to writing music together, and at the suggestion of Sonia Mota, the new band was named Corvus Stone. By now it seemed possible that an album would result from their efforts. Before they completed the recordings, they were contacted by American drummer Robert Wolff who expressed interest in joining the band, and Corvus Stone became a four- piece. Stef Flaming wrote the music for \\"Jussi Pussi\\", a whimsical piece named after a type of Finnish bread roll. Though most of the tracks were intended to be instrumental, Blake Carpenter sang on a couple of tracks. John Culley made a guest appearance on the song \\"You're So Wrong\\", a cover of an old Black Widow song he had played on. He was joined by drummer Victor Tassone of the progressive metal band Unified Past. The album was released through Melodic Revolution Records on November 26, 2012. While recording Corvus Stone, Tench was asked by Carpenter to play lead guitar for his band project The Minstrel's Ghost's second album, Road to Avalon. The album tells the story of King Arthur and was released on December 7, 2012. Tench was also approached by Andy John Bradford to play guitar for his band Oceans 5. He and Bradford enlisted the assistance of a few musicians with whom Tench was acquainted, such as Andres Guazzelli, Stef Flaming, Victor Tassone, and Italian keyboard player, Marco Chiappini. The newly formed band began reworking the old folk song \\"Return to Mingulay\\". Tench, however, was not satisfied with the mixing and set about learning how to mix albums. It was during this time he learned about dynamic range and how much of modern music is compressed to a low dynamic range level. He took pride in mixing all his music projects with a high dynamic range. Oceans 5 released their album Return to Mingulay on October 7, 2013 through Melodic Revolution Records. The song \\"6000 Friends\\" features a guest appearance by vocalist Lorelei McBroom of the Australian Pink Floyd band. Argentinian composer and musician Andres Guazzelli asked Tench to play lead guitar for his twelve-minute instrumental piece, \\"Wish You Could Hear\\". The track was released on November 2, 2013 by Melodic Revolution Records. Tench commented saying that it was the most challenging piece that he had ever played on. = Corvus Stone II, unscrewed, side projects and guest appearances = Having become accomplished at mixing and mastering music, Tench was asked by Stef and Yolanda Flaming of the Belgian band Murky Red to mix their debut album, Time Doesn't Matter. He also contributed lead guitar for the track \\"Heal My Bleeding Heart\\". His collaboration with the Flamings continued as Corvus Stone began recording material for a second album. They chose to cover the Murky Red song \\"Boots for Hire\\" and asked Stef Flaming to sing on the track. As the album came together, several musicians were either approached by Tench to perform on the album or the artists themselves asked to be a part of the music. Special guests for Corvus Stone II included Andres Guazzelli, Blake Carpenter, German Vergara, Phil Naro, Sean Filkins, and Timo Rautiainen all doing vocals for different songs. Victor Tassone added percussion and also drums for the track \\"The Simple Life\\". The album was released September 30, 2014. In 2015, Tench proposed remixing a selection of songs from the first Corvus Stone album. The remixes and four new tracks were released as a digital download album on July 28. By this time, Tench had become known to many musicians and was asked to play on various tracks or be a part of band projects. He joined Stef Flaming and John Moulder in a new project called Transmission Rails. The trio recorded two songs together. In 2016, he also guested on German progressive rock band KariBow's Holophinium album, Italian psychedelic/progressive rock artist Marco Ragni's album Land of Blue Echoes, and French progressive rock band Grandval's album A Ciel Ouvert.... Tench was also approached by Mark Trueack of the multi-national progressive rock artist collaboration United Progressive Fraternity to perform on the debut album, Fall In Love With the World, which also included contributions by legendary progressive rock artists Jon Anderson and Steve Hackett. Composer and multi- instrumentalist Steve Gresswell asked Tench to play lead guitar for his band project Coalition's second album, Bridge Across Time. The album was released October 7, 2016 and features Blake Carpenter on vocals. = Colin Tench Project = After a flurry of activity in the first half of 2016, Tench turned his attention to a personal project which he had begun back in 2011 and had been working on little by little. Unfinished pieces and early versions of ideas in the works had been uploaded to the ReverbNation music-sharing site under the name Colin Tench Project, but now at last these works became the focus of his attention. Over the next few months, Tench contacted several musicians to ask if they would be interested in participating in the project. Joining the project was Corvus Stone bassist, Petri Lindstrom, and vocalist Phil Naro, who had previously sung on Corvus Stone tracks. Other names included drummer Vic Tassone and bassist Stephen Speelman of the American progressive metal band, Unified Past, composer Steve Gresswell, flutist Ian Beabout, and German melodic progressive rock band, KariBow's Oliver Rusing, who played drums for one track. Tench was always pleased to announce new members to the project, first with tease posts on his Facebook page and finally the official announcement. One very important person to join the project was the multi-talented Peter Jones who was the sole member of the English progressive rock project, Tiger Moth Tales. Jones had only just recently been asked by legendary prog rock band, Camel, to join them on tour as a keyboard player. Tench was deeply impressed with Jones' ability to understand what Tench was aiming for, and he often stated that, \\"Pete just gets it!\\" In addition to vocals, Jones also played a clarinet solo in the song \\"And So Today\\", which also became the lead single release. As Tench continued to tease his fans with new music, one piece titled \\"The Sad Brazilian\\" caught the interest of American guitarist and orchestral composer, Gordo Bennett. Bennett knew Tench through their work on the United Progressive Fraternity album, and when \\"The Sad Brazilian\\" was posted on YouTube, an inspired Bennett downloaded the music and added his own orchestration to it, then contacted Tench with an apology for stealing the music and a request to listen to Bennett's additional orchestration. Tench loved it and welcomed Bennett to the project. The timing was most fortuitous as orchestral composer, Steve Gresswell was becoming busy with his Coalition band project. Bennett was able to take over and provide the orchestral music for the rest of the album. The Colin Tench Project album Hair In A G-String (unfinished but sweet) was released on September 30, 2016. The title was a humorous play on the title \\"Air On A G String\\" and the commonly used appended title \\"Unfinished Suite\\". The album was based on the multi-part hair In A G-String suite, several instrumental compositions including three acoustic guitar tracks and two re- workings of a Corvus Stone theme, and a few melodic songs in a more classic rock feel. The album quickly captured one of the top positions on the ProgArchives web site and received praise from reviewers around the world, who noted the successful blend of contributions from so many musicians. Music web sites and music magazines rated the album highly. Tench was pleased to receive so much praise but always stressed that the reason for the success of the music was due to the efforts of every single member in the project. Before the summer of 2017, Tench began working on ideas for a follow up album. The project was temporarily put on the back burner as he turned to some important renovations on his home, but by the end of the summer, new music teasers were being dropped into his Facebook timeline. This time the cast of participating musicians was trimmed back to a core group consisting of vocalists Peter Jones and Joey Lugassy, who had sung on the BunChakeze album back in 1985, Petri Lindstrom on bass, Gordo Bennett for orchestral arrangements, and drummer Joe Vitale of the Joe Walsh group. Additional guests were limited to Eddie Young on cello and Christo Pellani on drums and percussion. Running time wise, the album was shorter, coming to just around 54 minutes in comparison to Hair In A G-String which had not only nearly filled up the entire CD but also included as a bonus track with the digital download a composition credited entirely to Gordo Bennett. Another noticeable difference between the two albums were some more sombre tracks on the first \\"side\\" of the album. Variety, however, pervaded the new release, which was titled \\"minor Masterpiece\\". The digital download became available on December 25, 2017 and the CD was released on January 30, 2018.

At the time of the German invasion on June 22 it was located in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains near the border with Hungary as part of the 17th Rifle Corps of 12th Army in the Kiev Special Military District. While the division was not attacked by the main German forces in the first days, its almost total lack of trucks and shortage of horses made it difficult to retreat to the east. It was soon transferred with 17th Corps to the new 18th Army in Southern Front, but returned to 12th Army in mid-July. It fell back through western Ukraine under that headquarters into August when it found itself encircled in the Uman pocket where all but remnants of the division were destroyed. The 60th Mountain was finally officially disbanded on September 19. Formation The division was officially converted from the 60th Rifle Division on April 24, 1941 based on the prewar shtat (table of organization and equipment) for mountain rifle divisions, which among other things required the formation of a fourth rifle regiment: * 196th Mountain Rifle Regiment * 224th Mountain Rifle Regiment * 350th Mountain Rifle Regiment * 358th Mountain Rifle RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Death\\", Soviet Mountain, Naval, NKVD, and Allied Divisions and Brigades 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. VII, Nafziger, 1995, p. 10.

Gen. Markis Bikmulovich Salikhov, who had been the 60th Rifle's deputy commander until April 24, 1940 and had been promoted to general's rank on June 4 of that year. It was one of six rifle divisions converted to mountain divisions in Ukraine in late 1940/early 1941; like the rest it received little or no specialized training or equipment before the invasion began. At that time it had on hand 8,313 officers and men with 7,742 bolt-action rifles and carbines, 349 semiautomatic rifles, 939 sub-machine guns, 357 light machine guns, 209 heavy machine guns, 8 45mm antitank guns, 32 76mm cannon and howitzers, 24 122mm howitzers and 120 mortars. Despite having, on paper, both a battalion and a company of trucks it actually had just 10 trucks and 1 tractor plus 2,280 horses for its transport; it was intended to mobilize the remainder from the civilian economy.Sharp, \\"Red Death\\", pp. 3, 10. Sharp gives the number of semiautomatic rifles as 3,449, which appears to be a typo. Combat service On June 25 the division was transferred with 17th Rifle Corps (60th and 96th Mountain, 164th Rifle Divisions) to the 18th Army which was being formed in Southern Front (former Odessa Military District).Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1941, p. 17 During early July the 17th Corps was mostly facing the Hungarian 8th Army Corps and by July 11 it had been forced back east of Kamianets-Podilskyi.David Stahel, Kiev 1941, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2012, pp. 78-79 Later that month the 60th was detached from the Corps and returned to 12th Army where it came under the command of 13th Rifle Corps before August 1.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1941, p. 34 By July 23 it was fighting south of Lypovets, now against the German 97th Light Infantry Division, before falling back to just south of Uman at the end of the month.Stahel, Kiev 1941, pp. 84-85 By now both the 12th and 6th Armies were encircled in the Uman pocket. Breakout attempts, particularly on August 6 and 7, allowed individuals and small groups to escape the cauldron but apart from these remnants the 60th Mountain was smashed and was no longer carried on the Soviet order of battle by the end of the month, although it was not officially disbanded until September 19.Sharp, \\"Red Death\\", p. 10 Meanwhile, on July 29 General Salikhov had been relieved of command, court-martialed and condemned to 10 years imprisonment, although this was later commuted to demotion to the rank of colonel. He was replaced in command by Col. Boris Alekseevich Sorokin. Salikhov was soon given command of the 980th Rifle Regiment of the newly- forming 275th Rifle Division near Novorossiysk which was shipped to the Odessa District in late August to join the reforming 6th Army.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 57 Within days of this move Salikhov was taken prisoner; he collaborated with the Germans at least until 1943 and on June 21 of that year was tried in absentia and condemned to death.

Career The 1.83 m tall athlete played for the Bundesliga team DJK Don Bosco Bamberg until 2014 and was considered a great talent in German women's basketball. This was also expressed by the fact that she was appointed to the DBB's U-16 team and that she made her debut as a 17-year-old in the senior national team with national coach Alexandra Maerz. In her second international A game, she scored her first seven points in the national jersey in a clash with Finland. After the DJK Brose Bamberg relegated from the 1st Bundesliga in the 2013/2014 season (in that season Hartmann achieved the best average of their Bamberg Bundesliga time with 9.8 points per game played), she moved to Boulder to join the American college team Colorado Buffaloes of the University of Colorado Boulder. As, like Hartmann later described, her time at the college felt like a \\"military drill\\", she returned to Germany in the season of 2015/16 and joined the Bundesliga club SV Halle.

Taking place on the fictional planet of Palua in the future, where an evil being known as Honey plots to have his own galaxy, players assume the role of Lazy and Refia in order to prevent Honey and his followers from realizing their plan. Its gameplay mainly consists of platforming mixed with action elements using a main two-button configuration. Headed by Visco founder Tetsuo Akiyama and Breakers producer Don Gabacho, Bang Bang Busters was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Visco. Though it was initially launched for the Neo Geo AES, the game was later released for both Neo Geo MVS (arcade) and Neo Geo CD in 2011 and 2012 respectively, as well for the Dreamcast in 2018.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot Bang Bang Busters is a platform game similar to Snow Bros. and Nightmare in the Dark, where the players assume control of Lazy (P1) and Refia (P2) across seven stages comprising multiple levels that take place on planet Palua, each with a boss at the end that must be fought before progressing any further, in order to stop an evil being known as Honey and his followers before the former has his own galaxy as the main objective.Bang Bang Busters user's manual (Neo Geo AES, US)Bang Bang Busters manual (Dreamcast, US) The players must throw energy projectiles at enemies to inflate them with air, which is reminiscent of Dig Dug. From there, players can grab the inflated enemies to perform a variety of actions such as launching them against other enemies at any direction by holding the attack button, perform a dash throw by double-tapping the joystick left or right, as well as float above the ground by repeatedly tapping the jump button. Any enemy inflated with air cannot move until it shakes it off. Defeated enemies may spawn power-ups and items like a speed increaser, a bomb that obliterates any enemy caught in its blast radius, among others. Players can sustain a number of enemy hits, at the expense of losing power as a penalty, but the game is over after taking one last hit unless the players decide to continue playing.  Development and release  Bang Bang Busters was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Visco Corporation. Its development was helmed by Visco founder Tetsuo Akiyama and Breakers producer Don Gabacho, with Yasuhisa Itoi acting as supervisor. Ebi Taisyo and Tel.Y served as designer, with Taisyo also serving as writer. Artists Hirofumi Mawatari, Makoto Nobetani and Kaoru Ishizawa designed the characters, while Kentaro Masakane and Kenichi Imamatsu were the programmers. The music was composed by Kiyoshi Kusatsu, while other people also collaborated during development. Bang Bang Busters was initially showcased at trade shows and intended to be released in 1994 but it was never released for unknown reasons until 2010, when independent developer and publisher Neo Conception International released the AES version as part of an acquisition deal with Visco in regards to the rights of their intellectual properties. Although its production number during development remained unknown, it was later revealed to be officially assigned with the number 71. The title was then launched for Neo Geo MVS in 2011 and later for Neo Geo CD by N.C.I. in 2012. Years later, an officially licensed port by Visco for the Dreamcast was also released by JoshProd worldwide in 2018.

Contents In 1987, four years after the release of the third (and at the time, the final) Star Wars movie, Return of the Jedi, West End Games published the popular Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game. However, by 1992, having published many supplements and adventures, West End Games was finding it increasingly difficult to create original material out of the original trilogy of movies; they decided to release a second edition of the game based on other material that had been published. The third supplementary sourcebook to be published for the second edition, Dark Empire Sourcebook, is based upon the Dark Empire comic series by Tom Veitch and Cam Kennedy. Dark Empire Sourcebook is a 126-page softcover book written by Michael Allen Horne and Carol Hutchings, with graphics, iillustrations and cover art by John Paul Lona, Dave Dorman and Cam Kennedy. The sourcebook gives biographical profiles of notable personalities from the comics, a brief overview of the history of the New Republic, an essay on the Force, and brief profiles of planets and aliens mentioned in the comics. It also includes a 16-page color insert, and several sidebars covering various incidents. Reception In the November 1993 edition of Dragon (Issue #199), Rick Swan called sections of this book \\"dreary\\" and found that there was an overlap of material previously published in other second edition sourcebooks. He liked the \\"imaginative sidebars\\", which he found to be \\"competently written and liberally illustrated with artwork from the comics\\". Overall, Swan thought the book \\"makes an engaging side trip for players on vacation from the New Republic.\\" He gave Dark Empire Sourcebook an average rating of 4 stars out of 6, saying that \\"players on a budget\\" could probably get along without it.

It is a spin-off from BET drama The Oval. The first season of 24-episodes premiered on March 19, 2020 on BET+. Starting on May 7, 2020, the show began airing on the BET Network following new episodes of The Oval. Plot In a backdoor pilot during the first three episodes of The Oval, Ruth Truesdale (Melissa L. Williams) kidnaps her daughter Callie to join her and the sex-crazed members of the Rakudushis cult. Ruth is a devoted member of the Rakadushi cult. After helping to severely punish her rebellious, best friend Tally, she becomes an \\"Elder,\\" a high ranking member of the cult. However, in order to be initiated into the position of Elder, she was required to be gang raped by seven high ranking cult members, including Andrew and Dikhan, in the presence of The Highest. After being gang raped, Ruth no longer wanted to be a member of the cult and began planning an escape, along with her best friend, Tally. The leader of the Rakadushis is \\"the Highest\\" (Matt Cede√±o). The Highest has long hair and is always wearing white. His demeanor is very calm, peaceful, and welcoming. This is to cover up the fact that he is a sexual sadist. He uses drugs to make newcomers black out and lose all memory in order to violently rape them. He himself is also a drug addict. Dikhan (Lenny Thomas), is a high ranking cult member who is the right hand to The Highest. He is the overseer of everything that happens on the cult's property. Dikhan is very handsome and loyal to The Highest, but he is also extremely invasive and stern. It is revealed in Season one, episode seven, that Dikhan and The Highest have been in a homosexual relationship for twelve years. The Highest's fondness of Andrew causes Dikhan to be jealous and insecure. Members of all ranks of the cult fear Dikhan. Dikhan reports all wrongdoing of the cult members to The Highest and often recommends and inflicts their punishment. The Rakadushi cult was infiltrated by undercover FBI agent Andrew (Blue Kimble) who eventually converted his beliefs into that of the religious sex cult and is in the process of becoming a high ranking member of the Rakadushis. Andrew is married to Sarah and they have one son. After the infiltrating and becoming a unwavering believer of the Rakadushi religion, he began a secret, forbidden, sexual affair with Tally (Yvonne Senat Jones), who is also a member of the Rakadushi cult. Andrew falls in love with Tally, and eventually gets her pregnant. Tally does not know that Andrew is an undercover FBI agent who is also married. Andrew is a very loyal member and believer of the Rakadushi cult and its beliefs. However, he is frequently torn between his beliefs and his love for Tally, when Tally is severely and continuously punished for her mistakes and rebellious behavior. Tally questions Andrew's love for her after finding out Andrew was one of the seven men who gang raped Ruth. Andrew had homosexual sex with The Highest one time, proving his loyalty to the cult, but causing friction between him and Dikhan, due to Dikhan being in love with The Highest.

History  A church at the site dates from 1101, but the base of the bell-tower is the only remaining structure. Reconstruction of the church began in 1527. The facade is simple, with a semicircular tympanum. Above the nave is a baroque dome. The bell-tower retained its Romanesque style, although a clock face was added. The interior was refurbished in the 18th century with a late-baroque coffered ceiling with gilded frames. The church contains a Crucifixion attributed to the Cavaliere d‚ÄôArpino. In 1656 the relics of San Valerio, protector of the village, were transported here. The building was badly damaged by the earthquake of 1915 and was restored in 1934.

Early life  Martha Ann Roniger was born in Manhattan, Kansas, the daughter of Pascal Allen Roniger and Martha Sharer Roniger. She was a member of 4-H. Her high school in Elmdale, Kansas had no track team, so her father and brother built some practice equipment on the farm, and Roniger trained in nearby Emporia. Ann Roniger attended Colorado State University in Fort Collins for one year, then transferred to the University of Hawaii, on a full athletic scholarship.  Career  In 1956, Roniger broke the national standing broad jump record, and tied the National Junior Olympic record for the 50-year dash. From 1957 to 1959, as a teenager in Elmdale, Kansas, Roniger was three-time Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) women's pentathlon national champion. Her 1957 win was considered especially notable, because she \\"had never competed previously in the shotput, hurdles, or high jump\\", three of the component events. She was featured in Sports Illustrated for her accomplishment. In 1958, she won three events, set two Ozark regional records, and finished with the highest total points across the five pentathlon events. In 1959 she was included in the All- America Women's Track and Field Team. She continued competing as an athlete in college at Colorado State University, where she was a member of the school's first women's track and field team, along with sprinter Lillian Greene- Chamberlain, high jumper Ann Marie Flynn, and Rose Melanchuk. She aspired to a place on the American team for the 1960 Summer Olympics, but failed to qualify. In 1961 she transferred to the University of Hawaii, where she continued as a track athlete. In 1962, she set a state women's high jump record at Hawaii's Cooke Field. In adulthood, Hussong was a health science teacher at a Kansas high school for 25 years. When she retired to Oklahoma, she became a professional organizer.  Personal life  Ann Roniger married Bill Hussong in 1962. They had three children, William, Shawn, and Stephanie. She died in 2019, aged 76 years, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

Born into a wealthy English family, Edward and his elder brother Henry received a good education but were orphaned at a young age. The brothers emigrated to New Zealand and Edward was 19 when they arrived in 1859. They initially spent time with a relative in the Hawke's Bay Region from whom Edward learned photography. The brothers became surveyors in the Hawke's Bay and then worked for the Canterbury Provincial Council in this trade. They were involved in a very public scandal in 1876 when Edward beat a prominent member of parliament to some land that they were both interested in based on insider information that had been passed on by his brother. Both Sealy brothers were also farmers, with Henry engaging in much land speculation. They built family mansions next to each other in 1875 just outside of Timaru after they both married. His brother lost his house in the economic downturn that started in the late 1870s. Edward Sealy explored in the Southern Alps, sometimes working alongside Julius von Haast. He took his camera into the mountains and was the first to take photos in those areas. When the New Zealand Alpine Club was founded in 1891, Sealy became one of the inaugural vice-presidents. Sealy was a collector of butterflies, moths and birds' eggs and his entomology collection was considered one of the most notable private collections in the world. The South Canterbury Museum in Timaru holds his entomology collection, and his photographs are held by the South Canterbury Museum and Canterbury Museum in Christchurch. Some geographic features in the Southern Alps and elsewhere are named for Sealy. Early life Edward Sealy was born in England in 1839. Forebears had become rich in Barbados as plantation owners. His paternal grandparents died young and his father and aunt were brought up by relatives in England. Edward became an orphan when his father, the author Thomas Henry Sealy, died in 1848. Edward and his elder brother Henry (born 1838) were brought up by their aunt Maria Sealy. He received a classical education at Clifton College in Bristol. Edward was said to \\"stammer dreadfully\\". Surveying and farming The brothers emigrated to New Zealand on the Clontarf, which arrived in Lyttelton on 5 January 1859. John Acland, a Canterbury high country runholder, was also on this ship. The brothers' intention was to proceed to Hawke's Bay but the ship lay in Lyttelton Port for a month as much of the crew had deserted. In mid-February, they set off from Wellington on the Emily Allison to meet up with their relative Henry Bowman Sealy, who lived at Patoka, inland from Napier. The family connection is uncertain, but sources assume that he was their uncle. The brothers stayed with their relative and worked on his farm, learning the basics of farming. They also helped out land survey parties that worked in the district and during 1861, both of them worked as surveyors, Edward employed by the Hawke's Bay Provincial Council. In 1862, Edward surveyed for the Canterbury Provincial Council in Ashburton and North Canterbury. Henry was in 1872 surveying between the Opuha and Orari rivers in South Canterbury. In 1874, the brothers won a tender for a survey contract further west and inland, with Edward working in the area near Burkes Pass. Edward retired as a contract surveyor in 1876 and was afterwards farming, managing properties with his brother. His brother got into financial difficulties in the depression that started in the late 1870s; by January 1881 he had to sell his home 'Heathcliffe'. From then on, Edward farmed on the land surrounding his homestead only. Sealy was a co-founder of the Farmers' Co-operative Association in Timaru and was the organisation's director. =\\"The Sealy case\\"= The Sealy brothers caused a great scandal when Edward Richardson applied for land on behalf of his father, The Honourable Edward Richardson. Richardson Jr was requesting land that Edward Sealy was also interested in; Henry was present when the request was made. Richardson Jr was told to come back the next morning when the land office opened again but by that time, Edward had purchased the land on the advice of his brother. This happened just prior to Henry finishing a contract survey of Saint Andrews township; this was completed on 9 May 1876. The Lyttelton Times reported about the affair for a whole month under the heading \\"The Sealy case\\" and stated that Henry Sealy's \\"engagement with the government has terminated\\", with descendants maintaining that his contract was not up for renewal anyway as the provincial government was not entering new contracts shortly before the disestablishment of the provincial government system. Photography and mountaineering Sealy's uncle in Patoka is assumed to have been the first commercial portrait photographer in New Zealand, advertising his trade in 1848. It is assumed that Edward had learned photography from his uncle. In 1866, Sealy took his camera and other equipment to the upper Ashburton River and the Rangitata River, and the glaciers that feed these rivers. During the following year, he explored the whole length of the Mueller Glacier and took photos of Aoraki / Mount Cook from there. Dr Alfred Barker, a Christchurch- based doctor best known as a photographer, considered Sealy the best photographer in New Zealand at the time. Over Christmas and New Year 1867, the brothers caught up and over the space of a few days socialised with the Canterbury elite: Francis Jollie (a member of parliament) at Christmas Day, John Acland (by then a member of the Legislative Council) at Boxing Day, then on to Charles George Tripp (a large runholder) followed by Dr Ben Moorhouse (another large runholder). Moving on to Christchurch, the brothers then socialised with the family of Julius von Haast. In 1869, Sealy helped von Haast with the exploration of the Tasman Glacier. By then, von Haast was suffering from rheumatism and the exploratory work was left to Sealy. Other glaciers explored that year were the Classen and Godley glaciers. On this latter trip, Sealy took his camera with him. His photos did not come out well and he decided to switch from dry to wet plate. In 1870, he went back to the Tasman Glacier and the Rangitata glaciers. He took photos of Mount Darwin and Hochstetter Dome; this is the first time that these mountains were seen from the east side. Sealy exhibited landscape photos at the first art exhibition in Christchurch in early 1870. In 1871, he gave 44 photo plates to the Canterbury Museum, where his friend von Haast was the curator. Some of Sealy's photos were exhibited as part of a map prepared by von Haast at the 1873 Vienna World's Fair, and Sealy won a silver medal for some of his photos. It is estimated that Sealy's gear that he carried onto the glaciers for photography weighed . When the New Zealand Alpine Club was founded in Christchurch in July 1891, Sealy was elected as one of the vice-presidents. Entomology Sealy was an avid collector of moths, butterflies and birds' eggs. Insects in his collection from overseas were from India, Africa, China, New Guinea, Malaysia, Mexico, Ecuador, Brazil, Peru, and Guiana. In his obituary, the collection was described as \\"one of the finest private collections in the world\\". His collection of New Zealand bird eggs was possibly the most complete set at the time. Family Southerndown in the 1890s Heathcliffe in 1911, by then known by its current name Craighead Sealy had become friendly with the Sanderson family. On 13 October 1873, he married Frances Sarah Sanderson (born 21 September 1855) at the family's homestead, Greta Peaks, near Scargill in the Hurunui District. The marriage was conducted by the bishop of Christchurch, Henry Harper. The honeymoon saw the newlyweds travel to Sydney and Melbourne, from where they returned in early January 1874. They returned to a newly built house 'Southerndown'; then located just outside Timaru in Highfield. Henry Sealy and his wife Emma were living with them until their adjacent house, 'Heathcliffe', was ready by November that year. Sealy cut his leg with a sickle during the time of the Richardson scandal in 1876 and spent a month in bed. He never really recovered from the injury and it caused him ongoing trouble. Many years later, he developed a debilitating paralysis. He died at his home, \\"Southerndown\\", on 30 October 1903 aged 64, and was buried at Timaru Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, five daughters and one son. One daughter had died before him. In its obituary, The Timaru Herald described his exploration in the Southern Alps thus: His wife died at 'Southerndown' on 4 January 1912 aged 56. Within a fortnight of her death, 'Southerndown' was offered for sale. By April 1913, the house had been purchased by A. J. McLean, who renamed it Ardgour. His eldest child, Violet (1875‚Äì1926), married Charles James Peter on 21 December 1898 at St Mary's Church in Timaru. He was the son of the late Hon William Spence Peter, a member of the Legislative Council. Their daughter, Juliet Peter, became a notable potter. Sealy's second eldest child, Frances Helen Mary (1876‚Äì1920), married John Patrick Peter, another son of the Hon W. S. Peter. His fifth child, Ruth Verity (1883‚Äì1960), married William Percy D'Ewes Barker. Her husband was the grandson of Dr Alfred Barker, the early Christchurch photographer noted above. The Barkers had a daughter, Audrey, who died in early 1935 aged 21. Commemoration Church of the Good Shepherd at Lake Tekapo, with the bell commemorating Sealy and one of his granddaughters Sealy's collections of moths, butterflies, and birds' eggs are held by the South Canterbury Museum in Timaru. Sealy owned a first edition of Walter Buller's book A History of the Birds of New Zealand and amended it with his own notes and drawings of bird eggs. The South Canterbury Museum purchased Sealy's book in 2008 to add it to their collection. Many of his photographs are held by the South Canterbury Museum and Canterbury Museum in Christchurch. Von Haast named a number of geographic features in the Southern Alps for him, including Mount Sealy and the Sealy Tarns in the Sealy Range. Sealy Glacier, which feeds Sealy Stream, located in South Westland, are probably also named for Sealy. Sealy Pass above the Godley Glacier commemorates Sealy's 1869 exploration of the glaciers. The driveway to their house 'Southerndown' in the suburb of Highfield is now known as Sealy Street. His brother's house, which was accessed via the same driveway, still stands, is known as 'Craighead', and has given its name to the girls' school, Craighead Diocesan School, that is now occupying the land. When his granddaughter Audrey Barker died in February 1935, the Church of the Good Shepherd at Lake Tekapo was under construction. The Barker and Sealy families donated the bell for the church, commemorating both Audrey Barker and Sealy.

It is currently signed as State Route 31 for its entire length. Waterworks Road transports traffic between the Brisbane central business district and western suburbs such as Red Hill, Ashgrove and The Gap. History Waterworks Road was built on a Turrbal pathway that led to Mount Coot-tha ‚Äì a place of the honey-bee Dreaming. It was surveyed and named in 1864 as a direct route to the site of the Enoggera Dam, which was built from 1864 to 1866. A small Catholic Church was built on Waterworks Road in 1921, and St Finbarr‚Äôs Catholic primary school in 1925. The tram line was extended from Red Hill to Jubilee Terrace in 1924, and then to Coopers Camp Road in 1935. This line operated continuously until it was closed in 1969. Examples of 1920s and later trams are shown. Route Connecting to the terminus of Musgrave Road (which leads into the city), Waterworks Road begins as a four-lane road in Red Hill. The road then leads into the central section of Ashgrove and intersects with major roads such as Jubilee Terrace and Stewart Road. Once the road reaches West Ashgrove, it is divided into two roads; the inbound road being Glory Street. After intersecting Coopers Camp Road, Waterworks Road forms back into a single, four-lane road and continues into The Gap. Once in The Gap, Waterworks Road intersects with Settlement Road, which connects traffic from The Gap to Keperra. Following this major intersection, Waterworks Road becomes a two-lane road and terminates at The Gap Park 'n' Ride. It connects to Mount Nebo Road, which travels to rural suburbs Mount Nebo and Mount Glorious. In most sections of the road, there is a T2 Lane which operates between 7-9am on weekdays. Terrain From Musgrave Road, Waterworks Road descends the north-western slope of Red Hill until it crosses Ithaca Creek. It then climbs to the ridge line between Ithaca Creek and Enoggera Creek, and continues west to the Coopers Camp Road intersection. From there it descends rapidly into the Enoggera Creek valley and proceeds west into the gap between the Taylor Range to the north and Mount Coot-tha to the south. After crossing Enoggera Creek at Walton Bridge it follows the ridge line between Enoggera Creek and Fish Creek to its transition to Mt Nebo Road. Upgrade In 2018, it was proposed that Waterworks Road required an upgrade between Trout Street and Beth Eden Terrace in Ashgrove to improve traffic efficiency, reduce congestion and improve safety of road users. The upgrade includes the addition of a secondary right- turn lane on the Waterworks Road - Stewart Road intersection, the addition of a left-turn lane on the Waterworks Road - Ashgrove Avenue intersection and the relocation of Bus stop 16 on Waterworks Road. Construction began in April 2019. Local heritage places The Brisbane City Council has defined a number of local heritage places in Waterworks Road under the Queensland Heritage Act 1992. They are: * Stewart Place (including war memorial and tram shelter) * Residences at 150 and 180 Waterworks Road * Churches at 202 and 290 Waterworks Road * Ashgrove Private Hospital (former) * Montvue Buildings * Ithaca Bridge * Two tram shelters (example shown) Major intersections The entire road is in the Brisbane local government area.

It is located in Tizim√≠n Municipality, northeast Yucatan, Mexico.Kulub√°, ruinas mayas entre ranchos El Camino mas corto, retrieved Dec 27, 2019 The site contains a palace, an altar, ruins of two residences, and a round structure believed to be an oven. The palace measures tall, long and wide, and is believed to have been inhabited between 600-1050 CE.Mayan palace at least 1,000 years old uncovered by archeologists in Mexico Sky News, Dec 27, 2019 A 1,000-year old Maya palace was discovered in Kulub√° in 1939, by American archeologist Wyllys Andrews.  Etymology  According to the Mayan language specialist, William Brito Sansores (The writing of the Maya,1981), the name Kulub√°, consists of the words K'ulu', which refers to a species of wild dog, and ha', water, that is, \\"water of kulu\\" Transliteration of the Maya language has yielded several spelling variations. The name Kulub√° has been commonly used in the 21st century. Andrews titled his initial article 'Culuba', starting with a C and omitting any accent on the a.  Site contents  Kulub√° consists of three main architectural structures. They are believed to be residential sets of important lineages. Next to these have been stone alignments that were probably the foundations of large wooden structures. The site is about in diameter and some 300 smaller structures had been discovered by 2009. = Group C = The main structure, called Group C, was discovered in the winter of 1939‚Äì1940E. Wyllys Andrews IV.: The ruins of Culub√°n Northeastern Yucat√°n. In: Notes on Middle American Archaeology and Ethnology 1, 1941, pp. 11‚Äì14.. It is built on a base of two meters high and measures . The main building is the Masquerade Palace, a vaulted creak divided into six rooms. The main frieze has been lost, but it is known that in the corners there were Snakes of Toltec style and that the panels of the walls contained Chaac masks, with a clear influence of Chichen Itza . = Group B = On one platform stands the six-room building, the partially well-preserved back of which has a facade design that combines many elements of the Puuc style, but in a form that can be found both in the late Uxmal style and in Chichen Itza. For this purpose, the crumpled sembfelt sembrooms of the tripartite plinth are as characteristic as the cascades of Chaac masks, which are not, as in the Puuc style, related to striking architectural points, such as entrances and corners, and the division of the upper wall surface into fields with different d√©cor. The south side of the building is badly damaged and no longer has any recognizable facade details. At the right angle to the described building is another one with five rooms, from which the entrance to the middle is reminiscent of the Chenes-style snake-mouthed portals. The tripartite base with alternating smooth surfaces, sifting groups and fields with slanted grids corresponds to the mammalian style of the Puuc. = Group A = The only well- preserved structure of this group consists of five rooms in a row, with another arranged behind the larger central space. This floor plan is common in Chaac style. The facade decoration of the entire wall surfaces with cladding stones, which have a roughly horseshoe-shaped pattern, is atypical.  History of rediscovery  The first modern rediscovery efforts began in the winter of 1939 to 1940, with Wyllys Andrews' trip to the Yucatan specifically to explore the site. In 1965, Victor Segovia Pinto visited the site, and in 1980, the INAH Yucatan Center began restoration. In 2017 and 2018, significant funds were allocated to its restoration. Scientists were exploring a possible reforestation of the area to protect it from weather damage.

A horror-thriller film, it tells the story of a zombie apocalypse, it contains elements of social satire. It is Venezuela's first zombie film. The film has received several awards and nominations. It is seen by many to contain anti-Chavismo commentary, and has been banned in Venezuela.  Synopsis  As a new strain of rabies takes hold of Venezuelan capital Caracas, Dr. Adam Vargas and friend Johnny fight their way across the city to an international laboratory to create a cure, while also trying to find Adam's son who was staying in the countryside with his grandparents. They meet a doctor from Switzerland who has been sent to investigate the epidemic. It contains \\"post-epidemic interviews\\" during the end credits.  Cast  Cast listed in review * Rub√©n Guevara as Dr. Adam Vargas * Leonidas Urbina as Johnny * Magdiel Gonz√°lez * Genna Chanelle Hayes as Dr. Lucy Blake * Luca de Lima as Miguel \\"Miguelito\\" Vargas  Production  The film was shot over 64 locations in Venezuela, including around Maracay. A report by Stephen Gibbs for CGTN America about the production described some difficulties that had been encountered in creating the film. For example, to ensure the cast and crew's safety, police were stationed around and on the sets; director Flavio Pedota said that the police were there \\"most of the time\\". The film also suffered from its low budget and the fact that it was being made during the time of shortages in Venezuela. Pedota has said that the crew managed to cheaply improvise many items of equipment and props, which they otherwise would have needed to import. He also gives the example of set-dressing during a scene that required abandoned cars on a main highway, saying that they found many such cars already at the location; Gibbs noted that making an apocalypse film in Venezuela gave the production \\"a pre-made film set\\". Infection is an independent film with no support from Venezuelan film bodies. It was intended to be released in 2017, but began crowdfunding to complete its post-production in Mexico in 2018. In 2017 it had been shown at the Guadalajara Works in Progress festival, winning two prizes. It is Pedota's first feature film, though he has been working on films for several years. Gibbs noted that the film was being made as the Zika epidemic reached Venezuela but before people knew it had spread to the country, calling the film \\"remarkably prescient\\". The only non-Venezuelan actor in the film is the Australian Genna Chanelle, a friend of Pedota's whom he asked to be involved. She says that she was fearful of traveling to Venezuela for it.  Release  In January 2020, as an act of defiance against the ban, the film was screened independently around Venezuela, in M√©rida, Maracaibo, Barquisimeto and Caracas, including in the Alfredo Sadel Square.  Response  Infection was nominated for the Best Ibero-American Film award at the 2019 Guadalajara International Film Festival, and won a Best Makeup and Best Actor award (for Rub√©n Guevara) at the 2019 Skiptown Playhouse International Film Festival. At Skiptown Playhouse it was also nominated for Wardrobe, Production Design, Special Effects, Sound Design, Cinematography and Director. It was also screened at the 2019 Raindance Film Festival. For Variety, John Hopewell writes that the film has good production values and impressive shots of Caracas. He says it \\"can be read as social allegory\\". Javier Fernandez further writes that it \\"highlights a Latin American political problem, the destruction of a political and cultured class in a class struggle which spreads to the rest of Latin America\\". CinePremiere agrees that the film contains a social narrative, saying that being set \\"in a destroyed region, the film uses the zombie genre to talk about the socio- political context of Venezuela today\\". Corina J Poore says that the film features \\"the fastest zombies [she's] ever seen\\", which are shown as breaking into houses and vandalizing abandoned cars, noting that this makes the film different. Poore comments on the social situation, too: she notes that in one shot a dead body lies beneath a sign reading 'An achievement of the Bolivarian Revolution', and the film contains anti-Maduro graffiti. Pedota, the writer and director of the film, has said that political, social, and health issues can be \\"interpreted in many different ways\\" but he \\"doesn't want to be the guy who tells you what the film is about, [he wants] people to explore it and have different interpretations\\". The film was banned in Venezuela. Victor Drax of the Caracas Chronicles writes that horror is a genre often censored around the world, but it is popular in Venezuela, so the film has not been censored for its horrific content; he says that, instead, it has been censored because of its anti-Chavismo content. Talking to the magazine, Pedota maintained that \\"[he] filmed about our nation today. Wherever you point your camera at, that's what you see\\"; Drax concludes that \\"Chavismo doesn't care about censoring zombies and gore, it cares about censoring reality [...] reflected on the screen.\\"  See also  *Bolivarian Revolution in film *List of banned films  References   External links  * Category:2019 films Category:2019 horror thriller films Category:Censored films Category:Films about zombies Category:Kickstarter-funded films Category:South American horror films Category:Venezuelan films ","title":"Infection (2019 film)"},{"id":"62673065","text":"Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (also known as FedDev Ont) is a Canadian federal government agency responsible for fostering the innovation and business growth in southern Ontario region.

Background A Harry Payne Whitney homebred, Whichone was a full brother to Mother Goose, herself an American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly in 1924. Their sire was Chicle who was bred and foaled in France by their American owner due to the complete shutdown of horseracing in 1911 and 1912 in the state of New York as a result of the Legislature's passage of the Hart‚ÄìAgnew Law. Brought to the United States by owner/breeder Harry Payne Whitney, Chicle would become the Leading sire in North America in 1929 and the Leading broodmare sire in North America in 1942. Chicle was the son of Spearmint, winner of the Epsom Derby in England and the Grand Prix de Paris in France, both races the then most prestigious in their country. Spearmint became the outstanding sire whose progeny included Johren, Plucky Liege Royal Lancer, Spion Kop. Danny Maher, U. S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee and twice the British flat racing Champion Jockey was quoted as saying that Spearmint was the best horse he ever rode. Spearmint's sire Carbine was a New Zealand Racing Hall of Fame and Australian Racing Hall of Fame inductee. Chicle won the 1915 Champagne Stakes in fast time beating a field of six other runners including Friar Rock who in 1916 would be named American Horse of the Year. Chicle beat Friar Rock again in the 1916 Brooklyn Derby. The dam of Whichone, and Mother Goose, was the unraced Flying Witch. She was a daughter of the three time Leading sire and U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Broomstick who in turn was sired by Ben Brush, twice a U.S. National Champion runner and Leading Sire as well as a U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee. 1929: Two-year-old season Trained by Jimmy Rowe Jr. and ridden by Linus McAtee, in 1929 the two-year-old Whichone had wins in three stakes races. His first came in the August 10 Saratoga Special Stakes at Saratoga Race Course where he won by six lengths in beating eight other juveniles. On August 31, Whichone finished second in the Hopeful Stakes to his H. P. Whitney owned stablemate Boojum. The colt's biggest win would come on September 9 in the Belmont Futurity. In a field of 17, Whichone defeated Hi-Jack by four lengths with Gallant Fox another ¬Ω length further back. Not only was the Futurity the richest race anywhere in the world, Whichone earned $100,730 marking the first time in American history any horse had earned $100,000 for first place money. The win cemented Whichone's two-year-old Champion honors. Whichone's final stakes win of 1929 came in the Champagne Stakes, a race won by his sire Chicle in 1915. For his efforts, Whichone earned $5,825, a minuscule purse compared to the Futurity. but one that would prove costly because the colt came out of the race with an injury that would keep him out of the 1930 Kentucky Derby won by Gallant Fox who he had easily beaten by 6¬Ω lengths in the Futurity. 1930: Three-year-old season T. J. Healey, the Whitney stable's head trainer took over Whichone's race conditioning for his three-year-old campaign. Jimmy Rowe Jr. become head trainer for Greentree Stable belonging to Harry Whitney's sister-in-law, Helen Hay Whitney. By early May 1930, Whichone's injury seemed behind him and he was back in training. In mid May it was reported the colt appeared sound and was scheduled to make his first start of the year on May 31 in the one mile Withers Stakes at Belmont Park. In a tune-up race for the 1930 Belmont Stakes Whichone showed very good form with an easy win in the May 28 Ballot Handicap over one mile at Belmont Park. Three days later, on a slow Belmont Park track, Whichone almost leisurely captured the May 31 Withers Stakes by four lengths in the slow time of 1:38 1/5 for the mile. Under instructions from trainer Healey, jockey Raymond Workman continued running for another quarter mile in preparation for the mile and one-half Belmont Stakes. A June 3, 1930 Daily Racing Form story on the upcoming 1930 Belmont Stakes reported on the opinion of various horsemen as to whether it would be Whichone or Gallant Fox that would come out on top. The consensus was that Whichone would be the victor, the DRF stating it was important to note that for the most part the votes for the Whitney colt came from trainers and jockeys while those supporting Gallant Fox were handicappers and others who closely study horseracing. Among those jockeys and trainers who chose Whichone were future Hall of Fame inductees Laverne Fator, Mack Garner, Max Hirsch, Willie Knapp, and \\"Dick\\" Thompson. The Belmont would be Whichone's third start in 11 days and he finished second in a field of just four runners. On a track rated only as good, Whichone struggled until they made the turn for home but his challenge was not enough to catch Gallant Fox who won easily by three lengths and becoming the second horse to win the U.S. Triple Crown. Scheduled to compete against Gallant Fox again in the June 28 Dwyer Stakes, yet again Whichone came up with another injury and had to be scratched. The quartercrack in a forefoot kept the colt out of racing until the August 6 Saranac Handicap at the Saratoga Race Course. Described as a \\"brilliant comeback\\" by the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Whichone not only won with ease, he ran the mile in the fastest time of the racing season. Just three days later, Whichone got another easy win in the Whitney Stakes. Simply galloping over the finishing line he still won by four lengths. With all eyes watching the popular colt for any signs of leg trouble, the Form Chart for the mile and one-quarter race took an unusual step with a statement that said \\"He pulled up sound.\\" Once again, three days after that win, Whichone ran in the August 12 Miller Stakes as a final prep for the very important Travers Stakes in which he would be certain to meet Gallant Fox again. Whichone earned a third straight win in the 41st running of the Miller Stakes at Saratoga. He did it in the very fast time of 1:56 2/5 for a mile and three-sixteenths which broke the stakes record set by Enfilade in 1918 and equaled by the legendary Man o' War in 1920. =The Jim Dandy Travers= In what would become the most talked about upset in American Thoroughbred racing folklore, a 100 to 1 longshot named Jim Dandy won the August 16, 1930 Travers Stakes beating runner-up Gallant Fox by six lengths. Whichone finished five lengths further back in third being pulled up by jockey Raymond Workman when he knew the horse was seriously hurt. This latest injury turned out to be a career-ending bowed tendon. At stud Harry Whitney died on October 26, 1930 and his horse racing stable and stud farm would be passed on to his son Cornelius Vanderbilt \\"Sonny\\" Whitney. Whichone was retired to stand at Whitney's Kentucky stud farm beginning in 1931. While he would never sire any runner that was even remotely close to being his equal on the racetrack, he did produce several that met with some success. From Whichone's first crop in 1932, a colt bred and retained by Sonny Whitney named Today looked very promising after he won the 1935 Wood Memorial Stakes by three lengths. Among a field of 12, that the New York Times described as \\"the most formidable eligibles\\" for the Kentucky Derby, were Plat Eye owned by the Greentree Stable, the Brookmeade Stable colt Psychic Bid, William Ziegler Jr.'s very good filly Esposa, who would become the 1937 and 1938 American Champion Older Female Horse, and Omaha, a son of Whichone's great rival Gallant Fox. Other of Whichone's progeny who met with some success in racing included winners: Whichee (1934) gelding : San Francisco Handicap, Los Angeles Handicap, San Antonio Handicap Bourbon King (1935) colt : Remsen Stakes, Chesapeake Stakes Handcuff (1935) filly : Wakefield Stakes, Acorn Stakes, Alabama Stakes, Delaware Oaks Triplane (1935) gelding: Longacres Mile Handicap Pedigree References Category:1933 racehorse births Category:1944 racehorse deaths Category:Thoroughbred racehorses Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:American racehorses Category:American Champion racehorses Category:Whitney racehorses ","title":"Whichone"},{"id":"62673260","title":"Parliament of the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic"},{"id":"62673267","text":"The 1952 Tennessee A&I; Tigers football team represented Tennessee Agricultural & Industrial State College as a member of the Midwest Athletic Association (MAA) during the 1952 college football season.

It can take on a variety of meanings, but the constant thread is the lived experience of women. History Various women's theaters started up in the 1970s and 1980s, an outgrowth of the political and social activism of the times. Early leaders included Michelene Wandor, Martha Boesing, Caryl Churchill and The Women's Theater Group (renamed as Sphinx Theatre Company in 1999) in London. During the 1970s and 1980s, feminist or women's theater was a specific, new type of theater. Since then, the theater genre itself has opened itself up to women's viewpoints. Some felt that it was no longer necessary to have a separate genre, because of increased parity. Many groups folded. However, even with that increased parity, men's roles continue to outweigh women's roles in mainstream theater, and the situations and challenges facing women continue to be severe. There are currently a large number of theaters again that are either explicitly feminist, explicitly women's theaters, or that define themselves as inclusive of women's perspectives specifically. Variability Feminist theater defies definition because, by its nature, it is about breaking boundaries and experimentation. Catherine Castellani says, \\"Historical play, science fiction, any class, any race, experimental or straight-forward, there is no formula for a feminist play because there is no formula for how to be human.\\" Global The Women's Movement resulted in feminist theatre around the U.S., in England, and in other parts of the world in the 1970s, and it has continued to be a global genre ever since. One of the earliest feminist theatre's in England was the Sphinx Theatre Company (originally called the Women's Theatre Group). Another theater in Adelaide that started in the 1970s also called itself the Women's Theatre Group. The oldest feminist theatre in the United States is Spiderwoman Theatre, a Native American Theatre founded in 1976. There are numerous feminist theatre companies around the globe, and although most tend to be situated in major Western cities (New York City, Chicago, London), the majority of them produce works based in the intersections of women of color and LGBTQ women. Some of them also raise money for prevention of violence against women. Some examples include the Manhattan Shakespeare Project, La Luna Productions, LezCab, Women Center Stage Festival, and Teatro Luna. Numerous theatres tend to focus on specific cultural performance traditions, such as La Luna Productions, which does modern works with primarily female characters, but uses the Japanese theatrical style Kabuki. = In Canada = Canada's oldest feminist theatre company is the Toronto-based Nightwood Theatre, formed in 1979. Nightwood was not originally founded as a feminist theatre but eventually garnered a reputation for producing female-centred shows. Other Canadian feminist theatre companies include Toronto's Company of Sirens and The Clichettes, Quebec's Th√©√¢tre Exp√©rimental des Femmes (since rebranded as Th√©√¢tre Espace Go) and Le Theatre Parminou, Winnipeg's Sarasvati Productions and Nellie McClung, and Calgary's Urban Curvz (later rebranded as Handsome Alice) and Maenad Theatre. Many of Canada's earliest feminist theatre companies, including Nightwood, Company of Sirens, and Urban Curvz, were founded as collectives. Canada has also been home to several annual feminist theatre festivals including FemFest, Women in View and the Groundswell Festival. = In India = Feminist theatre rose to prominence in India in the 1970s. In the late 70s and early 80s, much of the feminist theatre of India was street theatre. Beginning in the 1980s, women began to take on the traditionally male roles of playwright and theatre director. Some of India's feminist theatre companies include Jana Natya Manch and Sampurna Trust. India has hosted a number of feminist theatre festivals including Akka, the National Women's Theatre Festival (in Mysore in 2001), National Women's Theatre Festival (organized by Prithvi Theatre), and the National Workshop on Women. = In the United Kingdom = One of the United Kingdom's earliest feminist theatre groups, The Women's Street Theatre Group, was founded in 1970 and garnered national attention for interrupting the broadcast of the 1970 Miss World competition at the Royal Albert Hall. Many early members of The Women's Street Theatre Group and similar UK-based feminist theatre groups in the early 1970s had little to no formal theatre training. The first Women's Theatre Festival was held in 1973 in London to support emerging feminist theatre companies in the area. The Women's Theatre Group was founded in 1974 and the Monstrous Regiment Theatre Company was formed the following year. Many influential British feminist plays received their first performances including but not limited to Claire Luckham and Chris Bond's Scum: Death, Destruction and Dirty Washing (1976), Caryl Churchill‚Äôs Vinegar Tom (1976), and Pam Gems‚Äôs Queen Christina (1977). Other UK-based feminist theatre companies include Clean Break, Mrs. Worthington's Daughters, Cunning Stunts, Siren, Scarlet Harlets, Burnt Bridges Theatre Company, Blood Group, Little Women, RashDash, and Sensible Footwear. Challenges Feminist theatre faces internal and external challenges, starting with variable meanings of the word feminist. Since its onset, there have been additional direct challenges relating to funding, media backlash, and fit within existing theater contexts. Third wave feminism had different goals and methods than second wave feminism. The goals of feminist theatre continue to be extreme, including exploration of social injustices and inequalities in order to identify transformative possibilities and solutions. Today, gender privilege and bias continue to be both the subject and the challenge for feminist theatre.

The company employees were officially considered to be in his majesty's service and were responsible directly to Lisbon. History The chartered company was founded by Marquis of Pombal, then a powerful Portuguese minister, to develop and control commercial activity in the State of Gr√£o-Par√° and Maranh√£o, including a monopoly of the trade in African slaves, given the prohibition of enslaving the indigenous peoples of the region, and of the naval transport of all merchandise to the region for a period of 20 years. In accumulating so many privileges, the chartered company also caused resentment toward the local elites, which was neglected by the Marquis of Pombal who wanted to protect his financial interests in the region. As an additional advantage for the government was that its control of the company gave it the means to cover up the widespread practice of smuggling and tax evasion. With all of the company's activities, trade with Portugal, previously minimal, began to prosper. Ships of the company left Bel√©m, founded in 1616 by the kingdom, weighed down with rice, cotton, cocoa, ginger, wood and medicinal plants, and moreover the slave trafficking. Between 1755 and 1777, the estimated population of African slaves - they had been taken from their homes in Cacheu, Bissau and Angola \\\\- grew from 3,000 to 12,000, all of whom had been bought with company funds. With the death of the King of Portugal, Joseph I, and the fall of his powerful statesman the Marquis of Pombal, the period known as Viradeira began. Mary I Queen, Joseph I's daughter, was contended with all of the Marquis of Pombal's policies, and in 1778 she not only revoked the monopoly but closed the company itself.

History and Description The town of Atina was leveled by an earthquake on 9 September 1349. Reconstruction was patronized by the aristocratic Cantelmo family. The town was rebuilt at the original site of the Ancient Roman town, and a hamlet built by the Counts of Aquino. The Duke of Alvito, Rostaino Cantelmo, decided to build the fortress-like palace in the highest point in the town. Construction lasted over two centuries. In the meantime, feudal owner ship of the town underwent many changes. In 1595, the palace was bought by the Gallio family. But by the 18th century it became property of the Paniccia family of Vicalvi. In 1870, it was sold to the town council. For a period it was used as a prison. In the early 1900s, the palace housed a theatre and hall for meeting, modified by Giuseppe Visocchi. The tall facade has three mullioned windows and above three oval rose windows. The main portal has a pointed Gothic arch. Above the entrance is an Ancient Roman spolia, poorly conserved, of a low relief depicting a votive offering, dating to the first Imperial period. To the right of the portal is an Ancient Roman statue, presumably of a high ranking official, but nicknamed Pasquino. Flanking the facade are two medieval rectangular towers. The first floor has a large hall, which displays Ancient Roman floor mosaics from the 2nd century BC. The mosaics depict armed Samnite warriors set between panels of geometrical designs. This mosaic was discovered in 1946 during excavations in Via Virilassi in the town. On the second floor is another large hall, and the chapel of San Onofrio. The chapel has 14th century frescoes depicting the Madonna and Child with St. John the Baptist, Christ in Glory and the saints Onofrio, John the Evangelist and Michael the Archangel. The palace also preserves frescoes detached from the local church of San Marco. They depict Martyrdom of St Dario and Scenes of Courtly Life. The palace now serves as the Town Hall, the Register Office, and a display on the archeology of the region.Atina tourism site.

It contains only a single species, Cabarzia trostheidei, which is based on a well-preserved skeleton found in red beds of the Goldlauter Formation. Cabarzia shared many similarities with Mesenosaurus romeri (a varanopid from Russia), although it did retain some differences, such as more curved claws, a wide ulnare, and muscle scars on its sacral ribs. With long, slender hindlimbs, a narrow body, an elongated tail, and short, thick forelimbs, Cabarzia was likely capable of running bipedally to escape from predators, a behavior shared by some modern lizards. It is the oldest animal known to have adaptations for bipedal locomotion, predating Eudibamus, a bipedal bolosaurid parareptile from the slightly younger Tambach Formation.  Discovery  Cabarzia is known from a single articulated skeleton, missing only the head, neck, and portions of the shoulder, tail, and left limbs. This holotype specimen, NML-G2017/001, was discovered in 1989 by Frank Trostheide, a fossil collector prospecting at the Cabarz Quarry in the Thuringian Forest of Germany. This quarry preserves a large portion of the Goldlauter Formation, which is a sequence of Early Permian red beds, lake sediments, and volcanic layers slightly older than the nearby Artinskian or Kungurian-age red beds of the Tambach Formation. Preliminary study of the specimen tentatively considered it an araeoscelidian diapsid reptile, but a 2019 study by Frederik Spindler, Ralf Werneburg, and J√∂rg W. Schneider reasoned against that assignment after comparing the postcranial anatomy of small Permian amniotes such as basal synapsids, parareptiles, and eureptiles. They argued that it was likely a varanopid closely related to Mesenosaurus, part of the subfamily Mesenosaurinae which they had named the previous year. The specimen was assigned the name Cabarzia trostheidei in honor of both the locale of its collection and its collector.  Description  The dorsal vertebrae have long centra and widely spaced zygapophyses, giving them an hourglass shape when seen from above. Their neural spines are low, rectangular and blade-like. Cabarzia's vertebrae were relatively simple by varanopid standards, with no distinct lateral excavations or mammillary processes. Mesenosaurus also lacks these characteristics. The seemingly holocephalous (single-headed) ribs, which were already short to begin with, diminished further towards the hip. There were likely only two sacral vertebrae, based on the number of sacral ribs. All of the sacral ribs apparently flared out to the same extent as they contacted the pelvis, like Mesenosaurus, although Cabarzia additionally possessed knob- like scars on the upper surface of its sacral ribs. The caudal (tail) vertebrae were fairly elongated, with thick, hook-shaped caudal ribs proportionally similar to those of Apsisaurus. Preserved portions of the shoulder girdle indicate that Cabarzia had a thin scapula with a convex front edge. The pelvis included an ilium with a long and low dorsal blade and a pubis with a small tubercule. The forelimb is short and robust relative to the long and slender hindlimb. The humerus in particular is thick, with a large entepicondyle. Cabarzia's entepicondylar foramen was located near the elbow, a far position only otherwise seen in Mesenosaurus among basal synapsids. The radius was relatively short (only slightly longer than the humerus) and was straight, unlike the twisted radius of Mesenosaurus. Most of Cabarzia's carpals (wrist bones) were proportionally similar to those of Mesenosaurus, with a broad intermedium and fairly large proximal carpals and centrale/centralia. However, it also differs due to its characteristically wide ulnare and the retention of two centralia. A tiny pisiform bone is also preserved, much smaller than that of varanodontines. On the other hand, the relative metacarpal proportions of Cabarzia are close to varanodontines. The femur is neither particularly robust nor slender, but it does have a thin and angular internal trochanter. Like other varanopids (and diapsids), the tibia and fibula were each relatively long, more than 80% the length of the femur. The ratio of the tibia to the longest toe in the foot (the fourth toe) is 3:4, like Mesenosaurus. The astragalus was large and simple, and the calcaneum abutted it along a slightly concave edge surrounding a narrow hole. The fourth distal tarsal is large and unfused to the fifth distal tarsal. As in Mesenosaurus, the elongated fourth metatarsal had a proximal projection which contacted the short fifth metatarsal. The position of the fossil suggests Cabarzia had a fifth toe which was angled relative to the rest of the foot. One of the most clear differences between Cabarzia and Mesenosaurus was the fact that Mesenosaurus had long but rather straight unguals while those of Cabarzia were shorter, deeper, and sharply curved, a characteristic also known in the hands of Tambacarnifex.  Paleobiology  Fused neural spines and well-ossified joints indicate that the holotype specimen of Cabarzia was an adult animal. The curved claws of Cabarzia and Tambacarnifex were likely adapted for predation, in contrast to the more straight claws of Mesenosaurus and Varanops which may have been more useful for digging. The broad ulnare is an adaptation also seen in aquatic animals, although there is no other evidence for aquatic habits in Cabarzia. Cabarzia's proportions (short forelimbs, thin body, long hindlimbs and tail) are similar to those of modern lizards capable of bipedalism. They also match the Tambach bolosaurid Eudibamus, although the 'sprawling\\" ankle and foot of Cabarzia are not as specialized for bipedal habits. This may indicate that Cabarzia did not engage in active bipedalism (slow, methodical walking on the hindlimbs) but rather passive bipedalism (a shift into a bipedal posture when running at high speeds, due to the center of weight being behind the hindlimbs). The advantage of passive bipedalism is not fully understood, even in living reptiles, though it may be involved with increased coordination or assistance in the capture of flying insects. Other \\"mesenosaurines\\" (such as Mesenosaurus) shared Cabarzia's adaptations for bipedalism, and may have had increased hip musculature to habituate to the lifestyle further. Information on \\"mesenosaurine\\" foot proportions afforded by the description of Cabarzia indicates that they are good candidates for the trackmakers of Dromopus, a common Permian reptile footprint ichnogenus which has traditionally been assumed to have been created by araeoscelidian diapsids. Although no known Dromopus fossils seem to correspond to bipedal animals, this is likely due to bipedalism in \\"mesenosaurines\\" being restricted to rare circumstances where they are forced to escape predators. As Cabarzia is the oldest known \\"mesenosaurine\\" and predates the previously oldest known bipedal animal (Eudibamus) in Thuringian stratigraphy, Cabarzia can be considered the oldest animal known to have practiced bipedalism.

Selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes requires circumventing over-oxidation to the carboxylic acid. One popular approach are methods that proceed through intermediate alkoxysulfonium species (, e.g. compound 6) as detailed here. Since most of these methods employ dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as oxidant and generate dimethylsulfide, these are often colloquially summarized as DMSO- oxidations. Conceptually, generating an aldehyde and dimethylsulfide from an alcohol and DMSO requires a dehydrating agent for removal of H2O, ideally an electrophile simultaneously activating DMSO. In contrast, methods generating the sulfonium intermediate from dimethylsulfide do not require a dehydrating agent. Closely related are oxidations mediated by dimethyl selenoxide and by dimethyl selenide. Comparison with related methods In comparisons, sulfonium-based methods are popular because reactions are efficient (high yields, comparably fast, no over-oxidation, few side reactions, reproducible results), reaction conditions are mild (low temperature, no strong acids or bases), reactions are operationally simple (no specialized equipment or uncommon and/or costly reagents necessary, byproducts often easily separated, tolerant of oxygen and moisture,) and they generally avoid highly toxic starting materials and toxic waste disposal. However, the reactions are not too popular with many undergraduate chemistry students in the laboratory since the common byproduct dimethylsulfide is a strong odorant, reminiscent of fouling eggs, that requires a well-ventilated fume hood. Other drawbacks might include excess of base, handling of the dehydrating agent, limited choice of solvent or side reactions at elevated temperature, e.g. Pummerer rearrangement or elimination of the sulfonium intermediate to the reactive H2C=(S+)-CH3-species that form methylthiomethyl ethers with alcohols. In consequence this means that the activity of the oxidation can not be tuned at will by increasing the reaction temperature, e.g. to force oxidation of an unreactive alcohol. Common alternatives to these sulfonium-based methods are oxidations with *hypervalent iodine (e.g. Dess-Martin,IBX), *chromium reagents (e.g. PCC, Collins), *ruthenium oxides (e.g. TPAP), *oxoammonium species (e.g. TEMPO), *transfer hydrogenation or hydride transfer (e.g. Oppenauer) and *MnO2, BaMnO4, DDQ for allylic alcohols. Categories The sulfonium oxidations can be categorized into two groups: The methods discovered earliest rely on activated alcohols like alkyl tosylates (Kornblum) or alkyl chloroformates (from reaction of alcohols with phosgene: Barton-Kornblum) that react as electrophiles when treated with DMSO, liberating an oxygenated leaving group (e.g. ). However, the additional step for pre-activation of the alcohol and sometimes harsh reaction conditions for the nucleophilic displacement proved less convenient. Therefore, methods generating activated sulfoxides have been developed later. Depicted below is the activated sulfoxide generated during Swern oxidation 4 reacting with a secondary alcohol 5 to form alkoxysulfonium species 6. The mechanism of the Swern oxidation. These activated sulfoxides react as electrophiles when treated with an alcohol, expelling a leaving group that might simultaneously function as counter-ion to the alkoxysulfonium species () generated. Upon deprotonation ‚Äì usually assisted by a mild base like triethylamine ‚Äì the alkoxysulfonium species decomposes, yielding the aldehyde and dimethylsulfide. The latter collection contains popular oxidations like *Swern, *Corey-Kim, *Parikh- Doering, * Pfitzner-Moffatt and also includes Albright-Goldman, Albright- Onodera (DMSO/P2O5), TFAA/DMSO (Swern) and Me2S/Cl2.

After graduating from Makerere University, he enlisted in the Tanzania People's Defence Force in 1965. He held various positions in the army, including head of the National Leadership Academy, and served as a brigadier during the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War of 1978 and 1979. He retired with the rank of major general in 1992, and subsequently worked as a government administrator. He chaired the Tanzania Commission for AIDS from 2001 until 2007, and died in 2014.  Early life  Herman Lupogo was born on 12 December 1938 in Mbinga District, Tanganyika. He studied at Makerere University in Uganda from 1958 until 1964, graduating as a Master of Arts with a teaching certificate. While there he served as chairman of Northcote Hall, and in 1962 he performed in the first showing of Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o's play, The Black Hermit, at the Ugandan National Theatre.  Career  = Military service = Lupogo joined the Tanzania People's Defence Force (TPDF) on 23 July 1965 and was commissioned as an officer on 21 January 1966. Three years later he went to Canada to study international diplomacy. In 1970 he went to North Korea as part of a military delegation to inspect units of the Korean People's Army. From 1971 to 1974 Lupogo was Commandant of the TPDF's Officer Cadet School and from 1974 until 1976 he acted as the Tanganyika African National Union's assistant secretary for defence and security. From 1976 until 1978 he acted as the head of the National Leadership Academy. In 1978 war broke out between Uganda and Tanzania. The TPDF embarked on a programme of expansion and in January 1979 Lupogo acted as a recruitment officer at the military camp in Makambako. Later that year Tanzania launched an invasion of Uganda. Lupogo, with the rank of brigadier, was given command of the TPDF's 205th Brigade. When Tanzanian commanders feared that a Ugandan regiment was due to attack them from Mubende, they dispatched Lupogo and his brigade north from Masaka to intercept it. The 205th Brigade encountered entrenched Uganda Army troops in the town of Sembabule, marking the beginning of a three-week-long battle. Lupogo deployed his men in small units and attempted repeatedly to dislodge the Ugandans. Their efforts were unsuccessful and Tanzanian morale steadily dropped until TPDF commanders decided to withdraw Lupogo and replace him with Brigadier Muhiddin Kimario. Lupogo transferred command to Kimario while the brigade headquarters was taking fire. Kimario revised the Tanzanians' strategy and the 205th Brigade was eventually able to secure the town. After the fall of Kampala, Lupogo was contacted by one of his former professors from Makerere University about the status of the body of Hans Poppe, a Tanzanian police official who had been killed in a 1971 border clash with Uganda and since kept in a Kampala mortuary. Lupogo helped arrange for Poppe's body to be repatriated. In 1985 Lupogo went to the United Kingdom to study international military strategy. He retired from the TPDF with the rank of major general on 11 September 1992. = Administrative service = Following the end of his military service, Lupogo acted variously as the Regional Commissioner for Iringa, Director General of the Arusha International Conference Centre, and Board Chairman of the Benjamin Mkapa Foundation. In December 2000 he was appointed Chairman of the Tanzania Commission for AIDS. He took up the post in 2001, and served until his term expired in January 2007.  Later life  After retiring Lupogo moved to the ward of Mikocheni B in Dar es Salaam. He had a wife and several children. He fell ill and died on 19 October 2014 at Lugalo Military Hospital in Dar es Salaam at the age of 76. President Jakaya Kikwete expressed his condolences to the TPDF and Lupogo's family in his wake, and thanked him for his service to the country. Lupogo was buried at Kinondoni cemetery in Dar es Salaam.

According to Bar Hebraeus, Theodore was a monk in the desert of Skete in Egypt who later moved to the monastery of Qenneshre in Syria. He was consecrated as patriarch of Antioch by the bishop Abraham of Emesa. Sources disagree on the date of Theodore's consecration as patriarch, as it is placed in December 649 by Bar Hebraeus in his Ecclesiastical History, whilst the Zuqnin Chronicle dates the consecration to 650/1. He continued to reside at Qenneshre for the duration of his term as patriarch. The vita of Theodotus of Amida relates that, when the young Theodotus, a monk of Qenneshre, was preparing to leave the monastery, Theodore convinced him to prolong his stay for one year because he foresaw that his own death was approaching. Theodotus remained in Qenneshre until Theodore's death, and attended the patriarch's funeral before making a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and Egypt. The vita also attests that the patriarch was mourned by Christians and Muslims alike. According to the Zuqnin Chronicle, as well as the Chronicle of 819 and Chronicle of 846, Theodore's death was in 664/5, whereas it is dated to 666/7 by Bar Hebraeus.

(Note the converse is also true and is easier.) The theorem is similar to the Artin‚ÄìTate lemma, which says that the same statement holds with \\"Noetherian\\" replaced by \\"finitely generated algebra\\" (assuming the base ring is a Noetherian ring). The theorem was first proved in Paul M. Eakin's thesis and later independently by . The theorem can also be deduced from the characterization of a Noetherian ring in terms of injective modules, as done for example by David Eisenbud in ; this approach is useful for a generalization to non-commutative rings.  Proof  The following more general result is due to Edward W. Formanek and is proved by an argument rooted to the original proofs by Eakin and Nagata. According to , this formulation is likely the most transparent one. Proof: It is enough to show that M is a Noetherian module since, in general, a ring admitting a faithful Noetherian module over it is a Noetherian ring. Suppose otherwise. By assumption, the set of all IM, where I is an ideal of A such that M/IM is not Noetherian has a maximal element, I_0 M. Replacing M and A by M/I_0 M and A/\\\\operatorname{Ann}(M/I_0 M), we can assume *for each nonzero ideal I \\\\subset A, the module M/IM is Noetherian. Next, consider the set S of submodules N \\\\subset M such that M/N is faithful. Choose a set of generators \\\\\\\\{ x_1, \\\\dots, x_n \\\\\\\\} of M and then note that M/N is faithful if and only if for each a \\\\in A, the inclusion \\\\\\\\{ a x_1, \\\\dots, a x_n \\\\\\\\} \\\\subset N implies a = 0. Thus, it is clear that Zorn's lemma applies to the set S, and so the set has a maximal element, N_0. Now, if M/N_0 is Noetherian, then it is a faithful Noetherian module over A and, consequently, A is a Noetherian ring, a contradiction. Hence, M/N_0 is not Noetherian and replacing M by M/N_0, we can also assume *each nonzero submodule N \\\\subset M is such that M/N is not faithful. Let a submodule 0 e N \\\\subset M be given. Since M/N is not faithful, there is a nonzero element a \\\\in A such that aM \\\\subset N. By assumption, M/aM is Noetherian and so N/aM is finitely generated. Since aM is also finitely generated, it follows that N is finitely generated; i.e., M is Noetherian, a contradiction. \\\\square References   *  Further reading  * Math StackExchange - Exercise from Kaplansky's Commutative Rings and Eakin-Nagata Theorem Category:Theorems in abstract algebra Category:Commutative algebra ","title":"Eakin‚ÄìNagata theorem"},{"id":"62674652","text":"Isoko Mochizuki (Japanese: ÊúõÊúà Ë°£Â°ëÂ≠ê; born 1975) is a Japanese newspaper journalist for Tokyo Shimbun, based in Tokyo.

Since 2001, Klepetan has traveled from South Africa to Brodski Varo≈°, Croatia, each spring to mate with Malena, who is unable to travel due to a gunshot injury.  Story  Croatia is a popular nesting spot for white storks; some 1,500 nesting pairs reside in the country, with some villages having more storks than people. Croatian janitor Stjepan Vokiƒá found Malena while fishing in 1993; she had been shot by hunters and was unable to fly. Vokiƒá rescued Malena and became her caretaker. In 2001, a male stork, whom Vokiƒá named Klepetan, began to visit Malena. Klepetan returned every spring to mate with Malena. Through a radio tracking band, it was determined that Klepetan made a month-long journey from South Africa to Croatia to meet up with Malena each year. Vokiƒá takes care of their chicks since Malena cannot hunt, building them a nest, shelter, and feeding them. In 2017, Klepetan returned to find another bird and a newly laid egg in Malena's nest. Klepetan drove the male away and smashed his competitor's egg. The pair had 66 chicks in total. In 2019, a bird that may have been Klepetan showed up unusually early to Brodski Varo≈°.

It was developed and manufactured in the late 2010s by Kalashnikov Concern, based on the Yevgeny Dragunov MA Compact Rifle and unveiled at the Russian Army Expo 2017 alongside the AM-17. The weapon is intended for use as a close quarters weapon, primarily for special units of the Russian Interior Ministry and the Russian Army to replace the AS Val and VSS Vintorez firearms. Design details =Operating mechanism= The AMB-17, unlike previous firearms in current use with the Russian military, differentiates itself by employing two receivers that connect on a hinge instead of a single stamped receiver with a lid. To do this, the upper receiver itself is made from polymer and steel reinforcements, while the lower receiver along with its magazine housing is made entirely from polymer, and connected to the upper receiver by two captive take down cross-pins, reducing the weight of the firearm significantly and allowing for easier access into the internal operation. The gas operated action uses a short stroke gas piston and rotary bolt which locks with three radial lugs on the bolt head, similar to previous 9x39mm carbines such as the VSK-94. The bolt carrier within the upper receiver is almost streamline by design raising it towards the bolt group reducing both bolt friction and felt user recoil. =Features= The weapon has an integral suppressor mounted on the front of the upper receiver which wraps around the barrel. In order for the suppressor to be integrated, the AMB-17 employs a wider opening within its handguard as compared to the AM-17, along with the front of the upper receiver which also allows for an integrated handguard half-length MIL-STD/1913 Picatinny rail. The integrated upper also includes a full-length MIL-STD/1913 Picatinny railing, polymer side-folding and adjustable (telescoping) shoulder stock, and longitudinal slots in the walls of the upper receiver allowing for ambidextrous controls in both the fire selector and charging handle. The firearm uses a subsonic 9√ó39 mm cartridge to avoid sonic boom with detachable box magazines compatible with AS VAL, VSS, and SR-3 (SR-3M, SR-3MP) and other 9x39mm rifle systems Additionally, the bullet is very effective at penetrating body armor. It is equipped with a hardened steel or tungsten tip and can penetrate a high-density steel plate at 100 m; a steel plate or a standard army helmet can be fully penetrated at 500 m; however, the rifle is typically employed under 400 m.

It is transmitted every Wednesdays at 7pm on Venezolana de Televisi√≥n and TVes. It is hosted by Diosdado Cabello. Its sister broadcast Nos Vemos en la Radio (English: See You On The Radio) is also broadcast on Radio Nacional de Venezuela. Programacion del Canal Informativo  History  On 17 February 2014, during the protests in Venezuela, Cabello warned in the program that \\"no opposition march will enter the Libertador Municipality, they will not pass!,\\" adding that \\"it is a territory of peace\\" and ensuring that opposition protesters would not bring \\"violence\\" to the municipality. In 2016, after the opposition handed over to the National Electoral Council the signatures collected to convene a recall referendum of President Nicol√°s Maduro, Cabello expressed on 4 May in the program that the directors of public bodies they signed were to leave. In 2017, Cabello presented a video on his program in which the violinist and activist Wuilly Arteaga was heard supporting the government of Nicol√°s Maduro. Wuilly reported that he was forced to record clandestinely every day without being able to take off his clothes and that the statements were manipulated. = Golpe Azul plan = On 12 February 2015, Libertador Municipality Mayor Jorge Rodr√≠guez during a special broadcast, denounced the participants of an alleged attempt planned by aviation general Oswaldo Hern√°ndez, who was convicted in May 2014 along with nine other military personnel for the crimes of rebellion and against military decorum. National Assembly president Diosdado Cabello announced the arrests of eight people in Aragua by officials of the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN) and the seizure of various equipment, including a computer with information on the tactical objectives of the coup group. He also showed maps allegedly located on the computer equipment of the protagonists of Golpe Azul, where buildings appeared in Caracas that were marked as tactical objectives such as the Miraflores Palace, the Public Ministry of Venezuela, the Caracas mayor's office, the Ministry of Defense headquarters, the Ministry of Interior, Justice and Peace building, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ), the National Electoral Council (CNE), the Directorate General of Military Counterintelligence (DGCIM) and offices of Telesur. During the program, Mayor Jorge Rodr√≠guez accused National Assembly deputy and opposition politician Julio Borges of choosing the places indicated as tactical objectives. Cabello also revealed the alleged possession of AR-15 rifles, grenades, military and security uniforms, as well as an eight-minute video with a statement from the protagonists. According to Cabello, the bombing would be carried out with a Tucano artillery planeafter publishing a statement in the national press requesting the government, among other things, the dissolution of public powers, the call for elections and the affiliation to organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and later the military would issue a uniformed message where they would make a called the population to calm.  Controversies  In this program, Cabello talks about the government's view on many political issues and presents accusations against the opposition. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) has expressed concerns about how the program has intimidated people that went to the IACHR denouncing the government.IACHR Expresses Alarm over Intimidation in Venezuela directed against People Who Come before the Inter-American Human Rights System (OAS press release) Some Venezuelan commentators have compared the use of illegally recorded private conversations on programs such as Cabello's to the practices in place in the East Germany as shown in the film The Life of Others.La Vida de los Otros (El Nacional) Amnesty International has denounced the way in which Cabello has revealed details on the travel arrangements of two human rights defenders in his program and how he routinely shows state monitoring of people that may disagree with the government.Amnesty International report on TV program = Law against Hatred = Cabello has been accused by Venezuelan public of inciting hatred against opponents through the program, as he is frequently seen accusing and incriminating Venezuelan opposition activists and citizens, as well as international personalities, with alleged coup plans and/or terrorists against the government of Nicol√°s Maduro. Since the controversial Law against Hatred was sanctioned by the 2017 National Constituent Assembly, several sectors of Venezuelan society questioned whether such a law would be applied to Cabello for inciting hatred in its program. However, to date the defendants have been only opponents.

The increase in performance indicators represent a maintenance action. roughness increases. The road is located in Texas. Deterioration modeling is the process of modeling and predicting the physical conditions of structures or infrastructure. The condition of infrastructure is represented either using a deterministic index or the probability of failure. Examples of such performance measures are pavement condition index for roads or bridge condition index for bridges. For probabilistic measures, which are the focus of reliability theory, probability of failure or reliability index are used. Deterioration models are instrumental to infrastructure asset management and are the basis for maintenance and rehabilitation decision-making. The condition of all physical infrastructure degrade over time. A deterioration model can help decision-makers to understand how fast the condition drops or violates a certain threshold.El-Diraby, T. E., Kinawy, S., & Piryonesi, S. M. (2017). A Comprehensive Review of Approaches Used by Ontario Municipalities to Develop Road Asset Management Plans (No. 17-00281) Traditionally, most municipalities have been using deterioration curves for deterioration modeling. Recently, more complex methods based on simulation, Markov models and machine learning models have been introduced. A well-known model to show the probability of failure of an asset throughout its life is called bathtub curve. This curve is made of three main stages: infant failure, constant failure, and wear out failure. In infrastructure asset management the dominant mode of deterioration is because of aging, traffic, and climatic attribute. Therefore, the wear out failure is of most concern.  Types of deterioration models  Deterioration models are either deterministic or probabilistic. Deterministic models cannot entertain probabilities. Probabilistic models, however, can predict both the future condition and the probability of being in that certain condition. = Deterministic models = Deterministic models are simple and intelligible, but cannot incorporate probabilities. Deterioration curves solely developed based on age are an example of deterministic deterioration models. Traditionally, most mechanistic and mechanistic- empirical models are developed using deterministic approaches, but more recently researchers and practitioners have become interested in probabilistic models. = Probabilistic models = Examples of probabilistic deterioration models are the models developed based on reliability theory, Markov chain and machine learning. Unlike deterministic models a probabilistic model can incorporate probability. For instance, it can tell that in five years a road is going to be in a Poor condition with a probability of 75%, and there is a 25% probability that it will stay in a fair condition. Such probabilities are vital to the development of risk assessment models. If a state or class of the performance measure is of interest, Markov models and classification machine learning algorithms can be utilized. However, if decision-makers are interested in numeric value of performance indicators, they need to use regression learning algorithms. A limitation of Markov models is that they cannot consider the history of maintenance, which are among important attribute for predicting the future conditions. Deterioration models developed based on machine learning do not have this limitation. Furthermore, they can include other features such as climatic attributes and traffic as input variables.  Markov models  A large portion of probabilistic deterioration models are developed based on Markov chain, which is a probabilistic discrete event simulation model. Deterioration models developed based on Markov chain consider the condition of asset as a series of discrete states. For instance, in the case of pavement deterioration modeling, the PCI can be categorized into seven classes: good, satisfactory, fair, poor and very poor (or simply 1 to 5). A Markov model is then developed to predict the probability of transition from state 1 to each of other states in a number of years. Crude Markov models have been criticized for disregarding the impact of ageing and maintenance history of the asset. More complex models known as semi-Markov models can account for history of maintenance, but their calibration requires a great deal of longitudinal data. Recently, efforts have been made to train Markov deterioration models to consider the impact of climate, but generally it is not possible to have climatic attributes or traffic as an input in these types of models.  Machine learning  Since the late 2000s machine learning algorithms have been adopted to tackle infrastructure deterioration modeling. Neural networks have been among the most commonly used models. Despite their high learning capability, neural networks have been criticized for their black-box nature, which does not provide enough room for interpretation of the model. Therefore, other algorithms have been used in the literature as well. Examples of other algorithms used for deterioration modeling are decision tree, k-NN, random forest, gradient boosting trees, random forest regression, and naive Bayes classifier. In this type model usually, the deterioration is predicted using a set of input variables or predictive features. The examples of predictive features used in the literature are initial condition, traffic, climatic features, pavement type and road class.

Anthonie Smith, he designed and built the largest number of churches for the Reformed Churches in South Africa. In terms of public architecture, a prominent contribution is the Land Bank building in Pretoria. His inspiration, his example and his architecture, still live, Professor Schalk W le Roux (erstwhile Head of the Department of Architecture University of Pretoria) wrote as follows in his obituary: During the second half of the Twentieth Century Johan de Ridder was an influential South African architect. He is best known for a fresh and personal approach to Reformed Church architecture, but this is not the only building type where his example was studied and emulated. It is because he reached beyond the simple requirement of function in his search and design, thus consciously allowing for local realities of climate, terrain, building material, building science and craftsmanship to be realistic and creative generators of structures. The resultant buildings and places celebrated land- and cityscapes with which they were contextually interwoven and expedited the development of a South African way of architectural thought, based on and advocating a contemporary worldview. The same values, fuelled by a love of history, language and country, found expression in restoration work, such as at Paul Kruger‚Äôs farm house at Boekenhoutfontein, where he paid tribute to past achievements, and also in houses and bigger buildings, such as the Land Bank building in Pretoria, where again he was true to the present ‚Äì the time in which he lived and worked. Closest to his heart was possibly the building of churches and his pursuit was for a worthy and meaningful architecture embracing worship. His experimentation to achieve this can be traced in many of his subsequent buildings and designs. As a young architect, he was outspoken about the unchanging and \\"distinctive style of Gerard Moerdyk and Henry Vermooten\\" and inspired by the \\"refreshing modern work of Verhoef Smit and Viljoen who served as inspiration for me.\\" He takes it further when he says: ‚Äú[My] designs reflect a quest for a new form and aesthetic to express what is essential in a church building.‚Äù His striving was for a simplicity in form, line and plane that derives from and reflects the basic nature of worship in the Reformed Church, and its execution within the constraints of available funds. ‚ÄúThe function of a church,\\" he said to architecture students in 1955, shortly after the completion of his best known church in Parys, Free State, \\"is determined by public worship: it is the master builder. The building emerges from a plan and, in its turn, the plan is determined by the function of the building.‚Äù In addition, he argued, there was an inherent symbolism and aesthetic in his churches suggesting the Word of God moving from the pulpit, over the congregation and, through the windows, to the world beyond. Referring to the church in Parys he said: \\"As in many other designs, symbolism, based on biblical truth, is embedded in this structure. It is the symbolism of the church as a tent trekking through the desert of this temporary existence on the journey towards eternity.‚Äù The church is therefore a visual symbol of transience with the tent-shape a direct architectural translation of the concept of having no fixed abode. The architect's real contribution is to give form to the symbolic. De Ridder‚Äôs three principles, applied to both religious and secular buildings, were firstly that the architecture should be contemporary, secondly that form should emerge from the meaning of the function and thirdly that the structure should be economic and affordable. A faithful adherence to these principles is probably one of the reasons his buildings have withstood the test of time. As an architect, he had the rare experience that his designs remained appreciated and current in his lifetime, and are still being studied and analysed as historically significant in a quest for authenticity. His work was published widely in South Africa and also internationally in both acknowledged academic journals and more popular monthly architectural magazines where his ideas and decisions are revisited and re-evaluated. His inspiration, his example and his architecture live on. De Ridder's innovative design philosophy is most exemplified in the \\"Dopper\\" church, summarised in the New York Museum of Modern Art collection of the photographs of David Goldblatt: Paradoxically however Dopper churches were architecturally the most radical in the great wave of church building engaged in by the Afrikaner Protestant Churches between the 1940s and the late 1980s. Several of the archetypal Dopper churches, including this one, were by Johan de Ridder. Himself a Dopper, he explained his approach to me in 1994: \\"The Dopper Church took the lead because of the strength of its doctrine. I could approach the design of the church as the community did, trying to incorporate our beliefs in it. It was not a style. The church was a visual symbol of aspects of our faith, while simultaneously retaining the basic idea of the Reformation that all external symbols should be avoided. I couldn't accept a complicated architecture. I wanted simple wall surfaces, big roof surfaces, a plain, striking building with height and unity between interior and exterior... The triangle is essentially religious with a very vertical and spiritual character. Preaching of the Word is not confined to four walls. It must go out through big windows at the top and front of the church which is like a megaphone with the preacher at its apex.\\" MoMA, 1998, Accessed 29 Dec 2019 Excluding the Dutch Reformed church located in Aranos in southern Namibia, all De Ridder's designs were for buildings in the former Transvaal (province) and in the northern Free State (province).

Corps (XXXV. Armeekorps) was a corps in the German Army during World War II.  History  The Corps was first known as H√∂heres Kommando z.b.V. XXXV (H.Kdo.) and was established on 15 October 1939 in Breslau. After the Invasion of Poland, the H.Kdo was stationed there between December 1939 and June 1941. After the start of Operation Barbarossa (June 1941), the H.Kdo saw its first action at the beginning of July 1941 in the Battle of Kiev (1941). As part of the 2nd Army, the H.Kdo formed part of the northern pincer. After successfully completing this battle, the H.Kdo advanced with the 2nd Panzer Army towards Moscow. The H.Kdo. advanced towards Yefremov, but was overstretched and had hardly any contact with its neighbors. Now it was time for the Soviets to launch their Yelets Offensive on 6 December 1941. Soon the H.Kdo. was in full retreat under heavy attacks from the Soviet 3rd Army. The front line stabilised on December 17, 1941, but had moved almost 100 km back to the west. The H.Kdo. had suffered heavy losses. The weakness in defense of a H√∂heres Kommando also became extremely clear. On 20 January 1942, the H.Kdo. was transformed into a fully-fledged Army corps. In 1942 , the Corps was stationed in the relative quite Front sector around Oryol. In 1943, the Corps had to withdraw during Operation Kutuzov and the Battle of Smolensk (1943) and ended up in the area around Zhlobin in Belarus. Here, the Front stabilised again between November 1943 and June 1944. When the Soviets launched Operation Bagration on 23 June 1944, The Corps was surrounded during the Bobruysk Offensive and completely destroyed.

Biography  He came from an illustrious family of artists. His father was the painter Jos√© de Madrazo y Agudo and his mother, Isabel Kuntz Valentini, was a daughter of the Polish painter, Tadeusz Kuntze. Two of his brothers, Federico de Madrazo and Luis de Madrazo were also painters. His sister, Carlota, married the editor of the journal, El Artista, Eugenio de Ochoa.Ignacio Peir√≥ y Gonzalo Pasamar, Diccionario Akal de historiadores espa√±oles contempor√°neos (1840-1980). Madrid: Akal, 2002 He and his brother Federico were born in Rome, while their father was studying there on a grant from King Charles IV. His primary education began in Madrid, at a seminary school operated by the Jesuits. This was followed by legal studies in Toledo and at the University of Valladolid, where he graduated. In 1837, he and Federico traveled to Paris, then back to Rome. Shortly after, he married Manuela Rosales, daughter of the painter, Eduardo Rosales. They had three daughters and a son. During this time, he worked as an art teacher. Later, he moved to Madrid. There, he, his brother Federico and future brother-in-law, Ochoa, created the magazine, ', which played a major role in establishing the Romantic style in Spain. He also contributed to most of the cultural publications of the day; including El Renacimiento, El Espa√±ol, El Iris, La Cruz and La Ilustraci√≥n Espa√±ola y Americana. Later, he served as Editor of ', where he published verses in imitation of the Psalms and translations from the Bible. He combined his journalistic career with legal service; as an assistant and a prosecutor, in which capacity he worked for the Spanish Council of State in 1860.

Founded in 1965 by Chau Xiang, the restaurant specialises in snake soup and serves Cantonese cuisine made from exotic animals such as wattle-necked softshell turtles, crocodiles, geckos, silkworms, and seahorses. Dishes served include \\"fried snake balls\\", \\"barbecued snake\\", \\"glistening snake skin casserole\\", \\"dark golden-brown fried snake meat\\", \\"stir-fried crocodile meat\\", and \\"snake gall bladder wine\\". Shia Wong Hip stores hundreds and sometimes thousands of live snakes in wooden drawers. It has a cobra in a cage visible from the storefront. The restaurant purchases its snakes from mainland China, Indonesia, and Malaysia and supplements its income by selling snakes to restaurants and snakeskin to factories that make wallets, shoes, handbags, and belts. Originally located on Nam Cheong Street, Shia Wong Hip was moved to Apliu Street in the 1970s. Chau Xiang's daughter, Chau Ka Ling, in 1971 started working at the restaurant from age 13 and took over the business in 1991 after her father died. She runs it with her two younger brothers. The Hong Kong government has recognised Chau Ka Ling as the only woman snake- catcher in the region, which earned her the name \\"Snake Queen\\". History Shia Wong Hip, which in English means \\"Snake King Brothers\\" or \\"Snake King Cooperative\\", was founded in 1965 by Chau Xiang (). Chau immigrated from Huadu District in Guangzhou to Hong Kong in the 1950s. He initially sold ye wei such as pangolins and masked palm civets. Owing to snake sales being very good, he started Shia Wong Hip at Nam Cheong Street in 1965. When the building owner saw it was a profitable business and wanted to start a business there, Chau was forced to raise funds from his friends to relocate the restaurant to Apliu Street in the late 1970s. Chau's family had a challenging experience because Sham Shui Po station was not open yet and the restaurant did not have enough business. Chau Xiang had two daughters and five sons who worked at the restaurant with him and his wife. Previously a group of people owned shares in the restaurant, though eventually Chau became sole owner and he was then succeeded by his children. Shia Wong Hip is currently located on Apliu Street and is concealed at the rear of market stalls on the street. The restaurant's specialty is snake soup. It is owned by Chau Ka Ling (), the second-generation operator of the restaurant who as a youth learned from her father, the restaurant's founder, how to deal with snakes. In the 1960s, it was challenging for Chau's father to recruit workers willing to interact with snakes. Chau had a youthful desire to become a seamstress. But as the oldest of seven children, Chau felt a filial duty to help her father with the restaurant. She began working at the restaurant in 1971 when she was 13 years old, as she was not doing well with her homework and wanted to find her happiness in the family business. She trudged to Western District Public Cargo Working Area to purchase snakes. She studied the business from the shifus her father brought on. One shifu was an expert in how to handle snakes while a second was an expert in how to make snake soup. In her first three months at the restaurant, she would only slice snake meat as she was too fearful to actually kill the snake. After witnessing the daughter of the owner of snake restaurant Sher Wong Yip on Nam Cheong Street kill snakes, she summoned enough courage to begin killing snakes herself. Her father had high demands for her, instructing her to perform different aspects of the business such as cleaning and welcoming customers. The snakes the restaurant buys need to be defanged, a risky task. At age 17, she began defanging snakes. In the 1980s and 1990s, Chau performed snake dances at restaurants and on television shows such as on TVB's Enjoy Yourself Tonight. She taught viewers how to make snake dishes on Women Life. When Josephine Siao starred in a movie involving snakes, she asked Chau to teach her about them. Chau Ka Ling was the only one to assist with running the restaurant until her father died in 1990 or 1991 of a heart attack when buying snakes in Guangzhou, after which her younger siblings started to take part in the business. Two brothers run the business with her. Despite her instructing both of them how to defang snakes, a single brother agrees to do it because of the risk of harm. Chow Pak Kiu () is a brother who owns and runs the business with her. Chau Pak (), a brother who is the youngest of the siblings, worked at the restaurant in his youth. After getting tired of working with snakes, he studied abroad in the United States for electronic engineering and returned to Hong Kong to work in an electronics factory. Upon the closure of the factory owing to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Chau left the electronics industry in 2000 and returned to work at Shia Wong Hip. The Hong Kong government recognised Chau Ka Ling as the only woman snake-catcher in the region, a role that gave her the responsibility to assist the government in catching wild snakes and gave her the nickname \\"Snake Queen\\". The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department pays her several hundred dollars to catch snakes in residences. Chau is married, has no children, and in 2013 was in her early 50s. She declined to train anyone to take over her business, saying, \\"I've killed snakes for so many year, but actually I don't want to. Because there are fewer and fewer snakes now. But I can't make a career change. There's nothing else I can do.\\" Her husband is a snake trader who looks for snakes in different locations in Southeast Asia. In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak led China to bar exports of snake and caused speculation that snakes are carriers for SARS, which led to Shia Wong Hip having purchases down by 70%. Shia Wong needed to import snakes from Southeast Asia, which raised costs because shipment fees led snakes from Southeast Asia to be 30% more expensive than those from China and shipped snakes were more likely to die. According to the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, in 2013 Shia Wong was one of only 18 stores in Hong Kong licensed to sell live snakes. The restaurant has been profiled by the TVB show Midnight Banquets. Food and products The area around Shia Wong Hip with its sign in the distance Shia Wong serves Cantonese cuisine made from exotic animals. Animals served include snakes, turtles with hard shells, wattle-necked softshell turtles, crocodiles, and geckos. The restaurant has snakeskin bags, snakeskin products, snakeskin belts, and snake wine for purchase. A cobra in a cage is visible from outside the restaurant. Placed close to the entryway, the snake is alive and waiting to be prepared as food. The restaurant houses the snakes in a set of brown cupboards made of wood at the back. The cupboards are imprinted with the bright red warning \\"poisonous snakes\\" written in Chinese and stores hundreds, occasionally thousands, of snakes that are alive. Chinese cobras, banded krait, and king cobras are stored in the cupboards. The restaurant has tiled walls plastered with both cuttings from newspapers and coloured paper containing Chinese symbols. Its cupboards have a variety of items such as plastic bags and glass jars. Diners sit on wooden stools at formica tables on a tiled floor coloured pink and white. Shia Wong Hip sources five kinds of snakes from China, Indonesia, and Malaysia two times a week to create its soup. It previously sourced most snakes from Mainland China but began importing snakes from other countries after China began curbing the sale of snakes outside the mainland. The restaurant boils the snake soup base from 9:00pm to 3:00am, after which slices of snake meat, fungus, ginger, and Jinhua ham are mixed in. Shia Wong Hip receives licences from Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department and other countries' analogous departments to import snakes to Hong Kong. Additional materials used to create the soup are slivers of lemon leaves, vinegar, black fungus, and mandarin orange peels. Dishes served include \\"fried snake balls\\", \\"barbecued snake\\", \\"glistening snake skin casserole\\", \\"dark golden-brown fried snake meat\\", \\"stir-fried crocodile meat\\", and \\"snake gall bladder wine\\". Shia Wong Hip uses the snake's internal organs to concoct an herbal treatment for skin issues. Another soup it serves customers is one made of lizards, silkworms, and seahorses. It markets a \\"snake banquet\\" for a dozen people. According to Rough Guides, \\"less adventurous\\" customers are able to select \\"delicious\\" sticky rice sprinkled with Chinese sausage to eat. Shia Wong Hip resells snakes to restaurants such as The Chinese Restaurant at Hyatt Regency Hong Kong, Tsim Sha Tsui and sells snakeskin to factories that produce wallets, shoes, handbags, and belts. In 2007, customers on average purchased 600bowls of snake soup daily which amounted to 1,800snakes that in total weigh . On the most bustling days in winter, the restaurant makes more than 1,000bowls of snake soup for customers. Its customers eat dishes such as snake soup in the belief that it will heat up their body during the winter cold. Upon finishing their food, restaurant patrons can ask to carry a snake. In October2017, the restaurant had fewer customers which Chau attributed to climate change causing Hong Kong to have a warm winter. Reception Taras Grescoe of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Shia Wong Hip \\"serves a deliciously spicy soup made from snakes displayed in cages piled to the ceilings, and shots of brandy\\".

The two scandals were tied together by the release of revealing KakaoTalk messages that exposed alleged crimes at the Burning Sun nightclub, and separately, by K-pop singer and entertainer Jung Joon-young and his friends. While the Burning Sun scandal revolved around a nightclub and Korean idol Seungri of the group Big Bang, Jung's chatroom expos√© affected more idol friends and other acquaintances of Jung's. The chatroom portion of the larger scandal included allegations of rape and spy cams when Jung confessed to secretly filming himself having sex with women and sharing the videos without their knowledge or consent, and he resigned from the entertainment industry on March 12, 2019, a day after Seungri's resignation related to allegations in the Burning Sun. The allegations of sex crimes involved added to the country's \\"epidemic\\" of what is called molka, a Korean word for the online distribution of unconsented sex videos taken of women. Jung's KakaoTalk messages revealed conversations and videos dating from 2015 to 2016, which were used in a police investigation which resulted in gang rape convictions (two victims, separate dates) of Jung and four other chatroom members: a former member of F.T. Island, Choi Jong- hoon; a former Burning Sun employee named Kim; a businessman named Kwon; and a former employee of YG Entertainment named Heo. Jung's conviction included charges for eleven instances of illegal filming and sharing. During the course of the investigation, other charges were made against Seungri and solo singers Roy Kim and Eddy Kim for allegations of individually sharing an illicit photograph in Jung's chatrooms. Development =Background= Jung Joon- young, a 30-year-old South Korean singer-songwriter and television celebrity, lived in Indonesia until the age of five, then spent the remainder of his formative years in China, France, and Japan; he moved to South Korea at age 19. Before the scandal, he was conducting a U.S. tour in October 2018 with his rock band Drug Restaurant, which he had formed in 2015, and preparing for the opening of his Korean-style fusion restaurant in Paris with a two-week trial period in November 2018. Jung had been involved in a previous sex video scandal in August 2016, when an ex-girlfriend filed criminal charges that he had taped them having sex without her consent, but later withdrew those charges. The new scandal reopened the case after revealing chat messages about the incident. During the 2016 scandal, Jung dropped out of the television show 2 Days & 1 Night, but returned after three months. In May 2017, a JoongAng Ilbo analysis of 44 celebrities involved in crimes and scandals between 2006 and 2016, and the length of time their return to the industry took, listed Jung's case and his quick return as an example of a sex scandal that showed the public was becoming more tolerant in what they considered to be the \\"private lives of celebrities.\\" Jung began his career as a contestant on the audition show Superstar K in 2012, where he placed third. It was there that he met and became friends with the show's winner, 25-year-old singer-songwriter soloist Roy Kim (real name is Kim Sang-woo), and 29-year-old singer-songwriter soloist Eddy Kim (real name is Kim Jung-hwan). Jung was also friends with Seungri, age 28 and Choi Jong-hoon, age 29. Choi was the guitarist and leader of the rock band F.T. Island since their debut in 2007, until he resigned due to the KakaoTalk scandal. =February 26, first set of KakaoTalk messages released= On February 26, 2019, the first KakaoTalk messages were released by an anonymous source in connection with the ongoing investigation of the Burning Sun scandal. =March 11, second set of KakaoTalk messages and source revealed= The source of the earlier KakaoTalk text messages, which were first shared by media reports in the Burning Sun scandal, was revealed to be lawyer Bang Jung-hyun on March 11, 2019, when he was interviewed on SBS Eight O'Clock News. Bang had obtained the messages from a whistleblower, possibly a technician at a phone repair shop, where Jung had dropped his phone off for repairs. The whistleblower had sent an email to Bang of thousands of chats taken from Jung's phone that had taken place over eight months between 2015 and 2016. When the Burning Sun scandal started, the phone messages were forwarded to the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission and to SBS funE; and the secretly filmed sex tapes and other chat messages on Jung's phone became public. During the SBS interview, the integrity of the chatroom file was discussed and said to have a tamper-proof device, technically a hash-code verification, showing that the file had not been manipulated; and could stand as circumstantial evidence to seek more evidence. Bang, an economics graduate of Seoul National University said of the chats, \\"Their conversations showed that there were not only sex crimes by celebrities, but also a cozy relationship between them and top police officers,\\" and, \\"It is someone higher up than [the Gangnam Police Precinct chief].\\" The phone belonged to Jung, who was in Los Angeles filming for another television show when the chatroom leaks reached him. He hurriedly returned to Seoul on March 12, where he was booked as a suspect on charges of illegal hidden camera filming and sharing and accused of taping ten or more women. Chatroom messages first released by SBS were translated into English and shared by other media, including The Korea Times. Some of the conversation they translated for April 17, 2016, was as follows: Kim 1 \\"Anybody want porn?\\", Choi \\"Me\\", Kim 1 (Kim sends the video), Choi \\"Wait, she is fainted.\\", Kim 1 \\"So what?\\", Choi: \\"I want to see her alive (in the video).\\", Kim 1 \\"Then I couldn't have turned on the flash.\\" Jung \\"You raped her. (Laughs)\\". In another alleged chat conversation in The Washington Post, Jung said, \\"Let's all get together online, hit the strip bar and rape them in the car.\\" Another member responded, \\"Our lives are like a movie. We have done so many things that could put us in jail. We just haven't killed anyone.\\" Later on March 12, Jung released a statement saying, \\"I admit to all my crimes\\", and resigned from all his entertainment work a day following Seungri's resignation. Jung said, \\"I filmed women without their consent and shared it in a chatroom, and while I was doing so I didn't feel a great sense of guilt,\\" and apologized to his victims. Jung had previously been investigated over similar charges in August 2016 and December 2018. In the 2016 hidden camera case, his victim, an ex-girlfriend, withdrew her complaint of his filming them having sex without her consent, but an SBS report on March 13 had added allegations of possible police tampering with the case. Seungri's and Jung's inter-locking scandals were combined in public view when both were called into the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency (SMPA) on March 14, with more than 100 journalists gathered for Jung's 10 a.m. appearance. Jung apologized before entering the station for questioning and a drug test, followed similarly by Seungri some three hours later. Seungri exited first at around 6:15 a.m. on March 15 and Jung exited around an hour later and told reporters he had handed in his \\"golden phone\\", a public nickname his second mobile phone had gained in a 2016 talk show appearance. SMPA Jongno Police Station where Jung was taken after March 21, 2019 arrest On the same day, two other Korean idols, Choi and Yong Jun-hyung of K-pop boy band Highlight, resigned from entertainment after allegations they were involved in Jung's chatrooms. Yong admitted to viewing a sex tape recorded without the woman's permission and participating in \\"inappropriate conversations\\" about it, saying, \\"All these behaviours were extremely unethical, and I was stupid\\". Choi had been a member of one of the chatrooms that was of immediate interest in media reports and the investigation. In one conversation, Choi allegedly detailed his own drunk driving incident from 2016, that was allegedly kept out of media coverage due to help from a police official with the surname Yoon. Choi was questioned on March 16 under allegations of secretly filming and sharing videos. On March 15, another Korean idol, Lee Jong-hyun of rock band CNBLUE, made his admission through a statement from his agency FNC Entertainment. Lee said that he had viewed Jung's sex videos in a chat group and had made disparaging remarks about women, talking about them as sexual objects. The admission followed a prior denial on his part and an SBS report of an alleged KakaoTalk conversation he had with Jung, during which Lee asks for \\"young\\", \\"pretty\\" and \\"kind\\" women he could have sex with, and to which Jung responded, \\"Who do you want?\\" Other celebrities affected by the scandal were actor Cha Tae-hyun and comedian Kim Jun-ho, Jung's fellow cast members on 2 Days & 1 Night, who resigned from the entertainment industry on March 16 after the chatroom conversations revealed allegations of their gambling on golf in large amounts. Jung Joon-young's arrest Jung was arrested on March 21 for charges under the Act on Special Cases Concerning the Punishment, etc. of Sexual Crimes. He was charged with crimes against at least ten victims for illegally filming and distributing sex tapes. Jung admitted to the charges and apologized at the hearing for his arrest at the Seoul Central District Court, and was later taken to the SMPA Jongno Police Station. On March 29, he was transferred from the police station again to the prosecution for referral of an indictment, and he was indicted on April 17. =April 2, third set of KakaoTalk messages revealed= At the beginning of April, two more Korean idols were added to the list of KakaoTalk chatroom participants. On April 2, 2019, SMPA issued a summons for Roy Kim, who they said appeared in the illegal chatroom with Jung, Seungri and Choi, and booked him the following day for distributing an obscene photo in the chatroom, which he denied taking himself, and which investigators agreed was likely the case. Roy Kim's agency coordinated his return from his U.S. schooling, and he was questioned by SMPA on April 10. On April 5, Eddy Kim was booked for circulating one or more illegally taken photographs. On April 3, Label SJ, the agency for Kangin of boy band Super Junior, released a statement admitting that Kangin had been a member of Jung's chatroom while working together on the television show Hitmaker three years prior and denied any illegal activity on his part. On April 4, police said that Kangin, Jeong Jin-woon of boy band 2AM, and model Lee Cheol-woo were members of the chatrooms, but they had no plans to question them yet. An early April police tally stated that seven chatroom members had been booked for disseminating spy camera content; and there were a total of 23 different groups or one-on-one chatrooms, with sixteen participants. Included in the bookings and instances of occurrences were: Jung, 13; Choi, 3; and Seungri, 1. Two arrests included Jung and a former Burning Sun employee, surnamed Kim, including a probe of five others. =April 19 ‚Äì end of year= First chat group victim files police complaint, arrests and trial On April 19, the first victim complaint against chat group members was filed against Jung, Choi and three others former employees of the Burning Sun and YG Entertainment, and an anonymous businessman. The complainant alleged that, after passing out, she had been raped in a Daegu hotel room in March 2016, in an incident that was filmed by the group. The vicrim's complaint followed an April 11 interview of Bang on JTBC's Lee Gyu-yeon's Spotlight, where he reported there were about ten photos and videos from the chatrooms that showed forced sexual assaults, sometimes by multiple members of the chat group. Bang had met with some of the women from the videos, who were unaware of what had happened to them, perhaps due to having been drugged. On April 23, SMPA began an investigation into the complainant's allegations, which reportedly occurred after a fan signing event for Jung; and a second similar rape case at a resort in Hongcheon in January 2016, where another alleged victim traveled with Jung and Choi. SMPA said they were aware of group rape after examining the videos, but had not been able to identify the victims until they came forward. The cases were assigned to the SMPA's Women and Juvenile Affairs Division, who have expertise in crimes against women, including sexual assault. Choi was arrested on May 9 for allegations of group sexual assault with four members of Jung's chat group in March 2016; after appearing at a hearing with two others and denying the charges against him. Another male, surname Kwon, was also arrested; with both Choi and Kwon charged under the Act on Special Cases Concerning the Punishment, etc. of Sexual Crimes. Jung, who was still under police custody, pled guilty to eleven cases of the illicit filming and sharing at a May 10 pretrial hearing, where he offered to settle with the victims. He was being investigated separately in the group rape case, where he, like Choi, denied allegations. On May 17, SMPA referred the gang rape case to prosecutors, recommending indictments on charges of special rape. On June 5, after indictments, the Seoul Central District Court merged the trials for the five previously accused, Jung, Choi, Kwon, a Burning Sun MD named Kim, and an entertainment director named Heo, to include two charges of group rapes of the two victims in 2016. The five appeared at a June 27 hearing and denied the rape charges. At the first trial hearing on July 16, which included the illegal filming and sharing and rape charges, Jung and Kwon admitted to having sex but denied rape, and Choi denied having sex. Jung's lawyer submitted a statement contesting the legality of evidence obtained from the KakaoTalk messages in violation of the Personal Information Protection Act. The court specified five victims, two reference witnesses, a time period for the alleged illegal photography from November 2015 to June 2016, the dates of the alleged rapes on January 9 and March 20, 2016, and the need for confidentiality of the victims. The next trial dates, on August 19, August 26, September 2, September 16, September 23, October 7 and October 21 were closed to the public. At the ninth trial date on November 13, prosecutors recommended prison sentences on the rape charges for all five men. The defendants and number of years respectively were: Jung, 7; Choi, 5; Kwon, 10; Kim, 10; and Heo, 5. Jung's charges included the illicit filming and sharing. Prosecutors also asked that all five be restricted from working with children and minors for 10 years, be required to disclose personal information, and undergo sexual violence treatment programs. Another trial date was held on November 27. On November 29, the court sentenced Jung to six years in prison and Choi to five, and both were sentenced to complete 80 hours of sexual assault treatment and a five- year restriction on working with children and minors. The judge said \\"the defendants treated the women as simple instruments of sexual pleasure\\", \\"committing crimes of gang rape and sexual assault\\" and \\"sharing their acts in a chatroom with acquaintances\\", and said the \\"damage to the victims could not be recovered\\". Both Jung and Choi cried after the sentences were announced. The other three defendants were also sentenced, with Kim receiving a five-year prison sentence, Kwon a four-year prison sentence, and Heo a suspended sentence with two years' probation and 160 hours of community service. By December 6, Jung, Choi and Kim had submitted appeals to the court for their convictions. =January 2020 ‚Äì present= =Additional indictments, trial appealed; Roy Kim and Eddy Kim cases dropped= On January 30, 2020, Jung and Choi were indicted by prosecutors on more charges, along with nine others in the Burning Sun case, Jung for allegations of soliciting prostitution and Choi for bribing a police officer during his drunk driving incident in February 2016. On February 4, the first trial hearing for an appeal of the November 29 rape convictions by all five defendants was held. At the March 18 trial for Choi for additional charges, he admitted to illegal filming and sharing in the KakaoTalk chatrooms, but denied the 2016 police bribery charge. Prosecutors proposed an additional one year and a half sentencing on top of his prior rape conviction sentence, if convicted. Agencies for Roy Kim and Eddy Kim released statements on February 25 and March 6, respectively, that their indictments had been suspended from prosecution due to each singer having uploaded only one image that was captured online, and had belonged to a \\"hobby chatroom\\" with Jung Joon-young, not the more questionable one. On April 3, Jung and Kim were fined one million won and two million won, respectively, in a summary judgment for the prostitution charges, along with judgments for two others in the Burning Sun case. On May 12, an appellate court reduced the prison sentences for three of the defendants: Jung's to five years from six, Choi's to two-and-a-half years from five, and Kim's to four years from five. Sentences for the other two defendants, Kwon's four years in prison and Heo's two years' probation, remained the same as the first trial. Jung had submitted documents attesting to his regret, and Choi and Kim had settled with one of the victims, accounting for the sentence reductions. Jung and Choi were additionally denied probation, mandated to attend treatment programs and restricted from working with children and teens. Jung and Choi submitted appeals to the Supreme Court of South Korea on May 13 and May 18, respectively, and on September 24, the sentences for Jung (five years) and Choi {two-and-a-half years} were upheld. Investigative reporting The SBS investigative reporter who examined the KakaoTalk chat messages sent by the whistleblower to the television station SBS funE was Kang Kyung-yoon. When she started interviewing some of the victims of the videos, she found they did not know of their existence. She said, \\"Some of them begged, 'Please save me. How do I live after this? She said they were ashamed and angry but feared \\"wearing a scarlet letter as a sex crime victim\\", and thus feared being identified. Kang said that the sex video investigation was seen by some people as a means to avert attention away from the larger corruption scandal with its multiple allegations, but she perceived it as a serious social issue that needed reporting on. On November 25, 2019, following the assumed suicide of idol Goo Hara, Kang said that Goo, who had undergone public scrutiny over a sex video that was filmed by her boyfriend, had contacted her to offer support. Investigation summary Jung was investigated and arrested for allegations of illegal hidden camera filming and distributing, and on May 10 conceded to the charges, at the first hearing for his trial. He was subsequently indicted in January 2020 for soliciting prostitution. Jung, Choi Jong-hoon and three others were arrested and charged with group sexual assault. Choi was also indicted for the attempted bribery of a police officer in 2016 to cover up a case of driving under the influence (although an initial police investigation was dropped), and for illegal hidden camera filming and distribution. Seungri, Roy Kim and Eddy Kim were investigated for allegations of sharing, individually, one illicit photograph in Jung's chatrooms. Effects on entertainment industry Months after the scandal started, music artists were still suffering repercussions and denying involvement. In late August, Lee Jong-hyun, still in the military and, according to his agency, \\"in a period of reflection for his wrongdoing\\" related to Jung's chatrooms, left his group CNBLUE after being involved in another chat scandal with a YouTuber. In late September, Jeong Jin-woon of 2AM, reported in April to have been a member of one of Jung's chatrooms, released a statement that he was not involved in the illegal chatrooms. Also in late September, rapper Zico, who had mentioned Jung's \\"golden phone\\" on a television program in 2016, and was rumored to have seen the illegal videos, released lyrics in a song on his new album referring to it, \\"I've never seen a video like that, I swear to God.\\" At the same time, music site Melon had to explain a banner, recommending a Jung Joon-young album to users, that popped up due to an automated system. Public response Protest rally, Sinnonhyeon Station Exit 6, (Le M√©ridien Hotel), Gangnam, May 25, 2019 Public protests, led by women's and civic groups, directed towards the Burning Sun scandal and Jung Joon-young's sex-video chatrooms started in March and continued throughout the year. A representative for the Korean Cyber Sexual Violence Response Center (KCSVRC), a Seoul activist group that provides legal advice to victims of hidden-camera related crimes, said there are a lot of \\"Jung Joon-youngs\\" in society, and if the scandal had not involved a celebrity, it would have been uneventful. They said they hoped the anger it had generated would bring a change in the way such cases were looked at and punished; saying that a real change has to come from within a male society that it is not right to share or watch the videos. The House of Sharing, a support group for comfort women, responded to language revealed in Jung's chatroom conversations, where the women, in sexual contexts, were said to be \\"like comfort women\\". The president, Ahn Shin-kwon said, \\"We cannot hide our anger toward them for using such words to disparage women. It is disappointing to see such appalling historical knowledge from celebrities, who have a lot of influence over the public.\\" North Korean fans of the TV show 2 Days & 1 Night, which had starred Jung and two more celebrities who quit, were disappointed it was off-air, many of them not aware it had halted productions due to the scandal. It had been one of their favorite South Korean programs since the early 2010s, of analog television viewers in Pyongsong, Nampo, Pyongyang and places closer to the border, and for others through USB sticks and DVDs. The show went on hiatus for nine months after public criticism of the show's \\"chronic moral hazard problems\\". Viewers accused the show of leniency in the handling of Jung's prior public 2016 case of filming his girlfriend, after they allowed him to return to the show after a short absence; and were critical that the production crew had been a part of the group chat that was aware of Cha Tae-hyun's and Kim Jun-ho's gambling issues. Jung's distribution of sex videos was one of the top gender issues talked about on online platforms in South Korea for the first half of 2019, with research showing a growing trend of gender based topics, most in a negative context. Google Korea's 2019 most popular domestic searched terms included Jung Joon-young ranked at number two over-all, and number one for top public figure; with Burning Sun ranked at number three for domestic news and issues.

Outline of the incident On June 20, 2003, the four bodies of Shinjiro Matsumoto ( ), his wife Chika ( ), and their two children ages 11 and 8 were found in the ocean of Hakata Bay handcuffed and weighted down. Shinjiro Matsumoto, 41, had been strangled with a tie, and Chika, 40, had been drowned in a bathtub. The children had been strangled or smothered. (source) Three suspects were identified from witness testimony near the discovery site and footage of a surveillance camera at the store where the handcuffs and dumbbells used for the crime were sold. Once the victims had been murdered, their bodies were transported by vehicle to Hakata Bay where they were discarded in the ocean. The first suspect, Wei Wei (È≠è Â∑ç) was a 40-year-old former language student in Japan. He was detained by police in another case. He pleaded guilty to the four murder counts but had contended he was not a central figure in the case. The murder was the result of a plan to rob the family while at home. The remaining two suspects, who were also students, Yang Ning (Ê•ä ÂØß) and Wang Liang (Áéã ‰∫Æ), had fled to China, where they were also arrested. The three assailants said, \\"I committed a crime for the purpose of robbery\\". Chika and Shinjiro ran a high-end restaurant, and Wang arrived by accident on the way to a part-time job. On seeing a Mercedes-Benz parked outside the restaurant, Wang thought that, \\"There must be a bank deposit of around tens of millions of yen in Matsumoto's house.\\" Some of the victims' survivors said, \\"For the purpose of robbery, the amount of cash stolen was as small as about 40,000 yen, and there were many suspicious points, such as the fact that valuables such as cameras were left behind. Besides the three, there is a suspicion that accomplice may be present.\\"  Progress of criminal trials  = Hearing by the Chinese side (Yang and Wang) = The Chinese government did not respond officially, even when the accused Wei charged with the Japanese side was sentenced to death as described below. The criminal trial on the Chinese side proceeded in steps with Japan. Attention was paid to the sentencing balance and public opinion trends between Japan and China. Yang and Wang were arrested by public security officials in China and charged on July 27, 2004, about a year after the case. They were sentenced to severe punishment by prosecutors at the first trial on October 19, 2004. On January 24, 2005, the Liaoyang Intermediate People's Court sentenced Yang to death and Wang to life imprisonment. Yang was sentenced to death on February 3, 2005. His death sentence was confirmed by the Liaoyang Superior People's Court after a ruling which dismissed the appeal. Yang was executed on July 12, 2005 at the of age 25. = Hearing by the Japanese side (Wei Wei) = In Japan, Wei was indicted on March 23, 2004 by Judge Hiroshi Suyama of the Fukuoka District Court. The fact of prosecution was largely confirmed in the first trial, and on February 1, 2005, opening statements began whether the Fukuoka District Public Prosecutors Office should seek the death penalty. On May 19, 2005, the first trial was held, where the Fukuoka District Court (Presiding Judge Kawaguchi) sentenced Wei to death. The Court of Appeals turned away from the silent first instance and gave detailed testimony on the motive, the criminal process, the role of the three, and the apology to the victim's bereaved family. On March 8, 2007, the Court of Appeals upheld Wei Wei's appeal in favor of the first instance and death sentence in a trial of the appeal decision. Wei's appealed to the Supreme Court, but on October 20, 2011, Shiraki Isamu (), the presiding judge handed down the ruling dismissing Wei's appeal. The death sentence was finalized in the following month. Approximately eight years and one month after the death penalty was sentenced, Minister of Justice Masako Mori issued an execution order for Wei on December 23, 2019. On December 26, he was executed at Fukuoka Detention House at the age of 40.

Design  The submarines are reported to combine the roles of multi-purpose and strategic submarines, being able to use both cruise and ballistic missiles depending on the task and modular configuration. The submarines will have a smaller displacement than the current fourth-generation s and incorporate the double hull design with the outer hull made of composite materials. The composites are also expected to be used for control surfaces and propulsion system. The main armament is to include the 3M-54 Kalibr and P-800 Oniks anti-ship cruise missiles as well as the 3M22 Zircon hypersonic cruise missiles. The vessels are also projected to be armed with MARVed ballistic missiles currently in developlent by the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau. According to President of the United Shipbuilding Corporation Alexei Rakhmanov, the submarines are to be highly unified in their key components in order to substantially reduce the costs for the Russian Defence Ministry. The Project 545 submarines reportedly feature the displacement of 11,340 tons, maximum speed of 35 knots, 90 days of autonomy and maximum submersion depth of 600 meters.

Among the offices in which he served was United States Marshal for Vermont, a position he held from 1794 to 1801. Life =Early life= Jabez Gale Fitch was born in Norwich, Connecticut, on March 20, 1764, a son of Dr. Jabez Fitch (1729-1806) and Lydia (Huntington) Fitch (1735-1803). Fitch was raised and educated in Norwich, and his numerous brothers and sisters included Ebenezer Fitch, the first president of Williams College. During the American Revolution, Fitch went into the naval service while still a boy and he served on the Patriot side until the end of the war. He served in the militia in Vermont, and attained the rank of colonel, the title by which he was commonly addressed. =Career= When his parents and several siblings moved to Vermont in the late 1780s, Fitch joined them in relocating to the area around Vergennes. He was active in the local Masonic lodge, served in local offices including town lister, and was involved in civic projects including construction of a courthouse in Vergennes. Fitch became a merchant and trader. His enterprises included speculating in land, mills, an iron works, and producing lumber and potash for transport to markets in Quebec via Lake Champlain. In 1801, he purchased title to the town of Coventry from Ira Allen, then sold lots at moderate prices to encourage settlement in the area. An early adherent of the Federalist Party, Fitch served in appointed offices including deputy U.S. Marshal. In 1794, Vermont's first U.S. Marshal, Lewis R. Morris, resigned. Fitch was appointed to succeed Morris, and served until 1801. His tenure was most notable for his imprisonment of Democratic-Republican Party politician Matthew Lyon during Lyon's arrest and trial for violating the Alien and Sedition Acts. Lyon's constituents reelected him to Congress while he was in jail; after the law against sedition expired in 1801, Thomas Jefferson, the first Democratic- Republican president, replaced Fitch as U.S. Marshal with John Willard, a supporter of the Democratic-Republican Party. In the early 1820s, Fitch became overextended and his holdings were seized to satisfy creditors. He subsequently moved to Western New York to live with relatives. =Death= Fitch died in Warsaw, New York, on July 31, 1824. He was buried at Warsaw Cemetery (also known as Warsaw Pioneer Cemetery). =Family= Fitch was married to Speedy Goodrich (d. 1806). They were the parents of two sons and three daughters.

Life He was the son of Edgar Horne (1820‚Äì1905), and younger brother of William Edgar Horne; and was educated at Westminster School from 1876 to 1880. He entered Pembroke College, Oxford in 1884. Horne was a solicitor, at 50 Lincoln's Inn Fields. He had a large house, Ditton Place, built near Balcombe, Sussex, in 1904, with a formal garden by Reginald Blomfield. In 1914 he was chairman of Morib Plantations, Ltd. Ditton Place, now a school, in 2009 Beginning an involvement with theatre, initially as a backer, Horne ultimately became an actor-manager. He supported Johnston Forbes-Robertson in 1905 at the Scala Theatre, which was enlarged by F. T. Verity and continued to 1911, when it became a cinema. Again, in 1911, he supported John Eugene Vedrenne and Dennis Eadie, who took over the Royalty Theatre. He requested a curtain raiser from his friend A. A. Milne, around the beginning of 1914. During World War I, Horne was involved in entertainments for the troops, organised with Lena Ashwell and the YMCA. He supported Nigel Playfair's takeover in 1918 of the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, with Arnold Bennett. Horne in 1925 took over management of the Festival Theatre of the Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club. He brought in Tyrone Guthrie as resident director. That year, the company had a run of three weeks for James Bernard Fagan at the Oxford Playhouse, playing Ibsen, Somerset Maugham and Roland Pertwee. The licensee of the Westminster Theatre from 1931 to 1947, Horne took leading roles in productions there, under the stage name Waldo Wright. He brought from Cambridge a company including Robert Eddison, Evan John, Flora Robson and Gillian Scaife.

Biography  Marwan belonged to what the 11th- century anthologist al-Tha'alibi called \\"the most poetic of families in Islam\\", as it counted six poets. This tradition began with the eponymous ancestor, Marwan's great-grandfather, Abu Hafsa Yazid. He was either of Persian or Jewish origin and a mawla of the Umayyad caliph Marwan I. Marwan was born in al-Yamama in 723. In order to pursue his career, Marwan left his family's home for Baghdad, where he quickly rose to prominence in the court circles. Marwan knew to take advantage of his position and manage his image: the specialist of Arab poetry describes him as \\"sordidly avaricious, clumsy and unscrupulous, he would arrive at the palace clad in rags, despite the enormous sums which the caliphs gave him for his poems. With a keen eye to his own advancement, he attached himself to the prominent Arab chief Ma'n ibn Za'ida. He wrote numerous works in praise of his patron, of such skill and eloquence that on one occasion the Abbasid caliphs al-Mansur () and al-Mahdi () are said to have taken offence at the lavish praise, and to have excluded him from their presence for one year thereafter. Nevertheless he always returned to favour, not least because he shared his family's hostility to the Alids and was a staunch propagandist of the Abbasids' legitimacy. He was assassinated in under unclear circumstances. The story that his assassin was an Alid supporter angry about his attacks on their claims to the caliphate may be apocryphal, but as th ehistorian H. Kilpatrick notes, it nevertheless \\"suggests the impact that his poetry had\\". His brother Idris also wrote poetry, but it was Marwan's grandson, Marwan ibn Abi'l-Janub, who was the last notable poet of the family. Assessment Bencheikh considers Marwan \\"a great classical poet\\" and \\"a master of the well-turned utterance\\", with a \\"supple and lexically straightforward vocabulary\\" and \\"clear syntax\\" that lent themselves to striking formulations in his panegyrics. According to H. Kilpatrick, he was \\"a master of the classical style associated with the great Umayyad panegyrists\\". He was meticulous in the composition and preparation of his poems, first showing them to grammarians to improve his language. Indeed, his knowledge of Arabic was deficient; the strict philologist al-Asma'i (d. 828/833) scorned him as a half-Arab (muwallad) who never properly learned the language, and anecdotes tell of his giving incorrect explanations of words. At the same time, this was typical of the poets of his time, and did not prevent other philologists from praising his work: Ibn al-A'rabi (d. 846) considered him the last of the great poets. The bulk of his work is panegyric or elegiac in nature, but a few compositions on private, everyday affairs, have also survived.

Career Dauger first started his career at 17 years, as first-choice for Bayonne in 1936 while he was working locally at the cadastre. In 1938, he shifts to the semi- professionalism of rugby league, playing for RC Roanne XIII alongside Robert Samatan and Max Rousi√© while working for the Devernois factory, not appreciating the pseudo-amateur mores of the championship at the time. He was considered by the rugby league literature as \\"an attack prince\\" , \\"an exceptional back with dazzling start-up and an ultra-developed sense of game\\". In 1941, he returned to Bayonne as the Vichy regime and its R√©volution nationale banned rugby league. His two union international caps in 1945 for France on 1 January 1945 against Army Rugby Union (greeted by Jacques Chaban- Delmas, who will play alongside him in the following test cap against the British Empire XV on 28 April 1945), caused a very grave crisis against other national teams, being the reason of a 8-year eclipse. His last cap was on 10 January 1953, also brought a new crisis against Scotland. He still would play for Bayonne until 1956; he is the great centre who inspired his successors such as Maurice Prat, Roger Martine and Andr√© Boniface.

It was previously known by the synonym Vitaliana primuliflora. Native to the high mountains of Europe, it is cultivated as an alpine garden plant, being considered easy to grow in well drained soil in a sunny position. Description Androsace vitaliana is a cushion- or mat-forming plant reaching up to or more across. Its leaves are arranged in rosettes, each leaf being long and usually greyish green in colour. The flowers are usually unstalked (sessile) and are bright yellow in colour. They consist of a tube about or more long with five lobes reaching across when fully open. The flowers are borne singly at the ends of the leaf rosettes. Like the genus Primula, flowers are heterostylous, having pin and thrum forms. Taxonomy The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as Primula vitaliana. In 1845, Antonio Bertoloni placed it as the only species in a new genus, Vitaliana, using the replacement name Vitaliana primuliflora. It has also been placed in the genus Douglasia as Douglasia vitaliana. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that it is embedded within Androsace. =Subspecies= Six subspecies have been identified, with distinct distributions in the high mountains of Europe: *A. vitaliana subsp. assoana ‚Äì Iberian Peninsula excluding the Pyrenees *A. vitaliana subsp. cinerea ‚Äì south-western Alps *A. vitaliana subsp. lepontina ‚Äì Pennine Alps *A. vitaliana subsp. praetutiana ‚Äì Apennines *A. vitaliana subsp. sesleri ‚Äì south-eastern Alps *A. vitaliana subsp. vitaliana ‚Äì Pyrenees File:Androsace vitaliana subsp. praetutiana 2017-09-28 5400.jpgA. vitaliana subsp. praetutiana File:Vitaliana primuliflora 2016-04-22 8792.jpgFlowers File:Androsace vitaliana 100419.jpgIn cultivation in an alpine trough Distribution and habitat Androsace vitaliana is native to the high mountains of Europe in Spain, France, Italy, Switzerland and a small part of Austria.

It was written by Ed Hime, and directed by Lee Haven Jones. In the episode, the Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) and her companions Graham O'Brien (Bradley Walsh), Ryan Sinclair (Tosin Cole), and Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill) travel to a tranquility spa after Graham wins a free holiday, an alien resort on a deserted planet overrun with mutated beings. The episode was watched by 5.38 million viewers, and was the twelfth series' most poorly rated episode among critics and viewers.  Plot  The Doctor, Graham, Ryan and Yaz are taken to Tranquillity Spa via a transport cube for an all-inclusive stay. They are welcomed by their customer host, Hyph3n. As Ryan retrieves a snack from a vending machine, he is infected by a Hopper virus, which the Doctor is able to extract from him. While recovering, he meets a fellow guest, Bella. Meanwhile, a physical breach occurs and guests are asked to assemble for a muster drill. The Doctor convinces Hyph3n to give her access to the \\"linen cupboard\\", which is actually a security room with an armoury, where they meet Kane. The Doctor becomes suspicious upon discovering that there is an ionic membrane needed to protect a holiday spa. The creatures that broke into the spa start killing guests. Making matters worse, the Hopper virus also found its way into the spa's systems, disabling the transporter and security cameras. The remaining survivors, the spa's mechanic Nevi, his son Sylas, and an elderly woman, Vilma, meet at the \\"linen cupboard\\", but Vilma notices Benni, her partner, has gone missing. The Doctor builds a new ionic membrane from scratch to banish the creatures. Now safe, Kane identifies the creatures as the local Dregs. It is revealed that the spa is a \\"fakation\\", a place designed to look like a vacation but in a fabricated environment. The spa's system, which tracks all the guests, shows Benni outside the spa, so the survivors go out to rescue him. From the vehicle, the group sees the uninhabitable desolation of the orphan planet they are on, Orphan 55. The vehicle is caught in a Dreg trap and the Dregs surround it, keeping Benni as a hostage. The group makes a run for a nearby service tunnel, but the Dregs kill Hyph3n and Benni is shot by Kane. In the tunnel, Bella reveals she is Kane's daughter, who the latter neglected in order to build the spa. Bella escapes with Ryan via the transporter while the others are forced to continue further along to the stairs as Dregs swarm into the tunnel. After the Doctor, Yaz, and Graham discover a rusted Russian sign, they deduce that Orphan 55 is actually Earth after it was devastated by global climate change and nuclear war in an unknown year. Vilma sacrifices herself to give the group more time to escape. Going through a Dreg nest, the Doctor learns that the Dregs are mutated humans that survived the fallout. Kane stays behind to give the group more time to escape. Bella resumes her plan to destroy the spa out of anger toward her mother. As the Dregs surround the spa to attack, the group fixes the transporter and safely evacuate, leaving Bella and Kane behind to fight off the Dregs. Back in the TARDIS, the group despairs over Earth's future. The Doctor tells them that while this timeline is only a possibility, she cannot promise that it will not come to pass; humanity can either make a positive change or accept their fate and end up like the Dregs.

Toponymy  The toponymic designation ‚ÄúSawine River‚Äù appears on a 1947 map of Laurentian National Park. This acronym evokes the memory of an Abenaki family, more particularly that of Ambroise O'Bomsawin and her son Amable. In the 1850s, this family would have settled in Mashteuiatsh, in Lac-Saint-Jean. The specific ‚ÄúSawine‚Äù would therefore be the shortened form of the surname O'Bomsawin. The toponym ‚ÄúSawine River‚Äù was formalized on December 5, 1968, at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec - Rivi√®re Sawine.

Synopsis Beth (Riley) is an upper class conservationist who is in Scotland to protect the freshwater pearl mussel from poachers who prise open the mussels and kill them for the pearls inside. Compston's character Ritchie, falls in love with Beth when he sees her emerging from a river in a bikini.

Critical reception Almost all reviews were negative about the film; James Luxford, writing in the Radio Times said: \\"All the jokes miss the mark as well even though, surrounding the couple, are familiar faces in comedy including Harry Enfield and Russell Kane. Mostly, the supporting cast do horrendous accents and contribute little to the plot. Listless from start to end, there is nothing to be salvaged from this dreadful Highland fling.\\" Similarly, David Kettle said: \\"What Riley seems to be aiming for is a Pride- or even Brassed Off-style feelgood UK romcom-with-a-message. But with its broad, scattergun humour, lazy characterisation and inept plot and dialogue (not to mention its patronising, metropolitan view of \\"wild\\" Scotland), Scottish Mussel should have stayed firmly locked in its shell.\\" Robert Peacock, writing for the Wee Review, said : \\"Clich√©-heavy conservationist comedy seeks to emulate feel good British films of yesteryear.

Trenholme Bar station was closed in 1954 to passengers and four years later to goods. The station was located south of Stockton, and west of Battersby railway station. The A19 trunk road now runs through part of the station site. History Peter Hill Bridge, Trenholme Lane. This was just east of the station site The station was opened with the line in 1857 when the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Railway Company built their line between Picton and Stokesley, but just two years later, the line and stations were taken over by the North Eastern Railway (NER). Whilst the station was situated in a hamlet that had a crossing over a main north/south road (later the A19), it was the nearest railway station for Crathorne to the north and Mount Grace Priory to the south. A derailment occurred some east of the station on 7 September 1866. A late-running train that was not due to stop at Trenholme Bar, left the rails and fell to the south side of the running line. The train was believed to have been travelling at between and at the time. It caused some injuries and two deaths, with the bodies being moved to an inn at nearby Hutton Rudby, where an inquest was opened soon afterwards. The Board of Inquiry found that the engine was a goods engine which was too heavy for the line it was on and it was stated that \\"...the permanent way was unable to withstand the strain thus put upon it.\\" Bradshaw's timetable of 1877 shows five out and back workings between Stockton railway station and Whitby, with connections advertised in Middlesbrough. The timetable of 1906 shows that the station had six services eastbound from Stockton railway station towards , with five going all the way to and one terminating at Battersby railway station. Return services were just five a day with four coming from Whitby. The other service from Whitby reversed at Battersby and went to Stockton via railway station. By 1946, eight years before closure, the service was down to just three stopping services each way per day, with most of the services from Whitby to Stockton reversing at Battersby and going via Middlesbrough. The station was furnished with a small goods yard on the south side of the line. It had three sidings, one with a coal depot. The station closed in June 1954. When the A19 road was widened in the 1970s, the dual carriageway took up some of the former station site.

It is labelled \\"Act 6 of 2004\\". The Act amended The Citizenship Act, 1955 by: * introducing and defining a notion of \\"illegal migrant\\", who could be jailed or deported. * making illegal immigrants ineligible for citizenship by registration or by naturalisation,Citizenship soon for those who fled religious persecution, The Hindu, 5 August 2015. * disallowing citizenship by birth for children born in India if either parent is an illegal immigrant, and * introducing a notion of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) for citizens of other countries who are of Indian origin. The Act also mandated the Government of India to construct and maintain a National Register of Citizens.: \\"Section 14A made the registration of all citizens of India, issue of national identity cards, the maintenance of a national population register, and the establishment of the NRC by the central government, compulsory.\\" Scholar Anupama Roy described this amendment as a \\"hinge point\\" from which emerged the two contradictory tendencies represented by the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016 (eventually to be an Act in 2019) and the National Register of Citizens.: \\"The contemporary assemblage of citizenship space, dominated by the CAB and National Register of Citizens (NRC), may be seen as one where disparate and, indeed, adversarial political tendencies have coincided and become conjoined in their particularistic articulation of citizenship. The 2003 amendment, I argue, provided the hinge point from which these contradictory tendencies, represented by the NRC and CAB, emerged.\\" These two developments gave rise to large-scale protests all over India in December 2019. Background The Indian Constitution was implemented in 1950 guaranteed citizenship to all of the country's residents at the commencement of the constitution, and made no distinction on the basis of religion. The Indian government passed the Citizenship Act in 1955. The Act provided two means for foreigners to acquire Indian citizenship. People from \\"undivided India\\" were given a means of registration after five years of residency in India. Those from other countries were given a means of naturalisation after ten years of residency in India.India: Act No. 57 of 1955, Citizenship Act, 1955, UNHCR, retrieved 3 January 2020. (This is the version of the Act with amendments applied up to 10 December 1992.) A very large number of illegal immigrants, the largest numbers of whom are from Bangladesh, live in India. The Task Force on Border Management quoted the figure of 15 million illegal migrants in 2001. The majority of them live in the states of Assam and West Bengal, but many attempt to find work in big cities like Delhi. The reasons for the scale of migration include a porous border, historical migration patterns, economic reasons, and cultural and linguistic ties. On August 15, 1985, after six years of violent protests against migrants and refugees in the northeastern states of India, the Assam Accord was signed between the Indian government and the leaders of the Assam movement in the presence of Rajiv Gandhi. This accord, amongst other things, promised that the Indian government will deport all illegal aliens who had arrived after March 1971. A 1986 amendment to the Citizenship Act of 1955 was proposed and passed by a Congress-led government. This amendment restricted the Indian citizenship to those born in India prior to 1987 to either a mother or a father who was an Indian citizen. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 1986 effectively blocked jus soli citizenship to the children of couples who were both illegal aliens and to second-generation refugees from citizenship rights in India. In addition, in 1983, the Congress government passed the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act, thereby establishing a system to detect and expel foreigners through tribunal proceedings. The \\"detection, deletion and deportation\\" of illegal migrants has been on the agenda of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since 1996. After coming to power in 1998, the government drafted an amendment to the Foreigners Act, 1946 proposing jail sentences and fines for illegal immigrants as well as for those abetting illegal immigration. After receiving a review report from the Law Commission, the bill was passed by Rajya Sabha in May 2003 and by Lok Sabha in January 2004.RS nod to amend Foreigners Act, The Times of India, 7 May 2003.175th Report on The Foreigners (Amendment) Bill, 2000, Law Commission, via indiakanoon.org, September 2000.Discussion On The Foreigners (Amendment) Bill, 2003 .

Advani, Home minister and Deputy Prime Minister The bill was introduced in the Parliament by L. K. Advani, the Home Minister, on 7 May 2003 during its Budget session. It was sent to the parliamentary standing committee on home affairs, and came back to both the houses of the Parliament towards December 2003. It was passed unanimously by Rajya Sabha on 18 December and passed \\"without any acrimony\\" in the Lok Sabha on 22 December. The Congress, AIADMK, Rashtriya Janata Dal and some other opposition parties supported the bill.Dual Citizenship Bill passed in Rajya Sabha, The Hindu, 19 December 2003.Neena Vyas, Anita Joshua Dual citizenship Bill passed, The Hindu, 23 December 2003. The bill was branded as a \\"dual citizenship bill\\", a reference to the provision for Overseas Citizen of India. All the other changes to the citizenship law, some of the most radical ones since 1955, were passed without any comment. More than a decade later, in 2019, a comment made by Manmohan Singh, the leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha, got circulated. Singh said, in connection with the legislation of \\"illegal immigrants\\", that the minorities of Bangladesh who had faced persecution in the country had to be treated more liberally:BJP digs up Manmohan speech seeking citizenship for persecuted refugees, The Times of India, 20 December 2019. The deputy chairman of the Rajya Sabha, Najma Heptullah added that minorities in Pakistan also faced persecution. The Home minister L. K. Advani endorsed the view and made a distinction between an \\"illegal immigrant\\" and a \\"bona fide refugee\\":M. K. Venu, By Listing Religions, Modi's CAA Broke Atal-Manmohan-Left Concord on Persecuted Minorities, The Wire, 29 December 2019. But no changes in the bill are visible to address these concerns.  The Amendments  = Illegal migrants = Illegal migrants: The first significant change introduced by the 2003 Amendment is the introduction of the term \\"illegal migrant\\" to the Citizenship Act: : \\"The 2003 Act defined an illegal migrant as a ‚Äòforeigner‚Äô who entered India without a valid passport or documents as prescribed by/under the law or who entered with a valid passport or similar travel documents prescribed by/under the law, but who continued to stay beyond the permitted period.\\" The concept of \\"illegal migrants\\" was used for amending all the sections of citizenship acquisition (by birth, by descent, by registration and by naturalisation). Citizenship by birth: The section 3 of the principal Act (citizenship by birth) was replaced wholesale: The newly added clause (c) declares that, after 2003, if either parent of a child born in India is an illegal migrant, the child is not qualified to be a citizen. For children born between 1987‚Äì2003, it was adequate for one parent to be an Indian citizen. Prior to 1987, there were no restrictions. : \\"if ‚Äòeither of whose parents [was] a citizen of India at the time of his birth‚Äô, the Amendment Act of 2003 restricted citizenship by birth to a person born in India only where ‚Äòboth of his parents are citizens of India; or one of his parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth‚Äô.\\" : \\"It also restricted citizenship by birth to a person born in India on or after the commencement of the Act, both of whose parents are citizens of India, or one of whose parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of her/his birth.\\" Citizenship by descent: The section 4 of the principal Act (citizenship by descent) had its subsection (1) replaced wholesale: The amended section liberalised descent via father to descent via either parent. Citizenship by registration: The section of the principal Act (citizenship by registration, meant for \\"persons of Indian origin\\", i.e., migrants from \\"undivided India\\") had its subsection (1) replaced wholesale: By the main amendment to section 5, illegal migrants cannot acquire citizenship by registration. The residence requirement for citizenship by registration was also increased to seven years from five years. The clauses (f) and (g) added new provisions. Citizenship by naturalisation: Section 6 (citizenship by naturalisation) was amended prohibiting illegal migrants from getting naturalised: The Third Schedule, which lists the requirements for naturalisation, was amended by increasing the residency requirement to 12 years from the earlier 10 years. = National register of citizens = The 2003 Amendment mandated the Central Government to create and maintain a National Register of Citizens and to issue national identity cards to all the registered citizens. = Overseas citizens =  Aftermath  In January 2005, it was reported that the Odisha government headed by Naveen Patnaik targeted 1,551 people in the Mahakalpada block for deportation, calling them illegal Bangladeshis. All of them were Hindus, and included women and children. Even though it was known that the majority of illegal immigrants in the area were Muslims, it was said that the Biju Janata Dal government was reluctant to target them.No home to call one's own, The Telegraph, 25 January 2005. The targeted persons, belonging to the Namasudra Matua community, protested these actions over the next 15 years, including hunger strikes in Delhi and Kolkata, and filing a Supreme Court petition demanding unconditional citizenship.Himadri Chatterjee, Why Scheduled Caste Refugees of Bengal Are Resisting CAA and NRC, The Wire, 31 December 2019. The Estimates Committee of the Indian Parliament estimated 5.2 million refugees from the present day Bangladesh in 1989, 70 percent of whom belonged to agricultural communities and were mostly from scheduled castes. This population is likely to have grown to 13 million by 2019. Scholar Himadri Chatterjee states: In 2012, the CPI(M) leader Prakash Karat wrote Manmohan Singh, then prime minister, reminding him of his 2003 statement and urging him to bring an amendment to address the minority community refugees. The chief minister of Assam Tarun Gogoi also submitted a memorandum to the prime minister pleading that \\"Indian citizens\\" who had to flee religious persecution due to partition should not be treated as foreigners.Assam: Congress seeks citizenship for Hindu Bengalis, Buddhists who migrated from Bangladesh, The Economic Times, 2 June 2015.Political bid: Assam CM Tarun Gogoi seeks refugee tag for Hindus from Bangladesh, The Economic Times, 11 September 2013. In September 2015, the Narandra Modi government made a decision to exempt the minority refugees of Bangladesh and Pakistan who entered India before December 2014 from the category of \\"illegal immigrants\\" and made them eligible for long-term visas. The Foreigners (Amendment) Order, 2015 was issued under the Foreigners Act, 1946 for this purpose.Changes to Passport, Foreigners Acts still pending in top court, The Economic Times, 6 December 2019. In 2016, the Home minister Rajnath Singh brought a bill to the Parliament seeking exemption for persons belonging \\"minority communities, that is, Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsis, and Christians\\" fleeing Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh due to religious persecuting from being treated as \\"illegal immigrants\\". After considerable debate, a revised version of the bill was passed as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 and led to large-scale protests across India in 2019.

It was founded in the 19th century and became the only all-Christian village in Gujarat.  History  The Ghogha Christian mission was initiated by the Reverend James McKee in 1844 and was a part of the Kathiawar and Gujarat mission establishment started and supported by the Irish Presbyterian Mission. About 1869, Wallacepur was founded on a tract of land near the village of Kareda about southwest of Ghogha by William Beatty, a missionary at Ghogha from 1867 to 1877. The village was laid out and most of the houses were built by Beatty. He also built a church with a bell in 1871. The village was named after James Wallace, who had been appointed a missionary at Ghogha in 1845 and later at Surat. Wallace had retranslated scriptures, and written an educational textbook and some Gujarati tracts. Additions to the village were made by the Reverend George T. Rea, who was in charge of the mission afterwards. In 1871, a number of Christians came from Gujarat and settled. At the time, there were eight houses, a church with a bell, a resthouse, a missionaries house, a public well, and a cattle pond. Most of the villagers were Hindu and later adopted Christianity.  Demographics  The village has a population of around 500 people, all of whom are literate. It is the only all-Christian village in Gujarat and all the residents are Protestants. Most men are engaged in farming, while many women have taken up roles as nurses, teachers, and clerks in nearby villages and Bhavnagar. Disputes are settled internally and the village has been crime-free for years. Wallacepur has also been the recipient of the district council's cleanest village awards. The village has a reciprocal arrangement with the nearby village of Kareda, with residents of both attending each other's religious festivals.

ERIC shares multi-state voter registration information to improve both the accuracy of voter rolls and the encouragement of greater voter participation in elections.Archived Project, Pew Charitable Trust. Retrieved December 27, 2019. A Brennan Center study discovered an increasing rate of eligible voters being removed from the rolls.  Structure  In 2012, seven states, Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Nevada, Utah, Virginia, and Washington, joined to form ERIC, a non-profit organization. As of March 2020, 30 states plus the District of Columbia comprised its membership. Each jurisdiction has a member's seat on the organization's board. By 2019, Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin had joined the partnership, and Texas joined in March 2020.ERIC, Electronic Registration Information Center. 2019, Retrieved December 27, 2019. In the 2019-2020 fiscal year, its budget was slightly less than one million dollars.  Operations  ERIC essentially took the place of the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program (IVRC), or \\"CrossCheck.\\" That was an extremely labor-intensive and largely ineffective enterprise that had been developed in the interests of protecting the integrity of elections by focusing on and identifying voters who cast ballots in more than one state in the same electoral period. After years of major erroneous purges of voter rolls, harmful misidentification of legitimate voters, and costly operation in return for very marginal success, it was shut down in December 2019 in part off its own weight, but also as a direct result of litigation successfully brought by the Kansas Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.Kansas Abandons Technology Trumpeted by Kris Kobach, Trump‚Äôs Onetime Voter Fraud Czar, ProPublica, Jessica Huseman December 12, 2019. Retrieved December 27, 2019. ERIC, on the other hand, was developed by minimalist data scientist Jeff Jonas, using his effective software in a multistate project to identify eligible voters who had fallen off the rolls via unreported changes of address, for instance, and thereby to increase voter participation and also to resolve errors in voter rolls, such as removing names of deceased voters.Millions of Unregistered Voters, New York Times, Steve Lohr, November 5, 2018. Retrieved December 25, 2019. Bringing a different perspective to the difficulties, Jonas reported finding, \\"As I dove into the subject, it grew on me, the complexity and relevance of the problem.\\" Between 2012 and 2018, ERIC identified 26 million persons who were eligible to cast ballots but were not registered to vote, as well as 10 million registered voters who had moved, or who appeared on more than one list. As with many aspects of the electoral process, the maintenance and integrity of voter rolls are prominent issues. ERIC's role in the process is determinedly neutral. Administrators from both Democratic and Republican majority states have participated in the process of refining the product and reduced the challenge of handling data processing. Jonas modified his existing technology to accommodate the new challenges to identity resolution. \\"Every time you get two pieces of junk mail from the same place, that‚Äôs an entity resolution problem,\\" according to Jonas. He says they may be difficult to discern, but they're ubiquitous. In 2017, researchers at Stanford University, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Microsoft Corporation confirmed that Crosscheck produced erroneous eligibility data, elevating the potential of disenfranchising legitimate voters. An investigation by ProPublica found that Crosscheck was also lacking sufficient protection to keep registrant information from being hacked. Your private voter data is unsafe in national database, Mississippi Today, Adam Ganucheau, November 20, 2017. Retrieved December 27, 2019. States joining the program have agreed with pursuing its non-partisan and protective goals. David Becker, former head of the elections program at Pew and the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research observed, \\"If we didn't do that, ERIC would become another politicized tool.\\" That year, member governments included twenty-four states and the District of Columbia, from both traditionally \\"red,\\" and \\"blue\\" jurisdictions. Each group contributes at least voter registration and motor vehicle license data. ERIC's software digests and links that data, combining it with other input such as postal change-of-address lists. Private personal information including date of birth, driver‚Äôs license, and Social Security numbers, are stringently encrypted to ensure privacy. The program locates those eligible to vote no matter what their domiciles. Participating states are required to mail notifications to people identified as eligible to vote but not registered. Follow-up research in some states concluded that 10 to 20 percent of those contacted had later registered to vote, a high response rate for direct mailings, Mr. Hamlin said. That rate suggests 2.6 million to 5.2 million of the 26 million people notified became voters. Some state administrators said determining a person's current domicile can present problems, per the Brennan Center study. Member states report that \\"false positives\\" are rare. Unopened returned mail ‚Äî evidence of a wrong address ‚Äî is substantially reduced. Colorado's outreach produced the highest percentage of eligible, registered voters in the country in 2016, at 90 percent, up from 82 percent in 2012. \\"For my money, ERIC is a big part of that,\\" said Judd Choate, Colorado‚Äôs director of elections. \\"ERIC has been a game-changer in elections for those of us in it.\\" Jonas has been particularly pleased that ERIC has a two-person staff with one tending the constantly growing database of more than 275 million records.

The quantum Fisher information F_{\\\\rm Q}[\\\\varrho,A] of a state \\\\varrho with respect to the observable A is defined as F_{\\\\rm Q}[\\\\varrho,A]=2\\\\sum_{k,l} \\\\frac{(\\\\lambda_k-\\\\lambda_l)^2}{(\\\\lambda_k+\\\\lambda_l)} \\\\vert \\\\langle k \\\\vert A \\\\vert l\\\\rangle \\\\vert^2, where \\\\lambda_k and \\\\vert k \\\\rangle are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the density matrix \\\\varrho, respectively. When the observable generates a unitary transformation of the system with a parameter \\\\theta from initial state \\\\varrho_0, \\\\varrho(\\\\theta)=\\\\exp(-iA\\\\theta)\\\\varrho_0, the quantum Fisher information constrains the achievable precision in statistical estimation of the parameter \\\\theta via the quantum Cram√©r‚ÄìRao bound: (\\\\Delta \\\\theta)^2 \\\\ge \\\\frac 1 {F_{\\\\rm Q}[\\\\varrho,A]}. It is often desirable to estimate the magnitude of an unknown parameter \\\\alpha that controls the strength of a system's Hamiltonian H = \\\\alpha A with respect to a known observable A during a known dynamical time t. In this case, defining \\\\theta = \\\\alpha t, so that \\\\theta A = t H, means estimates of \\\\theta can be directly translated into estimates of \\\\alpha. Relation to the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative The quantum Fisher information equals the expectation value of L_{\\\\varrho}^2, where L_{\\\\varrho} is the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative. Convexity properties The quantum Fisher information equals four times the variance for pure states F_{\\\\rm Q}[\\\\vert \\\\Psi \\\\rangle,H] = 4 (\\\\Delta H)^2_{\\\\Psi} . For mixed states it is convex in \\\\varrho, that is, F_{\\\\rm Q}[p \\\\varrho_1 + (1-p) \\\\varrho_2 ,H] \\\\le p F_{\\\\rm Q}[\\\\varrho_1,H]+(1-p)F_{\\\\rm Q}[\\\\varrho_2,H]. The quantum Fisher information is the largest function that is convex and that equals four times the variance for pure states.

Note that \\\\vert \\\\Psi_k\\\\rangle are not necessarily orthogonal to each other. Inequalities for composite systems We need to understand the behavior of quantum Fisher information in composite system in order to study quantum metrology of many-particle systems. For product states, F_{\\\\rm Q}[\\\\varrho_1 \\\\otimes \\\\varrho_2 , H_1\\\\otimes {\\\\rm Identity}+{\\\\rm Identity} \\\\otimes H_2] = F_{\\\\rm Q}[\\\\varrho_1,H_1]+F_{\\\\rm Q}[\\\\varrho_2,H_2] holds. For the reduced state, we have F_{\\\\rm Q}[\\\\varrho_{12}, H_1\\\\otimes {\\\\rm Identity}_2] \\\\ge F_{\\\\rm Q}[\\\\varrho_{1}, H_1], where \\\\varrho_{1}={\\\\rm Tr}_2(\\\\varrho_{12}).  Relation to entanglement  There are strong links between quantum metrology and quantum information science. For a multiparticle system of N spin-1/2 particles F_{\\\\rm Q}[\\\\varrho, J_z] \\\\le N holds for separable states, where J_z=\\\\sum_{n=1}^N j_z^{(n)}, and j_z^{(n)} is a single particle angular momentum component. The maximum for general quantum states is given by F_{\\\\rm Q}[\\\\varrho, J_z] \\\\le N^2. Hence, quantum entanglement is needed to reach the maximum precision in quantum metrology. Moreover, for quantum states with an entanglement depth k, F_{\\\\rm Q}[\\\\varrho, J_z] \\\\le kN + N_{R}^{2} holds, where N_{R} is the remainder from dividing N by k. Hence, a higher and higher levels of multipartite entanglement is needed to achieve a better and better accuracy in parameter estimation. Similar quantities The Wigner‚ÄìYanase skew information is defined as I(\\\\varrho,H)={\\\\rm Tr}(H^2\\\\varrho)-{\\\\rm Tr}(H \\\\sqrt{\\\\varrho} H \\\\sqrt{\\\\varrho}). It follows that I(\\\\varrho,H) is convex in \\\\varrho. For the quantum Fisher information and the Wigner‚ÄìYanase skew information, the inequality F_{\\\\rm Q}[\\\\varrho,H] \\\\ge 4 I(\\\\varrho,H) holds, where there is an equality for pure states.

Background  Doyle comes from a racing background. Her father Mark Doyle, from Clonmel, is a former jockey and her mother Caroline rode in Arab horse races. The family lived in Herefordshire and had point-to-pointers and ponies at home. Doyle was a member of the Herefordshire Pony Club and rode her first pony race at the age of nine. She had her first ride under rules as an amateur rider on The Mongoose at Salisbury in May 2013, winning by half a length. After taking her GCSEs in 2013, she joined the training yard of David Evans in Wales. That winter she spent six weeks riding trackwork in Santa Anita, California.  Career  Doyle moved as an apprentice jockey to the Wiltshire yard of trainer Richard Hannon in 2014 and rode out her claim in November 2017. Her first win in a Listed race came on Billesdon Bess in the August 2017 Upavon Fillies' Stakes at Salisbury while still an apprentice.

Pilgrims come from Alsace, Lake Constance, and Switzerland, among other places. History Inscription near the statue's altar In 1643 the city of Rottweil was under siege by French troops during the Thirty Years' War. As cited in the original Dominican document, 300 citizens of the town ceaselessly prayed the rosary at a statue of the Madonna and Child at the Dominican church. On 10 November 1643 witnesses saw the statue turn pale and raise its eyes toward heaven then back to the city. Some claimed to have heard it speak. Both Catholics and non-Catholics witnessed the event. Fifteen days later, the statue's face turned reddish and the eyes moved again while shedding a few tears. At the same time, the French and Saxe-Weimar troops were defeated by Bavarian troops in the Battle of Tuttlingen. The victory was attributed to the intercession of Mary. The statue remained in the church until 1802 following the secularization of Germany when the monastery was dissolved and the church was seized by the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. At this time the statue was transferred to the city's main Catholic church, the Holy Cross M√ºnster. A solemn procession was held to relocate the statue on 29 December of that year. The Dominican church later became the town's Protestant church, the Predigerkirche. The statue was loaned back to the former Dominican church temporarily from 5 March 2016 to 24 September 2017 while the Holy Cross M√ºnster was under restoration.

Its plot follows a professional tennis player who is kicked off the tour for punching an opponent then recruited to play in a secret league that is part Fight Club, part Dodgeball. It was released on video on demand.  Plot  The movie begins with professional tennis player Aaron Faust (Sharples) playing an exhibition match at the estate of the late Mickey Rooney. Despite the fact that the match is for a good cause \\"benefitting underprivileged children,\\" Aaron has a John McEnroe-like meltdown over a line call then punches his opponent who finds Faust's Achilles heel when he taunts him for playing a ‚Äúpussy sport.‚Äù Banned from the ATP tour, dumped by his fianc√©, and sentenced to anger management, Aaron is blindsided by the sudden turn his life has taken and laments that \\"tennis is missing something\\" but doesn't quite know what it is. Julie (Fox), a fellow anger management participant, aroused by Aaron's \\"bad-ass\\" on-court behavior, introduces him to Dwayne (Head), an intense and charismatic tennis zealot who is also \\"star-struck\\" by Aaron and immediately tries to recruit him for an underground tennis league called Gentlemen's Fury. Gentlemen's Fury is Dwayne's answer to tennis‚Äô image problem, and also, he promises, just what Aaron needs to turn his life around. Though hesitant at first, Aaron is excited to learn that Gentlemen's Fury is made up of other former pros who were excused from the tour for questionable behavior and that the league takes significant liberties with the rules of tennis, essentially turning it into a contact sport, so he joins the squad. But Aaron begins to realize as he gets deeper and deeper involved in this cult-like club that Gentlemen's Fury might not be all it's cracked up to be. The pay is good, but the rules are a little vague and, it turns out, increasingly dangerous. Dwayne, in true cult leader fashion, transforms from a guy spouting a new tennis utopia into a crazed psychopath with more than one homicide on his hands, while Aaron struggles at first to keep up, then just to survive.

Production  Gentlemen's Fury began principal photography on June 1, 2015 after a successful Kickstarter campaign. The film was shot over 18 days, mostly in Santa Monica and Manhattan Beach. League scenes were filmed at Studios 60 in Los Angeles. Post production occurred over the next year and a half.  Distribution  Ben Sharples and Marissa Hall at the American Film Market The filmmakers took Gentlemen's Fury to the 2016 American Film Market, where they received 15 offers from various distribution companies and sales agents.

These coalitions are also termed Blue‚ÄìRoman (French: Bleue-romaine, Dutch: Rooms- blauw), corresponding to the colors of the liberal parties, and the Roman of the Roman Catholic Church for the Christian Democrats.  History  While the term originated after the 2007 Belgian federal election to designate the proposed federal coalition between christian democrats and liberals, several Belgian government coalitions correspond with this definition. In fact, the first coalition government in Belgian history following the Belgian Revolution were composed of Catholics and Liberals. This coalition was known in the 19th century as the Unionist coalition, as it represented a union of the Catholics and Liberals against the Netherlands. From the 1860s onward, Belgium had majority governments consisting of either the Liberal Party or the Catholic Party. It wasn't until the Interwar period that the Catholic-Liberal coalition formed a coalition government together again. At the time, it was the only viable majority coalition to prevent the Belgian Labour Party from forming government. Between World War II and the 1980s, government coalitions alternated between those formed by the Orange-Blue coalition, and those formed by the Parti Socialiste/Socialistische Partij Anders. Since the end of the 1980s, these types of coalitions are almost never seen in Belgian politics. An exception occurred before the 2019 Belgian federal election, when the Michel II Government used the coalition prior to the election. = Federal Government = * 1831 : de Gerlache (Catholiques-Lib√©raux) * 1831 : Lebeau I (Catholiques-Lib√©raux) * 1831‚Äì1832 : de Muelenaere (Catholiques-Lib√©raux) * 1832‚Äì1834 : Goblet (Catholiques-Lib√©raux) * 1834‚Äì1840 : de Theux I (Catholiques-Lib√©raux) * 1841‚Äì1845 : Nothomb (Catholiques-Lib√©raux) * 1845‚Äì1846 : Van de Weyer (Catholiques-Lib√©raux) * 1855‚Äì1857 : De Decker (Catholiques-Parti lib√©ral) * 1921‚Äì1925 : Theunis I (Parti catholique-Parti lib√©ral) * 1927‚Äì1931 : Jaspar II (Parti catholique-Parti lib√©ral) * 1931‚Äì1932 : Renkin (Parti catholique-Parti lib√©ral) * 1932‚Äì1934 : de Broqueville III (Parti catholique-Parti lib√©ral) * 1934‚Äì1935 : Theunis II (Parti catholique- Parti lib√©ral) * 1939 : Pierlot II (Parti catholique-Parti lib√©ral) * 1949‚Äì1950 : Gaston Eyskens I (CVP-PSC-Parti lib√©ral) * 1958‚Äì1960 : Gaston Eyskens III (CVP-PSC-Parti lib√©ral) * 1960‚Äì1961 : Gaston Eyskens III (remani√©) (CVP-PSC-Parti lib√©ral) * 1966‚Äì1968 : Vanden Boeynants I (CVP-PSC-PLP-PVV) * 1974 : Tindemans I (PSC-CVP-PLP-PVV) * 1977 : Tindemans III (PSC-CVP-PLP-PVV) * 1981‚Äì1985 : Martens V (PSC-CVP-PRL-PVV) * 1985‚Äì1987 : Martens VI (PSC-CVP- PRL-PVV) * 1987‚Äì1988 : Martens VII (PSC-CVP-PRL-PVV) * 2018‚Äì : Michel II (MR- CD&V-Open; Vld) = Flemish Government = * 1985‚Äì1988 : Geens II (CVP-PVV) * 1988 : Geens III (CVP-PVV) = Walloon Government = * 1985‚Äì1988 : Wathelet (PSC-PRL) * 2017‚Äì2019 : Borsus (MR-cdH) = German Community Government = * 1986‚Äì1990 : Maraite I (CSP-PFF)  See also  * 2007‚Äì08 Belgian government formation * Verhofstadt III Government * 2007 Belgian federal election * Federal Government of Belgium * 2010‚Äì2011 Belgian government formation * Second Merkel cabinet, an equivalent coalition government in (Germany)  References   External links  * Galerie de dessins de Vadot sur la crise politique en 2007 * Galerie de dessins de Vadot sur la crise politique en 2008 Category:Coalition governments Category:Politics of Belgium ","title":"Orange‚Äìblue coalition"},{"id":"62677290","text":"Khiji Chandeswori Domestic Airport (also known as Khiji Demba Airport) is an under-construction domestic airport in Khiji Chandeshwari in Okhaldhunga District in Province No. 1 in Nepal.

He is professor of computer science at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and director and founder of the Institute of Architecture of Application Systems (IAAS).  Biography  Leymann studied Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy, and received a Master of Science degree in Mathematics (i.e. Dipl.-Math.) in 1982 from University of Bochum, Germany. He worked as research staff member in the Faculty of Mathematics at University of Bochum, where he obtained his PhD in Mathematics (i.e. Dr. rer. nat.) in 1984. In his PhD thesis he studied foliations on spaces with singularities. After his PhD he went to IBM Research and Development contributing to software products like DB2, Websphere, or MQSeries. Leymann was main co-inventor and chief software architect of IBM's business process management and workflow products, and was appointed IBM Distinguished Engineer for this work. In 2004, he was appointed full professor of computer science at University of Stuttgart where he founded the Institute of Architecture of Application Systems. He holds many granted patents in the area of software.  Work  Frank Leymann's main contributions are from the domains of workflow systems, service-oriented architecture, and cloud computing. He also active in the area of quantum computing. = Database management = His initial focus was on database technology: In order to simplify queries on relational databases with many tables, Leymann co- developed a universal relation system on top of existing relational database systems. Contributions to architectural aspects of stored procedures and user defined functions followed. The latter resulted in investigating the use of object databases, especially ObjectStore, as the underpinning of other middleware. At this time, developers were quite unfamiliar with object databases, thus, Leymann helped to create tooling to ensure proper performance of corresponding applications. = Business process management & workflow systems = Workflow systems support companies in modeling, optimizing, and executing their business processes in computing environments. Several languages have been proposed for modeling business processes, out which two languages are widely supported in industry: one of which is the OASIS (organization) standard Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) that Leymann co-invented and which in turn is based on Web Services Flow Language (WSFL), a language that Leymann authored for IBM; the other language is Business Process Model and Notation 2.0 (BPMN), which Leymann co-author too. Such modeling languages support \\"programming in the large \\" and allow splitting high-level logic of control- and data flow within an overall application from low-level logic implementing elementary business functions; this way, workflow-based applications can be created, that allow changing business processes without having to change the programs implementing individual steps of the process. Often, collections of such steps represent long running transactions, i.e. performed steps must succeed or - in case of an error - must be collectively undone; to support this behavior in business processes Leymann introduced compensating transactions in workflow systemsF. Leymann: Supporting Business Transactions Via Partial Backward Recovery in Workflow Management Systems. In: Proc. BTW'95, 1995. Based on his contributions to IBM's workflow products, Leymann co-authored the seminal book \\"Production WorkflowF. Leymann, D. Roller: Production Workflow: Concepts and Techniques. PTR Prentice Hall, 2000. \\" that explains how to build scalable and reliable workflow systems. = Service computing = The architecture and implementation of workflow systems anticipated many aspects of service- oriented programming like the use of service interfaces, service invoker, or service listener. Consequently, from 2000 on, Leymann helped to define several of the original web service standards like WS-Addressing, WS-Business Activity, BPEL4People, or the Web Services Resource Framework. Especially, aggregation of web services has been addressed by BPEL and WSFL. How the plethora of web service standards fit into an architecture for an enterprise service bus was described in a book on the web service platformS. Weerawarana, P. Curbera, F. Leymann, T. Storey, D.F. Ferguson: Web Services Platform Architecture. Prentice Hall, 2005. co-authored by Leymann. = Cloud computing = The work on the web services resource framework had already shown that elements of a computing infrastructure like hardware, operating systems etc. can be perceived as services too - just like software functionality. Consequently, complete applications can be outsource to the cloud, which requires standards and technology to provision and manage applications in such environments: Frank Leymann was initial co-author of OASIS TOSCA that allows to specify the structure of applications, their artifacts, and dependencies, as well as the associated operational semantics to automatically provision such applications. Leymann's group at University of Stuttgart built an open source implementation of this standard called OpenTOSCA. Guidelines for building applications that fit properly into the cloud have been derived jointly with industry partners and was published as a vendor-neutral language of cloud computing patterns.Ch. Fehling, F. Leymann, R. Retter, W, Schupeck, P. Arbitter: Cloud Computing Patterns, Springer Wien, 2014.

Patterns are abstractions of concrete working solutions, but in course of the abstraction process the knowledge about these workings solutions is lost - with the consequence that working solutions are created over and over again when a pattern is applied. To avoid this ineffectiveness, the reuse of concrete solutions has been investigated and worked out.M. Falkenthal, J. Barzen, U. Breitenb√ºcher, Ch. Fehling, F.

Modleski argued that the formulaic nature of these genres gave readers the freedom to construct their own response, at a distance from the text. Her next book, The Women Who Knew Too Much, examined seven Hitchcock films: Blackmail, Murder, Rebecca, Notorious, Rear Window, Vertigo and Frenzy. Modelski now challenged the terms of taking 'distance' from a text, arguing that \\"the desire for distance itself [is] ... bound up with the male's insistence on his difference from woman.\\" By contrast to male violence, the 'feminine' could embrace \\"narrative empathy, spectatorial passivity, and the subconscious imaginary\\". In Feminism Without Women, Modleski argued that \\"male power frequently works to efface female subjectivity by occupying the site of femininity\\", and that the writer has a responsibility to re-articulate women's shared experience.

The course of the Trompeuse River crosses the northwestern part of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. The Trompeuse river valley is located between route 169 connecting Quebec (city) to Chicoutimi and route 155 connecting La Tuque to Chambord. This valley is also served by some secondary forest roads of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve, especially for forestry and recreational tourism activitiesOpen Street Map - Accessed February 3, 2019. Forestry is the main economic activity in this valley; recreational tourism, second. On the rivi√®re aux √âcorces, downstream from the confluence of the Trompeuse river and at the head of the lac aux √âcorces des spawning grounds are recognized as one of the best spring fishing sites in the territory of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. The surface of the Trompeuse River is usually frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March, however the safe circulation on the ice is generally made from mid-December to mid-March.  Geography  The main watersheds neighboring the Trompeuse River are: * north side: lac aux √âcorces, lac √† la Culotte, Pikauba River, rivi√®re aux canots, Panache Lake; * east side: Fortin stream, Cloutier stream, Huit lake, Charland lake, rivi√®re aux Canots; * south side: Araigne brook, Gros-Jos brook, rivi√®re aux √âcorces North-East, rivi√®re aux √âcorces, * west side: rivi√®re aux √âcorces, Lac √ârin, Lac Samson, Lac Monbrion, lac aux √âcorces, Salvail stream. The Trompeuse River originates at Trompeur Lake (length: ; altitude: ) in a forest area in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. This source is located at: * east of Lac du Chasseur; * south-east of a curve in the course of the rivi√®re aux Canots; * east of Lac √† la Culotte; * north-east of lac aux √âcorces which is crossed by the rivi√®re aux √âcorces; * north-west of the confluence of the Rivi√®re Trompeuse and rivi√®re aux √âcorces; * north-west of the course of the rivi√®re aux √âcorces North-East; * of the hamlet Mont-Apica where the route 169 passes. From its source (Trompeur Lake), the Trompeuse River flows over with a drop of entirely in the forest zone, according to the following segments: * towards the south in particular by crossing Lake Tiffaut (length: ; altitude: ) over its full length, up to its mouth. Note: Lac Tiffaut receives the outlet (coming from the east) from Lac Rousseau; * south to Fortin stream (coming from the east); * first towards the west, towards the northwest, then towards the west by crossing an area of marsh, until the discharge (coming from the north) of the lake of Chasseur; * first towards the southwest by crossing a marsh area at the start of the segment, then towards the south in particular by crossing Second Lake Thivierge (length: ; altitude: ), then Thivierge Lake (length: ; altitude: ) on , to the mouth of the latter; * south, to Cloutier stream (coming from the east); * towards the south by forming a loop towards the west and collecting around twenty streams, to its mouth. The Trompeuse river flows on the northeast bank of the rivi√®re aux Canots. This confluence is located at: * north-east of Lac √ârin; * south-east of lac aux √âcorces; * east of M√©tascouac Lake; * north-east of a curve of the M√©tabetchouane River; * south-west of route 169; * south of the confluence of the Pikauba River and the rivi√®re aux √âcorces; * south-east of the confluence of the Pikauba River and Kenogami Lake; * southwest of the confluence of the Chicoutimi River and the Saguenay River in the Chicoutimi sector of the city of Saguenay (city). From the mouth of the Trompeuse river, the current successively follows the course of the rivi√®re aux √âcorces on generally towards the north, the course of the Pikauba River on generally to the north, crosses Kenogami Lake on north-east to barrage de Portage-des-Roches, then follows the course of the Chicoutimi River on towards the east, then the northeast and the course of the Saguenay river on towards the east until Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary .  Toponymy  The toponym ‚ÄúRivi√®re Trompeuse‚Äù appears on a 1928 map. Two theses can explain the meaning of this toponym: * According to the first thesis, this toponym was attributed by the fact that the body of water at its confluence, generated by the widening of the river, comprising five islands, leads to confuse the discharge of the Trompeuse river and the main course de la rivi√®re aux √âcorcesWork: Names and places of Quebec, work of the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec, published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of a printed illustrated dictionary, and in that of a CD-ROM produced by the Micro-Intel company, in 1997, from this dictionary.. This body of water also receives the Spider Creek (coming from the east). * According to the second thesis, when going up the river upstream of Second Thivierge Lake, navigators arriving at a marsh area (located on the east side of the watercourse), confuse the discharge (coming from the north) of Lac du Chasseur, which is wider, and the outlet (coming from the east) from Trompeur and Tiffaut lakes. This confusion is accentuated in this place by the presence of an island on the course of the outlet of Lac Trompeur, in the marsh area. The toponym ‚ÄúRivi√®re Trompeuse‚Äù was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©becCommission de toponymie du Qu√©bec - Rivi√®re Trompeuse.

Life Mas ø≈´d became the abbot of the Dayr al-·π¢alƒ´b (Monastery of the Cross) around 1462/63. He left the monastery in 1480/81 to become bishop of ·∏§esno d'Kifo and the monastery of Mor Quryaqos. As bishop he took the name Basil. In 1492 he became the Patriarch of ·π¨ur  øAbdin (as Mas ø≈´d II) and by tradition took the throne name Ignatius. As patriarch he promoted monasticism in the ·π¨ur  øAbdin. Mas ø≈´d was not a popular patriarch. He caused confusion by appointing a maphrian, Baselios Malki of Midyat, and twelve new bishops for the ·π¨ur  øAbdin, provoking some leading bishops to denounce him. According to Afram Barsoum, they denounced him to the Patriarch of Antioch, the head of the Syriac Orthodox church, but according to the anonymous continuator of the Ecclesiastical History of Bar Hebraeus, they denounced him to the secular Islamic authority, the emir of ·∏§esno d'Kifo. As a result, Mas ø≈´d was forced into retirement. According to the continuator, he was even confined to a monastery. He abdicated and ordered his supporters not to elect a new patriarch, but before the end of his life he had regained the exercise of his patriarchal functions. Some sources have him dying in 1509, others reigning as patriarch down to 1512. The identification of the abbot, bishop and writer with the patriarch was first made by Afram Barsoum in the 20th century. Works Only one work by Mas ø≈´d has survived, the Elpo ru·∏•onoyto or The Spiritual Boat. An extended poem in dodecasyllabic metre, it is a guide for monks and hermits seeking the \\"haven of impassibility\\". It is a mystical tract in three sections devoted to the Trinity, Christology and the spiritual gifts given by Christ to both angels and humans. The last section is based on the Pseudo-Dionysian Celestial Hierarchy. The life of Mas ø≈´d Zazoyo before he was ordained a bishop in 1480/81 is recorded in a short biographical notice written by his disciple  øAziz and included in the oldest manuscript of Mas ø≈´d's Spiritual Boat, now kept in Baghdad.

Contents In 1987, four years after the release of the third (and at the time, the final) Star Wars movie, Return of the Jedi, West End Games published the popular Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game. However, by 1992, having published many supplements and adventures, West End Games was finding it increasingly difficult to create original material out of the original trilogy of movies; they decided to release a second edition of the game called The New Republic, based on the Thrawn trilogy of novels by Timothy Zahn. Several sourcebooks were released based on the novels; the second book, Dark Force Rising Sourcebook, takes its material from the second novel of the trilogy, Dark Force Rising. Dark Force Rising Sourcebook is a 144-page softcover book written by Bill Slavicsek, with graphics and illustrations by Stephen Crane, Mike Nielsen, Dana Knutson, Rob Caswell, John Paul Lona, and Mike Vilardi, with cover art by Tom Jung. The sourcebook gives biographical profiles of notable personalities from Zahn's novel, and brief profiles of planets and aliens mentioned in the novel. Reception In the November 1993 edition of Dragon (Issue #199), Rick Swan found that although the biographical \\"background summaries are informative and enlightening,\\" the book was otherwise remarkably light on substantive content. Swan thought the book \\"feels tentative and inclusive; there doesn't seem to be enough material to justify a 144-page book.\\" Swan gave Dark Force Rising Sourcebook an average rating of 3.5 stars out of 6, saying that \\"players on a budget\\" could probably get along without it.

He was a member of the Rana Dynasty of Nepal.  Early life  Rana was born in Tansen Durbar, Lumbini Zone, to Lieutenant General Madhav Shamsher J.B. Rana and Rani Madhavi Kumari Rana. Lt General Madhav Rana was the Governor of Dhankuta during the Rana Dynasty. He was the fourth son. Rana had four brothers (three elder and one younger) and three sisters (two elder and one younger). Rana belonged to a family with a history in military command and statesmanship. His paternal grandfather, Maharaj Kumar Commanding General Pratap Shamsher J.B. Rana, had been the Governor of Palpa (1924‚Äì1929) as well as the Commanding General of Northern Nepal (1932‚Äì1934). His paternal great-grandfather, Commanding General Maharaja Sir Bir Shumsher J.B. Rana, had been the 11th Prime Minister of Nepal and the Maharaja of Lamjung and Kaski (1885‚Äì1901). Rana completed most of his further education in India. He passed the admission examination of the Benares Hindu University in 1949. He was awarded his Intermediate of Arts Degree in 1951. He then began pursuing a BA degree at BHU but dropped out in the last year due to his successful results in the Officer Cadre Selection Examination for the Royal Nepalese Army.‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞‡§•‡•Ä ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∏‚Äå‚Äå‚Äå‚Äç‡§§‡•ç‡§ö‡§ø‡§§ ‡§∂‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∂‡•á‡§∞ ‡§ú‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó‡§¨‡§π‡§æ‡§¶‡•Å‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡§æ.

Kathmandu: Abhilekhalaya Shakha, Jangi Adda, Nepal Army Headquarters. 2003  Military career  = Junior officer = After his selection, he chose the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst to undertake his military training in 1953. He completed his training and was commissioned into the Royal Nepalese Army in the rank of second lieutenant on 22 July 1955. At the time, the then Lieutenant Rana was the second officer in the Royal Nepalese Army to have received training from Sandhurst. In his first posting, he was assigned to the Shree Shreenath Battalion.‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞‡§•‡•Ä ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∏‚Äå‚Äå‚Äå‚Äç‡§§‡•ç‡§ö‡§ø‡§§ ‡§∂‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∂‡•á‡§∞ ‡§ú‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó‡§¨‡§π‡§æ‡§¶‡•Å‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡§æ.

The objective of the team was to resolve the border disputes taking place at the time. The work undertaken by the team contributed to the official border agreement between Nepal and China signed in 1961. After being promoted to captain in 1962, he underwent further training at the Nepalese Military Academy which at that time was based in Nagarkot. He was then assigned to the No.1 Home Guard of the Barda Bahadur Battalion. During this period, he was promoted to Assistant Battalion Commander and afterwards, Acting Battalion Commander. = Staff College and Para Rifle Company = In 1965, he left for Staff College training to Germany to join the F√ºhrungsakademie der Bundeswehr in Hamburg. After spending a year in Hamburg, Rana returned to Nepal. Upon his return, he was promoted to major and was deputed to the Army Headquarters. In 1970, he was transferred to the Para Rifle Company. Immediately after his transfer, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. A year after this, he took overall command of the Para unit as well as the Para Training Academy. He was associated with the Para unit for eleven years. At the start of his tenure, he completed his parachuting training course which was facilitated by the instructors of the Israel Defense Force. = Khampa Disarmament Operation = By the early 1970s about nine thousand Khampa fighters, Tibetan tribesmen resisting Chinese authority, had crossed over the border to the remote Nepalese district of Mustang. Here they established military camps from where they would launch attacks into the Chinese Autonomous Region of Tibet.Abhilekhalya Shakha, Jangi Adda, Nepal Army Headquarters In addition to carrying out illegal military activity, the Khampa fighters had been pillaging, plundering and killing members of the local communities. Consequently, a joint agreement between the Nepalese and Chinese governments was signed, with the common objective of disarming the Khampa fighters. A brigade size task-force was organised with the objective of disarming the Khampa fighters in 1974. Before the deployment of the entire taskforce, the then Lieutenant Colonel Rana led a small reconnaissance team to gather military intelligence in order to formulate the procedure of disarmament. After having identified the locations of various military camps, gauged their military capabilities and identified the leaders of the Khampa fighters, Rana devised the plan of operations. The taskforce was deployed towards Mustang on 15 July 1974. The main battle group of the task force was based around the Shree Shreenath Battalion, which was under the command of Rana. Consequently, Rana was given the leadership of the ground operations. After having received multiple false promises of disarmament from Gey-Wangdi, the commander of the Khampa forces, military units under the command of Rana moved in to occupy the camps on 1 August. Whilst Rana was able to dismantle all the camps, recover large quantities of weaponry and capture a number of Khampa fighters, Gey- Wangdi was able to escape. Wangdi was eventually killed in a fire fight in mid-September. Rana was awarded the Kirtimaya Nepal Shreepad for \\"his effective planning, efficient execution and distinguished field command during the operation\\". = Royal Nepalese Military Academy Kharipati = After the completion of the Khampa Operation, Rana was promoted to the rank of colonel in May, 1975. He was then appointed as the Commandant of the Royal Nepalese Military Academy, Kharipati. During his tenure as commandant, he tried to re- calibrate the syllabi of the academy to focus on mountain warfare. He also took the initiative to undertake research in order to solve the logistical problems related to mountain warfare.‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞‡§•‡•Ä ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∏‚Äå‚Äå‚Äå‚Äç‡§§‡•ç‡§ö‡§ø‡§§ ‡§∂‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∂‡•á‡§∞ ‡§ú‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó‡§¨‡§π‡§æ‡§¶‡•Å‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡§æ. Kathmandu: Abhilekhalaya Shakha, Jangi Adda, Nepal Army Headquarters. 2003 = United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon = In 1978, the Royal Nepalese Army deputed Rana to work in the headquarters of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon as Chief Operations Officer. The UNIFL had been set up by the United Nations in response to the South Lebanon conflict which took place the same year. Rana's tenure as COO saw the Tyre District, a designated UN area, being infiltrated and occupied by eighty Palestine Liberation Organization fighters. This destabilised the military and political situation, as Israel had only recently withdrawn troops from Lebanon on the condition that the PLO would follow suit. Rana responded by placing various peacekeeping units in positions around the Tyre District and surrounding the infiltrators. Consequently, he made their position strategically untenable and forced them into negotiations. He personally led the negotiations with the PLO fighters and their leaders, including Yasser Arafat, who were based in the surrounding regions. After one and a half months, Rana ensured their withdrawal without the need for military confrontation. During his time as COO, he developed a close rapport with the then Secretary General of the UN Kurt Waldheim. Throughout the Tyre District confrontation, he was in correspondence with Waldheim, discussing and formulating peacekeeping plans with him. When they met in person at the UN Headquarters in New York, Waldheim offered Rana a tenure extension in lieu of his effective leadership of the UNIFL. However, Rana declined due to his prior professional commitments to the Royal Nepalese Army.People of Nepal Who's Who. Kathmandu: Sahitya Prakashan Pvt Ltd. 2004. = 1979 student protests and Director of Military Operations = Rana returned to Nepal in 1979. Whilst he had been in Lebanon, Rana had been promoted to the rank of brigadier general. Upon his return, he was appointed commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade. His tenure as commander witnessed the 1979 Nepalese Student Protests. The main objective of the protestors was to gain democratic freedom. The Brigade was based in Kathmandu when the protests began. Rana was involved in the minimisation of violence and vandalism which was being carried out by certain reactionary groups of the protest. The protests came to an end after King Birendra announced a referendum. Following the election, the electorate chose to continue with monarchical panchayat system.Shaha, Rishikesh. Politics in Nepal 1980‚Äì1990. New Delhi: Manohar Publications, 1990. Afterwards, Rana commanded the 2nd Infantry Brigade in 1980. Rana was promoted to the rank of major general in 1982. Along with this promotion, he was also appointed as the Director General of Military Operations. In this capacity, he supervised the planning and execution of all military operations undertaken by the Army. = Chief of Army Staff = On 15 May 1987, Rana was appointed as the Chief of Army Staff. During his tenure as COAS, which lasted four years, he planned and executed multiple military and civil missions. During the Third SAARC Summit held in November 1987, as COAS he was in-charge of the overall security, logistics and administration. In 1988, an earthquake of magnitude 6.5 struck eastern Nepal along its border with the Indian state of Bihar. 252 people perished, more than a thousand were injured and thousands of houses collapsed due to the earthquake. Rana was responsible for coordinating search and rescue operations. He also carried out the implementation of rehabilitation programmes. In late ‚Äò89 and early ‚Äò90, protests broke out in Kathmandu and in other parts of Nepal in support of a multi-party democratic system. Initially, Rana after discussions with King Birendra, did not want to take military action against the protestors. Consequently, the Army was not deployed. However, on 6 April 1990, the protests turned violent. A number of protestors began to vandalise and carry out acts of arson. Such violence was concentrated around the Tundikhel and New Road area.Coll, Steve (1990-04-08). \\"Nepalese Army Enforces Curfew, Shootings Reported\\". The Washington Post. Retrieved 2019-12-31. In an effort to deescalate the situation, Rana ordered units of the Army to move into the centre of Kathmandu. To avoid further such violence, a curfew was put in place in the Kathmandu Valley. On 9 April, King Birendra allowed for the establishment of a multi-party democratic system and the creation of a new constitution. In the new system of governance, King Birendra became a constitutional monarch with a large amount of political power transferring to the elected representatives. During the drafting of the new constitution, Rana provided suggestions to the then Prime Minister and Defence Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai. Rana advocated that the new constitution should continue to keep the King as the Supreme Commander of the Army. He believed that this would allow the armed forces to maintain its political neutrality and professional proficiency. When the new constitution was implemented in November 1990, the King remained the supreme commander of the Army. However, any military action to be undertaken had to now be discussed in the National Defence Council. This council consisted of the King, the elected Prime Minister and the Chief of Army Staff. During his tenure, he aided in the establishment of the Shree Birendra Army Hospital in the Chauni District of Kathmandu and the Birendra Sainik Awasiya Mahavidyalaya in Bhaktapur. Additionally, he undertook official visits in the capacity of COAS to the United Kingdom and Bangladesh. On 15 May 1991, Rana retired from his position after having commanded the army for four years. His retirement marked the end of a thirty-six year-long military career.  Post military career  Upon his retirement, Rana was appointed by King Birendra as an Honourable Member of the Royal Council. In 1995, during the 50th Birthday Celebrations of King Birendra, Rana was appointed the Vice Chairman and Treasurer of the Golden Jubilee Birthday Ceremony Committee. In June 1996, he was appointed as the Royal Ambassador to Myanmar, Vietnam, and Laos. During his ambassadorship, Rana worked to enhance the relationship between Nepal and Myanmar. During this period, Myanmar supported Nepal's application for membership in the BIMSTEC. In 1998, Nepal became an observer member of BIMSTEC. Rana served as ambassador till 1999 after which he returned to Nepal. After his return, Rana was regularly called upon by the government to give his opinion on security matters. With the escalation of the Maoist Insurgency in Nepal, King Gyanendra appointed Rana as a Rt. Honourable Member of the Privy Council Standing Committee. During this period, Rana was critical of the Maoist forces and their methods of engagement. Consequently, he was considered a target by the Maoist insurgents. A resort owned by Rana was attacked by Maoist insurgents in September 2003. In August 2005, Rana's residence in Kathmandu was bombed by the Maoists. In both terror attacks, there were no fatalities. In 2005, when the Seven Party Alliance and 12 Point Agreement was carried out, Rana considered these alliances to be unnatural. According to him, democratic parties negotiating with an insurgency group undermined the interests of the state. Rana believed that in trying to gain political power, the democratic parties had compromised on national interests. Rana succumbed to cancer on 4 May 2007. He is survived by his wife and four children.  Personal life  Rana was married to Rani Asha Rana (n√©e Shah). They had three daughters and one son: * Mrs Satchida Rajya Laxmi Singh * Mrs Saktida Rajya Laxmi Singh * Captain Sadaya Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana (Retd) * Mrs Sukirti Rajya Laxmi Bhatta In his retirement, Rana involved himself in agriculture and tourism. He established the Gurkha Hill Resort, which is still open in the Gorkha Municipal District, and began apple farming in Mangchet, Rasuwa District. He was also an avid golfer.
