In the late 1970s, roughly 300,000 ethnic Chinese immigrated from Vietnam to China. Immigration has increased modestly since the opening up of the country and the liberalisation of the economy, mostly of people moving to the large cities and to Hong Kong. Many of the foreign nationals who immigrate to China are of Chinese ethnic heritage. China has also been the destination of illegal immigration, particularly along the China‚ÄìNorth Korea border and in Guangzhou. Legal immigration In 2016, China issued 1,576 permanent residency cards. This was more than double what it had issued the previous year, but still roughly 750 times lower than the United States‚Äô 1.2 million. =Return of Overseas Chinese= The only significant immigration to China has been by the Overseas Chinese, who in the years since 1949 have been offered various enticements to return to their homeland. Several million may have done so since 1949. The largest influx came in 1978‚Äì79, when about 160,000 to 250,000 ethnic Chinese refugees fled Vietnam for southern China, as relations between the two countries worsened. Many of these refugees were settled in state farms on Hainan Island in the South China Sea. Illegal immigration =North Koreans= Illegal immigrants from North Korea have moved across the China‚ÄìNorth Korea border to seek higher wages and escape repression. Approximately 1,850 North Koreans fled their country in 2004, but China views them as illegal economic migrants rather than refugees and sends many of them back. This is also due to pressure from North Korea. Many of those who succeed in reaching sanctuary in foreign diplomatic compounds or international schools have been allowed by China to depart for South Korea.  Africans in Guangzhou  There is a sizeable community of black Africans primarily concentrated in Guangzhou, China. Since the country's late 1990s economic boom, thousands of African traders and businesspeople predominantly from West Africa migrated to the city of Guangzhou, creating an \\"Africatown\\" in the middle of the southern Chinese metropolis of approximately 10 km2. The primarily male population often set up local businesses and also engage in international trade. According to official statistics of the PRC government, the number of Africans in Guangzhou has increased by 30-40% each year, and now form the largest black community in Asia. However, as many have overstayed their visas, official figures may be understated. Estimates vary on the number of Africans living in Guangzhou: from 20,000 to over 200,000. This has led to controversies and anger by the local community due to rumors of increasing numbers of crimes, including rape, fraud, robberies and drug dealing committed by Africans. Huang Shiding of the Guangzhou Institute of Social Sciences estimates the number of permanent residents of foreign nationality (six months and above) to be around 50,000, of which some 20,000 are of African origin.

Dance in China is a highly varied art form, consisting of many modern and traditional dance genres. The dances cover a wide range, from folk dances to performances in opera and ballet, and may be used in public celebrations, rituals and ceremonies. There are also 56 officially recognized ethnic groups in China, and each ethnic minority group in China also has its own folk dances. Outside of China, the best known Chinese dances today are the Dragon dance and the Lion dance. History A Tang Dynasty dancer from a mural unearthed in Xi'an dancing with a shawl. There is a long recorded history of various forms of dance in China. The earliest Chinese character for \\"dance\\", 20px, written in the oracle bones, is itself a representation of a dancer holding oxtails in each hand. Some Chinese dances today such as dancing with long sleeves have been recorded since the very early periods, dating from the at least as early as the Zhou Dynasty. The most important dances of the early period were the ritual and ceremonial music and dances called yayue, and these dances were performed at the imperial court until the Qing dynasty, but only survive today as performances in Confucian ceremonies. The imperial court from the Qin dynasty onward established various departments responsible for the collection of music and dances, training of performers as well as their performances at the court, such as the Music Bureau and Royal Academy. During the Six Dynasties era (220 - 589 CE), there were strong influences from Central Asia in music and dance. The art of dance reached a peak in the Tang Dynasty, and the dances of the period were highly diverse and cosmopolitan, dances from Central Asia in particular were popular. A great number of dances were recorded in the Tang dynasty, for example there are over 60 Grand Compositions alone which are large scale performances from the Tang court, and there were tens of thousands of musicians and dancers at the Imperial palaces. The art of dance however declined after the Tang dynasty. This is due in part to the increasing popularity of the practice of footbinding, which may have first arisen from dancers themselves but later tighter binding limited their movements, and greater social restriction placed on women may have also led to a virtual elimination of female dancers. Furthermore, dance was absorbed into Chinese opera that started to take shape in the Song dynasty and became increasingly popular and further developed in the following dynasties, and dance as a separate performance art largely survives in folk traditions. In more recent times, the art of dance in China has enjoyed a resurgence, and modern developments in Chinese dances are continuing apace. Traditional dance Many of the traditional dances have a long history. These may be folk dances, or dances that were once performed as rituals or as an entertainment spectacle, and some may have been performed in the imperial court. Among the best-known of the Chinese traditional dances are the Dragon dance and Lion dance, and both dances were known in earlier dynasties in various forms. A form of lion dance similar to today's lion dance was described as early as the Tang Dynasty, the modern form of the dragon dance however may be a more recent development. Dragon dance. In some of the earliest dances recorded in China, dancers may have dressed as animal and mythical beasts, and during the Han Dynasty, some forms of the dragon dance were mentioned. The Dragon dances of Han Dynasty, however, do not resemble modern form of the dance. Dragon dances mentioned include a dance performed during a ritual to appeal for rain at time of drought as Chinese dragon was associated with rain, acts in the baixi variety shows where performers dressed up as a green dragon playing a flute, and acts where fish turned into a dragon. Modern Dragon Dance uses light- weight structure manipulated by a dozen or so of men using poles at regular intervals along the length of the dragon, and some forms of the dragon can be very long and involve hundreds of performers. There are more than 700 different dragon dances in China. A lion dance The lion dance has been suggested to have been introduced from outside China as lion is not native to China. Suggested origin of the dance include India and Persia, although some have also proposed a native Chinese origin. A detailed description of a lion dance appeared during the Tang Dynasty and it was then recognized as a foreign import, but the dance may have existed in China as early as the third century AD. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties it had association with Buddhism. A version of lion dance resembling modern lion dance was described by Tang poet Bai Juyi in his poem \\"Western Liang Arts\\" (Ë•øÂáâ‰ºé), where the dancers wear a lion costume made of a wooden head, a silk tail and furry body, with eyes gilded with gold and teeth plated with silver, and ears that moves. There are two main forms of Chinese Lion Dance: the Northern Lion and Southern Lion. A form of the Lion Dance is also found in Tibet where it is called the Snow Lion Dance. =Folk dances of Han Chinese= Folk dances are important historically in the development of dance in China, some of the earliest dances in court rituals and ceremonies may have evolved from folk dances. Rulers from various dynasties collected folk dances, many of which eventually became court dances. However, at various times there had also been antipathy towards some folk dances and some emperors attempted to ban them. Many of the folk dances are related to harvest and hunting and the ancient gods associated with them. For example, the Constellation Dance was performed to procure as much seed grain as there are stars in the sky, while the Harpoon Dance was associated to Fuxi who according to the mythology gave the Han people fish net, and the Plough Dance was connected to Shennong, the god of agriculture. Some examples of Chinese folk dance: *Yangge - a dance that is common in Northern China. *Lantern Dance - a dance found in Southern China. *Errenzhuan Folk dance from a minority group in China. =Folk dances of ethnic minorities in China= There are many minority groups in China and each have their own dances that reflect their culture and way of life. A few examples of their dances: *Baishou Dance - a dance of the Tujia people * Mongolian Bowl Dance (È†ÇÁ¢óËàû) - a dance where female dancers balance several bowls on their heads while dancing. * Long Drum Dance (Èï∑ÈºìËàû) - a dance of the Yao people which inspired the orchestral composition Dance of the Yao People. *Sanam - an Uyghur dance. *Lhamo - a Tibetan opera with dancing and singing =Dance in theatre= Dance as part of the Peking Opera in a performance of \\"Heavenly Lady Scatters Flowers\\" (Â§©Â•≥Êï£Ëä±). In the entertainment centres called wazi during the Song Dynasty, various theatrical forms flourished and Chinese opera began to take shape, and dance started to become merged into opera. Dances such as \\"Dance Judgement\\" (ËàûÂà§, also called the Dance of Zhong Kui, Ë∑≥ÈêòÈ¶ó) became opera pieces in the Ming Dynasty, and dances of the Song Dynasty such as Flapping the Flag (Êí≤ÊóóÂ≠ê). Other dances found in opera include the Sword Dance. Chinese opera became very popular by the Yuan Dynasty, and dances became absorbed into opera over the following centuries. =Ritual dance= Most early records of dances in China were ritual or ceremonial dances, and these dances formed the yayue which were considered to be of great importance in the court. These dances have largely disappeared from modern Han Chinese culture, although ritual dances are still found in some folk traditions and the cultures of ethnic minorities in China. * Yi Dance (‰ΩæËàû, literally \\"row dance\\") was originally a court dance, but adopted to form part of a Confucian ceremony. This ancient dance may be performed with rows of dancers holding pheasant feathers and red flutes in a square formation (Civil dance) or they may hold a shield and a battleaxe (Military Dance). The tradition of dancing holding items such as feather plumes dated back to Shang Dynasty. The most important ceremony is performed with 8 rows of 8 dancers (the Eight Yi Dance, 64 dancers in all). Originally dances were only performed in 6 rows of dancers (36 dancers in all) in Confucian temples as 8 rows were restricted to the Imperial court,Ba Yi (ÂÖ´‰Ωæ) According to ancient texts, this dance should only be offered in court. Confucius once complained of one such performance in the house of a noble: \\"The 8 yi dance is supposed to be performed in court, if he can bear to do this, what else can he bear to do?\\" but permission was later granted to perform the 8-row dance as well on the basis that he was given the title of a king by an emperor. Modernized version of such performances are presented for tourists at the confucian temple in Qufu. This Confucian dance is also performed in Taiwan and Korea. * Nuo Dances (ÂÑ∫Ëàû) - a dance with masks which may be performed in Nuo opera or as rituals during festivals to drive away evil spirits. *Cham dance - a Tibetan Buddhist dance Dancing in park as exercise =Exercise dance= According to L√ºshi Chunqiu, during the time of Emperor Yao, a dance was created as an exercise for the people to keep healthy after a prolonged spell of wet weather. Traditionally some Chinese dances may also have connection with the martial arts that were used to train fighting skills as well as for fitness, and some martial art exercises such as Tai chi or Qigong are similar to a choreographed dance. In modern China, it is common to find people using dance as a form of exercise in parks. =Dance troupe= *China National Ethnic Song and Dance Ensemble Modern and Western dances 1972 production of The Red Detachment of Women by the National Ballet of China. =Ballet= The first ballet school in China, Beijing Dance School, was established in 1954 with Dai Ailian as the principal and staffed by some outstanding Russian teachers, including Pyotr Gusev who instituted the Russian training system. In the following years ballets such as Swan Lake and Romeo and Juliet were performed. The National Ballet of China was founded on the last day of 1959 as the Experimental Ballet Company of the Beijing Dance School. During the Cultural Revolution under the control of Madame Mao, Revolutionary Model dramas came to the fore, and the repertory was eventually reduced to two ideological ballets - The Red Detachment of Women and The White Haired Girl. After the fall of the Gang of Four, the ballet company began to reform and change direction with the classical Western ballets resurrected, and also broadened its range to include more modern ballets from around the world. Other ballet companies in China: *Shanghai Ballet Company *Guangzhou Ballet *Hong Kong Ballet * Liaoning Ballet * Suzhou Ballet * Tianjin Ballet Modern choreography on traditional themes - this one is based on paintings and sculpture of Thousand Hand Guanyin. =Contemporary dance= *BeijingDance / LDTX *Beijing Modern Dance Company *City Contemporary Dance Company in Hong Kong *Guangdong Modern Dance Company *Living Dance Studio in Beijing Modern traditional Many dances presented as traditional in theatres and television are modern imagination of ancient dances using modern choreography, for example the famous Rainbow-Feathered Dress Dance of the Tang Dynasty. *Dunhuang dance - modern composition inspired by frescos from Dunhuang caves. Social Dances Western ballroom dancing became popular in the 20th century, previously it would not have been permissible for men and women from respectable families to dance together. It was popular in the 1940s Shanghai nightclubs, and early Communists leaders such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai were also avid Soviet-style ballroom dancers. Ballroom dancing however later disappeared after the Cultural Revolution to be replaced by massive group dances such as yangge dance. Ballroom dances however reappeared after the liberalisation of China later in the century, and it is now commonly found performed by many people in public parks in the morning as exercise.

The band released one album and recorded several radio sessions for the BBC. History Cay formed in Camden, London in the mid-1990s around the nucleus of Dutch singer/rhythm guitarist Anet Mook and Swedish guitarist/pianist Nicky Olofsson, who were musical and romantic partners. The lineup solidified with the addition of London bass guitarist Tom Harrison and Northern Irish drummer Mark Bullock. The band name was hastily improvised from the initials of one of their demo tracks (\\"Cool As You\\") when Mook was talking to a record company. Cay drew on a variety of influences, predominantly ‚Äúpunky, grungy‚Äù material such as Nirvana, Sonic Youth and The Sex Pistols (which, in tandem with Mook's hoarse and lacerating vocals, brought them comparisons to Hole which they ultimately found unwelcome). However, the band would also cite more diverse influences (such as Robert Fripp, or Mook's childhood love of diva singers including Diana Ross, Barbra Streisand and Billie Holiday).  writer Sarah interviews Anet Mook for PlanetGrrlMusic e-zine The band's approach was often more technically exploratory than many of their peers, leading to further comparisons with bands such as Gang of Four and Nomeansno. Cay's first release was the Better Than Myself EP, released on Org Records in 1998, with the band's first Peel Session for BBC Radio 1 being broadcast on 20 September. The single and session (and the band's appearance at that year's In the City music festival in Manchester) attracted the attention of various record labels including EastWest Records, who signed the band. Two further singles followed on EastWest in early 1999 - \\"Neurons Like Brandy\\" and \\"Princes & Princesses\\" ‚Äì with the band gaining further press attention. NME reviewed a London gig in January commenting that \\"Cay are simply following in that great Camden tradition of stealing what's best from America and coating it in north London grime.\\" Cay's debut (and only) album, Nature Creates Freaks was released in July 1999. Reviews were favourable, with the band being compared to the likes of Sonic Youth, Robert Fripp and The Breeders and the NME commenting \\"this is the album (which Hole's) Celebrity Skin should have been. It's the most genuinely angry album you'll hear this year,\\" as well as describing the band's sound as being \\"like the devil's own daughter gargling razor blades over the rawest hardcore.\\"\\"Cay - Nature Creates Freaks\\", NME, 5 Jun 1999Perry, Tim (1999) \\"Album Reviews: Cay - Nature Creates Freaks\\", The Independent, 3 July 1999 The album was followed by a third EastWest single, also called \\"Nature Creates Freaks\\". On 3 June 1999, the band recorded its second Peel Session (this time in the \\"Nearly Live\\" sequence) at the Queen Elizabeth Hall as part of the Sound City events. The band also won the Best British Newcomer award at the 1999 Kerrang! Awards. Despite Cay's early promise, the band had by now become dogged by substance abuse and infighting which ultimately disrupted their activities and career to such an extent that by the following year the band had been dropped by both their label and their management. In April 2000, both Bullock and Harrison left the band. Mook and Olofsson recruited a new rhythm section for Cay (Chris Hall on drums and Ed Sonsino on bass guitar) and returned to Org Records, who issued their final single \\"Resurrexit\\". The single received airplay on Radio 1 and the band played at the Glastonbury festival on 23 June (with their performance being recorded for a third Peel Session, broadcast the following day), followed by an appearance at Guildford Live Festival in July. However, the band's internal problems remained unresolved. After a final Peel Session recording on 22 November 2000 (broadcast on 5 December) featuring four new songs ‚Äì \\"Sun Through the Rain\\", \\"Flying Fools Through Icy Attitudes\\", \\"FUNY (A Celebration of New York)\\" and \\"Part of the Show\\"  Cay simply disappeared. There was no formal notification of a split and the Cay songs unveiled in the final Peel Session were never released. The band's former drummer Mark Bullock would go on to play on Feeder's Australian tour in 2000 (he would also play on the band's Top of the Pops performance of the \\"Just A Day\\" single in late 2001). Despite ongoing curiosity about the whereabouts of Anet Mook and Nicky Olofsson, or news of subsequent musical projects, further news on either was rare (or insubstantial) over the course of the following decade. On 15 June 2011, Org Records founder Sean Organ announced on his Organart site that he had been informed in an e-mail from Mark Bullock of Anet Mook's death. Mook had been struck by a moving vehicle in the Netherlands. On 16 June 2011, Mark Bullock confirmed in his blog, \\"Sink of Swirling Stars\\", that Mook had died the previous week, adding that she had struggled with drug addiction for many years. Bullock later clarified the cause of Mook's death by stating that she was struck by a train and was sober and of sound mind at the time. Her funeral was held on the day of Bullock's posting.

Kennedy, 35th President of the United States and the first white ethnic President White ethnic is a term used to refer to White Americans who are not Old Stock or White Anglo-Saxon Protestant. \\"Religion is the most critical factor in separating white ethnics in American society. As Catholics and secondarily Jews ... they were immediately set apart from the Protestant majority at the time of their entrance and given a strongly negative reception.\\" They consist of a number of distinct groups and make up approximately 69.4% of the white population in the United States. The term usually refers to the descendants of immigrants from Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, Ireland, the Caucasus, and France/Francophone Canada. In the 19th century, American industrial development caused millions of immigrants to emigrate from Europe to the United States. Many came to provide labor for the industrial growth of the Northeast and Midwest, and multitudes of immigrants from non-British or non-Germanic Protestant backgrounds settled in the nation's growing cities. This immigration wave continued until 1924 when Congress enacted the Johnson‚ÄìReed Act, which restricted immigration as a whole, and from southern and eastern European countries in particular. Additionally, the onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s acted as a deterrent to further immigration to the United States from Europe. Separated from the ruling class by blood, religion, and economic circumstances, white ethnics retained a strong and distinct sense of identity. During the early 20th century, many white ethnics were relegated to menial or unskilled labor. They were often subject to ethnic discrimination and xenophobia and were lampooned with stereotypes. Historian and reformer Andrew Dickson White lamented that, in American cities, \\"a crowd of illiterate peasants, freshly raked from Irish bogs, or Bohemian mines, or Italian robber nests, may exercise virtual control.\\" Religion was another big factor in this alienation from broader American society. In contrast to the mostly Protestant and Anglo- Saxon majority, white ethnics tended to practice Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox Christianity, or Judaism. These cultural, ethnic and religious differences helped them retain a strong and separate identity from the rest of America until the post war era. In the 1950s and 1960s, suburbanization caused many young ethnics to leave the city and settle in the nation's burgeoning suburbs with the hope of rising into a higher economic class. In the 1960s and 1970s, several ethnic organizations became vocal in promoting white ethnic culture and interests. At the same time, white ethnics became more involved in American political life and began to challenge the majority Protestant ruling class for greater political power. The election of John F. Kennedy as President in 1960 was the first time that a white ethnic (Irish Catholic) was elected president. However, it was not the first time that a white ethnic was nominated for the Presidency. Al Smith, a Catholic, was the first white ethnic to be nominated for president on a major party ticket. Barry Goldwater, an Episcopalian, was the first major party presidential candidate of Jewish heritage. If elected, Michael Dukakis would have been the first Greek-American and first Eastern Orthodox Christian president. Spiro Agnew, a Greek-American, was the first white ethnic elected vice president. Joe Biden was the first non-Protestant and the first Roman Catholic elected vice president. Prior to Joe Biden, there were five white ethnic Vice Presidential candidates: William Miller (R-1964), Ed Muskie (D-1968), Thomas Eagleton (D-1972, briefly), Sargent Shriver (D-1972) and Geraldine Ferraro (D-1984). Mike Pence was raised in a Roman Catholic family of partial Irish descent but has since converted to Evangelical Christianity. White ethnics and urban politics White ethnics dominated the Democratic machine politics of the major cities in the Northeast and Midwest throughout the first half of the 20th century, often run by Irish Catholics in concert with other ethnicities, such as Jews and Italians in New York and Poles and other Slavs in Chicago. In New York City, Tammany Hall was the dominant political machine that controlled political patronage positions and nominations and figures like Carmine DeSapio were powerful kingmakers on a national level. However, many white ethnics left the Democratic Party as it moved leftward during the 1960s and 70s, and white ethnics were a key component of the Reagan Democrats that voted for the GOP during the 1980s. With increased suburbanization and continued assimilation of white ethnics and their subsequent replacement by newer immigrant groups, many remaining white ethnics have lost much of their political power in urban politics in the early 21st century.

Launched in 1927, the 493cc overhead valve engine was slanted, and the motorcycle featured a saddle tank that enabled a low seating position, improving the centre of gravity and handling. Designated as the new S-series, whether this stood for sloper, speed or silence is unknown, but sloper became the term used by motorcyclists and hence adopted by BSA for marketing. The Sloper range remained much the same until its demise in 1935. Each model was designated with the two letters of the year produced, hence the S31 was produced in 1931. The first models featured a 493cc (80x98mm) single ported cylinder-head, topped by a cast-aluminium enclosure for the rockers, with exposed valve springs. Alongside the cast barrel were plated tubes to cover the pushrods. Easy cam contours and wide bases on the tappets ensured no associated valve clack, meaning that the Sloper was regarded by many as one of the smoothest and quietest of sporting 500cc machines. The large crankcase accommodated both a large and heavy flywheel, and a separate oil feed tank controlled by a hand meter. Early models had a duplex-frame and three-speed gearbox, but soon the top tube was replaced by an I-frame forging to support a new steering head. By the 1929/30 the engine carried a twin-port head, and the ohv joined by a less-popular side-valve model; these models also had extra chrome. From 1932 all were equipped by a 4-speed gearbox. From 1930 there was an optional sporting kit for ¬£10, including a high-compression piston, hardened valves and springs, and a racing sparkplug, but the company noted that there were few buyers. The model ceased production in 1935, by which time there were only two models, an overhead-valve and a sidevalve, both of 595cc. The large heavy flywheel and easy cams gave the Sloper a slow purposeful tick over, which was supplemented by large fishtail silencers. With a purposeful rhythm, together with its easy handling, they may have added to choice of its name. Cruising speed was , with a top speed of around .

History  ZUPCO was formed in 1980 in Harare, soon after the New Government was formed. Before Zimbabwean Independence, the bus company was run as a Parastatal and it was known as the Rhodesia Bus Company. After transition, the company was renamed to Zimbabwe United Passenger Company (ZUPCO). By 1993 ZUPCO was operating 1,200 buses on 426 routes.  Bus services  Regional services The company offers direct and reliable out-of-country bus services to Countries such as Malawi, Zambia, Botswana, South Africa. Urban services Urban routes include transport services from the key residential areas to many of the Central business districts in Harare. These include for example the Harare- Chitungwiza route, which travels from a large business district to a large residential area. In line with being a market driven player in the industry, the company has also sought to alleviate the suffering of the urban consumer who has to pay hiked fares during peak hours by commuter omnibuses. Because of this rising problem, the company has reintroduced the urban bus routes at an affordable fare during the morning and evening peak hours. Rural services ZUPCO has purposefully invested in and is looking into ways of providing a safe and reliable service for the usually neglected rural residents. Thus the company provides daily scheduled bus service to many rural areas dotted around the country. Like many other bus companies, rural areas are seldom given bus routes, as the cost is very high for a small part of the population.  Conflicts  ZUPCO operations however declined following deregulation of the urban transport sector, and the uprising of individual based mini-bus \\"combi\\" services. In 2006, the former ZUPCO chairman Charles Nherera was arrested for corruption in relation to bus procurement and was jailed. In February 2016, the company was accused of Corruption, mismanagement, and flouting very important procedures. Many of the buses in Harare were cited to have No fuel, as there was not enough money; Although there was still over $500,000 still sitting in a recapitalization account, and only $10,000 is needed to get all of the buses on the road.  Accidents  On January 18, 2015, one Zupco bus and another bus from a different company Sideswiped. The accident caused 21 passengers to die onsite and 3 later died at the hospital. At least 46 people were seriously injured. On May 2, 2016, a Zupco bus caught fire after a suspected mechanical problem caused the bus to create an internal flame. The bus was heading to a high school with 70 students inside the bus. All of the students were able to get out without serious injury.

Mission The Council's objective is to identify and advise the government on \\"future trends and developments\\" on issues that are of great importance for society by taking a multidisciplinary approach. In addition to its 88 reports, it has published more than 170 preliminary studies and investigations as well as more than 250 working documents; several of the reports and studies on agriculture, development cooperation, and foreign policy have been disseminated internationally. History The WRR was founded by the \\"Act Establishing a Scientific Council on Government Policy of 30 June 1976\\" (known as \\"Instellingswet WRR\\") and began on November 20, 1972, as a temporary advisory council of the Dutch government. The first council took a predominantly theoretical approach based on science as well as the \\"emerging disciplines of political science and public administration\\". In the 1990s, under the chairmanship of Piet Hein Donner, a number of changes were formalised‚ÄîWRR's focus shifted \\"from substantive policy...to shaping those parameters of policy\\". The first external evaluation of WRR was carried out in 2001 by the Alexander Rinnooy Kan Commission, after which WRR \\"raised its public profile\\"‚Äîi.e., its composition became more flexible, with foreign experts invited in addition to Dutch ones. It also started delivering oral presentations of reports to various stakeholders. Membership The Council consists of five to eleven members and is a working council, this means the members themselves do research and write reports. They do this in cooperation with the scientific staff. Decisions of the Council are made collectively. Council members are appointed for a term of five years. They may serve a maximum of two terms.

Life =Great Britain= Edmund Bohun was born on March 12, 1644/5 in Ringsfield, Suffolk, England.S. Wilton Rix, The Diary and Autobiography of Edmund Bohun Esq (1885) He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge. He married Mary Brampton (d. 1719) on July 26, 1669. They had a single child, Nicholas (1679-1718) who died in Carolina. In the late 1660s, Bohun became associated with William Sancroft, Samuel Parker and Leoline Jenkins, in a group of High Church proto-Tory thinkers. He began to write against the Whigs after the Exclusion Crisis of the 1680s. He attacked Whig theories and in particular Algernon Sidney in his Defence of Sir Robert Filmer (1684). Sancroft asked Bohun to edit Robert Filmer‚Äôs works, for an edition of 1685, and its preface Bohun attacked James Tyrrell.Andrew Pyle (editor), Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers (2000), article on Bohun, pp. 105-7. In reply to Jeremy Collier's The Desertion discuss'd in a Letter to a Country Gentleman (1688), Bohun wrote The History of the Desertion (1690), bringing forward an argument influential for Tories who (unlike Collier) were prepared to swear allegiance after the Glorious Revolution; this work was the first history written of the events in which James II of England left the throne. He drew on the work of Grotius, in De Jure Belli ac Pacis, for the idea of conquest after a just war as applicable to the contemporary United Kingdom, as was also done by William King.Mark Goldie and Robert Wokler (editors), The Cambridge History of Eighteenth- century Political Thought (2006), p. 46.Tony Claydon, Europe and the Making of England, 1660-1760 (2007), p. 247 note 116.J. P. Kenyon, Revolution Principles: The Politics of Party 1680-1720 (1977), p. 31. In 1692, Bohun was appointed Licenser of the Press, a position as pre-publication censor. He ran into trouble in the case of an anonymous pamphlet called, King William and Queen Mary Conquerors which was really by Charles Blount. It argued a case similar to Bohun's own views. Thomas Babington Macaulay claimed that the Whig Blount in writing it deliberately set out to entrap the unpopular Bohun, but this is no longer accepted. In a House of Commons debate in 1693, Tories defending Bohun pointed out that the bishops Gilbert Burnet and William Lloyd had published similar arguments. The outcome was that Bohun lost the position, which was shortly abolished, and Burnet's Pastoral Letter of 1689 was included in a suppression order covering William and Queen Mary Conquerors. Bohun was briefly imprisoned, and after a two-year renewal of the Press Act providing for a Licenser as censor to 1695, the pre-publication censorship of the press was allowed by Parliament to lapse.David Hayton, Eveline Cruickshanks, Stuart Handley, The House of Commons, 1690-1715: Volume 1 (2002), p. 1066.Evan Whitton, Patrick Cook, The Cartel: Lawyers and Their Nine Magic Tricks (1998), p. 60. =America= He emigrated to Carolina, becoming in 1698 the first recorded Chief Justice of (south) Carolina there, based in Charleston.Charles Warren, History of the Harvard Law School and of Early Legal Conditions in America (1908), p. 109. On October 5, 1699, Bohun died of Yellow Fever. In 1885, Bohun's diary and autobiography were published by S. Wilton Rix.

His ancestors held the public office of golova (head) of a stepnaya duma (steppe council, local self-government unit) in the territory of future Buryatia and the hereditary title of Taisha (Genghisid prince) until 1822. They were members of the Yensh√∂√∂b√º-Songool tribe (a Buryaticized Khalkha tribe) and were descendants of Okhin Taij who had submitted to Peter I of Russia in 1696 after fleeing from Inner Mongolia.

In 1914 he started his studies in Alekseevsky non-classical secondary school (real'noe uchilishhe, Realschule), and graduated in 1920. In early 1920s Kyakhta became the center of revolutionary activities of Damdin S√ºkhbaatar and Khorloogiin Choibalsan. On 1‚Äì3 March 1921 the first congress of the Mongolian People's Party (MPP) took place in Troitskosavsk, and B. Rinchen also participated as an interpreter. At that time he also met Konstantin Rokossovsky, then the commander of the 35th Independent Cavalry Regiment of the Red Army. In 1923‚Äì24, B.

He entered Leningrad Institute of Oriental Languages, studied under such well-known scholars-orientalists as Boris Vladimirtsov, Fyodor Shcherbatskoy, Sergey Oldenburg, Lev Shcherba, Vasily Bartold, Vasily Alekseev. After graduating in 1927, with the diploma of orientalist, B. Rinchen started working in scientific committee of Mongolia. From the first steps in his research work he showed himself primarily as a philologist - linguist and literary critic. At the same time B. Rinchen showed interest in other fields of knowledge, in particular, ethnography and religious studies. During this period he wrote his first poems and short stories.

He also wrote a movie script based on the biography of Choghtu Tayiji that won the State prize in the mid-1940s. He transferred all the prize money to support orphans of World War II in Leningrad. His novel √ú√ºriin tuyaa ('Dawn', based on modern Mongolian history) was issued in Russian, Czech and Chinese.

In 1736 Holmes was appointed as the Oxford Regius Professor of Modern History, a post he held until 1742. Whilst President of St John's, Holmes had the last letter of Sir Thomas White, the founder of college, printed to give every scholar on entering college, urging the fellows to peacefully with each other and suggests they \\"take a coppye of yt for my sake\\". Holmes was ridiculed as \\"time-serving\\" in an imitation of the first satire of Juvenal, printed in London in 1740, and in a letter purporting to be written from Oxford, published in British Champions, or, The Impartial Advertizer on 10 January 1743, which printed \\"that ornament of learning and politeness H‚Äîes\\" is an example of those that \\"steer judiciously between all extremes\\". Holmes was the first president of St John's to be loyal to the House of Hanover. Holmes was supportive of sound learning and met with Thomas Hearne, who wished the University to plan the printing of Oxford manuscripts. On 9 July 1733, acting as Vice-Chancellor he revived the ceremony of \\"the act\\", which had been discontinued, and invited George Frideric Handel to play before and after the ceremony. However, his allowing Handel to perform inside the Sheldonian Theatre on several occasions outside of University ceremonies and to charge 5 shillings. for admission, offended Hearne and other traditionalists. Hearne stated that \\"Handel and (his lousy crew) a great number of foreign fiddlers\\".Reliquiae, 778 At another time, Holmes refused a company of players from visiting Oxford. He was from 1728 to 1748 the President of St John's College, Oxford. He was nominated by George II to the deanery of Exeter Cathedral on 4 June 1742. Holmes was buried in the college chapel, and on the instruction of his wife, Sarah, a monument to him was erected in the college chapel. On his death on 4 April 1748, Holmes left an estate of two farms and ¬£200 a year to St John's College. Works Only one work is ascribed to Holmes, The Country Parson's Advice to his Parishioners ‚Ä¶ of the Younger Sort, which was an anonymous publication of 1742.

A force of nearly 4,000 United States Marines landed on the island of Emirau on 20 March 1944. The island was not occupied by the Japanese and there was no fighting. It was developed into an airbase which formed the final link in the chain of bases surrounding Rabaul. The isolation of Rabaul permitted MacArthur to turn his attention westward and commence his drive along the north coast of New Guinea toward the Philippines. Background =Strategy= In February 1943, General MacArthur had presented the US Joint Chiefs of Staff with his Elkton Plan for an advance on the Japanese stronghold of Rabaul. In this \\"scheme of manoeuvre\\" the penultimate stage was the capture of Kavieng, an important staging post for aircraft moving from Truk to Rabaul. The Allied occupation of Kavieng would cut this route and isolate Rabaul.Hayes, History of the Joint Chiefs, pp. 312‚Äì313 The Allied victory in the Admiralty Islands campaign in March 1944 prompted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to consider accelerating the tempo of operations in the Pacific. They solicited opinions on the matter from the theatre commanders. On 5 March 1944, armed with detailed information about Japanese deployments and intentions as a result of the capture of Japanese cryptographic materials in the Battle of Sio, MacArthur recommended omitting the proposed attack on Hansa Bay in favor of moving further up the coast of New Guinea to Hollandia.Drea, MacArthur's ULTRA, pp. 104‚Äì105 As this would be out of range of his land-based aircraft, he proposed that aircraft carriers of Admiral Chester W. Nimitz' United States Pacific Fleet, which were to cover the Manus and Kavieng operations could provide air cover until land-based aircraft could be established ashore. Admiral Nimitz, in Washington DC for consultation, objected to this proposal to retain forces in the South West Pacific theatre after the capture of Kavieng, as it would disrupt his plans for upcoming operations in the Pacific Ocean theatre. The Joint War Plans Committee discussed these alternatives, and recommended to the Joint Chiefs that Hollandia be seized on 15 April, but that the Kavieng operation be canceled.Hayes, History of the Joint Chiefs, pp. 554‚Äì556 MacArthur's Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Richard K. Sutherland, representing his commander before the Joint Chiefs, strenuously objected to the omission of Kavieng, which he believed could be captured on 1 April without delaying other operations. There was debate over how much of a threat the Japanese base at Kavieng was. Nimitz felt that as a result of the Battle of Eniwetok, Truk itself would soon be under constant attack and the flow of aircraft to Rabaul would be cut off. On 12 March, orders went out to MacArthur and Nimitz canceling Operation FOREARM [Kavieng] and ordering them to \\"complete the isolation of the Rabaul-Kavieng area with the minimum commitment of forces\\".Hayes, History of the Joint Chiefs, pp. 558‚Äì559 In the opinion of the commander of the South Pacific Area, Admiral William Halsey, Jr., \\"the geography of the area begged for another bypass\\".Shaw and Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, p. 518 On receipt of orders from MacArthur revoking plans for Kavieng and ordering him to occupy Emirau, Halsey ordered the commander of the III Amphibious Force, Rear Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson, to occupy Emirau on 20 March.Miller, CARTWHEEL: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 380 =Geography= Bismarck Archipelago. Emirau (or Emira) is an island in the Bismarck Archipelago in the south eastern portion of the St. Matthias Islands, located from Mussau Island, the other principal island in the St. Matthias group, and from Kavieng. Emirau is about long and wide, hilly, and heavily wooded. Inland is a plateau. The climate is tropical, with high humidity and heavy rainfall. There is a small harbor, Hamburg Bay, on the north west coast. About 300 natives lived on the island;Building the Navy's Bases, p. 303 but all available intelligence indicated that the Japanese had not occupied the islands in any appreciable strength. Emirau was considered suitable for development as an airbase and base for PT boats. A photo reconnaissance mission on 16 March revealed no indication whatsoever of enemy activity or installations.Shaw and Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, p. 521 Preparations Landing on Emirau. Halsey's message reached Wilkinson on Guadalcanal on 15 March, by which time ships were already loading for the Kavieng operation, which had originally been scheduled for 18 March. This operation was to have been carried out by Major General Roy S. Geiger's I Amphibious Corps, with the 40th Infantry Division and 3rd Marine Division, reinforced by the 4th Marines. For Emirau, Lieutenant Colonel Alan Shapley's 4th Marines would be sufficient, reinforced by Company C, 3rd Amphibian Tractor Battalion; Company A (Medium), 3rd Tank Battalion, equipped with M4 Sherman tanks; a company of pioneers from the 2nd Battalion, 19th Marines; signals, ordnance and motor transport detachments; and a composite anti-aircraft battery of the 14th Defense Battalion.Rottman, U.S. Marine Corps World War II Order of Battle, p. 318 This would be the first operation for the 4th Marines, which had been reformed on 1 February 1944 from four battalions of Marine Raiders, the original 4th Marines having been destroyed in the Battle of Corregidor. Commodore Lawrence F. Reifsnider was appointed to command the amphibious operation. Brigadier General Alfred H. Noble, the Assistant Division Commander of the 3d Marine Division would command the expeditionary troops. Noble, who was also slated to become island commander, was given a small staff created from I Amphibious Corps and 3rd Marine Division personnel. An air command was organized for Emirau under Colonel William L. McKittrick from the larger one intended for the Kavieng operation.Shaw and Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, p. 519 No opposition was expected on Emirau, but strong naval and air support was provided. A covering force under Rear Admiral Robert M. Griffin, consisting of the battleships , , and , accompanied by the escort carriers and , and 15 destroyers, carried out part of the original Kavieng plan‚Äîthe bombardment of Kavieng and the surrounding area. In all, some 1,079 rounds of 14-inch and 12,281 rounds of 5-inch ammunition were fired.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 423 Unfortunately, the bombardment gave Rear Admiral Ryukichi Tamura the impression that the expected invasion by Allied forces was imminent and he gave the order to kill all the European prisoners in Kavieng. At least 25 of them were executed in the Kavieng Wharf Massacre, which later led to six of the perpetrators being sentenced for war crimes in 1947. Sentenced to death by hanging, Tamura was executed at Stanley Prison on 16 March 1948.Dunbar, The Kavieng Massacre Operations The assault force left in two echelons. The Marines of the two assault battalions, the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 4th Marines, traveled on nine high speed transports (APDs) while the remainder of the force were on the dock landing ships (LSDs) , and , and the attack transport (APA) . One LSD carried the 66 LVTs for crossing Emirau's fringing reef, one carried three LCTs, two of them loaded with tanks, and the third carried three LCTs with radar sets and anti-aircraft guns. Supplies and equipment being brought ashore from landing craft to support the US Marine landing force. LVTs ferrying supplies ashore in the distance while a chain of men stretches from a landing craft to the shore to manhandle supplies to the beach. The attack group arrived in the transport area at 06:05 on 20 March. The LVTs were launched, and the assault troops transferred to the amphibious tractors using the APDs' boats, supplemented by those from Callaway while Vought F4U Corsairs of VMF-218 flew overhead to make a last-minute check of the island for any signs of the Japanese. The assault waves touched down on schedule. The reserve 3rd Battalion's boats grounded on the reef soon afterwards, and its marines waded ashore through knee deep water. The only problem encountered was with launching the LCTs carrying the tanks. The LSD's flooding mechanism failed and the LCTs had to be dragged out by a fleet tug. While the detachment sent to occupy Elomusao Island was approaching the beach, some supposed opposition caused the amphibious tractors and then a destroyer to open fire, and a man was wounded by a shell fragment. However, the natives informed the marines that the Japanese had left Emirau two months before and only a small detachment remained on Mussau Island.G-3 Journal, GHQ AFPAC 9 April 1944, \\"Emirau Operation ‚Äî Operations of the Emirau Landing Force\\", NAA(Vic): B6121/3 99A Supplies began landing at around 1100, first from the APDs and then from Callaway. Some 3,727 troops and 844 tons of cargo were ashore were by nightfall, when the ships sailed.Shaw and Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, p. 522 Within a month, some 18,000 men and 44,000 tons of supplies had been landed. Intelligence reports indicated that there were Japanese fuel and ration dumps on Mussau, and a radio station on a nearby island, so on 23 March these areas were shelled by destroyers. On the 27th, a destroyer intercepted a large canoe carrying Japanese troops about south of Mussau. The Japanese soldiers replied with their rifles and machine guns, and the destroyer returned fire, destroying the canoe and killing the occupants. Thus ended the only fighting in the St. Matthias Group. Base development Construction activities were taken in hand by the US Navy Seabees of the 18th Construction Regiment, which consisted of the 27th, 61st and 63rd Construction Battalions and the 17th Special Battalion, which arrived between 25 and 30 March, and the 77th Construction Battalion which arrived on 14 April. The 27th built a PT boat base, an LCT floating drydock and slipway, and roads. The 61st constructed housing, ammunition storage facilities, a runway, and some of the buildings at the PT boat base. It also handled sawmill operations. The 63rd assisted at the sawmill and worked on the roads, camps, harbor facilities, warehouses, magazines and avgas dumps. The 77th built taxiways, hardstands, aviation workshops and the avgas tank farm. The 88th worked on runways, roads, radar stations and a causeway at the eastern end of the island.Building the Navy's bases, pp. 303‚Äì304 Two airfields were constructed, Inshore and North Cape. These were heavy bomber strips, long and wide. The former had parking for 210 fighters or light bombers; the latter for 84 heavy bombers. Both were fully equipped with towers, lighting, and a dispensary. The aviation tank farm consisted of three storage tanks and nineteen storage tanks, together with the appropriate filling and distribution points. A reserve of was stored in drums. Three hospitals were established, a 100-bed naval base hospital, the 160-bed 24th Army Field Hospital, and the 150-bed Acorn 7 Hospital. The anchorage at Hamburg Bay could accommodate up to five capital ships. Port facilities included eight cranes, of refrigerated space, and of covered storage. The port could handle of cargo per day. Connecting the various facilities was of coral- surfaced all-weather road. All this work was completed by August and Construction Battalion Maintenance Unit (CBMU) 502 assumed responsibility for maintenance work. All the construction battalions departed by December. Garrison The 4th Marines were relieved as the garrison of Emirau by the 147th Infantry on 11 April 1944. The next day, Noble was replaced as island commander by a marine aviator, Major General James T. Moore, the Commanding General of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing.Shaw and Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, p. 523 In turn, the 147th Infantry was relieved as garrison by the 369th Infantry in June.Lee, The Employment of Negro Troops, p. 524 In August, General MacArthur directed that responsibility for garrisoning Emirau would be transferred to the Australian Army.Long, The Final Campaigns, p. 93 The Australian 8th Infantry Battalion arrived to take over the garrison role on Emirau on 30 September.War Diary, 23rd Infantry Brigade, 30 September 1944, AWM52 8/2/3 They were met by a small ANGAU detachment that had been on the island since May.Powell, The Third Force, pp. 132‚Äì133 Marine Aircraft Group 12 operated from Emirau until December, when it moved to Leyte; its place was taken by squadrons of the RNZAF.Shaw and Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, p. 533 On 20 March 1945, General MacArthur authorized a reduction in the garrison size to one company of the 8th Infantry Battalion. In June 1945, it too was withdrawn.Long, The Final Campaigns, p. 201 CBMU 502 departed for Manus that month.U.S. Navy, Building the Navy's Bases, p. 304 The RNZAF maintained a bomber-reconnaissance squadron at Emirau until July 1945, and a fighter squadron until August, when all forces were withdrawn from the island.Ross, Operations from Emirau Retrieved 18 January 2009 Notes References       Conflicts in 1944 Battles of World War II involving Australia 1944 in Papua New Guinea Territory of New Guinea Battles and operations of World War II involving Papua New Guinea Operation Cartwheel Battles and conflicts without fatalities South West Pacific theatre of World War II United States Marine Corps in World War II Battles of World War II involving the United States March 1944 events ","title":"Landing on Emirau"},{"id":"21144960","text":"Michael Koc√°b (born 28 July 1954) is a Czech composer, singer, and political activist.

She was elected to parliament with the DA in 2004, and was initially spokesperson on Arts and Culture. She was subsequently appointed opposition spokesperson on Health, and was a vocal critic of incumbent Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, particularly over her support for controversial German vitamin salesman Matthias Rath. Rath attempted to sue Kohler Barnard for describing him as a \\"charlatan\\", and also tried to sue newspapers that carried the remark. Subsequently, Kohler Barnard was appointed as Shadow Minister of Police. She was also the DA's representative on the SADC observer mission to Zimbabwe for the last two elections in that country.

Location Rohtasgarh is situated on the upper course of the river Son, 24¬∞ 57‚Ä≤ N, 84¬∞ 2‚Ä≤E. It takes around two hours from Sasaram to reach the foot of the hill over which is the Rohtas fort. It can be reached easily from the Dehri town, which has very good road network. One can also easily reach Rohtas fort via Rasoolpur. The fort is situated at about 1500 feet above sea level. The 2000 odd limestone steps were probably meant for elephants. For the visitor, they are exhausting climb of an hour and a half. At the end of the climb, one reaches the boundary wall of the fort. A dilapidated gate with a cupola can be seen there, which is the first of many gates provided for well- guarded entrances to the fort. From here one has to walk another mile or so before the ruins of Rohtas can be seen. History The early history of Rohtas is obscure. According to the local legends, the Rohtas hill was named after the RohitƒÅ≈õva, a son of the legendary king Harishchandra. However, the legends about RohitƒÅ≈õva make no mention of this area, and no pre-7th century ruins have been found at the site. The Rohtas seal of Shashanka. The oldest record at Rohtas is a short inscription of \\"Mahasamanta Shashanka-dava\\", whom John Faithfull Fleet identified with the Gauda king Shashanka. The Chandra and Tunga dynasties, which ruled in Bengal and Odisha regions respectively, traced their origin to a place called Rohitagiri, which may possibly be modern Rohtas. However, no evidence has been found at Rohtas to confirm this theory. A 1223 CE (1279 VS) inscription suggests that Rohtasgarh was in possession of one Shri Pratapa. The inscription states that he defeated a \\"Yavana\\" army; the \\"Yavana\\" here probably refers to a Muslim general. F. Kielhorn identified Shri Pratapa (≈örƒ´-PratƒÅpa) as a member of the Khayaravala dynasty, whose inscriptions have been found at other locations in the Rohtas district. The members of this dynasty ruled the Japila territory as feudatories, possibly that of the Gahadavalas. The Khayaravalas are probably represented by the modern Kharwars. In 1539 CE, the Fort of Rohtas passed out of the hands of the Hindu kings into those of Sher Shah Suri. Sher Shah Suri had just lost the Fort at Chunar in a fight with the Mughal emperor Humayun and was desperate to gain a foothold for himself. Sher Shah requested the ruler of Rohtas that he wanted to leave his women, children and treasure in the safety of the fort, while he was away fighting in Bengal. The king agreed and the first few palanquins had women and children. But the later ones contained fierce Afghan soldiers, who captured Rohtas and forced the Hindu king to flee. During the Sher Shah's reign 10000-armed men guarded the fort. Haibat Khan, a trustworthy soldier of Sher Shah built the Jami Masjid in 1543 AD, which lies to the west of the fort. It is made of white sandstone and comprises three domes. There is a mausoleum of perhaps Habsh Khan, the daroga or the superintendent of works of Sher Shah. In 1558 AD, Raja Man Singh, Akbar's Hindu General, ruled Rohtas. As the Governor of Bengal and Bihar, he made Rohtas his headquarters in view of its inaccessibility and other natural defenses. He built a splendid palace for himself, renovated the rest of the fort, cleared up the ponds and made gardens in Persian style. The palace was constructed in a north-south axis, with its entrance to the west with barracks for soldiers in front. The fort is still in a fairly good condition. After the death of Man Singh, the fort came under the jurisdiction of the office of the Emperor's wazir from where the governors were appointed. In 1621 AD, the Prince Khurram revolted against his father Jahangir and took refuge at Rohtas. The guardian of the fort, Saiyyad Mubarak handed over the keys of Rohtas to the prince. Khurram once again came to Rohtas for safety when he tried to win Avadh, but lost the battle of Kampat. His son Murad Baksh was born to his wife Mumtaz Mahal. During Aurangzeb's reign the fort was used as a detention camp for those under trial and housing prisoners sentenced for life. In 1763 AD, in the Battle of Udhwa Nala, the Nawab of Bihar and Bengal, Mir Kasim, lost to the British and fled with his family to Rohtas. But he was not able to hide at the fort. Finally the Diwan of Rohtas, Shahmal handed it over to the British Captain Goddard. During his two-month stay at the fort, the Captain destroyed the storeroom and many of the fortifications. Goddard left, keeping some guards in charge of the fort, but they too left after a year. There was peace at the fort for the next 100 years or so, which was at last broken at the time of the First War of Independence in 1857. Amar Singh, the brother of Kunwar Singh, together with his companions took refuge here. There were many encounters with the British where the latter were at a disadvantage, for the jungles and the tribal in them were of great help to the Indian soldiers. Finally, after a long drawn out military blockade and many clashes, the British overcame the Indians. Architecture It is one of the largest fort in world. It is spread in 42Sqkm.It has 83 gates and network of many underground place and tunnels. =Hathiya Pol and Elephant Gate= The main gate is known as the Hathiya Pol or the Elephant Gate, named after the number of figures of the elephants, which decorate it. It is the largest of the gates and was made in 1597 AD. =The Aina Mahal= The Aina Mahal, the palace of the chief wife of Man Singh, is in the middle of the palace. The most expansive structure within the palace is, however, the Takhte Badshahi, where Man Singh himself resided. It is a four-storied building, with a cupola on top. There is an assembly hall in the second floor and a gallery resting on strong, engraved stone pillars. The third floor has a tiny cupola, which opens into the women' quarters. From the fourth floor one can get a bird's eye view of the surrounding area. The residential quarters of Man Singh were on the first floor, which was connected to the ladies' rooms via a gateway in the east. An assembly hall, probably the Diwan-e-Khas or the hall or private audience is a little towards the west of Baradari or the hall of public audience. The hall is decorated with etchings of flowers and leaves, and lies on similarly decorated pillars. =Jama Masjid and Habsh Khan's mausoleum= Outside the palace grounds are the buildings of Jama Masjid, Habsh Khan's Mausoleum and the Makbara of Shufi Sultan. The beautiful stucco style, with the cupola resting on pillars reminds of the Rajputana style where the domed structures are known as chhatris. This style had not been used in Bengal and Bihar earlier but its emergence at Rohtas was not surprising as more than half the fort's guardians came from Rajputana. =Ganesh Temple= About half a kilometer to the west of Man Singh's Palace is a Ganesh temple. The sanctum of the temple faces two porch-ways. The tall imposing superstructure corresponds the temples of Rajputana (Rajasthan), especially of Ossian near Jodhpur built in the 8th century AD and the Mira Bai temple of the 17th century AD at Chittor. =The Hanging House= Further towards west, some construction must have taken place although there is no written evidence of what it was. The locals call it the Hanging House, as the fall from here is a straight 1500 ft down with no obstacles on the way. Locals have a story to tell about this place that this spot is the mouth of a cave, where a Muslim fakir (mendicant) is buried. It is said that he was thrown from here into the valley three times. In spite of being bound hand and foot, the fakir escaped unhurt each time. Ultimately he was buried in the cave. =Rohtasan Temple And Devi Temple= About a mile to the North-East of the Palace are the ruins of two temples. One is the Rohtasan, a temple of Lord Shiva. Iconoclasts probably destroyed the roof and the main mandap, which housed the sacred lingam. Now only 84 steps are left, which lead to a temple. The domes crest the Devi Mandir. The idol of the deity is missing from here also, though the rest of the building is in good condition. In local language it is also said \\"Chourasan Siddhi\\" because of its 84 steps.

Early forms of jazz education were more informal. Since the first degree program was founded in 1947, the rise of institutionalized jazz education, resulted in jazz education becoming more formalized and more structured.Worthy Formalized jazz education has brought a new wave of interest in jazz. JazzTimes.com currently lists 492 collegiate jazz programs globally. This database is exclusive to just schools that offer majors and does not include the number of schools that also offer jazz courses in their curriculum.\\"Jazz Education\\" The formalization of jazz was and still is a controversial subject. Many professional musicians believe that it has harmed the spirit of the music, while others maintain that it has been beneficial for the art form.Ake, 104 Early jazz education Jazz has long been celebrated for its roots as an aural tradition. This defined early jazz education in New Orleans, where the music originated among musicians who largely could not read music.Kirchner, 87 Early musically literate musicians who were able to afford formal music lessons, such as Jelly Roll Morton, scorned formal education and were left with varying degrees of musical literacy.Kirchner, 89 In New Orleans at the turn of the 20th century, as jazz was taking form from its roots, musicians learned in a style that is best described as an apprenticeship. Younger musicians would study with an older and more experienced musician, learning by listening to the music their mentor played.Dapogny This relationship also extended to a personal level. Many of these younger musicians would run errands for their mentors in order to repay them for the musical lessons. An early example of this style of education is Louis Armstrong, who studied under famed trumpet player King Oliver.Gioia,48 This educational form was dependent on aural skills. This style of pedagogy was prevalent in an era where the music relied heavily on group improvisation.Gridley, 46 The use, almost exclusively, of ear training amongst pedagogues and the cultural influence of New Orleans made this style of jazz the most practical and popular. In the late 1910s and early 1920s, jazz begins to move north to Chicago and New York City.Gioia, 52 These two urban areas were particularly popular because they provided a larger audience base for performers and closer proximity to recording studios.Gioia, 70 During the early part of the 1920s, New Orleans Jazz was prevalent in the many nightclubs sprung up in Chicago.Gioia, 72 In New York a new style of jazz became immensely popular. This style, known as Big Band, ushered in a new era of jazz education.Gioia, 56 Big band music is particularly important for jazz education because it introduces a number of new forums for the furthering of jazz music. The first such forum is the arranger. With the emergence of big bands arose a need for more detailed and thorough arrangements. Arrangers helped to standardize big band vocabulary. With the arranger, jazz began to mature from its roots as an exclusively aural art form. The arranger helped to introduce new influences, especially Impressionist Music during the big band era.Shipton, 217 The next influential introduction of the big band era was the emergence of after hours jam sessions. Many ideas for arrangements developed from after hours jam sessions. Many of these ideas would eventually turn into arrangements of their own. Duke Ellington used this technique to create new tunes and arrangements.Ellington These jam sessions were also a pivotal forum for the development of jazz improvisation. Jam sessions were home to the exploration of and self-education in improvisation. Musicians used these sessions as a way to learn from fellow musicians to improve their own skills. Clubs like Monroe‚Äôs Uptown House and Minton‚Äôs Playhouse became the public home for the phenomena that already took place in apartments and smaller venues across Manhattan and the rest of the country. The style that most directly descended from these jam sessions is known as bebop. Early bebop musicians such as Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Thelonious Monk introduced a new and more virtuosic style of improvising that proved influential to future generations of jazz musiciansGioia, 201 Early university jazz programs Jazz bands in secondary schools and colleges typically emerged as extracurricular auxiliary ensembles, derived from larger concert or marching bands. The earliest college jazz bands were not offered for academic credit and were usually organized and led by students. (Oxford Music Online) Prior to the first jazz degree, some academic classes were offered. In 1941 the New School for Social Research in Manhattan offered a jazz history course. In 1945 a school known as the Schillenger House opened in Boston. This school \\"offered a two year curriculum and awarded an artist diploma.\\" In 1973, the Schillenger House, which became the Berklee School of Music in 1954, officially changed its name to Berklee College of Music. The first college degree in jazz was offered in 1947 at the University of North Texas.Scott, 19 Over the course of the next few decades, jazz programs popped up all over the country and around the world. This Timeline of jazz education, notes the starting dates of many of these influential programs. By 1950, there were over 30 colleges and universities offering jazz courses.Kennedy Along with this growth at universities came a number of summer programs that served to educate young musicians about jazz. Stan Kenton is particularly famous for starting one such summer program. These summer camps were some of the first academic institution of any type to invite professional musicians to help educate young students.Fitzgerald This precedent continued to become more prominent.\\"Jazz Education.\\" Creating a jazz curriculum One of the most difficult, controversial and necessary steps in molding jazz into an academic program was standardization and formalization of jazz music. Prior to the introduction of the first jazz academic programs, musicians attempted to produce literature that explained jazz in a formal manner. Norbert Beihoff (n√© Norbert John Beihoff; 1904‚Äì2003) first attempted to explain jazz improvisation and arranging in a 1935 publication entitled Modern Arranging and Orchestration (). Professional musicians wrote method books, some with accompanying play- along records. Down Beat magazine published transcribed solos and pedagogical articles. In 1941 Joseph Schillinger published The Schillinger System of Musical Composition, a widely used text based on his own system of jazz arranging. George Russell wrote a text entitled Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization in 1953, promoting the idea that jazz chords have corresponding scales that may be used for improvisation\\". These books did not have a universal impact and were quickly forgotten. As the discipline expanded it became increasingly necessary to create standardized material to support a jazz curriculum. Early jazz educators such as Jamey Aebersold, David Baker and Jerry Coker laid the groundwork for a more universal educational practice. The first round of textbooks and other resources was characterized by an emphasis on strict formalization and structure, on the definition of levels, and on establishing a relatively narrow core early Aebersold books. In this clarification process, harmonic structures also became codified, and progressions such as the twelve-bar blues and the ii-V-I were defined as the easiest and most common, as indeed they were at the time.\\"Beale, 759 \\"The need to justify jazz education as worthy of institutional and cultural attention led to a clear, if in retrospect slightly limited, definition of a single jazz style and related set of skills.\\" The style that came to the fore for early jazz educators was bebop. Bebop improvisation is based on these fairly standard patterns and usually performed at tempos that force musicians to acquire a high level of facility with their instrument. Bebop vocabulary quickly became an important part of early formalized jazz education.Gridley, 145 Overlooked by this approach were the equally developed written techniques of jazz music. By this point in time, jazz composition and arranging had in its own right reached virtuosic levels. Written jazz, thanks in large part to the popularity of the swing era, established its own traditions within jazz music. One of the first educators to incorporate this aspect of jazz into was Gene Hall, a graduate of University of North Texas. Gene Hall, who had written a master's thesis there in which he outlined a proposed college-level jazz curriculum, became the first faculty member in the new program. Central to Hall's curriculum was an arranging class for which a laboratory ensemble performed student arrangements and compositions. That ensemble became the One O'Clock Lab Band.\\" Educational ensembles The end of World War II signified the end of the big band era. Even prior to this band leaders experienced difficulty financial supporting larger ensembles. As early as 1930, bands were trimming down to smaller ensembles. After the war, only a handful of the most prolific big bands survived. Many of these bands continued to tour for a number of years, but big bands have never enjoyed the professional success they enjoyed during the Swing Era.Shipton, 438 College jazz programs revitalized the dying style. By 1970 there were more than 450 college jazz bands and by 1980 there were over 500,000 high school and college students involved in jazz activities. The influx of student musicians brought about by formalized jazz education suddenly provided academic institutions with the numbers necessary to create their own big bands. Big bands also serve a very important pedagogical purpose. These bands enable educators to access a greater number of students at the same time. In 1967, as the number of college jazz bands was increasing at a rapid rate, a new ensemble was formed at Mount Hood Community College. This ensemble took big band repertoire and set it for choir. Genesis became the first jazz choir. The creation of the vocal jazz ensemble is indicative of the direction of jazz education.\\"Mt. Hood Genesis Vocal Jazz Ensemble The Jazz Education Network\\" Educators searching for new ways to make the music accessible turned to fusing different styles. The vocal jazz ensemble combines the classical traditions of Western Art Music, the vocal and instrumental traditions of jazz, and the pedagogical influence of jazz education.  Controversy in jazz education \\"The topic of jazz education has produced controversy since its beginnings. Many scholars avoid the subject almost entirely in their publications on jazz. Ted Gioia‚Äôs The History of Jazz makes virtually no mention of music schools, nor does Ken Burns‚Äôs ten-part PBS documentary. Gary Giddins‚Äôs 2004 collection Weather Bird consists of 146 short essays ‚Ä¶ Giddins never broaches the topic of jazz education.\\" The standardization of the jazz repertoire by early educators, such as Jamey Aebersold, drew criticism for the narrow lens with which it approached jazz education. Many feel that setting jazz to regimented structures and scales removes feeling from the music.Beale, 764 Some also argue that this new style of jazz education is too focused on the individual musician. Classes and lessons have replaced jam sessions, which served as the major form of jazz education for the first half of the twentieth century. Jam sessions forced musicians to learn from one another to develop technique and vocabulary. Critics of formalized jazz education denounce the new emphasis put on learning music from sheet music instead of by ear. Books such as the Charlie Parker Omnibook, which is a particularly popular publication, are denounced for the quality of student they produce. In response, jazz educators point to the revitalized interest in jazz music and the high quality of musicians now playing jazz music. On top of this, standardization of jazz techniques is an event that occurred before the introduction of institutionalized jazz education. Arrangers and instrumentalists alike developed techniques that became standard practice.Gridley, 190 Jazz education organizations Since the rise of jazz in academia, many institutions have sought to bring a unified face to jazz education. One of the largest of these groups was known as the International Association for Jazz Education, which scheduled regular conferences in cities across the world. The IAJE, however declared bankruptcy in April 2008. A new organization that has come to the fore is known as the Jazz Education Network, the website for which can be found at the Jazz Education Network Website. JEN was founded by Orbert Davis, Lou Fischer and Mary Jo Papich in 2008. The organization holds an annual conference each year as well as sponsoring other festivals.

It snakes through the mountains running for 144 miles (231 km). After 120 miles it passes Stryi. The river continues for another 20 miles before joining the Dniester near Khodoriv. Route Stryj River near the village of Klymets. Skole district. The upper reaches of the river Stryi. Stryi River at night near the village Hnizdychiv The river starts in a catchment area above and in the foothills of the Eastern Beskids range of the Carpathian mountains close to the village of Mokhnate, flowing down the East facing flank of the range. From here it begins to grow, being joined by many tributaries on its way North, before flowing into a series of twists and turns through gorges. It exits the hills reaching a flat area around Turka, where there was an attempt at hydro electric generation and flood control. The river meanders through the hills to Pidhorodci where it meets another main tributary the Opir at Nyzhnye Synievydne. From here it begins to straighten, 3.5 km south east of the town, at the start of the Stryi valley where it flows in an almost straight line past Duliby and Stryi and on to Zhydachiv. Here the river reaches a flat area and meanders wildly meeting the Dniester on the Eastern side of the Zhydachiv town causing many oxbow lakes. Geology The rocks in the area, known as the Stryi Depression, are arranged in three main layers. The river follows a natural fault line and is around an average of 60 feet wide, but is shallow at only an average of 10 feet deep in summer until its lower tracts where it reaches depths of 20 feet or more. The three layers of rocks types give the Stryi its unique form, in the upper tracts it flows through several areas of hard dense rocks and in between these through softer shales and alluvial deposits. As a consequence the river bed is mostly medium-sized rounded rocks and pebbles with islands of sand and rounded gravels in midstream in the middle and lower tracts. Behaviour The river is a popular destination for canoeing as it has many rapids in the upper tracts, as well as areas of beauty along its lower course. The river is noted for its quick and massive increases in both flow volume and speed during rain, which often cause bridges and the river itself to be impassable. This results in flooded roads and train lines which, in these mountainous areas, tend to be close to the river. This has quite an effect on transportation, even causing the halt of the Russian forces in the first world war on 8 July 1917 as they tried to drive the Germans from the Austro-Hungarian army out of the region. There have been attempts to use the river for generating Hydro-electric power, but at the present time there are no current plans to re-introduce their use. The name derives from the Scythian word \\"Str\\", meaning fast. Where the Opir and Stryi meet, there is a legend that the Ukrainian \\"Robin Hood\\", Oleksa Dovbush was wounded, and his blood stained the riverbank causing the red rocks that can be seen there today. Historical significance The Stryi was used as a northern barrier for the Russian Carpathian Front during the first world war. According to the New York Times Current History and Forum periodical, the river was at the edge of an area the Russian army was using to prevent the Austrian forces advance. \\"It was noted last week that the Russian line formed a huge crescent, the longer arc of which (and this was the Carpathian front) extended from Bartfeld north, then east along the Carpathian crests, north of Uzsok to a point on the Stryi River.\\" References External links * Panoramio photographs Rivers of Lviv Oblast ","title":"Stryi (river)"},{"id":"21145158","title":"64th meridian west"},{"id":"21145173","text":"New Babylon is an anti-capitalist city perceived and designed in 1959-74 as a future potentiality by visual artist Constant Nieuwenhuys.Henri Lefebvre on the Situationist International. Interview conducted and translated 1983 by Kristin Ross. Printed in October 79, Winter 1997 Origin of the name Initially known as D√©riville (from \\"ville d√©riv√©e\\", literally, \\"drift city\\"),PAQUOT, Thierry, \\"Le Jeu de Cartes des Sittuationnistes\\", Comit√© Fran√ßais de Cartographie (CFC), N¬∞ 204 - June 2010 it was later renamed New Babylon. Henri Lefebvre explained: \\"a New Babylon  a provocative name, since in the Protestant tradition Babylon is a figure of evil. New Babylon was to be the figure of good that took the name of the cursed city and transformed itself into the city of the future.\\" Goal and rationale The goal was the creating of alternative life experiences, called 'situations', Sarah Williams Goldhagen explained:Sarah Williams Goldhagen (July 2006) ON ARCHITECTURE: Extra-Large in The New Republic > [In the 1950s, Constant] had already been working for years on his \\"New > Babylon\\" series of paintings, sketches, texts, and architectural models > describing the shape of a post-revolutionary society. Constant's New Babylon > was to be a series of linked transformable structures, some of which were > themselves the size of a small citywhat architects call a megastructure. > Perched above ground, Constant's megastructures would literally leave the > bourgeois metropolis below and would be populated by homo ludensman at > play. (Homo Ludens is the title of a book by the great Dutch historian Johan > Huizinga.) In the New Babylon, the bourgeois shackles of work, family life, > and civic responsibility would be discarded. The post-revolutionary > individual would wander from one leisure environment to another in search of > new sensations. Beholden to no one, he would sleep, eat, recreate, and > procreate where and when he wanted. Self-fulfillment and self-satisfaction > were Constant's social goals. Deductive reasoning, goal-oriented production, > the construction and betterment of a political communityall these were > eschewed. Nieuwenhuys' New Babylon was based on the idea that architecture itself would allow and instigate a transformation of daily reality. As Nieuwenhuys wrote: > It is obvious that a person free to use his time for the whole of his life, > free to go where he wants, when he wants, cannot make the greatest use of > his freedom in a world ruled by the clock and the imperative of a fixed > abode. As a way of life, Homo Ludens will demand, firstly, that he responds > to his need for playing, for adventure, for mobility, as well as all the > conditions that facilitate the free creation of his own life. Until then, > the principal activity of man had been the exploration of his natural > surroundings. Homo Ludens himself will seek to transform, to recreate, those > surroundings, that world, according to his new needs. The exploration and > creation of the environment will then happen to coincide because, in > creating his domain to explore, Homo Ludens will apply himself to exploring > his own creation. Thus we will be present at an uninterrupted process of > creation and re-creation, sustained by a generalized creativity that is > manifested in all domains of activity.

These include works attested from as early as the 6th century BC. Modern Iranian literatures include Persian literature, Ossetian literature, Kurdish literature, Pashto literature, and Balochi literature, among others. Classical and medieval eras The title of a published Zend Avesta reading pargart auual in Pazend, a variant of the Avestan alphabet. = Avestan = The earliest surviving literary works in an Iranian language are that of the religious texts of the Avesta, written in Avestan, an Old Iranian sacred language. The oldest part of these are the Gathas (, , \\"hymn\\"), that are a collection of hymns believed to be composed by Zoroaster, the reformer of the ancient Iranian religion and the founder of Zoroastrianism, dating to the 6th century BC. = Old Persian, Parthian, and Middle Persian = Old Persian, the earliest form of the Persian language that is attested on several inscriptions from between the 6th to the 4th century BC, gave rise to Middle Persian in the 3rd century BC, which later produced a number of literary works centered in religious Manichaean and Zoroastrian books written between the 3rd to the 10th century AD. Parthian, another Middle Iranian language which dates to the first three centuries AD and was likely mutually intelligible with Middle Persian, was also used in Manichaean texts, and is regarded, along with Middle Persian, as one of the bases of the modern Persian language. = Khotanese = Khotanese literary works, written in a dialect of the Saka language that was used by the Saka Kingdom of Khotan on the southern branch of the Silk Road, centered mostly in Buddhist texts and were produced mainly between the 5th to the 10th centuries. = Sogdian = Sogdian literature, dating mainly from the 9th and 10th centuries in Sogdia, was centered in Manichaean, Buddhist, and Christian texts. = Bactrian = A few Bactrian manuscript fragments have also been discovered, dating between the 4th to the 9th century. Modern era = Persian = Of the living Iranian languages, Persian has been the most influential. Various modern dialects of Persian are spoken natively by the Persians, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Aimaqs, among others, of which three standardized variants, namely Western Persian (or simply \\"Persian\\"), Dari, and Tajik, are used officially in Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan. Modern Persian literature originates from its earlier forms in the 9th century, although it is also considered to be a continuation of works from much older stages of the language. In spite of originating from the region of Persis (better known as Persia) in southwestern Iran, the Persian language was used and developed further through Persianate societies in Asia Minor, Central Asia, and South Asia, leaving massive influences on Ottoman and Mughal literatures, among others. = Ossetian = Ossetian, the only surviving descendant of the ancient Scytho-Sarmatian (Alanic) languages that was written for the first time on an inscription dating from the 10th to 12th century, has a literary tradition that originates from the 17th century, with the first Ossetian book printed in 1798, although it also has a large body of older folkloric epics. It is spoken predominantly by the Ossetians in Ossetia, a region split between Georgia and Russia in the Caucasus, and is used officially by the Russian republic of North Ossetia- Alania and the autonomous State of Alania. Ossetian literature is based mainly on its prestigious Iron dialect, which is also used administratively. = Kurdish = Kurdish, spoken natively by the Kurds throughout Kurdistan and used officially by the autonomous Region of Kurdistan in northern Iraq and the autonomous federation of Rojava in northern Syria, has a literary tradition whose earliest works are those of Malaye Jaziri, a 16th century influential Kurdish poet from Jazira who used the Kurmanji dialect, and of at least one writer before him, in addition to the orally transmitted folk poetry and prose narratives. Gurani, spoken by the Guran Kurds mainly in Hawraman, also produced a literary tradition beginning in the 16th century. = Pashto = Pashto, one of Afghanistan's two official languages and the second-largest regional language of Pakistan that is spoken natively by the Pashtuns, has developed a literature since the 17th or possibly the 11th century, producing works mainly through its prestigious coastal dialects. = Balochi = Balochi, spoken natively by the Baloch people throughout Balochistan, has a literature starting from the early 19th century.

The Ukrainian Auxiliary Police was created by Heinrich Himmler in mid-August 1941 and put under the control of German Ordnungspolizei in General Government territory. The actual Reichskommissariat Ukraine was formed officially on 20 August 1941.J√ºrgen Matth√§us, Jewish Responses to Persecution: 1941‚Äì1942. AltaMira Press, p. 524. The uniformed force was composed in large part of the former members of the Ukrainian People's Militia created by OUN in June. There were two categories of German-controlled Ukrainian armed organisations. The first comprised mobile police units most often called Schutzmannschaft, or Schuma, organized on the battalion level and which engaged in the murder of Jews and in security warfare in most areas of Ukraine. It was subordinated directly to the German Commander of the Order Police for the area. The second category was the local police force (approximately, a constabulary), called simply the Ukrainian Police (UP) by the German administration, which the SS raised most successfully in the District of Galicia (formed 1 August 1941) extending south-east from the General Government. Notably, the District of Galicia was a separate administrative unit from the actual Reichskommissariat Ukraine. They were not connected with each other politically. The UP formations appeared as well further east in German occupied Soviet Ukraine in significant towns and cities such as Kyiv. The urban based forces were subordinated to the city's German Commander of State protection police (Schutzpolizei or Schupo); the rural police posts were subordinated to the area German Commander of Gendarmerie. The Schupo and Gendarmerie structures were themselves subordinated to the area Commander of Order Police.See the treatment in Dieter Pohl, Nationalsocialistische Judenverfolgung in Ostgalizien 1941‚Äì1944: Organisation und Durchf√ºhrung eines staatlichen Massenverbrechens (Munich: Oldenbourg, 1997), Section II.2: \\"Der Besatzungsapparat im Distrikt Galizien\\" History Map of the German Distrikt Galizien as of 1 September 1941 The local municipal police force (UP) in the occupied Ukrainian SSR came into existence right after the commencement of Operation Barbarossa. It was the result of an order issued on 27 July 1941 by the German commander in chief of the Order Police in occupied Krak√≥w. The Ukrainian auxiliary police in the new District of Galicia fell under the command of the German office for the General Government. An actual ethnic Ukrainian command centre did not exist. The top Ukrainian police officer, Vladimir Pitulay, rose to the rank of major and became the district commandant (Major der Ukrainische Polizei und Kommandeur) in Lemberg (now Lviv). A police school was established in Lviv by the district SS-and-Police Leader in order to meet plans for growth.

The total number of enlisted men in the new politically independent Distrikt Galizien amounted 5,000 people (out of the planned 6000, as the police was perceived negatively in Galicia due to German actions in Ukraine) including 120 low-level officers who served there. The units were used primarily to keep order and carry out constabulary duties. Their actions were restricted by other police groups such as the Sonderdienst, made up of Volksdeutsche; the Kripo (Criminal police); Bahnschutz (railroad and transport police); and the Werkschutz, who kept order and guarded industrial plants. They were supported by the Ukrainian Protection Police and the Ukrainian Order Police.

The make-up of the officer corps was representative of Germany's foreign policy. Professor Wendy Lower from Towson University wrote that although Ukrainians greatly outnumbered other non-Germans in the auxiliary police, only the ethnically German Volksdeutsche from Ukraine were given the leadership roles.Prof. Wendy Lower, Towson University. Local Participation in the Crimes of the Holocaust in Ukraine: Forms and Consequences LMU Muenchen / Towson Univ MD. Many of those who joined the ranks of the police had served as militiamen under Soviet rule since the invasion of Poland in 1939.Timothy Snyder, The Reconstruction of Nations, pg. 159. Professor Tadeusz Piotrowski wrote that the majority of Ukrainische Hilfspolizei in Galicia came from OUN-B,Tadeusz Piotrowski, Poland's Holocaust: Ethnic Strife, Collaboration with Occupying Forces and Genocide in the Second Republic, 1918‚Äì1947, 1997, page 221. which was confirmed by Professor John-Paul Himka as an important transitional stage of OUN involvement in the Holocaust.John‚ÄêPaul Himka (20 October 2011), The Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, the Ukrainian Police, and the Holocaust.

According to Andrew Gregorovich, the ethnic composition of Auxiliary Police reflected the demographics of the land and included not only Ukrainians but also Russians from among the Soviet POWs, Poles drafted from the local population, and German Volksdeutsche of all nationalities. Chapter: Jewish Holocaust in Ukraine. However, Browning (Ordinary Men) and Lower both insist that, for the German administration, nobody but the \\"Ukrainians and local ethnic Germans could be relied upon to assist with the killing\\".

Participation in the Holocaust Naked Jewish women await execution by Ukrainian Auxiliary Police Professor Alexander Statiev of the Canadian University of Waterloo writes that Ukrainian Auxiliary Police were the major perpetrator of the Holocaust on Soviet territories based on native origins, and those police units participated in the extermination of 150,000 Jews in the area of Volhynia alone.The Soviet Counterinsurgency in the Western Borderlands Statiev Alexander Cambridge University Press 2010 page 69 German historian Dieter Pohl in The Shoah in Ukraine writes that the auxiliary police was active during killing operations by the Germans already in the first phases of the German occupation. The auxiliary police registered the Jews, conducted raids and guarded ghettos, loaded convoys to execution sites and cordoned them off. There is a possibility that some 300 auxiliary policemen from Kiev helped organize the massacre in Babi Yar. They also took part in the massacre in Dnipropetrovsk, where the field command noted that the cooperation ran \\"smoothly in every way\\". Cases where local commandants ordered murder of Jews using police force are known. In killings of Jews in Kryvy Rih the \\"entire Ukrainian auxiliary police\\" was put to use. Persecution of Poles Defining nationality of Ukrainian policemen using present-day classifications is problematic, because in German occupied eastern Poland (see: District of Galicia) there was no perception of de jure Ukrainian independent statehood. Some Ukrainian Hilfspolizei who harbored a pathological hatred for Poles and Jews ‚Äì resulting in acts of mass murder ‚Äì remained formally and legally Polish from the time before the invasion until much later. Thirty years after the war ended, one former Ukrainian policeman, Jan Mas≈Çowski (a.k.a. Ivan Maslij), was recognized in Rak≈Çowice near Wroc≈Çaw by Polish survivors of massacres committed by Ukrainische Hilfspolizei in the towns of Szczepiatyn, Dyniska, Tarnoszyn, Niemst√≥w, and Korcz√≥w. He was sentenced to death in Poland in 1978. On 13 November 1942, members of the Ukrainische Hilfspolizei robbed and executed 32 Poles and 1 Jew in the village of Ob√≥rki (pl), located in prewar Wo≈Çy≈Ñ Voivodeship. After the crime the village was burned down.Grzegorz Motyka, Ukrai≈Ñska partyzantka 1942‚Äì1960 On 16 December 1942, the Ukrainian policemen, led by Germans, killed 360 Poles in Jezierce (former powiat Rivne).Czes≈Çaw Partacz, Krzysztof ≈Åada, Polska wobec ukrai≈Ñskich dƒÖ≈ºe≈Ñ niepodleg≈Ço≈õciowych w czasie II wojny ≈õwiatowej, (Toru≈Ñ: Centrum Edukacji Europejskiej, 2003) In Lviv, in late February and March 1944, the Ukrainische Hilfspolizei arrested a number of young men of Polish nationality. Many of them were later found dead and their Identity documents stolen. The Government Delegation for Poland started negotiations with the OUN-B. When they failed, Kedyw began an action called \\"Nieszpory\\" (Vespers) where 11 policemen were shot in retaliation and the murders of young Poles in Lviv stopped.Grzegorz Motyka, Rafa≈Ç Wnuk, Pany i rezuny, 1997, p. 63 Role in the Ukrainian Insurgent Army formation For many who joined the police force, enlistment served as an opportunity to receive military training and direct access to weapons. Bandera's OUN leadership on 20 March 1943 issued secret instructions ordering their members who had joined the German auxiliary police to desert with their weapons and join with the military detachment of OUN (SD) units in Volyn. The number of trained and armed policemen who in spring 1943 joined the ranks of the future Ukrainian Insurgent Army were estimated to be 10,000. This process in some places involved engaging in armed conflict with German forces as they tried to prevent desertion. –û—Ä–≥–∞–Ω—ñ–∑–∞—Ü—ñ—è —É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∏—Ö –Ω–∞—Ü—ñ–æ–Ω–∞–ª—ñ—Å—Ç—ñ–≤ —ñ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ –ø–æ–≤—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ –∞—Ä–º—ñ—è. Battalions By 1942, after the military administration was replaced with the regular Gendarmerie in occupied East, the strength of the Schutzmannschaft had increased tenfold. However, the new recruits were mostly not in the battalions. Instead, they took up the individual post duty as militias in place of former local Ordnungsdienst. The actual Security Battalions (or Schumas, ) comprised only one-third of the overall strength of the formation. As a matter of course, the static police wore black uniforms from the pre-war German stock which was no longer used and kept in storage. The black uniforms of the former Allgemeine-SS including their characteristic field caps were simply stripped of German insignia and given to Schutzmannschaft to use with the new patches. Gradually, the mobile units were issued field-grey uniforms (pictured). The desired size of each battalion was about 500 soldiers divided into three companies of 140-150 men each, with 50 staff members. The logistical problems with securing enough uniforms for all of them continued until late 1942. For the weapons, the most widely used were captured Russian military rifles and pistols. Machine guns remained scarce until the latter stages of the war. Ukrainian Schutzmannschaft battalion photographed in 1942 Most battalions were assigned block numbers based on ethnic and national makeup for ease of recognition. Those in Russia South and the heart of Ukraine were numbered from 101 to 200. The ones operating in Russia Center and in Byelorussia were numbered from 51 to 100. An exception was Battalion 201, which was formed not in Galicia but in Frankfurt an der Oder in October 1941, from members of the disbanded Nachtigall Battalion, formed originally by OUN-B. ;Russia Center and Byelorussia *Schutzmannschaft Bataillon 51 (ukrainische), disbanded in May 1943 *Schutzmannschaft Bataillon 53 (ukrainische), formed in August 1942 *Schutzmannschaft Bataillon 54 (ukrainische), formed in September 1942 *Schutzmannschaft Bataillon 55 (ukrainische), formed in August 1942 *Schutzmannschaft Wacht Bataillon 57, 61, 62, 63 (ukrainische), since July 1944 as Schutzmannschaft-Brigade Siegling; in August, as 30th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS. ;Russia South and Ukraine *Schutzmannschaft Bataillons 101, 102, 103, 104 (ukrainische) formed in July 1942. *Schutzmannschaft Bataillons 105, 106 (ukrainische) formed in November 1942. *Schutzmannschaft Bataillons 108, 109, 110, 111, 113, 114 (ukrainische) formed in July 1942. *Schutzmannschaft Bataillon 115 (ukrainische) formed in July 1942 and transferred to Belarus right away. *Schutzmannschaft Bataillons 116, 117 (ukrainische) formed in July 1942. *Schutzmannschaft Bataillon 118, formed in July 1942 with former Soviet officers at the helm who were soon dispatched in Kiev to form other battalions.

The revolt was plotted by followers of the Iraqi Communist Party in junction with military officers. The revolt failed to spread outside Baghdad and was crushed by the Baathist forces. Background On February 8, 1963, an army coup was staged, overthrowing the Iraqi Nationalist government of Abd al-Karim Qasim in favour of the pan-Arabist Abdul Salam Arif. The two had both been members of the free officers movement that orchestrated the overthrow the western-aligned Hashemite monarchy in the 14 July Revolution, but Ideological differences between the two caused tension. The coup had been planned for over a year, and followed one and a half months of Ba'athist agitations and protests against Qasim. After the coup the new regime instituted Arif as president and moved swiftly to eliminate its opponents, primarily the Iraqi Communist Party followers of Qasim. Thousands of leaders and key cadres of the Communist Party were detained, tortured and often killed, leaving the party in organizational disarray.Ismael, Tareq Y. The Rise and Fall of the Communist Party of Iraq. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008. pp. 107-109 Preparations of the revolt Whilst the Baathists had crushed most of the Communist Party organization, there were some Communist Party cells in the labour movement and the army that had remained intact. The Baghdad organizations of the Communist Party had been one of the most militant sectors of the party prior to the crackdown. The party cells inside the military began contacting cells belonging to the Baghdad Workers Committee, which organized party activities inside trade unions in the capital, to plan an overthrow of the Baathists a few weeks after the Baathist take-over.Ismael, Tareq Y. The Rise and Fall of the Communist Party of Iraq. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008. p. 110 Ibrahim Muhammad Ali was a member of the Workers Central Committee of the Communist Party, and led a Workers Committee in Baghdad. He had tried in vain to seek direction from a group of Central Committee members of the party, only to discover that they had been executed. Ali then proceeded on his own initiative to reorganize the civilian party cells in Baghdad. Ali directed Muhammad Habib (Abu Salam), a coffee-shop worker, to reorganize the party cells in the army. Habib was able to establish communications with Corporal Hasan Sari. Sari was in charge of one of the Communist Party cells inside the army. Ali was captured by the intelligence services, after Communist Party members turned government informers had revealed his identity. He was tortured to death. Habib then had to take over Ali's leadership of the civilian cells as well as continuing the work with the army cells. Habib and Sari formed a 'Revolutionary Committee', preparing for a revolt. Sari would mobilize soldiers in an uprising, whilst Habib would mobilize civilians to provide aid to the soldiers. Two other Communist Party corporals and a tailor named Hafiz Latfah, took part in the planning. The plotters presented their plan to the few remaining Central Committee members of the Communist Party. The Central Committee members rejected the plan, and labelled it as a violation of party discipline. Habib ignored their directions and did not inform Sari of the ruling by the party leadership. On the contrary, evidence suggested that Habib had conveyed to Sari that they had the full backing of the entire Communist Party. Together, Habib and Sari continued the preparations.Ismael, Tareq Y. The Rise and Fall of the Communist Party of Iraq. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008. pp. 110-111 The revolt On July 3, 1963, the revolt was staged. Rebel soldiers as well as the Baghdad and Middle Euphrates sections of the Communist Party, together amassing 2,000 fighters, took control over the ar-Rashid army camp in Baghdad. They were able to detain the camp commanders, the entire leadership of the Baathist National Guard militia, the Interior minister and the Foreign minister of Iraq.Ismael, Tareq Y. The Rise and Fall of the Communist Party of Iraq. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008. p. 111 Habib and Sari had selected the ar-Rashid camp as the scene of the revolt, since around 1,000 pro-Qassem officers and communists were in detention there. The rationale was that once the detained officers had been freed, they would provide leadership for other army units around the country to join the rebellion. However, even though the rebels had been able to seize the army camp they could not free the detainees as they met unexpected resistance from prison guards. The revolt never spread to other army units. Baathist forces were able to encircle the camp and crushed the revolt. Death train and aftermath Within the Baath Party, the military sector demanded that all captured officers be executed. Civilians in the Baathist leadership opposed mass executions of officers, arguing that executions should be limited to 30 core leaders of the revolt. In the end, it was decided that all captured officers would be sent on a cattle train to the Nuqrat as-Salman desert prison. The train-ride (later nicknamed the 'Death Train') was supposed to take six hours, during which it was calculated that many would die in the scorching heat. The train driver, realising that his cargo consisted of humans, speeded up the ride to just two hours. Arriving at their destination, only one of the captured officers had died. The train driver's initiative combined with the fact that several of the officers had medical training, were decisive factors to limit the number of casualties. After the ar-Rashid revolt, the Baathists stepped up their campaign against the Communist Party. Only the Middle Euphrates and Kurdish sections of the party remained intact.Ismael, Tareq Y. The Rise and Fall of the Communist Party of Iraq. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008. p. 112 Soviet involvement The revolt caused a rift in Iraqi‚ÄìSoviet relations, with the Iraqi government claiming that it had evidence that Soviet instructors had helped plan the revolt and Radio Baghdad accusing the Soviet Union of \\"a plot against our national independence.\\" There had been issues between Iraq and the Soviet Union before the revolt, with the Soviet Union suspending military shipments to Iraq and indicating support for Iraqi Kurdish rebels.

Looney Tunes animated cartoon directed by Robert McKimson. It starred Cool Cat, and was the final cartoon from the 1930-1969 era to bear the Looney Tunes name, and the last from that era to be widely released. One more cartoon, Injun Trouble, would follow Bugged by a Bee, but it was in the Merrie Melodies series. This cartoon was the last Looney Tunes short until 1987's The Duxorcist. Synopsis Cool Cat, a student at Disco Tech, sings about how he's \\"workin' through college to gain a lotta knowledge.\\" A bee disturbs him which he swats to the ground with his guitar. As the angry bee sharpens its stinger, Cool Cat checks out the college's sports programs and decides to try out pole vaulting to impress the female students. His first attempt goes wrong when his pole gets stuck in a chipmunk's hole, and when he goes again the bee stings him as he begins his run-up. The pain gives Cool Cat enough power in his run-up to set a record- breaking vault over the pole and the college's baseball coach is impressed enough to let him try out for the team. In his first baseball match Cool Cat tries to swat the bee instead of hitting the ball and records two strikes. On the crucial third ball Cool Cat hits a home run, which he completes with help from the bee's sting. The bee also helps him to triumphs in rowing and hurdling. In an important football match which is 0‚Äì0 in the final few minutes, Cool Cat is stung causing him to swallow the ball and dart around the stadium, while the other players ask each other who has got the ball. Cool Cat flops down on the touchline and is stung again, causing him to spit the ball out and score the winning touchdown. The college holds a ceremony to honor Cool Cat's achievements which have propelled Disco Tech to the top of the sports leagues. To Cool Cat's chagrin however, the bee is celebrated at the ceremony rather than himself.

The series is about a boy, Charlie Spinner (Eddie Cooper), who discovers that his grandfather, Oscar Spinner (David Swift), is actually a secret agent. He acts as if he is senile but it is just a cover so that nobody would notice. After Charlie confronts Oscar with this they work together on a dangerous assignment.  Plot summary  It doesn't go really well with Oscar Spinner, the father of the twelve-year-old Charlie. Grandpa Oscar regularly forgets his own name and the names of others. He burns his food and lets his bath overflow. So Charlie does not look forward to the family visits with grandpa. But during the stay with his grandfather, Charlie discovered a number of things which are not at all consistent with the picture of the demented grandfather. Oscar appears to solve the most difficult crossword riddles with ease; and in his coat, Charlie finds a super-modern personal digital assistant. When he confronts his grandfather with that, he tells Charlie the truth: Oscar is a secret agent for the British secret service MI5 for more than 30 years. For security reasons he has always kept this a secret for his family. But now that Charlie knows, he asks Charlie to help him with a dangerous and super-secret mission: Operation Bear Trap (Episodes 1 to 7). And this way the old and young Spinner join their strengths in the fight against the international crime and espionage. The second case (Episodes 8 to 13) appears at first glance to be about industrial espionage but it emerges that it in fact involves blackmail of the British Government by an unexpected person who kidnaps Oscar and tries to recruit him.  Characters  Charlie Spinner (Eddie Cooper) is a 12-year-old boy. He has a healthy brain. And that's really important for his activities at MI5. Oscar Spinner (David Swift) is Charlie's grandfather. He acts senile so that nobody discovers his secret. He's really intelligent. He is always happy and charming but gets really angry and concerned when Charlie gets himself into trouble. Alan Spinner (Owen Brenman) is Oscar's son and Charlie's father. Alan is really strict and he is disappointed in the school results of his son. He is not really smart himself and he believes his father is actually turning senile. Carol Spinner (Dido Miles) is Charlie's mother. She always stands on Charlie's side when Alan gets angry at him. As a teacher she also knows that Charlie has a lot of talents and is really smart. Deborah Spinner (Danielle Calvert) is Charlie's older sister. She treats her little brother as a child and finds him annoying. They always argue about everything. There is only one thing where they agree on and that is about their strict father. Deborah is secretly in love with Charlie's best friend: VJ. VJ and Willoughby are Charlie's best friends, but they really do not look alike. Willoughby (Robert Timmins) is a really good student, sometimes a bit unsure and a bit weird. Kind of a nerd actually. VJ (Wahlid Choglay) is a cool, smooth and self- assured boy. He is 13 but he acts like a 21-year-old. He always tries to make Charlie's image go up but Charlie's dad never agrees on it. George and Palmer are two people in MI5. They are friends of Oscar. George (Louis Mahoney) is Oscar's assistant and chauffeur. They have been working together for years. George has kept Oscar out of trouble several times. Palmer (Michael Fenton- Stevens) is at the head of MI5. He is a guy who can not stand it when they do not follow his orders. He does not like it when Oscar comes up with another idea. Palmer also has manyf secret agendas.

He was played by late Australian actor Heath Ledger. A psychopathic criminal mastermind and mass murderer with a warped, sadistic sense of humor, the Joker is hired by Gotham City's mob bosses to kill the vigilante Batman (Christian Bale), and also comes into conflict with Batman's allies, Gotham police officer James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Joker embodies themes of chaos, anarchy and obsession: throughout the film, he expresses a desire to upset the social order in Gotham through crime, and defines himself by his conflict with Batman. Ledger's interpretation of the Joker is specifically influenced by the graphic novels Batman: The Killing Joke and Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth. In the film, he wears the character's traditional purple and green color palette, while his facial appearance includes clown makeup that covers facial scars of a Glasgow smile, and green hair. Ledger's Joker also explores techniques found in the actor's previous performances, including his clown act in Terry Gilliam's fantasy film The Brothers Grimm, while also referencing paintings by artist Francis Bacon, Anthony Burgess' novel A Clockwork Orange, and various punk rock musicians, as well as a vocal style rumoured to be influenced by Tom Waits. Ledger's casting as the Joker was initially controversial but it is now considered his finest performance; Ledger himself regarded it as his most enjoyable. When the film was released in July 2008, six months after Ledger died from an accidental overdose, the performance received universal acclaim and numerous posthumous accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  Character arc  The character is indirectly referenced at the end of Batman Begins, when Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman) describes to Batman (Christian Bale) a suspect wanted in connection with an armed robbery and double homicide. Gordon shows Batman a joker playing card left at the crime scene. The Joker first appears in person at the beginning of The Dark Knight, as part of a six-member gang wearing clown masks who rob a mob-owned bank. He tricks four of them into killing each other, then kills the last one himself and escapes with the money. Interrupting a videoconference between mob bosses Sal Maroni (Eric Roberts), the Chechen (Ritchie Coster) and Gambol (Michael Jai White) with their accountant Lau (Chin Han), he offers to kill Batman for half of the mob's money. Gambol refuses the offer and puts a bounty on the \\"clown\\". Later, the Joker kills Gambol and takes over his gang. After learning that Batman has captured Lau, Maroni and the Chechen accept the Joker's offer. The Joker announces that people will die each day until Batman reveals his true identity, and makes good on his threat by assassinating Gotham Police Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb (Colin McFarlane) and mob trial Judge Janet Surillo (Nydia Rodriguez Terracina). When Gotham's district attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), attempts to draw him out by identifying himself as Batman, the Joker tries to kidnap him, only to be arrested and interrogated by Batman after Dent goes missing. The Joker reveals that Dent's girlfriend (and Bruce Wayne's childhood sweetheart) Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) has also gone missing and divulges their separate locations, both rigged with time bombs, but lies about which location each hostage is held at. Batman saves Dent, who is disfigured in the explosion, but Rachel is killed. The Joker then escapes the police station with Lau. The Joker kills Lau and the Chechen, burns his half of the mob's money and takes over the Chechen's gang. To prevent Wayne Enterprises M&A; law accountant Coleman Reese (Joshua Harto) from revealing Batman's secret identity on TV, the Joker announces that he will blow up a hospital if Reese is not dead within 60 minutes. During the ensuing panic, the Joker sneaks into Gotham General Hospital disguised as a nurse to meet with Dent and persuades him to take revenge on the people he holds responsible for Rachel's death. He then blows up the hospital and takes a busload of hostages. The Joker rigs explosives on two ferries leaving the Gotham bay, one containing citizens and the other transporting criminals, and tells the passengers that he will destroy both boats unless one blows up the other by midnight. While Batman fights the Joker, the ferry passengers choose not to blow each other up, Batman bluntly informing the Joker that, despite his attempt to prove \\"that deep down, everyone's as ugly as [him]\\", the Joker is alone in his corruption and insanity. Batman subsequently apprehends the Joker, who states that he believes that they are meant to fight each other forever. The Joker gloats that he has won \\"the battle for Gotham's soul\\", as the city's inhabitants will lose hope once Dent's rampage as the murderous vigilante \\"Two-Face\\" becomes known. The Joker then laughs hysterically as he is held at gunpoint by a SWAT team. Batman ultimately foils the Joker's plan by taking the blame for Dent's crimes. The Joker is not mentioned in The Dark Knight Rises, the 2012 sequel to The Dark Knight, out of respect for Ledger's memory. However, the novelization of the film makes an ambiguous reference to the character while describing Blackgate Prison:  Background  As a starting actor, Heath Ledger did not attach himself seriously to the roles he was playing. This changed, however, when at age 22 he started to watch some of his films. Realizing that they were movies he himself might not actually have wanted to see, it made him more cautious and respectful towards his professional choices. The 2005 fantasy film The Brothers Grimm marked a turning point for the actor as director Terry Gilliam gave Ledger (and his co- star, Matt Damon) opportunities to create characters they had not been given before. Gilliam helped Ledger put on a clown act for that film, an experience the actor later acknowledged as an influence for his performance as the Joker. Director Christopher Nolan had met with Ledger over the years for different roles. While meeting for the part of Batman in Batman Begins, Ledger explained that he was not interested in working on such a film. The actor reflected on his problems with portraying superheroes, saying; \\"I would just feel stupid and silly. I couldn't pull it off and there are other people who can perfectly, but I just couldn't take myself seriously.\\" However, later impressed with Batman Begins, Ledger sought the part of the Joker from Nolan. Impressed with Ledger's determination, Nolan cast him in the part. \\"Heath was just ready to do it, he was ready to do something that big.\\" Casting director John Papsidera reflected on the casting choice, saying the filmmakers knew they needed somebody courageous to play the part. Heath Ledger was cast before there was a script.  Performance  Heath Ledger described the Joker as a \\"psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy\\". Highlighting the opportunity for freshness, Ledger aimed for a new and different interpretation of the character, separate from previous film incarnations. Ledger and Christopher Nolan both explained seeing eye-to-eye on the Joker's appearance in the film, sharing common reference points for who the character was going to be. Based on philosophical ideas of anarchy and chaos, they looked at art by Francis Bacon for visual reference and they talked about Malcolm McDowell's performance as Alex in Stanley Kubrick's film A Clockwork Orange, and who Alex is in Anthony Burgess' novel of the same name.The Fire Rises: The Creation and Impact of the Dark Knight Trilogy, 2013. Warner Bros., Blu-Ray DVD. Time: 00:51:20. Director Christopher Nolan talks about his conversations with Heath Ledger about the Joker. English, USA. Ledger was given Alan Moore's graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke for preparation for the role, as well as Grant Morrison's graphic novel Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, which he \\"really tried to read and put it down\\". In an interview with MTV, Ledger said he regarded the experience playing the Joker as the most fun he ever had, \\"and probably will ever have\\". = Description = Wearing the character's traditional color palette, the Joker is dressed in a thin tie and green waistcoat, topped by a purple overcoat, stylistic choices that hearken back to the era of New Romanticism. His shoes have an upward swoop at the toe, reminiscent of clown shoes. He carries no identification of any kind and offers no clear details about his true name or background; when he is arrested by the Gotham City police, they find only knives and lint in his pockets. The Joker's hair is stringy, unkempt, and dyed green. His face is covered in a cracked and runny layer of white clown makeup, with his sunken eyes thickly rimmed in black. A sloppy red grin is painted across his mouth and cheeks, partly obscuring the scars of a Glasgow smile. Film critic Peter Travers wrote about the Joker as having \\"the grungy hair and the yellowing teeth of a hound fresh out of hell\\". The character's mannerisms carry a quality of unpredictability. His voice frequently shifts in pitch, so that he speaks his dialogue hitting higher notes, followed by an immediate lower voice capable of landing two octaves below. Nolan acknowledges this unpredictability to be part of the character's slinky physical movements as well, saying that Ledger's performance \\"[is] always a surprise\\". About the Joker's physical appearance, Geoff Boucher wrote for the Los Angeles Times that the character probes the facial scars with his tongue and \\"walks with shoulders bowed and his chin out and down, like a hyena\\". = Development = Steve Alexander, Heath Ledger's agent, said the actor had a \\"pay-or-play\\" deal on The Dark Knight, \\"so he felt free to do whatever he wanted to do as the Joker, no matter how crazy.\\" According to The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus cinematographer Nicola Pecorini, Ledger had talked with him about Johnny Depp's off-kilter portrayal of Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl in relation to The Dark Knight, aiming to make a performance that would be \\"so far out he'd be fired\\". As Ledger was cast early in pre-production, Nolan explained that the actor had \\"months and months\\" to prepare for the role. During a span of six weeks, Ledger \\"locked\\" himself away in a hotel room, forming a character diary and experimenting with voices. \\"It's a combination of reading all the comic books I could that were relevant to the script and then just closing my eyes and meditating on it\\", he said about his process. The diary contains scrawling and cuttings inside. Christopher Hooton, writing for The Independent, said that the 'Joker journal' had several stills from Stanley Kubrick's film A Clockwork Orange, joker cards, photos of hyenas, unhinged clown makeup and the word \\"chaos\\" highlighted in green. Furthermore, it contains a list of things the Joker would find funny, such as AIDS, landmines, and geniuses suffering brain damage. It was revealed that Ledger had read Grant Morrison's writing of The Clown at Midnight (Batman #663) and based the list upon the Batman writer's prose. Ledger highlighted the importance of finding an iconic voice and laugh for the character, relating the voice as \\"the key to the demented killer\\". Nolan explained Ledger's early and \\"peculiar\\" ambition for the voice of the character, saying that the actor had studied the way ventriloquist dummies talk. The filmmaker also acknowledged that the voice performance was based on the Alexander technique. Ledger developed the Joker's voice and mannerisms slowly over time and during camera tests. \\"Don't act, just read it\\", Nolan had told Ledger for a test screening. In hair and makeup tests, Ledger would start exploring the movements of the character. While test recording without sound, he shared his take on the Joker's voice and physicality, and \\"in that way he sort of sneaked upon it\\". The actor developed the physical appearance of the character, being \\"very involved\\" with the painting of his face, says prosthetic supervisor Conor O'Sullivan. O'Sullivan acknowledged how Ledger, Nolan, and makeup artist John Caglione all gravitated towards a Francis Bacon painting Nolan was referring to. Ledger also got to choose the Joker's weapon among different rubber knives, and he worked closely with costume designer Lindy Hemming on deciding the look for the character. Nolan noted, \\"We gave a Francis Bacon spin to [his face]. This corruption, this decay in the texture of the look itself. It's grubby. You can almost imagine what he smells like.\\" With costume designer Lindy Hemming picking inspiration for the \\"chaotic\\" look from such countercultural pop culture artists as Iggy Pop, Johnny Rotten, and Sid Vicious. She gave the image for the Joker of someone who is \\"very sweaty\\" and who \\"probably doesn't have a proper home\\". She tried to present a backstory for the character \\"that he really doesn't look after himself\\". = Execution = Application of Heath Ledger's makeup was done with the actor scrunching special facial expressions. Caglione called the application work \\"a dance\\". This technique created facial textures for white paint. As Ledger closed his eyes tight, Caglione put on the black makeup. Then, water was sprayed over the eyes and the actor would squeeze his eyes and shake his head to create imperfections in the makeup. To get in character for filming, Ledger used his Joker diary which he carried with him on set. Between takes, Ledger would stay in costume and makeup just being himself. The actor would goof around, skateboarding while in his Joker costume on set, and smoking cigarettes. John Caglione described Ledger as helping others around to relax, never letting \\"the intense nature of the roles overwhelm him\\". The first sequence shot was the film's IMAX opening, the \\"prologue\\". As the Joker wears a mask through the scene with minimal dialogue, Nolan set the prologue first in the schedule because he wanted to put off performance worries, allowing Ledger to enjoy that relief. The interrogation scene between Batman and the Joker was the first scene shot with Ledger really showing the full performance altogether. The director and his leading actors all liked the idea of shooting the key scene early on. During rehearsals, the actors kept things loose and improvisational, saving for the actual shoot. Bale confirmed that Ledger did not perform the Joker's voice during rehearsals, waiting to get in character when the cameras rolled. Nolan later acknowledged the scene to be his favorite in the film, saying \\"I had never seen anybody sell a punch the way Heath was able to do with Christian.\\" Ledger was allowed to shoot and direct the threat videos the Joker sends out as warnings. Each take Ledger made was different from the last. Nolan was impressed enough with the first video shoot that he chose to not be present when Ledger shot the video with a kidnapped reporter (Anthony Michael Hall).. . Heath Ledger always showed up early onset. The first thing he would do, according to Caglione, was to give bear hugs to cast and crew members around the set. \\"And no matter how banged-up or bruised Heath was after a long day, after we'd take off the last drop of makeup, he'd just hug everybody in the trailer before he left\\". At the end of shooting, on his Joker diary's final page, Ledger wrote \\"BYE BYE\\".  Effects of Heath Ledger's death  On 22 January 2008, after he had completed filming The Dark Knight, Ledger died, aged 28, of an accidental prescription drug overdose, leading to intense press attention and memorial tributes. \\"It was tremendously emotional, right when he passed, having to go back in and look at him every day [during editing]\\", Nolan recalled. \\"But the truth is, I feel very lucky to have something productive to do, to have a performance that he was very, very proud of, and that he had entrusted to me to finish.\\" All of Ledger's scenes appear as he completed them in the filming; in editing the film, Nolan added no digital effects to alter Ledger's actual performance posthumously. Nolan has dedicated the film in part to Ledger's memory. Ledger's death affected the marketing campaign for The Dark Knight and also both the production and marketing of Terry Gilliam's film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus; both Nolan and Gilliam celebrated and paid tribute to Ledger's work in these films.  Reception and legacy  = Announcement and early response = On 31 July 2006, The Dark Knight was officially announced by Warner Bros with the casting of Heath Ledger as the Joker. The casting decision surprised some and was seen as a controversial move at the time, receiving notable negative reactions on the Internet. Nolan remembered the cynicism he endured surrounding Ledger's casting, saying that \\"the whole world turned around and said 'What are you doing?' You know, Heath Ledger, Joker, didn't make any sense to people at all.\\" In his 2016 book The Caped Crusade: Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture, NPR contributor Glen Weldon recalled that fans were outraged over the choice of Ledger, due to his past roles in films such as Brokeback Mountain (2005). However, with the first trailer released in 2007, the film and its portrayal of the Joker received very positive response from audiences and entertainment industry professionals alike. Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro gushed of his impression for Ledger's performance, finding it \\"really, really edgy and scary\\". American Batman writers Paul Dini and Jeph Loeb both chimed with the positive reactions. Loeb, who had been critical of Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker in 1989's Batman, expressed his excitement for Ledger's interpretation, saying the casting felt \\"just about right. I eagerly anticipate more!\\" = Critical reception = Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker received widespread critical acclaim, winning numerous posthumous awards for his performance, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture, the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor, a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role, and a Best Actor International Award at the 2008 Australian Film Institute Awards. \\"I can only speak superlatives of Ledger, who is mad-crazy- brilliant as the Joker\\", wrote Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, stating that the film is deeper than its predecessor, with a \\"deft\\" script that refuses to scrutinize the Joker with popular psychology. (Postdated) Travers praised the cast, saying each brings his or her A' game\\" to the film. Travers said Ledger moves the Joker away from Jack Nicholson's interpretation into darker territory, and expressed his support for any potential campaign to have Ledger nominated for an Academy Award. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that Heath Ledger's portrayal is a \\"key performance\\" and pondered whether he would become the first posthumous Academy Award-winning actor since Peter Finch in 1976. Mark Dinning from Empire magazine called Ledger's performance \\"monumental\\" and wrote \\"The Dark Knight is Ledger's movie. It is a towering performance. ... A force of nature\\". Kevin Smith commented on Ledger, calling his \\"incredible\\" performance among \\"the most frightening, smart and well- played villains ever. Ever.\\" Mark Lee, writing for The Daily Telegraph, commented that Ledger accomplished \\"a genuinely unsettling, brilliant nuanced portrait of evil\\". Tim Teeman commented for The Times that \\"Ledger is so terrifying and unpredictable that his very presence on screen makes you nervous.\\" Total Film reviewed that Ledger is \\"burning brightly as he embodies an icon. ... This is the definitive Joker\\", calling the performance \\"a masterpiece\\". For The Hollywood Reporter, Kirk Honeycutt called Ledger's performance \\"a beauty\\". Entertainment Weekly put the film on its end-of-the- decade, \\"best-of\\" list, saying, \\"Every great hero needs a great villain. And in 2008, Christian Bale's Batman found his in Heath Ledger's demented dervish, the Joker.\\" Emanuel Levy wrote Ledger \\"throws himself completely\\" into the role. David Denby of The New Yorker, otherwise critical of the film, praised Ledger's \\"sinister and frightening\\" performance, which he says is the film's one element of success. Denby called Ledger \\"mesmerising\\" and said, \\"His performance is a heroic, unsettling final act: this young actor looked into the abyss.\\" (Postdated) \\"It's just one of the most iconic movie performances of modern times\\", declared chief film critic of Variety Scott Foundas. Film critics, co-stars Maggie Gyllenhaal and Michael Caine, and many of Ledger's colleagues in the film community joined Bale in calling for and predicting a nomination for the 2008 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in recognition of Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight.

He studied art in Paris, being the first Egyptian at the Louvre School. He was a pupil of Paul S√©rusier, F√©lix Vallotton and the Symbolist painter Maurice Denis. It can be said that he was attached to the artists of the Paris School - he worked beside Amedeo Modigliani - but he always refused to be considered one of them, keeping his independence and freedom. His family and the region of Brittany (where his children were born) provided him with subjects for many of his paintings, before trips to Egypt led him to rediscover the lights, landscapes and characters of his childhood. He excelled in portraits, nudes and landscapes both in France and in Egypt and was enchanted by the old districts of Cairo. A painter of talent, Georges Sabbagh forms one of the group of artists who Jean Cassou called \\"the sacrificed generation\\" (along with Henri de Waroquier and Jules-√âmile Zingg) - absorbing the school of Les Nabis, Fauvism and Cubism at the beginning of the century, but forgotten after the Second World War. Cassou describes him as a \\"cordial and deeply human painter\\". He was able to create in the end of his career a new attitude towards realism. He served in the British Army in the First World War. In 1916 he married the art historian Agn√®s Humbert, by whom he had two children: the television producer and director Pierre Sabbagh, and the sub-mariner and advisor to General Charles de Gaulle, Jean Sabbagh. Georges and Agn√®s divorced in 1934. After his death, his son Jean and daughter-in-law Monique were able to make a retrospective appreciation of his work and a catalogue.

He currently lives in London with his wife and two of his children. Comedy & Stage For more than 20 years, Clark has been building a reputation for himself on the comedy scene. Working as a comp√®re, he has hosted shows throughout the country. In January 1990 he introduced the first 'Pillar Talk' show at the Pillar Room in the Cheltenham Town Hall, a venue which has seen some of the top acts in the UK including Simon Pegg, Mark Lamarr, Bill Bailey and Frank Skinner. Clark was on hand to witness one of the crazier moments in Jim Jefferies' career. The Australian comic was on stage at the Comedy Store, Manchester when he was attacked by a heckler. As well as touring with Frank Skinner, Clark has toured extensively throughout Europe (including Kosovo and Bosnia) and in Asia. In 1995, he became the first western comic to perform in Beijing, China. He is now a regular comp√®re with Comedy Store and Jongleurs. At the 2002 Edinburgh Fringe, Clark performed his one-man drama, \\"Talking to Ted\\". Playing the role of a less than stellar comedian he tries to come to terms with his cocaine habit and how he's going to explain to his wife about the Welsh mistress which has now given him a son. His only companion he can talk to is the teddy bear his daughter left in the car. Fiona Stuges reviewed the show in The Independent praising Clark as \\"a revelation. has a strong feel for human frailty and performs with acute intelligence. For that, he shouldn't be overlooked.\\". The show was broadcast on 7 July 2004 on BBC Radio 4 with Les Dennis taking up the main role. He later returned to Edinburgh in 2006 with the Fringe First production of What I Heard About Iraq. Based on the Eliot Weinberger article and using direct quotes and statistics from the people and events that surrounded the war on Iraq, each member of the production take turns to say 'What I heard about Iraq'. Clark gave a 'powerful performance' and the reviewer ended by saying the play 'is likely to become one of the Fringe's most talked about shows, and rightly so'. TV & Radio Alongside Danny Kelly, Clark co-hosted a sports phone-in show on Channel 4 called Under the Moon. Starting on 12 Feb 1997, it was aired in the early hours of the morning. Clark only lasted about 10 episodes into its two-season run. In an interview Kelly would claim that \\"it didn't help that he wouldn't rehearse and he was having trouble with his contact lenses so couldn't read the autocue.\\" When the BBC tried to revive the show Give Us a Clue (originally on rival network ITV), Clark was called on to host the show. The format of the show basically followed the games of charades with one member of the team miming in order to convey to the rest of the team a popular phrase, book, TV or film. If their team was unable to guess it was passed over to the other team who could steal the points. The teams were captained by Christopher Blake and Julie Peasgood. It was broadcast in the afternoon it ran from 10 November until 19 December 1997 before being axed. He has probably gained the most national recognition from his television advert for the airline Virgin Atlantic. Appearing alongside actor Paul Blackthorne, Clark played the role of the Grim Reaper. Despite a costume and make-up which took several hours to applying, he was still recognised on the streets. As well as TV, there have been a couple of short film roles. Clark starred alongside Nina Pasale in Graeme Cole's Pilot for a 22nd Century Sitcom. Clark plays a scientist whose wife has stopped doing the house work fearing an impending nuclear war. He also had a brief appearance in the 2006 short film \\"The Bed Guy\\" in the guise of Santa. Clark has also made guest appearances on radio including six times on BBC Radio 5 Live's \\"Fighting Talk\\". Writing As part of Channel 4' Sitcom Festival in 1995, Clark wrote the play The Beautiful Game. The 30-minute piece about two football fans was written for television but performed in front of a live audience at the Riverside Studios, London. His writing career also includes speeches written for ex-England football manager Graham Taylor, ex-footballer Neil Ruddock and also Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

He was a devout Anglican in the high church tradition and a local benefactor. He paid for the restoration of his parish church and for the building of two new churches in villages on his estates. He also built cottages and farm buildings in the villages. Through his mother's line he inherited the Arley and Warburton estates in Cheshire. He is best remembered for rebuilding Arley Hall and its chapel dedicated to St Mary, and for helping to create the picturesque appearance of the village of Great Budworth. He and his wife designed extensive new formal gardens to the southeast of the hall, which included one of the earliest herbaceous borders in Britain. The hall and gardens are still owned by his family, but are open to the public. Egerton-Warburton's main hobby was hunting. He was a keen member, and later the president, of the nearby Tarporley Hunt Club. He also wrote poetry, the subject matter of which reflected his interests in hunting and in the countryside. Some of his rhymes are to be found on signposts in the grounds of the hall. Early life He was born Rowland Egerton in 1804 at Norley Bank, Norley, Cheshire, the eldest son of Rowland Egerton and his wife, Emma. His father was the seventh son of Philip Egerton who became the 9th baronet of Egerton and Oulton on the death of his elder brother in 1825. His maternal grandmother (also called Emma) was the youngest sister of Sir Peter Warburton, 5th baronet of Arley, who had no children. Sir Peter died in 1813 and in his will he left the estates of Warburton and Arley to Rowland junior, who was at that time still a minor. His father added the name \\"Warburton\\" by royal licence in the same year. Egerton- Warburton was educated at Eton College, and although he was admitted to Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 1823, there is no evidence that he was awarded a degree. After his time in Oxford he went on a Grand Tour, and returned to the life of a squire at Arley Hall, having gained control of the estates on achieving his age of majority in 1825. Landowner and benefactor St Cross Church, Appleton Thorn Egerton-Warburton managed the Arley estate from 1825 until his death in 1891. During this time the estate was profitable and he was able to enjoy a larger income than his predecessors. He was a high church Anglican and a supporter of the Oxford Movement, having been influenced by Keble, Pusey and Newman. He regularly attended choral Matins in the chapel at Arley Hall, and on hunt days he wore his hunting colours. He took little interest in politics, in which respect he is regarded as having been \\"passive\\". In the 1850s he paid for the restoration of his local parish church of St Mary and All Saints at Great Budworth, where he encouraged a more Anglo- Catholic style of worship. He paid for the building of new churches in two villages on his estates. In the village of Warburton he paid for the new church of St Werburgh. This was built in 1883‚Äì85 to a design by John Douglas of Chester, at which time Egerton-Warburton's nephew, Rev. Geoffrey Egerton- Warburton, was the incumbent. This church replaced the old church in Warburton, also dedicated to St Werburgh, as the parish church. The old church still exists on another site in the village. In the village of Appleton Thorn, to the north of Arley Hall, he paid for St Cross church, which was built in 1886‚Äì87 to a design by Edmund Kirby of Liverpool. Cottages in Great Budworth Egerton-Warburton also paid for the construction of secular buildings in villages on his estates, many of which were designed by John Douglas. In Great Budworth he had a \\"campaign to restore the village and render it picturesque in Victorian eyes\\". He restored many of the cottages in the village and built new ones to blend with them. In 1875, the George and Dragon, a simple three- bay Georgian inn in the village, was remodelled by adding ribbed chimneys, moulded brick mullions, an elliptical-headed doorway and a steep pyramid- shaped turret. The village has changed little since then and it remains \\"one of Cheshire's most charming villages\\". In 1873 he paid for the building of a cottage in Arley Green and founded Arley School in the village. In Warburton, he paid for a school in 1871‚Äì72, a church hall in 1889, and a post office in 1893. Features in the style of Douglas were added to the timber-framed Bent Farm, which stands opposite the new church, in 1880. He also built the public road from Arley Hall to Appleton Thorn. Fox hunter and poet Egerton- Warburton was a keen fox hunter and rode with the Tarporley Hunt Club, of which he became a member in 1825 and its president in 1838. When he retired from hunting in 1873, he was made an honorary member of the club. His friend, the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, described him as being \\"equally at home in the hunting field and the parish church\\". He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Cheshire in 1825, was an officer in the Royal Cheshire Militia and in the Cheshire Yeomanry, served as a Justice of the Peace, and was High Sheriff of Cheshire for 1833. His poetry, usually on the subjects of hunting and country life, was light-hearted and popular. In 1834 he published his Hunting Songs, which ran to eight editions. Titles of the songs include \\"A Good Merry Gallop for Me!\\" and \\"Farmer Dobbin\\". His nine-stanza poem \\"Quaesitum meritis\\" is considered to be his best work. He created signposts on his estate with rhyming inscriptions, some of which are still present. He also published more serious documents about the cattle plague of 1747‚Äì49. Lord Halifax referred to him as \\"a perfect combination, a good churchman, a good landlord, a keen sportsman, and a man of literary tastes\\". In his 1885 book Hunting, the Duke of Beaufort described Warburton as 'that Homer of the hunting-field'. He also wrote a couplet as an epitaph for the headstone of Copenhagen, the war horse ridden at the Battle of Waterloo by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. The couplet, \\"God's humbler instrument, though meaner clay, should share the glory of that glorious day,\\" was written at the request of the 2nd Duke, when he erected a tombstone for his father's famous horse on his grave at Strathfield Saye. The first Duke would have approved of the choice of poet, since he, like Egerton-Warburton, was a keen sportsman, and in fact, the Duke had often hunted on Copenhagen when the two of them were in the Peninsula. Rebuilding of Arley Hall South front of Arley Hall When Egerton-Warburton took over the estate, the hall was \\"dilapidated and swarming with rats\\", and so he decided to replace it completely. He took great interest in the design of the new house and chapel, and his ideas reflected respectively his artistic and his religious values. In respect of the house, he was influenced by the spirit of the Romantic movement. He also wanted the new house to reflect his ancient lineage: \\"to suggest something of the pity of the Middle Ages as well as the grandeur of Elizabethan England\\". He therefore rejected the neoclassical style of architecture, which was fashionable at the time, and chose instead to build a house in what is now known as Jacobethan style. He also wanted it to incorporate modern technology and materials in its construction, and he did not want it to be too expensive. He commissioned a young local architect, George Latham from Nantwich, and worked closely with him in the design. Latham suggested that the final cost would be in the region of ¬£5,000‚Äì6,000 (¬£‚Äì¬£ today). It was agreed that every architectural feature of the house should have an exact model in an existing Elizabethan building. Egerton-Warburton and Latham travelled together and visited such buildings to study these features. The first phase of building started in 1832, and the east, north and west wings of the old house were demolished. Most of the new building in this phase consisted of servants' quarters and utility rooms. A drawing room, grand staircase and hall were built but they were left unfinished. Modern plumbing was fitted, the structure of the house was raised on arches to reduce the effect of damp, and the spaces under the arches were ventilated and warmed by a patent device. This phase was completed in 1835 at a cost of about ¬£13,000 (¬£ today). Egerton-Warburton then took a break, partly to raise the money needed for the completion of the house, and also to work on the designs of the remaining rooms. The second and final phase was built between 1840 and 1845. The south front was demolished and the building, much of which is present today, was finished. The final cost of the house came to about ¬£30,000 (¬£ today). Herbaceous border In designing the chapel, he again broke away from the classical style of architecture. Having been influenced by the Oxford Movement, he decided that it should be designed in Gothic style. He commissioned the nationally famous architect Anthony Salvin to design a Gothic Revival chapel, which was completed and consecrated in 1845. In 1856‚Äì57, a north aisle and porch were added to a design by George Street. When Egerton- Warburton took over the estate, the gardens were mainly to the east of the hall, but with his wife, Mary, he designed new gardens. These were developed to the southwest of the hall between 1840 and 1860. They implemented their designs apparently without any professional help, and the present gardens are largely the result of their planning. The herbaceous border was one of the first of its type to have been created in England. Items they planted which are still present include the yew finials in the herbaceous border, which were planted in 1856, and the holly oak cylinders in the Ilex Walk, which were also planted in the 1850s. Family and later life Egerton-Warburton was the eldest child of ten; he had four brothers and five sisters. His younger brother, James Francis, who was born in 1807, graduated MA and became the rector of Warburton. Henry William was born in 1808, and became a major in the 47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot. Peter, born in 1813, worked with the East India Company before moving to Australia, where he achieved some notoriety as an explorer. Retrieved on 29 January 2009. The youngest brother, George Edward was born in 1819. He also emigrated and established a farm in Western Australia. Egerton-Warburton's sisters were Emma (born 1805), Frances Mary (1809), Maria Sybilla (1812), Charlotte (1815), and Sophia (1816). On 7 April 1831 Egerton-Warburton married Mary Brooke, the eldest daughter of Sir Richard Brooke, 6th baronet of Norton Priory. They had three children, Mary Alice, Piers (later MP for Mid Cheshire), and Mary. His wife died in 1881 and his younger daughter and her family moved in to live with him. By 1874 he was suffering from glaucoma, and soon afterwards became blind. He continued to take walks, led on a leather strap by his gardener. He had a path, Furlong Walk, constructed from the terrace at the hall with wire to guide him. His health began to fail from 1888 and he died in 1891 at the age of 87. He was buried in the family vault at Great Budworth church. His estate amounted to a little over ¬£51,670 (¬£ today).

Mailman (born 30 June 1932 in New York City died 18 April 2000 in Denton, Texas) was an American composer noted for his music for orchestra, chorus, multimedia, and winds. Biography Dr. Martin Mailman was born in New York City on June 30, 1932. He studied composition at the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester earning a bachelor's degree in music composition in 1954, a master's degree in music composition in 1955, and a PhD in music composition in 1960. His teachers at Eastman included Louis Mennini, Wayne Barlow, Bernard Rogers, and Howard Hanson. He served for two years in the United States Navy, and he was among the first group of young contemporary American composers chosen in 1959 to participate in The Young Composers Project, sponsored by the Ford Foundation and the National Music Council. As a result, he spent two years teaching in the schools of Jacksonville, Florida. From 1961 to 1966, he served as the first Composer in Residence at East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina. From 1966 until 2000, he was Composer in Residence, Coordinator of Composition, and later, Regents Professor at the University of North Texas College of Music in Denton, Texas. In November 2000, the University of North Texas Board of Regents awarded Emeritus status to Dr. Mailman posthumously. Dr. Mailman received numerous awards, among which include two American Bandmasters Association/Ostwald Awards for composition, the National Band Association/Band Mans Company prize for composition, the Edward Benjamin Award, Composer of the Year by the Texas Music Teachers Association, and the 1982 Queen Marie-Jose Prize for composition for his Concerto for Violin and Orchestra (Variations), Op. 68. His works include chamber music, band, choral, and orchestral music, film scores, television music, an opera, and a requiem for chorus, orchestra, and soloist. A frequently sought-after clinician and teacher, Dr. Mailman served as guest conductor-composer at more than ninety colleges and universities across the United States and Europe. He was a leader in promoting comprehensive musicianship programs through MENC throughout his career and gave presentations at conventions and schools across the country. Instead of featuring his own music, he always focused on music in general and the impact it has on students and professionals alike. He was particularly intrigued by the compositional process and the concept of music as \\"organized sound over time with intent.\\" Dr. Mailman‚Äôs musical holdings are now handled by his son, Dr. Matthew Mailman, Professor of Conducting in the Wanda L. Bass School of Music at Oklahoma City University. Martin Mailman‚Äôs widow, Mary Nan Mailman (1929-2016), established two endowed scholarships in his name: The Martin Mailman Excellence in Band Endowed Scholarship in the Wanda L.

Development The Sportster began development while Rearwin was still certifying the previous model: the Rearwin Speedster. The Speedster had been designed for performance, so the company focused on another, more basic, model to provide reliable income. This model was to become the Sportster, with design work beginning in 1934. As the Rearwin company was occupied trying to certify the Speedster, initial work was contracted out to Henry Weeks of Stevenson-Weeks Air Service. The resulting design first flew on April 30, 1935. The design of the Rearwin Speedster bore a coincidental resemblance to the competing Porterfield Flyabout. The Flyabout had started as the Wyandotte Pup, designed by engineer Noel Hockaday and built by students at Wyandotte High School. Ed Porterfield had seen the finished design, bought the rights to it, started the Porterfield company to build it, and hired Hockaday to develop the plane into the Flyabout. Hockaday had previously assisted engineer Douglas Webber at American Eagle Aircraft Corporation, both of whom later moved to Rearwin Aircraft. Their influence at Rearwin resulted in design elements that were used in the Sportster, thus resembling the Hockaday-designed Flyabout. In 1936, the Sportster was certified to take pontoons at the request of George B. Cluett. This required enlarging the vertical tail after the test aircraft nearly failed to recover from a flat spin. The final modifications to the Sportster occurred in 1939 to reinvigorate sales. The demands of World War II forced production of the Sportster to cease in 1941. Design The Sportster was a two-seat braced high-wing cabin monoplane. The pilot and passenger were seated in tandem. Both seats had flight controls, but only the pilot had an instrument panel. The conventional landing gear used a fixed tail-skid instead of tailwheel and came without brakes at first, although a tailwheel and brakes were later offered as options. Skis and pontoons were also available options, although the Sportster's vertical tail had to be enlarged to maintain its spin certification in case pontoons were fitted. A Deluxe model included wheel pants, navigation lights, radio, and optional skylights; later modifications to the design included a one-piece windshield. Initial versions of the Sportster were powered by a 5-cylinder LeBlond radial engine of 70-85 hp. The third model of the Sportster offered either the Warner Scarab or LeBlond radial engine (renamed as a Ken-Royce engine when Rearwin bought that company). Both produced 90 hp. Initially the engine was left uncovered but Townend rings and a propeller spinner were an option on the Deluxe model; a 1939 redesign introduced the streamlined NACA cowling. Range was about 500 miles for all versions. Variants 1936 Rearwin 7000 All Deluxe models were updated in 1939 to offer NACA cowling, one-piece windshield, and improved cooling. ;Rearwin Sportster 7000 :Initial production variant of 1935-1936 powered by either a 70hp (52kW) LeBlond 5DE or LeBlond 5E radial engine, 75 built.

Syrian literature has been influenced by the Arabic literatures of other countries, by French literature and by the country's political history. From early times to 1948 Under Ottoman rule, literary production was subjected to censorship. In the second half of the nineteenth century and the early twentieth, aspiring Syrian writers often chose emigration, moving primarily to Egypt‚Äîwhere they contributed to al-Nahda, the renaissance of Arabic literature‚Äîand to the United States, developing Syrian literature from abroad. From 1920 to 1946, while Syria was under French rule, French Romantic influences inspired Syrian authors, many of whom turned away from the traditional models of Arabic poetry. From 1948 to the present day In 1948, the partitioning of neighbouring Palestine and the establishment of Israel brought about a new turning point in Syrian writing. Adab al-Iltizam, the \\"literature of political commitment\\", deeply marked by social realism, mostly replaced the romantic trend of the previous decades. Hanna Mina, rejecting art for art's sake and confronting the social and political issues of his time, was one of the most prominent Syrian novelists of this era. Following the Six-Day War in 1967, Adab al-Naksa, the \\"literature of defeat\\", grappled with the causes of the Arab defeat. Baath Party rule, since the 1966 coup, has brought about renewed censorship. As Hanadi Al-Samman puts it, :\\"In the face of threats of persecution or imprisonment, most of Syria's writers had to make a choice between living a life of artistic freedom in exile-as do Nizar Kabbani, Ghada al-Samman, Hamida Na'na', Salim Barakat, and prominent poet, critic, and novelist 'Ali Ahmad Sa'id (Adonis)-or resorting to subversive modes of expression that seemingly comply with the demands of the authoritarian police state while undermining and questioning the legitimacy of its rule through subtle literary techniques and new genres\\". In this context, the genre of the historical novel, spearheaded by Nabil Sulayman, Fawwaz Haddad, Khyri al-Dhahabi and Nihad Siris, is sometimes used as a means of expressing dissent, critiquing the present through a depiction of the past. Syrian folk narrative, as a subgenre of historical fiction, is imbued with magical realism, and is also used as a means of veiled criticism of the present. Salim Barakat, a Syrian √©migr√© living in Sweden, is one of the leading figures of the genre. Contemporary Syrian literature also encompasses science fiction and futuristic utopiae (Nuhad Sharif, Talib Umran), which may also serve as media of dissent. Mohja Kahf has argued that literary dissent is typically expressed through the \\"poetics of Syrian silence\\": :\\"The nostalgic, moist-eyed silences of Ulfat Idilbi's narrative could not be more different from the chilling, cynical silences in Zakaria Tamer's stories. The impassioned lacunae in Nizar Kabbani's proclaim exactly what it is they are not saying explicitly, while the poet Muhammad al-Maghut's silence is sardonic, sneering both at the authorities and at himself, at the futility and absurdity of the human situation under authoritarian rule\\".

It was officially opened on 1 June 2006, and was named in honor of Joan Gamper, founder of the club. Located in Sant Joan Desp√≠ (Baix Llobregat, Province of Barcelona) to the west of central Barcelona and north of the city's airport, and covering 163.650 m¬≤, it is used since 2006 for youth team training and matches and since January 2009 for the first team training. It is also used by many of the other sports teams at the club including Basketball, Handball and Futsal who use facilities such as the multi-sports pavilion. Now that this facility is fully operational, all the youth teams that previously used the Camp Nou facilities, mainly the Mini Estadi and the Palau Blaugrana, train there. In 2019, the Johan Cruyff Stadium opened next to the Ciutat Esportiva to replace the Mini Estadi as a matchday venue for Barcelona B and Barcelona Femen√≠. The new Masia, residence opened in 2011 on the site. FC Barcelona's first team moved to this facility on 19 January 2009. This brought to an end a 30-year history that the first team had of training on the small pitch (known as the La Masia pitch) annexed to the Camp Nou. The first team facilities are the same as those at the Camp Nou and at the start of the 2009/2010 season it included a full pool and saunas for player recuperation. By 2011 a new residence was opened on site, housing the FC Barcelona's youth players who previously boarded at La Masia. This will include living space for around 85 players. The land occupied by the Ciutat Esportiva was purchased by the club in 1989 and is just 4.5 km away from the Camp Nou and is directly connected by the road between Barcelona and Sant Joan Desp√≠. The Ciutat Esportiva eventually cost 68 million euros, of which 25.6 corresponded to urbanization and 42.5 to the total construction costs. The club sold two plots of land, the first on 21 June 2002 and the second on 20 February 2003, for values of 29.7 and 15.9 million euros, respectively to cover part of the costs of the operation. The rest of the money was invested directly by the club, an amount of 22.5 million euros.

He was only the second awardee of the Member's Cross of the House Order of Hohenzollern. Early life and service Festner was born in Holzkirchen, Kingdom of Bavaria, on 30 June 1894. He originally served with, and was wounded with, the infantry before switching to aviation.The Aerodrome website's page on Festner http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/festner.php Retrieved on 15 April 2010. He was a mechanic with Flieger Abtleilung Nr. 1 in October 1914. Posted to FA 7b in February 1915 as a Gefreiter, Festner learned to fly unofficially, and then underwent training with FEA 2b and FEA 5b.Franks et al 1993, pp. 105‚Äì106. He served briefly with two seater units FA 18 and FA 5b, arriving at FA 18 on 10 September 1916 and FA 5b five days later. His next posting was to Jasta 11 on 10 November 1916. Under the command of Manfred von Richthofen, Festner quickly claimed 2 victories in February 1917 (A BE-2 on 5 February and a FE-8 of No.40 Squadron on 16 February) before claiming another 10 during 'Bloody April'.  'Bloody April'  A combat with No. 57 Squadron RFC Royal Aircraft Factory FE.2d's over Neuville There are several places called Neuville, and it is unclear where this combat took place. No. 57 Squadron was based at Fienvillers in April 2017, and the nearest places called Neuville to there seem to be Neuville-au-Bois and Neuville-l√®s-Loeuilly. on 2 April 1917 resulted in Festner claiming a FE-2d (Lt. H.P. Sworder, KIA & 2/Lt. A.H. Margoliouth, POW). On 5 April, during a combat between five Jasta 11 aircraft and six aircraft of No. 48 Squadron RFC, he forced down in captivity the Bristol F.2 Fighter of Captain Leefe Robinson, a Victoria Cross holder, holing his engine: his observer, 2/Lt. E.D. Warburton, was also captured. A Nieuport 17 of No. 60 Squadron was also claimed, but not credited, on 5 April (possibly Lt. E.J.D. Townsend, POW ). A 'Sopwith' was claimed on 7 April (actually a Bristol Fighter of No. 48 Sqn which force-landed with a dead observer) while on 8 April Festner himself force-landed his Albatros D.II (serial 223/16) with a cracked wing spar,Franks et al 1995, p. 30. which occurred while in combat with Nieuport 17s of No. 60 Squadron RFC, including future ace Lt. William 'Billy' Bishop.McCaffery 1988, p. 94. Von Richthofen had the damaged fighter written off strength. Festner shot down a BE-2d of 13 Sqn. RFC, ( Lt. E.R. Gunner, WIA & Lt. C. Curtiss) on 11 April, while on 13 April Jasta 11, Festner included, shot down an entire six-aircraft flight of Royal Aircraft Factory RE.8s from No. 59 Squadron RFC, Festner accounting for the RE-8 of Lt. A. Watson & 2/Lt. E.P. Law (both POW). He later claimed a FE-2b of No. 25 Squadron (Sgt. J. Dempsey KIA & 2/Lt. W.H. Green, POW). A Nieuport 17 of No. 60 Squadron was claimed both on 14 April (2/Lt. L.C. Chapman KIA) and 16 April 1917 (Lt. T. Langwill KIA). On 23 April 1917, having previously won both classes of the Iron Cross, Sebastian Festner became only the second recipient of the Member's Cross with Swords of the House Order of Hohenzollern.  Death in action  Flying Albatros D.III (serial 2251/17), Festner was killed in action on 25 April 1917, near Oppy. Exact details are unknown; he was either struck by ground fire, suffered a broken propeller, or shot down attacking a Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter crewed by Lt. C. R. O'Brien & gunner 2/Lt. J. L. Dickson of No. 43 Squadron RFC, who claimed a red Albatros as their 3rd and 2nd victories respectively. Festner crashed behind the British lines, between Gavrelle and Bailleul. With the area under German artillery fire, there was no attempt to recover either plane or body. Festner was therefore declared missing in action with no known grave.

Kenton conceived the idea out of concern that education of jazz and all its forms were not reaching teenagers who showed signs of interest in it. He strongly felt that the survival of jazz depended heavily on the ability of leaders and artists in jazz community to educate a younger generation. Development of the Clinics Dr. Gene Hall and Leon Breeden, both of North Texas State University, played a major role in helping Kenton develop the clinics. The first clinic was in 1959, held at Indiana University under the auspices of the National Stage Band Camp. Struck by the serious responsibility and encouraged by his first camp, Kenton, in 1960, sent a trunk load of original big band scores culled from his library to North Texas for use as teaching aids. We definitely have a serious responsibility that must be dealt with.Stan Kenton, _International Musician_ (1960) In 1961, two Kenton added two locations, one at Michigan State University and one at Southern Methodist University. Clinicians, Kenton included, received no salary, only room and board. In the beginning the Kenton Band would play dances and concerts in the nearby area each night of the clinic. By the late 60s the band members themselves became a more integral part of the day to day experience of the clinics. In 1967, Kenton separated his activities from the National Stage Band Camp, renaming it the Stan Kenton Band Clinics. The first clinics (the word camp was abandoned as being not academic enough) were held at University of Redlands and San Jose State University with faculty that included Henry Mancini, Shelly Manne, Pete Rugolo, Bill Holman, Bill Perkins and Bud Shank. In the 1970s Hank Levy, Ken Hanna, Lou Marini, Tom Ferguson and Dan Haerle were among the faculty.Terry Vosbeinm, liner notes from Horns Of Plenty, Volume 3, Tantara Records By 1975, Kenton was conducting over 100 clinics a year, as well as four week-long summer clinics on college campuses.

A smiling young man, hiding in the bushes on the left, watches her from a vantage point that allows him to see up into her billowing dress, where his arm is pointed with hat in hand. A smiling older man, who is nearly hidden in the shadows on the right, propels the swing with a pair of ropes. The older man appears to be unaware of the young man. As the young lady swings high, she throws her left leg up, allowing her dainty shoe to fly through the air. The lady is wearing a berg√®re hat (shepherdess hat). Two statues are present, one of a putto, who watches from above the young man on the left with its finger in front of its lips in a sign of silence, the other of pair of putti, who watch from beside the older man, on the right. There is a small dog shown barking in the lower right hand corner, in front of the older man. According to the memoirs of the dramatist Charles Coll√©, a courtier (homme de la cour) Although his identity was not unveiled by Coll√©, it has been thought that it was Marie-Fran√ßois- David Bollioud de Saint-Julien, baron of Argental (1713‚Äì1788), best known as Baron de Saint-Julien, the then Receiver General of the French Clergy. However there is little evidence for this, according to Ingamells, 163-164. first asked Gabriel Fran√ßois Doyen to make this painting of him and his mistress. Not comfortable with this frivolous work, Doyen refused and passed on the commission to Fragonard. The man had requested a portrait of his mistress seated on a swing being pushed by a bishop, but Fragonard painted a layman. This style of \\"frivolous\\" painting soon became the target of the philosophers of the Enlightenment, who demanded a more serious art which would show the nobility of man.Fragonard, The Swing. khanacademy.org. Retrieved 17 December 2016. Provenance The Swing (centre), as displayed at the Wallace Collection, London. The original owner remains unclear. A firm provenance begins only with the tax farmer Marie-Fran√ßois M√©nage de Pressigny, who was guillotined in 1794, after which it was seized by the revolutionary government. It was possibly later owned by the marquis des Razins de Saint- Marc, and certainly by the duc de Morny. After his death in 1865, it was bought at auction in Paris by Lord Hertford, the main founder of the Wallace Collection.Ingamells, 165 Notable copies There are two notable copies, neither by Fragonard. * One copy, once owned by Edmond James de Rothschild, portrays the woman in a blue dress. * The other is a smaller version (56 √ó 46 cm), owned by Duke Jules de Polignac. This painting became the property of the Grimaldi family in 1930 when Pierre de Polignac (1895-1964) married Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois (1898-1977). In 1966, the Grimaldi & Labeyrie Collection gave it to the city of Versailles, where it is currently exhibited at the Mus√©e Lambinet, attributed to Fragonard's workshop.

Contrary to the original painting, the lady is facing right and has plumes on her hat (among other dissimilarities) because it was drawn after the replica owned by Edmond de Rothschild. * 1920: The poem \\"Portrait of a Lady\\" by William Carlos Williams is believed to reference Fragonard's work and this painting in particular. * 1999: The first act of the ballet Contact: The Musical by Susan Stroman and John Weidman is described as a \\"contact improvisation\\" on the painting. * 2001: The Swing (after Fragonard), a headless lifesize recreation of Fragonard's model clothed in African fabric, by Yinka Shonibare *2013: The animated Disney film Frozen displays a version of The Swing in a scene when lead character Anna dances through an art gallery singing \\"For the First Time in Forever.\\" Notes References *Ingamells, John, The Wallace Collection, Catalogue of Pictures, Vol III, French before 1815, Wallace Collection, 1989, * External links * The painting at the Wallace Collection website * The Swing - Analysis and Critical Reception 1767 paintings Erotic art Rococo paintings Paintings by Jean-Honor√© Fragonard Paintings of the Wallace Collection Paintings of Cupid ","title":"The Swing (Fragonard)"},{"id":"21145951","text":"Szczepankowo is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Ostror√≥g, within Szamotu≈Çy County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, in west-central Poland.

Kalidasa [Kumarasambhava, VI] refers to Gandhamadana, in the vicinity of the mythical city of Osadhiprastha in Himalaya Mountain, having Santanaka trees. Nath tradition holds that Parashurama, after enacting his vengeance, sought out Dattatreya atop Mount Gandhamadana for spiritual guidance. Their conversations gave rise to Tripura Rahasya, a treatise on Advaita Vedanta. It was here the deity instructed the warrior-sage on knowledge of scripture, renunciation of worldly activities, and non-duality, thus freeing Parashurama from the cycle of death and rebirth.

The ship was suspected of being involved in smuggling about morphine base into Turkey. The crew scuttled the ship during the operation. MV Kƒ±smetim-1 was owned by Osman Ayanoƒülu. The morphine base on the ship, worth millions of dollars, belonged to a consortium of himself and his partners including ≈ûeyhmus Da≈ü and H√ºseyin Bayba≈üin, all Turkish drug lords.  Voyage  MV Kƒ±smetim-1 departed on October 7, 1991 from the Port of Yarƒ±mca in ƒ∞zmit, Turkey, carrying dyestuff to Karachi, Pakistan. As the ship docked at the destination port, Celal Kambur, the ship's purser started a conversation with the port policeman Yousuf Chacha. The Pakistani policeman asked the Turkish crew member to deliver a package to Ajman, a port in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The package contained heroin at a price of US$1.00 per gram. Soon after leaving the Port of Karachi, the captain received a radio message saying that the ship's owner Osman Ayanoƒülu was ambushed and murdered. On the way to Port of Ajman before dawn, the captain ordered to pickup goods from a motorboat on high sea, which docked the ship. More than 100 sacks were pulled up into the ship in the darkness. The captain told the crew that the sacks contained nuclear material for the MKE The ship arrived in Ajman to unload fertilizer. Celal Kambur met the Pakistani drug dealer and received the money in a restaurant. The delivery of the drug package took place at 23:00 local time the same day by throwing to a boat, which pulled alongside the ship. The next morning, police raid the ship and found the money of US$10,000 from the drug trade on Celal Kambur. He was tried and found guilty for the drug crime. The ship moored at the port for six months during the trial and was only allowed to leave as the trial ended, and Celal Kambur was put into prison. Celal Kambur served his heavy prison sentence and was pardoned after nine years by the emir of Ajman, one of the seven emirates of the UAE federation.  Operation  Since its departure from Karachi, the ship was under close surveillance by the United States DEA, which was forwarding all the relevant information to the Turkish Police. The incident in Ajman was very disappointing for the US and Turkish law enforcement services since they feared the main smuggle would have been revealed. Finally, the ship passed through the Suez Canal and sailed into the Mediterranean Sea. Three Turkish Navy warships, the frigate TCG Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m (F 243), the destroyer TCG Sava≈ütepe (D 348), the submarine rescue ship TCG Akƒ±n (A 585) and the US destroyer USS Briscoe (DD-977) carrying Turkish and US narcotic policemen as well as maritime patrol aircraft of type P-3 Orion deployed from Sicily intercepted the ship in high sea before she tried to escape to Cyprus, a country, which Turkey has no good international relations with. Following the four days lasting joint operation, the ship went down with all its load, the nine crew were rescued. The US and Turkish officials claimed that the crew deliberately sank the ship in order to prevent the capture of the drug load. The ship's crew denied this allegation before the court declaring that the ship sank due to rough sea. The operation was led on site by Necdet Menzir, director of Istanbul Police Department and Mestan ≈ûener, head of the narcotics bureau. Mehmet Aƒüar, director general of the Turkish Police and Ismet Sezgin, minister of interior, were in command of the operation.  Aftermath  ≈ûeyhmus Da≈ü was shot to death on December 25, 1992 in Istanbul in his car when he was on the way to a wedding ceremony along with his wife and two daughters. The killing occurred ten days after the Kƒ±smetim-1 incident and two weeks before the Lucky-S incident, another drug smuggling operation on the sea. Nejat Da≈ü, son of ≈ûeyhmus Da≈ü, who had carried out the drug trade negotiations in Karachi on behalf of his father, was tried at the 2nd State Security Court (DGM) in Istanbul and found guilty of drug trafficking. He was charged with 5 years and 10 months of heavy prison sentence. He escaped the prison on November 8, 1994, as he was brought from Sinop Fortress Prison to the 1st DGM in Istanbul for trial due to his involvement in the Lucky-S incident.

He was one of the founders of the modern study of the Tangut language of the mediaeval Xi Xia Empire, the work for which he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science in Philology during his life, and Lenin Prize posthumously. He spent most of his research career in Japan before returning to the USSR. He was arrested and executed during the Great Purge; his surviving manuscripts were published much later, starting in 1960.  Early life  He graduated from Rybinsk Gymnasium in 1909 with a silver medal, the second class of distinction, and entered the St Petersburg Institute of Technology. However, after a year, he transferred to the Department of Oriental Languages of the Saint Petersburg University, where he graduated in 1914. Among his teachers were Vasiliy Mikhaylovich Alekseyev and Aleksei Ivanovich Ivanov. In Japan In 1915, Nevsky was sent to Japan for two years, but the Russian Revolutions and the Russian Civil War made him remain there for fourteen years. In Japan, he travelled around the country, studying the Ainu language and the Ainu people as well as the Miyako language of the Miyako Islands and the Tsou language of the Tsou people of Taiwan (then part of the Japanese Empire). He published a number of research articles in Japanese journals. He started learning Miyako from a student named Ueunten Kenpu, who entered Tokyo Higher Normal School in 1919. He visited the Miyako Islands in 1922, 1926 and 1928. He invented a Cyrillization of Miyako; recorded Miyako's epic songs, called ƒÅgu and left an unpublished Miyako lexicon. In 1925, Nevsky began to decipher manuscripts in Tangut that had been discovered in 1909 in Khara-Khoto by Pyotr Kozlov. Return to Russia Persuaded by Soviet scholars and officials, Nevsky returned to Leningrad, renamed from St. Petersburg, in the autumn of 1929. He worked at the Leningrad State University, the Leningrad Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History; –ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç —Ñ–∏–ª–æ—Å–æ—Ñ–∏–∏, –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä—ã –∏ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏, the Institute of Oriental Studies (then based in Leningrad) and the Hermitage Museum.

Air inlet This article briefly describes the components and systems found in jet engines. Major components Basic components of a jet engine (Axial flow design) Major components of a turbojet including references to turbofans, turboprops and turboshafts: *Cold section: Air intake (inlet) ‚Äî For subsonic aircraft, the inlet is a duct which is required to ensure smooth airflow into the engine despite air approaching the inlet from directions other than straight ahead. This occurs on the ground from cross winds and in flight with aircraft pitch and yaw motions. The duct length is minimised to reduce drag and weight.\\"Trade-offs in jet inlet design\\" Andras Sobester Journal of Aircraft, Vol44 No3 May‚ÄìJune 2007 Air enters the compressor at about half the speed of sound so at flight speeds lower than this the flow will accelerate along the inlet and at higher flight speeds it will slow down. Thus the internal profile of the inlet has to accommodate both accelerating and diffusing flow without undue losses. For supersonic aircraft, the inlet has features such as cones and ramps to produce the most efficient series of shockwaves which form when supersonic flow slows down. The air slows down from the flight speed to subsonic velocity through the shockwaves, then to about half the speed of sound at the compressor through the subsonic part of the inlet. The particular system of shockwaves is chosen, with regard to many constraints such as cost and operational needs, to minimize losses which in turn maximizes the pressure recovery at the compressor.\\"Jet Propulsion for Aerospace Applications\\" 2nd edition, Walter J.hesse Nicholas V.S. MumfordPitman Publishing Corp 1964 p110 Compressor or fan ‚Äî The compressor is made up of stages. Each stage consists of rotating blades and stationary stators or vanes. As the air moves through the compressor, its pressure and temperature increase. The power to drive the compressor comes from the turbine (see below), as shaft torque and speed. Bypass ducts deliver the flow from the fan with minimum losses to the bypass propelling nozzle. Alternatively the fan flow may be mixed with the turbine exhaust before entering a single propelling nozzle. In another arrangement an afterburner may be installed between the mixer and nozzle. Shaft ‚Äî The shaft connects the turbine to the compressor, and runs most of the length of the engine. There may be as many as three concentric shafts, rotating at independent speeds, with as many sets of turbines and compressors. Cooling air for the turbines may flow through the shaft from the compressor. Diffuser section: - The diffuser slows down the compressor delivery air to reduce flow losses in the combustor. Slower air is also required to help stabilize the combustion flame and the higher static pressure improves the combustion efficiency.\\"Jet Propulsion for Aerospace Applications\\" 2nd edition, Walter J.hesse Nicholas V.S. MumfordPitman Publishing Corp 1964 p216 *Hot section: Combustor or combustion chamber ‚Äî Fuel is burned continuously after initially being ignited during the engine start. Turbine ‚Äî The turbine is a series of bladed discs that act like a windmill, extracting energy from the hot gases leaving the combustor. Some of this energy is used to drive the compressor. Turboprop, turboshaft and turbofan engines have additional turbine stages to drive a propeller, bypass fan or helicopter rotor. In a free turbine the turbine driving the compressor rotates independently of that which powers the propellor or helicopter rotor. Cooling air, bled from the compressor, may be used to cool the turbine blades, vanes and discs to allow higher turbine entry gas temperatures for the same turbine material temperatures. A blade with internal cooling as applied in the high-pressure turbine Afterburner or reheat (British) ‚Äî (mainly military) Produces extra thrust by burning fuel in the jetpipe. This reheating of the turbine exhaust gas raises the propelling nozzle entry temperature and exhaust velocity. The nozzle area is increased to accommodate the higher specific volume of the exhaust gas. This maintains the same airflow through the engine to ensure no change in its operating characteristics. Exhaust or nozzle ‚Äî Turbine exhaust gases pass through the propelling nozzle to produce a high velocity jet. The nozzle is usually convergent with a fixed flow area. Supersonic nozzle ‚Äî For high nozzle pressure ratios (Nozzle Entry Pressure/Ambient Pressure) a convergent- divergent (de Laval) nozzle is used. The expansion to atmospheric pressure and supersonic gas velocity continues downstream of the throat and produces more thrust. The various components named above have constraints on how they are put together to generate the most efficiency or performance. The performance and efficiency of an engine can never be taken in isolation; for example fuel/distance efficiency of a supersonic jet engine maximises at about Mach 2, whereas the drag for the vehicle carrying it is increasing as a square law and has much extra drag in the transonic region. The highest fuel efficiency for the overall vehicle is thus typically at Mach ~0.85. For the engine optimisation for its intended use, important here is air intake design, overall size, number of compressor stages (sets of blades), fuel type, number of exhaust stages, metallurgy of components, amount of bypass air used, where the bypass air is introduced, and many other factors. For instance, consider design of the air intake. =Air intakes= The air intake can be designed to be part of the fuselage of the aircraft (Corsair A-7, Dassault Mirage III, General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, nose located North American F-86 Sabre and Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21) or part of the nacelle (Grumman F-14 Tomcat, McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, Sukhoi Su-27, Sukhoi Su-57, Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, Boeing 737, 747, Airbus A380). Intakes are more commonly referred to as inlets in the U.S.A. Subsonic inlets Pitot intake operating modes Pitot inlets are used for subsonic aircraft. A pitot inlet is little more than a tube with an aerodynamic fairing around it. When an aircraft is not moving, and there is no wind, air approaches the intake from all directions: directly ahead, from the side, and from behind. At low airspeeds, the streamtube approaching the lip is larger in cross-section than the lip flow area, whereas at the intake design flight Mach number the two flow areas are equal. At high flight speeds the streamtube is smaller, with excess air spilling round the lip. Radiusing of the lip prevents flow separation and compressor inlet distortion at low speeds during crosswind operation and take- off rotation. Thin rounded intake lip Supersonic inlets Supersonic intakes exploit shock waves to decelerate the airflow to a subsonic condition at compressor entry. There are basically two forms of shock waves: # Normal shock waves lie perpendicular to the direction of the flow. These form sharp fronts and shock the flow to subsonic speeds. Microscopically the air molecules smash into the subsonic crowd of molecules like alpha rays. Normal shock waves tend to cause a large drop in stagnation pressure. Basically, the higher the supersonic entry Mach number to a normal shock wave, the lower the subsonic exit Mach number and the stronger the shock (i.e. the greater the loss in stagnation pressure across the shock wave). # Conical (3-dimensional) and oblique shock waves (2D) are angled rearwards, like the bow wave on a ship or boat, and radiate from a flow disturbance such as a cone or a ramp. For a given inlet Mach number, they are weaker than the equivalent normal shock wave and, although the flow slows down, it remains supersonic throughout. Conical and oblique shock waves turn the flow, which continues in the new direction, until another flow disturbance is encountered downstream. Note: Comments made regarding 3 dimensional conical shock waves, generally also apply to 2D oblique shock waves. A sharp-lipped version of the pitot intake, described above for subsonic applications, performs quite well at moderate supersonic flight speeds. A detached normal shock wave forms just ahead of the intake lip and 'shocks' the flow down to a subsonic velocity. However, as flight speed increases, the shock wave becomes stronger, causing a larger percentage decrease in stagnation pressure (i.e. poorer pressure recovery). An early US supersonic fighter, the F-100 Super Sabre, used such an intake. An unswept lip generate a shock wave, which is reflected multiple times in the inlet. The more reflections before the flow gets subsonic, the better pressure recovery More advanced supersonic intakes, excluding pitots: a) exploit a combination of conical shock wave/s and a normal shock wave to improve pressure recovery at high supersonic flight speeds. Conical shock wave/s are used to reduce the supersonic Mach number at entry to the normal shock wave, thereby reducing the resultant overall shock losses. b) have a design shock-on-lip flight Mach number, where the conical/oblique shock wave/s intercept the cowl lip, thus enabling the streamtube capture area to equal the intake lip area. However, below the shock-on-lip flight Mach number, the shock wave angle/s are less oblique, causing the streamline approaching the lip to be deflected by the presence of the cone/ramp. Consequently, the intake capture area is less than the intake lip area, which reduces the intake airflow. Depending on the airflow characteristics of the engine, it may be desirable to lower the ramp angle or move the cone rearwards to refocus the shockwaves onto the cowl lip to maximise intake airflow. c) are designed to have a normal shock in the ducting downstream of intake lip, so that the flow at compressor/fan entry is always subsonic. This intake is known as a mixed-compression inlet. However, two difficulties arise for these intakes: one occurs during engine throttling while the other occurs when the aircraft speed (or Mach) changes. If the engine is throttled back, there is a reduction in the corrected (or non- dimensional) airflow of the LP compressor/fan, but (at supersonic conditions) the corrected airflow at the intake lip remains constant, because it is determined by the flight Mach number and intake incidence/yaw. This discontinuity is overcome by the normal shock moving to a lower cross- sectional area in the ducting, to decrease the Mach number at entry to the shockwave. This weakens the shockwave, improving the overall intake pressure recovery. So, the absolute airflow stays constant, whilst the corrected airflow at compressor entry falls (because of a higher entry pressure). Excess intake airflow may also be dumped overboard or into the exhaust system, to prevent the conical/oblique shock waves being disturbed by the normal shock being forced too far forward by engine throttling. The second difficulty occurs when the aircraft Mach number changes. The airflow has to be the same at the intake lip, at the throat and at the engine. This statement is a consequence the conservation of mass. However, the airflow is not generally the same when the aircraft's supersonic speed changes. This difficulty is known as the airflow matching problem which is solved by more complicated inlet designs than are typical of subsonic inlets. For example, to match airflow, a supersonic inlet throat can be made variable and some air can be bypassed around the engine and then pumped as secondary air by an ejector nozzle.enginehistory.org \\"How supersonic inlets work\\" J. Thomas Anderson Fig1 If the inlet flow is not match, it may become unstable with the normal shock wave in the throat suddenly moving forward beyond the lip, known as inlet unstart.enginehistory.org \\"How supersonic inlets work\\" J. Thomas Anderson Section 5.2 \\"Inlet operating map\\" Spillage drag is high and pressure recovery low with only a plane shock wave in place of the normal set of oblique shock waves. In the SR-71 installation the engine would continue to run although afterburner blowout sometimes occurred.\\"SR-71 Revealed The Inside Story\\" Richard H. Graham, Col USAF (Ret) p56 =Inlet cone= Many second generation supersonic fighter aircraft featured an inlet cone, which was used to form the conical shock wave. This type of inlet cone is clearly seen at the very front of the English Electric Lightning and MiG-21 aircraft, for example. The same approach can be used for air intakes mounted at the side of the fuselage, where a half cone serves the same purpose with a semicircular air intake, as seen on the F-104 Starfighter and BAC TSR-2. Some intakes are biconic; that is they feature two conical surfaces: the first cone is supplemented by a second, less oblique, conical surface, which generates an extra conical shockwave, radiating from the junction between the two cones. A biconic intake is usually more efficient than the equivalent conical intake, because the entry Mach number to the normal shock is reduced by the presence of the second conical shock wave. The intake on the SR-71 had a translating conical spike which controlled the shock wave positions to give maximum pressure recovery.enginehistory.org \\"How supersonic inlets work\\" J. Thomas Anderson Section 4.3 \\"Spike translation\\" =Inlet ramp= An alternative to the conical intake involves angling the intake so that one of its edges forms a ramp. An oblique shockwave will form at the start of the ramp. The Century Series of US jets featured several variants of this approach, usually with the ramp at the outer vertical edge of the intake, which was then angled back inward towards the fuselage. Typical examples include the Republic F-105 Thunderchief and F-4 Phantom. This design is slightly inferior in pressure recovery to the conical intake, but at lower supersonic speeds, the difference in pressure recovery is not significant, and the smaller size and simplicity of the ramp design tend to make it the preferred choice for many supersonic aircraft. Concorde intake operating modes Later this evolved so that the ramp was at the top horizontal edge rather than the outer vertical edge, with a pronounced angle downwards and rearwards. This design simplified the construction of intakes and allowed use of variable ramps to control airflow into the engine. Most designs since the early 1960s now feature this style of intake, for example the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, Panavia Tornado and Concorde. =Diverterless supersonic inlet= A diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) consists of a \\"bump\\" and a forward-swept inlet cowl, which work together to divert boundary layer airflow away from the aircraft's engine while compressing the air to slow it down from supersonic speed. The DSI can be used to replace conventional methods of controlling supersonic and boundary layer airflow. DSI's can be used to replace the intake ramp and inlet cone, which are more complex, heavy and expensive. =Compressors= Axial compressors The 17-stage axial compressor of the General Electric J79 Axial compressors rely on spinning blades that have aerofoil sections, similar to aeroplane wings. As with aeroplane wings in some conditions the blades can stall. If this happens, the airflow around the stalled compressor can reverse direction violently. Each design of a compressor has an associated operating map of airflow versus rotational speed for characteristics peculiar to that type (see compressor map). At a given throttle condition, the compressor operates somewhere along the steady state running line. Unfortunately, this operating line is displaced during transients. Many compressors are fitted with anti-stall systems in the form of bleed bands or variable geometry stators to decrease the likelihood of surge. Another method is to split the compressor into two or more units, operating on separate concentric shafts. Another design consideration is the average stage loading. This can be kept at a sensible level either by increasing the number of compression stages (more weight/cost) or the mean blade speed (more blade/disc stress). Although large flow compressors are usually all-axial, the rear stages on smaller units are too small to be robust. Consequently, these stages are often replaced by a single centrifugal unit. Very small flow compressors often employ two centrifugal compressors, connected in series. Although in isolation centrifugal compressors are capable of running at quite high pressure ratios (e.g. 10:1), impeller stress considerations limit the pressure ratio that can be employed in high overall pressure ratio engine cycles. Increasing overall pressure ratio implies raising the high-pressure compressor exit temperature. This implies a higher high-pressure shaft speed, to maintain the datum blade tip Mach number on the rear compressor stage. Stress considerations, however, may limit the shaft speed increase, causing the original compressor to throttle-back aerodynamically to a lower pressure ratio than datum. =Combustors= Combustion chamber GE J79 Flame fronts generally travel at just Mach 0.05, whereas airflows through jet engines are considerably faster than this. Combustors typically employ structures to give a sheltered combustion zone called a flame holder. Combustor configurations include can, annular, and can- annular. Great care must be taken to keep the flame burning in a moderately fast moving airstream, at all throttle conditions, as efficiently as possible. Since the turbine cannot withstand stoichiometric temperatures (a mixture ratio of around 15:1), some of the compressor air is used to quench the exit temperature of the combustor to an acceptable level (an overall mixture ratio of between 45:1 and 130:1 is usedThe Combustion Chamber ). Air used for combustion is considered to be primary airflow, while excess air used for cooling is called secondary airflow. The secondary airflow is ported through many small holes in the burner cans to create a blanket of cooler air to insulate the metal surfaces of the combustion can from the flame. If the metal were subjected to the direct flame for any length of time, it would eventually burn through. Rocket engines, being a non 'duct engine' have quite different combustor systems, and the mixture ratio is usually much closer to being stoichiometric in the main chamber. These engines generally lack flame holders and combustion occurs at much higher temperatures, there being no turbine downstream. However, liquid rocket engines frequently employ separate burners to power turbopumps, and these burners usually run far off stoichiometric so as to lower turbine temperatures in the pump. =Turbines= The 3-stage Turbine of the GE J79 Because a turbine expands from high to low pressure, there is no such thing as turbine surge or stall. The turbine needs fewer stages than the compressor, mainly because the higher inlet temperature reduces the deltaT/T (and thereby the pressure ratio) of the expansion process. The blades have more curvature and the gas stream velocities are higher. Designers must, however, prevent the turbine blades and vanes from melting in a very high temperature and stress environment. Consequently, bleed air extracted from the compression system is often used to cool the turbine blades/vanes internally. Other solutions are improved materials and/or special insulating coatings. The discs must be specially shaped to withstand the huge stresses imposed by the rotating blades. They take the form of impulse, reaction, or combination impulse-reaction shapes. Improved materials help to keep disc weight down. =Afterburners (reheat)= Turbofan fitted with afterburner Afterburners increase thrust for short periods by burning extra fuel in the jetpipe behind the engine. =Nozzle= Afterburner GE J79 The propelling nozzle converts a gas turbine or gas generator into a jet engine. Power available in the gas turbine exhaust is converted into a high speed propelling jet by the nozzle. The power is defined by typical gauge pressure and temperature values for a turbojet of and .\\"The Aircraft gas Turbine Engine and its operation\\" P&W; Oper. Instr. 200, December 1982 United Technologies Pratt and Whitney =Thrust reversers= These either consist of cups that swing across the end of the exhaust nozzle and deflect the jet thrust forwards (as in the DC-9), or they are two panels behind the cowling that slide backward and reverse only the fan thrust (the fan produces the majority of the thrust). Fan air redirection is performed by devices called \\"blocker doors\\" and \\"cascade vanes\\". This is the case on many large aircraft such as the 747, C-17, KC-10, etc. If you are on an aircraft and you hear the engines increasing in power after landing, it is usually because the thrust reversers are deployed. The engines are not actually spinning in reverse, as the term may lead you to believe. The reversers are used to slow the aircraft more quickly and reduce wear on the wheel brakes. =Cooling systems= All jet engines require high temperature gas for good efficiency, typically achieved by combusting hydrocarbon or hydrogen fuel. Combustion temperatures can be as high as 3500K (5841F) in rockets, far above the melting point of most materials, but normal airbreathing jet engines use rather lower temperatures. Cooling systems are employed to keep the temperature of the solid parts below the failure temperature. Air systems A complex air system is built into most turbine based jet engines, primarily to cool the turbine blades, vanes and discs. Air, bled from the compressor exit, passes around the combustor and is injected into the rim of the rotating turbine disc. The cooling air then passes through complex passages within the turbine blades. After removing heat from the blade material, the air (now fairly hot) is vented, via cooling holes, into the main gas stream. Cooling air for the turbine vanes undergoes a similar process. Cooling the leading edge of the blade can be difficult, because the pressure of the cooling air just inside the cooling hole may not be much different from that of the oncoming gas stream. One solution is to incorporate a cover plate on the disc. This acts as a centrifugal compressor to pressurize the cooling air before it enters the blade. Another solution is to use an ultra-efficient turbine rim seal to pressurize the area where the cooling air passes across to the rotating disc. Seals are used to prevent oil leakage, control air for cooling and prevent stray air flows into turbine cavities. A series of (e.g. labyrinth) seals allow a small flow of bleed air to wash the turbine disc to extract heat and, at the same time, pressurize the turbine rim seal, to prevent hot gases entering the inner part of the engine. Other types of seals are hydraulic, brush, carbon etc. Small quantities of compressor bleed air are also used to cool the shaft, turbine shrouds, etc. Some air is also used to keep the temperature of the combustion chamber walls below critical. This is done using primary and secondary airholes which allow a thin layer of air to cover the inner walls of the chamber preventing excessive heating. Exit temperature is dependent on the turbine upper temperature limit depending on the material. Reducing the temperature will also prevent thermal fatigue and hence failure. Accessories may also need their own cooling systems using air from the compressor or outside air. Air from compressor stages is also used for heating of the fan, airframe anti-icing and for cabin heat. Which stage is bled from depends on the atmospheric conditions at that altitude. =Fuel system= Apart from providing fuel to the engine, the fuel system is also used to control propeller speeds, compressor airflow and cool lubrication oil. Fuel is usually introduced by an atomized spray, the amount of which is controlled automatically depending on the rate of airflow. So the sequence of events for increasing thrust is, the throttle opens and fuel spray pressure is increased, increasing the amount of fuel being burned. This means that exhaust gases are hotter and so are ejected at higher acceleration, which means they exert higher forces and therefore increase the engine thrust directly. It also increases the energy extracted by the turbine which drives the compressor even faster and so there is an increase in air flowing into the engine as well. Obviously, it is the rate of the mass of the airflow that matters since it is the change in momentum (mass x velocity) that produces the force. However, density varies with altitude and hence inflow of mass will also vary with altitude, temperature etc. which means that throttle values will vary according to all these parameters without changing them manually. This is why fuel flow is controlled automatically. Usually there are 2 systems, one to control the pressure and the other to control the flow. The inputs are usually from pressure and temperature probes from the intake and at various points through the engine. Also throttle inputs, engine speed etc. are required. These affect the high pressure fuel pump. Fuel control unit (FCU) This element is something like a mechanical computer. It determines the output of the fuel pump by a system of valves which can change the pressure used to cause the pump stroke, thereby varying the amount of flow. Take the possibility of increased altitude where there will be reduced air intake pressure. In this case, the chamber within the FCU will expand which causes the spill valve to bleed more fuel. This causes the pump to deliver less fuel until the opposing chamber pressure is equivalent to the air pressure and the spill valve goes back to its position. When the throttle is opened, it releases i.e. lessens the pressure which lets the throttle valve fall. The pressure is transmitted (because of a back-pressure valve i.e. no air gaps in fuel flow) which closes the FCU spill valves (as they are commonly called) which then increases the pressure and causes a higher flow rate. The engine speed governor is used to prevent the engine from over-speeding. It has the capability of disregarding the FCU control. It does this by use of a diaphragm which senses the engine speed in terms of the centrifugal pressure caused by the rotating rotor of the pump. At a critical value, this diaphragm causes another spill valve to open and bleed away the fuel flow. There are other ways of controlling fuel flow for example with the dash-pot throttle lever. The throttle has a gear which meshes with the control valve (like a rack and pinion) causing it to slide along a cylinder which has ports at various positions. Moving the throttle and hence sliding the valve along the cylinder, opens and closes these ports as designed. There are actually 2 valves viz. the throttle and the control valve. The control valve is used to control pressure on one side of the throttle valve such that it gives the right opposition to the throttle control pressure. It does this by controlling the fuel outlet from within the cylinder. So for example, if the throttle valve is moved up to let more fuel in, it will mean that the throttle valve has moved into a position which allows more fuel to flow through and on the other side, the required pressure ports are opened to keep the pressure balance so that the throttle lever stays where it is. At initial acceleration, more fuel is required and the unit is adapted to allow more fuel to flow by opening other ports at a particular throttle position. Changes in pressure of outside air i.e. altitude, speed of aircraft etc. are sensed by an air capsule. =Propellant pump= Propellant pumps are usually present to raise the propellant pressure above the pressure in the combustion chamber so that the fuel can be injected. Fuel pumps are usually driven by the main shaft, via gearing. Turbopumps Turbopumps are centrifugal pumps which are spun by gas turbines and are used to raise the propellant pressure above the pressure in the combustion chamber so that it can be injected and burnt. Turbopumps are very commonly used with rockets, but ramjets and turbojets also have been known to use them. The drive gases for the turbopump is usually generated in separate chambers with off-stoichiometric combustion and the relatively small mass flow is dumped either through a special nozzle, or at a point in the main nozzle; both cause a small reduction in performance. In some cases (notably the Space Shuttle Main Engine) staged combustion is used, and the pump gas exhaust is returned into the main chamber where the combustion is completed and essentially no loss of performance due to pumping losses then occurs. Ramjet turbopumps use ram air expanding through a turbine. =Engine starting system= The fuel system as explained above is one of the two systems required for starting the engine. The other is the actual ignition of the air/fuel mixture in the chamber. Usually, an auxiliary power unit is used to start the engines. It has a starter motor which has a high torque transmitted to the compressor unit. When the optimum speed is reached, i.e. the flow of gas through the turbine is sufficient, the turbines take over. There are a number of different starting methods such as electric, hydraulic, pneumatic, etc. The electric starter works with gears and clutch plate linking the motor and the engine. The clutch is used to disengage when optimum speed is achieved. This is usually done automatically. The electric supply is used to start the motor as well as for ignition. The voltage is usually built up slowly as starter gains speed. Some military aircraft need to be started quicker than the electric method permits and hence they use other methods such as a cartridge turbine starter or \\"cart starter\\". This is an impulse turbine impacted by burning gases from a cartridge, usually created by igniting a solid propellant similar to gunpowder. It is geared to rotate the engine and also connected to an automatic disconnect system, or overrunning clutch. The cartridge is set alight electrically and used to turn the starter's turbine. Another turbine starter system is almost exactly like a little engine. Again the turbine is connected to the engine via gears. However, the turbine is turned by burning gases - usually the fuel is isopropyl nitrate (or sometimes Hydrazine) stored in a tank and sprayed into a combustion chamber. Again, it is ignited with a spark plug. Everything is electrically controlled, such as speed, etc. Most commercial aircraft and large military transport airplanes usually use what is called an auxiliary power unit (APU). It is normally a small gas turbine. Thus, one could say that using such an APU is using a small gas turbine to start a larger one. Low pressure (), high volume air from the compressor section of the APU is bled off through a system of pipes to the engines where it is directed into the starting system. This bleed air is directed into a mechanism to start the engine turning and begin pulling in air. The starter is usually an air turbine type, similar to the cartridge starter, but uses the APU's bleed air instead of the burning gases of the propellant cartridge. Most cart starters can also use APU air to turn them. When the rotating speed of the engine is sufficient to pull in enough air to support combustion, fuel is introduced and ignited. Once the engine ignites and reaches idle speed, the bleed air and ignition systems are shut off. The APUs on aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 can be seen at the extreme rear of the aircraft. This is the typical location for an APU on most commercial airliners although some may be within the wing root (Boeing 727) or the aft fuselage (DC-9/MD80) as examples and some military transports carry their APUs in one of the main landing gear pods (C-141). Some APUs are mounted on wheeled carts, so they can be towed and used on different aircraft. They are connected by a hose to the aircraft ducting, which includes a check valve to allow the APU air to flow into the aircraft, while not allowing the main engine's bleed air to exit through the duct. The APUs also provide enough power to keep the cabin lights, pressure and other systems on while the engines are off. The valves used to control the airflow are usually electrically controlled. They automatically close at a pre-determined speed. As part of the starting sequence on some engines, fuel is combined with the supplied air and burned instead of using just air. This usually produces more power per unit weight. Usually an APU is started by its own electric starter motor which is switched off at the proper speed automatically. When the main engine starts up and reaches the right conditions, this auxiliary unit is then switched off and disengages slowly. Hydraulic pumps can also be used to start some engines through gears. The pumps are electrically controlled on the ground. A variation of this is the APU installed in a Boeing F/A-18 Hornet; it is started by a hydraulic motor, which itself receives energy stored in an accumulator. This accumulator is recharged after the right engine is started and develops hydraulic pressure, or by a hand pump in the right hand main landing gear well. =Ignition= Usually there are two igniter plugs in different positions in the combustion system. A high voltage spark is used to ignite the gases. The voltage is stored up from a low voltage (usually 28 V DC) supply provided by the aircraft batteries. It builds up to the right value in the ignition exciters (similar to automotive ignition coils) and is then released as a high energy spark. Depending on various conditions, such as flying through heavy rainfall, the igniter continues to provide sparks to prevent combustion from failing if the flame inside goes out. Of course, in the event that the flame does go out, there must be provision to relight. There is a limit of altitude and air speed at which an engine can obtain a satisfactory relight. For example, the General Electric F404-400 uses one igniter for the combustor and one for the afterburner; the ignition system for the A/B incorporates an ultraviolet flame sensor to activate the igniter. Most modern ignition systems provide enough energy (20‚Äì40 kV) to be a lethal hazard should a person be in contact with the electrical lead when the system is activated, so team communication is vital when working on these systems. =Lubrication system= A lubrication system serves to ensure lubrication of the bearings and gears and to maintain sufficiently cool temperatures, mostly by eliminating friction. The lubricant can also be utilized to cool other parts such as walls and other structural members directly via targeted oil flows. The lubrication system also transports wear particles from the insides of the engine and flushes them through a filter to keep the oil and oil wetted components clean. The lubricant is isolated from the external parts of the engine through various sealing mechanisms, which also prevent dirt and other foreign objects from contaminating the oil and from reaching the bearings, gears, and other moving parts, and typically flows in a loop (is not intentionally consumed through engine usage). The lubricant must be able to flow easily at relatively low temperatures and not disintegrate or break down at very high temperatures. Usually the lubrication system has subsystems that deal individually with the lubrication supply system of an engine, scavenging (oil return system), and a breather (venting excess air from internal compartments). The pressure system components are typically include an oil tank and de-aerator, main oil pump, main oil filter/filter bypass valve, pressure regulating valve (PRV), oil cooler/by pass valve and tubing/jets. Usually the flow is from the tank to the pump inlet and PRV, pumped to main oil filter or its bypass valve and oil cooler, then through some more filters to jets in the bearings. Using the PRV method of control, means that the pressure of the feed oil must be below a critical value (usually controlled by other valves which can leak out excess oil back to tank if it exceeds the critical value). The valve opens at a certain pressure and oil is kept moving at a constant rate into the bearing chamber. If the engine power setting increases, the pressure within the bearing chamber also typically increases, which means the pressure difference between the lubricant feed and the chamber reduces which could reduce flow rate of oil when it is needed even more. As a result, some PRVs can adjust their spring force values using this pressure change in the bearing chamber proportionally to keep the lubricant flow constant. =Control system= Most jet engines are controlled digitally using Full Authority Digital Electronics Control systems, however some systems use mechanical devices.

Oxford University Press US, , Amir Sultan Tarar was a Pakistan Army officer and special warfare operation specialist. He was a member of the Special Service Group (SSG) of the army, an intelligence officer of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and served as Pakistani Consul General at Herat, Afghanistan. A veteran of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, he is widely believed to have played a key role in the formation of the Taliban, after having helped train the Afghan Mujahidin on behalf of the United States in the 1980s. \\"Colonel Imam\\", as Tarar was also known, was a commando- guerrilla warfare specialist, and trained Mullah Omar and other Taliban factions and leaders. Colonel Imam remained active in Afghanistan's civil war until the 2001 United States led War on Terrorism, and supported the Taliban publicly through media. Tarar was kidnapped along with fellow ISI officer Khalid Khawaja, British journalist Asad Qureshi\\"No clue of Brit filmmaker kidnapped in Pak\\". The Gaea Times.

The Nation. 23 January 2011. Education and military career Amir Sultan Tarar was a graduate of Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Kakul (located near Abbottabad in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan), and of Fort Bragg, North Carolina, United States. After the graduation from Pakistan Military Academy, he joined the Pakistan Army's 15th Frontier Force Regiment as 2nd Lieutenant. Amir Sultan Tarar was sent to the United States in 1974, and was trained among with United States Army Special Forces. Upon his graduation from the Special Forces School, Amir Sultan Tarar was awarded American Green Beret by his training commander. Following his return to Pakistan, Amir Sultan Tarar joined the Special Service Group (SSG). In the 1980s, he participated in Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. Colonel Imam, as he became known, was increasingly involved in Afghanistan's politics even after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. After the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, Colonel Imam supported and trained Taliban fighters independently. It was alleged even in the 2000s that he still independently supported the Taliban independence movement in Afghanistan.Mission: Difficult By Rory Callinan/Tarin Kowt Thursday, January 24, 2008. Time. He was a disciple of Ameer Muhammad Akram Awan, the current sheikh of silsila Naqshbandia Owaisia. Relationships with United States After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Amir Sultan Tarar was invited to the White House by the then President George Herbert Walker Bush, and was given a piece of the Berlin Wall with a brass plaque inscribed: \\"To the one who dealt the first blow.\\" In the 2000s, Western intelligence agencies believed Colonel Imam was dead among a group of renegade officers from Pakistan's ISI who continued to help the Taliban after Pakistan turned against them following the attacks of September 11, 2001. Authentic knowledge about Amir Sultan Tarar Little is known of Amir Sultan Tarar's true history or operational profile as an agent of the ISI. Most information about 'Colonel Imam' was generated by his own admission, as well as news media speculation. Pakistan's secrecy over internal and external security, plus the code of conduct of Pakistan Armed Forces personnel serving in sensitive institutions, prevents such details from being available or verifiable. In 2010, however, Amir Sultan Tarar gave interviews to foreign and domestic journalists in Rawalpindi. Tarar's initial objective, after the Mujahedin infighting after Soviet withdrawal and before his involvement with Taliban, were unclear; his objectives at that time were just to find new friends for Pakistan from where to operate later, such as Akhaundzada of Helmand who had a blood feud with Hikmatyar and was a warlord with 17000 men under command. According to Colonel Imam's own claims, Soviets when in Afghanistan had put a 200 million Afghani bounty on him. He also claimed that, when he presented operational details to Aslam Baig after General Zia's death about anti-soviet struggle, the later was surprised as to the extent. In Cathey Schofield's book Inside Pakistan Army, Colonel Imam admitted meeting Osama Bin Laden in 1986. Kidnapping and execution In March 2010, Colonel Imam, former ISI officer Khalid Khawaja, journalist Asad Qureshi, and Qureshi's driver Rustman Khan were abducted by an unknown militant group which called itself Asian Tigers. Khawaja's body was found near a stream in Karam Kot in April 2010 with a note attached saying he was with the CIA and ISI, about seven kilometres south of North Waziristan's main town of Mirali. Qureshi and Khan were freed in September 2010. Colonel Imam was executed in captivity, as documented in a video released by Tehreek- i-Taliban Pakistan. Both the Haqqani network and the Afghan Taliban were purportedly against the execution.Unity among North Waziristan militant groups crumbles, Dawn, 28 Apr 2011 Colonel Imam's captors refused to release his body to his family unless a ransom was paid.

In the history of Reformed theology, there have been several examples of hypothetical universalist systems. Amyraldism is one of these, but hypothetical universalism as a whole is sometimes erroneously equated with it. Hypothetical universalism is sometimes believed to be outside the bounds of the Reformed tradition, but it has never been condemned by a Reformed council or symbol. History English hypothetical universalism was developed by John Preston, John Davenant, and James Ussher. This scheme teaches that God ineffectually decrees that all men be saved, but because God knows that some men will not have faith he makes an effectual decree to save those whom he predestines to salvation. Amyraldian hypothetical universalism, associated with John Cameron and Mo√Øse Amyraut, differs by asserting that God decrees the election of some to salvation logically subsequent to the decree to provide salvation through Christ. This represents a change to the traditional infralapsarian scheme of the logical order of God's decrees, where God's decree to save some was conceived of as logically preceding his decree to provide salvation. It is the same order as that advocated by Jacobus Arminius and his followers, though Amyraldians differed from Arminians by asserting that there are two phases to God's decree to save some. First, God decrees the salvation of all through Christ, but this decree is ineffectual because some people do not have faith. God then decrees that some will have faith and be saved.

History A scene from Pena (1910) after the death of Republican politician Dr. Miguel Bombarda It was created in 1564, and designated Sant'Ana by Cardinal Henry, King of Portugal, when the parish of Santa Justa was divided. Initially, the parish authority was localized in the Monastery of Sant'Ana (founded in 1561), but transferred to a building constructed by the brothers of the Santo Sacramento (after 25 March 1705): the Church of Nossa Senhora da Pena, along the Cal√ßada da Pena, when the parish name changed to Nossa Senhora da Penha. But, the 1755 Lisbon earthquake caused significant damage, and it was renovated by the middle of the 18th century, with recuperation completed in both the 18th and 19th centuries. Until 1763, the parish authority occupied several buildings, including a hermitage along the Travessa do Hospital, then at the Church of Nossa Senhora da Encarna√ß√£o e Carmo, along the Travessa das Recolhidas, and later to the chapel in the Palace of Mitelo (in the Largo do Pal√°cio do Mitelo). Geography The monument to Jos√© Tom√°s de Sousa Martins, physician and benefactor, in Jardim Braamcamp Freire The parish of Pena occupies one of the hilltops in Lisbon, namely Santana, which extends from Largo S√£o Domingos until Estef√¢nia and from Portas de Santo Ant√£o to Desterro. It is part of the historical quarter of Lisbon, and is encircled by the civil parishes of Santa Justa, Socorro, Anjos, S√£o Jorge de Arroios, Cora√ß√£o de Jesus and S√£o Jos√©. The centre of the parish is the Jardim Braamcamp Freire (), dedicated to the republican historian and archeologist, who directly opposed the British administration of William Beresford. After this period of Portuguese history the park was known as the Campo dos M√°rtires da P√°tria (dedicated to the martyrs of the fatherland), which was commonly referred to as the Campo de Santana until the 18th century.

Hughes The Times Thursday, May 13, 1954; pg. 8; Issue 52930; col E) was Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh from 1939 to 1950. Educated at Trinity College, Dublin,‚ÄúWho was Who‚Äù 1897-2007 London, A & C Black, 2007 he was an Inspector of Education for the Diocese of Dublin, Rector of RathfarnhamCrockford's Clerical Directory1940-41 Oxford, OUP,1941 and then Christ Church Leeson Park before ordination to the episcopate as the 10th bishop of the United Diocese. Albert Edward Hughes (13 February 1878 ‚Äì 11 May 1954) was the son of John and Margaret Hughes who are buried in the graveyard at Rathmolyon, County Meath. His siblings were Arthur Charles Hughes, William Henry Hughes, Anne Hughes, John Maddoc Hughes, Archibald Hughes, Charles Clement Hughes and Edith Elizabeth Hughes. Their births are registered in the Registry of Births at Ardrahan, Co Galway. He graduated from the old Royal University of Ireland in mathematics and mathematical physics in 1902 and afterwards entered Trinity College. He received the Divinity Testimonium in 1907 and took his MA degree in 1911, receiving the D.D. degree (jure dignatatis) in 1939. Following his ordination in 1907 he was appointed headmaster of Christ Church Cathedral Grammar School and curate of Drumcondra and North Strand where he remained until 1911. Afterwards he was curate and then Rector of Rathfarnham until 1921 when he became rector of the Mariners' Church, D√∫n Laoghaire, where he remained for three years. During the period 1907 to 1917 he was diocesan inspector of religious education in Dublin. From 1912 to 1919 he was a minor cannon of St Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral and in 1920-1921 he was chaplain to the Lord Lieutenant. In 1923 he was appointed rector of Christ Church, Leeson Park, Dublin and he spent the next 15 years of his ministry there until his election to the House of Bishops. (The Church of Ireland closed the church in Leeson Park in May 2005 because of reduced numbers attending the church. Since 1972 the church had been shared with the Methodist Centenary congregation, following the destruction of the Methodist Centenary Church, St Stephen's Green by fire a few years before. The intention was that the church would be used on Sundays and holy days by the Rumanian Orthodox church from June 2005 onwards.) In 1929 he was appointed a canon of Christ Church Cathedral and in 1933 he was appointed cannon and prebend of Dunlavin in St Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral, Dublin in room of Canon Thomas Arnold Harvey who had been elected Dean of St Patrick‚Äôs. While Rector of Christ Church, Leeson Park, he was also chaplain to the Molyneux Female Blind Asylum and in this, as in many other charitable works, he was an indefatigable worker and a first rate organiser. When his chaplaincy came to an end the trustees of the institution put on record their appreciation of the zealous manner in which Cannon Hughes had discharged the work of both chaplain and rector. On the death of Archbishop Day in 1938, Hughes became Bishop-elect of Armagh in order to complete the House of Bishops. When the Archbishop Gregg succeeded to the primacy and Bishop Barton, Bishop of Kilmore, became Archbishop of Dublin, Hughes became bishop of the vacant diocese of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh. He was consecrated in St Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral, Armagh on St Mark‚Äôs Day, 25 April 25, 1939. As a bishop he continued to show the same earnest and unfailing zeal in the carrying out of his episcopal duties that had characterised the earlier years of his ministry. His retirement on 12 May 1950 for health reasons was deeply regretted by the General Synod of the Church of Ireland. He was one of the best known and most popular men in the church and during the years when he ministered in Dublin, he made many friends, both clerical and lay and was admired and respected by all who knew him. Having been a teacher himself, he was keenly interested in education and on many occasions spoke effectively on the subject, both in the Dublin Synod and in the General Synod. In Dublin he was a member of the governing bodies of several schools and took a special interest in the work of the Incorporated Society for Promoting Protestant Schools in Ireland. His wide parochial experience and activities were an invaluable background when he was asked to assume the responsibilities of bishop. Throughout his life Hughes was a rugby football enthusiast. As a young man he had played for Surrey County and at one time was captain of the Dublin Wanderers‚Äô Club. Albert‚Äôs obituary describes him as ‚Äúa distinguished Churchman, a great Christian, a fine scholar and a notable organiser‚Äù. A portrait of Hughes is held by the National Portrait Gallery in London. It was painted by Lafayette (Lafayette Ltd) and is a vintage bromide print, circa 1920s measuring 5 3/4 in. x 3 7/8 in and was given to the National Portrait Gallery by Corporation of Church House, 1949. In 1911 Hughes married Marguerite Hall Baker. They had three children; Brian Hughes, John Derrick Watson Hughes and Hazel Hughes.

Miller and other liberal Democratic Party activists, inspired by Adlai Stevenson's presidential candidacy; they intended to organize the existing \\"Stevenson Clubs\\" into a grassroots movement to win back control of California State Government from the Republicans, who then held the Governor's office and both US Senate seats. According to the group's website, the organization, which coordinates the activities of Democratic clubs statewide, is the only one of its kind in the United States.CDC official website After Cranston, its founding President, CDC has also been headed by Joseph Wyatt, Tom Carvey, Simon Casady, Gerald Hill, John L. Burton (former State Senate President Pro Tem and Congressman, and former Chair of the official California Democratic Party organization), Nathan Holden, Wallace Albertson, Lia Triff Belli, Robert W. Farran, African-American leader Quincy Beaver, State Party Secretary Jim Clarke, DNC member Chris Stampolis, Henry Vandermeir, Emilie Gatfield, Hilary Crosby, and since November 2019, Iyad Afalqa, who is the Chair Emeritus of the CDP Arab American Caucus. President John F. Kennedy said: \\"I have always regarded the California Democratic Council as one of the United States‚Äô most important centers of citizen participation in politics.\\"Quoted without citation on the Democracy for America website In reality, Kennedy and his brother, Robert, were closely allied in California to the Los Angeles political organization of Jesse Unruh, the powerful Speaker of the State Assembly, who was considered the bete noire of the liberal organization. History The CDC \\"club movement\\" played an important role in the 1958 election of Governor Edmund G. \\"Pat\\" Brown and a slate of other State Democratic candidates (including Cranston as State Controller), the first Democratic administration in the State since the New Deal. In 1964, CDC endorsed the US Senate candidacy of its founding father, Alan Cranston, but he lost the Democratic nomination to former Kennedy Press Secretary Pierre Salinger - who was later defeated by George Murphy, the Republican nominee, in the General election. In 1966, the Council was bitterly split over the issue of American military entanglement in Vietnam. After a \\"horrendous struggle\\" in which Governor Brown and Cranston sided with a CDC faction that was more moderate in opposing the war policy of President Lyndon Johnson, both Brown and Cranston were booed and hissed at a CDC Convention. Cranston's sister later concluded that this rift with the Democratic leadership marked the beginning of CDC's decline.Eleanor Fowle, \\"Cranston, The Senator from California\\" (San Rafael, California, 1980) Two years later, CDC endorsed the anti-war presidential candidacy of Senator Eugene McCarthy over that of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who was supported by Unruh. Kennedy won the Democratic Primary, but was killed on the day of his victory. Later that year, Cranston was at last elected US Senator, remaining in office for the next 24 years. Though he had somewhat distanced himself from the Council, his election symbolized the height of \\"citizen participation\\" in Party politics. As of 2016, the CDC continued to provide support services freely to the California Democratic Party Caucuses, County Democratic Committees and Chartered Democratic Clubs of California. Currently numbering over 512 active organizations as listed on the CDC Main website under the Clubs/Organization Listing (currently under construction), ALL of these organizations are automatically members of the CDC and receive basic rights and services from the CDC. Organizations which choose to Affiliate with the CDC, receive additional services such as free websites, leadership training and increased delegate count at CDC meetings.

He was listed as tall and . Burnside grew up in Evanston, Illinois, rooting for the Chicago Cubs. He signed with the New York Giants out of high school, under the agreement that he could earn his degree at Dartmouth College while pitching in their minor league system. After a stint in the United States Army, Burnside made his major league debut in 1955, picking up his first win the same year and impressing Carl Hubbell, Giants' Hall of Fame pitcher and farm director. Injuries prevented Burnside's return to the big leagues until 1957, and he only won one of the 16 games he pitched for the Giants in 1957 and 1958. Acquired by the Detroit Tigers for 1959, Burnside spent the whole season in their bullpen that year. Getting a chance to start with the team in 1960, he had a career-high seven wins before being selected by the Washington Senators in the expansion draft. In 1961, the Senators used Burnside as a starter at the beginning of the year. He lost his rotation spot due to ineffective pitching, altered his delivery, and rejoined the starting rotation in September, throwing two shutouts. He started 1962 in their rotation again but lost his spot; though he set a career high with 20 starts, he also lost a career-high 11 games. He was traded to the Baltimore Orioles after the season, started 1963 in their bullpen, and was reacquired by the Senators following his release in May; however, he had a 6.15 earned run average for Washington. He went to Japan following the season, pitching two years with the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball before returning to Illinois to become a teacher and coach at New Trier High School, his alma mater. Early life Burnside was born July 2, 1930, in Evanston, Illinois. His father Robert, a salesman, married his mother, the former Helen Willits, six years before Burnside's birth‚Äîthe couple separated in the early 1930s. Burnside grew up a Chicago Cubs fan and often rode the Chicago \\"L\\" rapid transit system to Wrigley Field, where his favorite player was Larry French, who, like Burnside, threw left-handed. At New Trier High School in Winnetka, Burnside played basketball and baseball, helping the basketball team post a 13-3 record in his senior year and once throwing 19 straight scoreless innings for the baseball team. The Chicago Cubs gave him a tryout at Wrigley, but he ultimately decided to attend Dartmouth College, choosing not to sign with the Cubs as the minor league baseball season conflicted with the college schedule. However, the New York Giants also pursued him, on the advice of scout Tom Sheehan. Chub Feeney, the Giants' president, was a graduate of Dartmouth and worked out an agreement with Burnside under which the pitcher could wait until the spring semester was over to begin his seasons, allowing him to earn his degree. He signed with the Giants in 1949 but continued his education until 1952, at which point he graduated with a double-major in history and sociology. Career Burnside's professional career began in 1949 with the St. Cloud Rox of the Class C Northern League. He only pitched one game for them that year before being limited to throwing batting practice because of a back ailment. In 1950, he appeared in 12 games with the team, going 2‚Äì6 but posting a 10.07 earned run average (ERA), the product of 60 walks in only 42 innings of work. He pitched for two teams in 1951: four games for the Ottawa Giants of the Class AAA International League and 14 for the Knoxville Smokies of the Class B Tri-State League. With both of those teams, he had more walks than innings pitched, though his ERA was less than half what it had been the year before. In 1952, he made an appearance with the Minneapolis Millers of the Class AAA American Association-he walked seven and allowed three runs in two innings before getting reassigned to the Nashville Volunteers of the Class AA Southern Association. In nine games for Nashville, he had a 2-3 record and a 4.90 ERA‚Äîand then, with the Korean War going on, Burnside was drafted into the United States Army Medical Corps, ending his season. While in the military, Burnside continued his pitching, drawing national attention by striking out the first 17 batters of a game he pitched for the Hilltoppers, the baseball team for Fort Leonard Wood, in October 1953. He was discharged in 1954 and assigned to Minneapolis. Then, he was sent to Nashville in a trade between the minor league clubs, with Minneapolis receiving Alex Cosmidis. At Nashville again, Burnside had mixed success. He walked a lot of batters and had 16 home runs allowed in 97 innings but did win two games against the Atlanta Crackers (who had the best record in 1954) and was one of two Nashville pitchers to have a winning record. ‚Äú[Burnside] ha[s] the stuff, in bountiful quantity...it‚Äôs only a question of polish and control before [he] is ready to wear [a] Giants uniform‚Äù opined Joe King of the Sporting News. Burnside continued to hone his skills in winter ball, joining Giants' stars Willie Mays and Rub√©n G√≥mez in helping the Cangrejeros de Santurce win a pennant. Burnside attended spring training with the Giants in 1955 but was sent to the minors two weeks before the season began. \\"I‚Äôm happy about it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI want a chance to pitch regularly and I know I‚Äôll get it here.‚Äù His 1955 season in the Class AA Texas League, where he posted an 18‚Äì11 record, a 2.47 ERA, and a league-leading 235 strikeouts for the pennant-winning Dallas Eagles, earned him his first big-league call-up to the New York Giants in September. Carl Hubbell, Giants' Hall of Famer and Farm Director, said he was \\"the most promising pitcher in the chain.\\" He started two late-season games, both in doubleheaders. In his first, on September 20, he issued six bases on balls and allowed seven runs (only two of them earned) in 3 innings against the cellar- dwelling Pittsburgh Pirates. While the Giants' offense bailed him out‚ÄîBurnside departed the game with New York leading 11‚Äì7. His early exit kept him from claiming the victory in an eventual 14‚Äì8 Giants' triumph; that went to relief ace Hoyt Wilhelm. In his second start a week later, however, Burnside threw a complete game, seven-hitter, earning the win in a 5‚Äì2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. In spring training, 1956, Burnside suffered a pulled tendon in his left leg and was sent to Minneapolis shortly before the season began. Then, he broke his left foot and missed much of the first half of the Millers' season with various injuries. When he was healthy, he was not always effective. For example, he had a 1‚Äì7 record in his final eight decisions. In 22 games (19 starts), he had a 5‚Äì9 record, a 4.62 ERA, 71 strikeouts, and 50 walks in 113 innings. He was called up in September by the Giants but did not appear in any games. Burnside made the Giants out of spring training for the first time in 1957. He got his second (and last) victory in a Giant uniform April 23, when he threw a complete game, three-hit shutout to defeat the Pirates 1‚Äì0 at the Polo Grounds. He failed to get through the inning in three of his next four starts, then got sent to Minneapolis in May, though he was called up at the end of the month when the Giants hit a stretch of 15 games in 13 days. On June 2, he limited the Pirates to two runs in innings of the second game of a doubleheader but took the loss in a 2‚Äì0 defeat. He made three more starts, then was sent back to Minneapolis. Hubbell felt that he was trying too hard in the major leagues and that he did better with the Millers because he relaxed more. Indeed, Burside got off to an 8‚Äì0 start with the Millers, finishing 10‚Äì5 with a 2.47 ERA and 114 strikeouts in 131 innings. Again, he was called up by the Giants in September but did not appear in any games. In 10 games (nine starts) with the Giants, he had a 1‚Äì4 record, an 8.80 ERA, and 18 strikeouts in innings pitched. While Burnside did not have a great spring training in 1958, he was added to the Giants' first San Francisco roster because the team did not wish to expose him to waivers. In 1958, Burnside began throwing a new pitch: a sinker. He was used sparingly, only throwing 10 innings through June 4. That day, he entered a game against the Milwaukee Braves that the Giants led 7‚Äì4 with two outs in the ninth; Burnside relinquished a game-tying home run to Wes Covington in an eventual 10‚Äì9 loss. After that, he was sent to AAA, now the Phoenix Giants of the Pacific Coast League, to finish out the year. He threw three shutouts with Phoenix, posting an 11‚Äì7 record, a 3.91 ERA, and 113 strikeouts in 152 innings. With San Francisco, he had a 6.75 ERA in six games (one start). The Giants sold his contract to the Detroit Tigers on October 5, 1958. \\"He‚Äôs always had a good arm,‚Äù Tigers general manager John McHale said of the new acquisition. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had some good reports on Burnside. Several times he‚Äôs been on the verge of establishing himself in the major leagues.‚Äù Burnside entered 1959 with another new pitch, a screwball, which he had learned from teammate Marv Grissom in 1958 and practiced in winter ball over the offseason. For the first time in 1959, Burnside spent the whole season in the major leagues. Used exclusively in relief throughout the year, he had his best month in July, allowing only two earned runs in innings. In 30 games, he had a 1-3 record and a 3.77 ERA in 62 innings. Burnside competed for a spot in the Tiger rotation in 1960, did not get it, and was assigned to the bullpen to begin the year. On Opening Day, he entered in the 12th inning of a 2‚Äì2 tie with the Cleveland Indians and threw four scoreless innings, picking up the win in the 4‚Äì2 triumph. After posting a 2.16 ERA in his first seven games, he joined the rotation on the last day of May. He threw a complete game on July 9, allowing one run in a 6‚Äì1 victory over the Kansas City Athletics. In his next start, the second game of a doubleheader on July 17, he threw another complete game, limiting the New York Yankees to two runs in a 3‚Äì2 victory. After posting a 6.75 ERA through his first four August starts, he was moved back to the bullpen, making only one more start during the rest of the year (a game in which he was pulled after allowing the first three hitters to reach). In 31 games, 15 of which were starts, Burnside had a big-league personal best in victories (seven) to go along with an equal amount of losses. His ERA was 4.28, and he had 71 strikeouts in innings pitched. The American League expanded to 10 teams after the season, and the Tigers left Burnside unprotected for the expansion draft, allowing the Washington Senators to take him with the eighth overall pick. Used as a starter at the beginning of the year, Burnside suffered from inconsistency. In one of his better starts on May 12, he only allowed two hits in seven innings against the Boston Red Sox but allowed six walks and two runs and took the loss in a 2‚Äì1 defeat. Meanwhile, on June 7 against Cleveland, he left the game in the first inning after walking four of the first seven hitters. Moved to the bullpen in July, he continued to struggle, allowing all four batters he faced to reach (they all would score) on July 21 in a 16‚Äì5 loss to the Los Angeles Angels. Then, pitching coach Sid Hudson suggested Burnside shorten his stride on the mound, and Burnside improved enough to return to the rotation in September. Though his record was just 3‚Äì3 for the month, he had a 1.80 ERA and threw two shutouts, both coming against the Athletics: a five-hitter on the 16th and a two-hitter on the 29th. ‚ÄúHis improvement was sudden but [certain],‚Äù Ed Doherty, the Senators' general manager, had to say. ‚ÄúWhen he had those good days late in the season, there was not a better pitcher in the league.‚Äù In 33 games (16 starts), Burnside had a 4‚Äì9 record, a 4.53 ERA, ad 56 strikeouts in innings pitched. He and Bennie Daniels were projected to be the team's top two starters for 1962. On April 14, 1962, Burnside limited the Indians to four hits and two runs in a 5‚Äì2 victory, pitching a complete game that only lasted five innings because of rain. The team was in last place by May 23, when Burnside held the Angels to nine hits and went the distance in a 7-2 victory. He had a winning record (4‚Äì3) in his first nine starts of 1962, with a 3.45 ERA. After that, he lost seven of his last eight decisions, as well as his starting spot after August 8. He had an 8.18 ERA in August, allowing 16 runs in 12 innings in the three starts he made that month. He set career highs that year in starts (20), complete games (six), innings (), and strikeouts (74) but had a 4.45 ERA and set career highs in losses (11) and home runs allowed (20). On December 5, he and Bob Johnson were traded to the Baltimore Orioles for Marv Breeding, Art Quirk, and Barry Shetrone. Acquired by the Orioles to replace Billy Hoeft, Burnside was projected by Baltimore manager Billy Hitchcock to be another left-hander for the 1963 Oriole bullpen. He had a 4.91 ERA in five relief appearances for Baltimore through early May of , then drew his unconditional release on May 9. The Houston Colt .45's offered him a tryout, but Burnside re-signed with Washington on May 24, replacing Quirk (a pitcher), who had just been optioned to the minor leagues. He was used mostly in relief this time around, and only allowed one run in seven relief appearances in July. Gil Hodges, manager of the Senators, called Burnside ‚Äúa front-line reliever‚Äù in an article that appeared in the Sporting News in early September, but Burnside posted a 12.19 ERA that month, failing to record an out in either of his last two appearances. In 38 games with the Senators, he had an 0‚Äì1 record, a 6.15 ERA, and 23 strikeouts in innings pitched. After the 1963 season, the Senators were going to assign Burnside to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League; while Burnside did leave the United States after the season, he opted to pitch in Japan instead, signing a deal with the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball. He appeared in 29 games (19 starts) for Hanshin in 1964, posting a 5‚Äì8 record, a 3.36 ERA, and 47 strikeouts in 118 innings. The next year, he again won five games but lost 14, even though his ERA fell to 2.90 in 28 starts. That was his last professional season, as he returned to the United States to earn his master's degree. During his eight-season MLB career, Burnside lost 36 of 55 decisions (for a winning percentage of .345), and in 567 innings pitched he surrendered 607 hits and 230 bases on balls; he fanned 303. He threw 14 complete games and three shutouts and, as a reliever, registered seven saves. Later life Burnside met his future wife, Suzette Herbuveaux, while pitching for Phoenix in 1958. The couple was married before he went to Hanshin and had three children, a daughter and two younger sons. Following his baseball career, Burnside obtained his master's degree from Northwestern University, then returned to his high school alma mater, New Trier, where he was a teacher and coach from 1967 through 1993, when he retired. He was lifelong friends with former Senator teammate Don Zimmer.

Instead, it redeposited the funds to designated banks at interest. It took one-half percent of the interest to cover administrative expenses and passed on the rest‚Äîaround two percent‚Äîto the customer. Accounts in the system were initially limited to a balance of $500, which was raised to $1,000 in 1916 and to $2,500 in 1918. At its peak in 1947, the system held almost $3.4 billion in deposits. In addition to holding cash deposits, the system also sold fixed-term bonds and operated a Savings Card program. These cards provided spaces for a fixed number of postage stamps, each purchased for a few cents. Once filled, the cards could be presented for credit to a savings account in the system. From 1921, depositors were fingerprinted.\\"Postal Savings Depositors All to Be 'Fingerprinted'\\", \\"The New York Times\\", December 10, 1921 This was initially 'not to be associated with criminology' but in some instances the Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar radio show in the early 1950s suggests Postal Savings account fingerprints were used for positive identification in criminal cases. According to a 2019 analysis, \\"the program was initially used by non-farming immigrant populations for short-term saving, then as a safe haven during the Great Depression, and finally as long-term investment for the wealthy during the 1940s... Postal Savings was only a partial substitute for traditional banks, as locations with banks often still heavily used postal savings.\\" Decline The system originally had a natural advantage over deposit-taking private banks because the deposits were always backed by \\"the full faith and credit of the United States Government.\\" However, because the establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation gave a guarantee to depositors in private banks, the system lost its advantage in trust. The rise of United States Savings Bonds during and after World War II also drew funds away from the system. By the 1960s, with American banks fully recovered and more accepting of consumer deposits, the Postal Savings System was seen as redundant. The government passed legislation requiring it to stop accepting deposits on July 1, 1967, and to transfer remaining deposits (approximately $50 million) to a claims fund of the United States Treasury. In 1971, most of the fund was distributed to state and local authorities in proportion to the obligations of individual post offices. Outstanding deposit claims were voided in 1985.  Locations  On March 26, 1911, the locations of the central depositories for the first 19 states were established, followed the next day by 25 others. The post offices were selected by merit rather than by geography, based on those with the best efficiency record in the state.\\"Postal Savings Stamps of U.S.\\", by H.L.

In 2015, Kevin Weatherill reformed the group with new members. Formation, album history and tours The band was formed in Kent, England by two sets of brothers: Kevin Weatherill (vocals, guitar) and Paul Weatherill (bass, vocals), and brothers Andy Ross (guitar) and Peter Ross (drums), the sons of saxophonist Ronnie Ross.Larkin, Colin (1995) The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Guinness Publishing, The band's single \\"Immaculate Fools\\" reached No. 51 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1985. Their debut album, Hearts of Fortune, reached No. 65 in the UK Albums Chart the same year.Immaculate Fools, Chart Stats The band toured Europe extensively, building a strong following in Spain, where they made several television appearances. In 1987 the band's second album, Dumb Poet, was well received by critics (including a five-star review in Sounds magazine), although it did not repeat the first album's commercial success. The album did, however, give the band a second charting single with \\"Tragic Comedy.\\" The band underwent a major line-up change when the Ross brothers left, with Barry Wickens (violin), Brian Betts (guitar), Paul Skidmore (drums) and Ian Devlin (keyboards) joining for the Another Man's World album. The band set up a recording studio in a farmhouse (Woodhouse) on the Welsh borders near Ludlow. For the band's final two albums, Woodhouse and Kiss and Punch, the Weatherill brothers were joined by Wickens, Betts, and Nick Thomas (drums). They continued to record music and occasionally tour until they formally split up in 1997. After the breakup Kevin Weatherill, who was not only the lead vocalist but also the main songwriter of the band, continues to record and tour both in the UK and Europe under the name Dirty Ray. In 2010 he worked with Miles Hunt (of the band Wonderstuff) and violinist Erica Nockalls to produce the album Big World for a Little Man. Andy Ross went on to work with Basia, Howard Jones, Miguel Bos√©, and Tori Amos.Gregory, Andy (2002) The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002, Routledge, In 2013 Andy Ross won an award at the Reel Earth Environmental Film Festival in New Zealand for his short film, Well Beyond Water, about the plight of drought affected farmers in New South Wales. Paul Weatherill died in 2020.https://immaculatefools.com/paul-weatherill-1952-2020/ Reformation In December 2014, Kevin Weatherill announced on his website that Immaculate Fools were to reform in 2015, initially playing some gigs in Spain, Portugal and Italy, and then embarking on a UK tour. In February 2015, the band began recording a new album titled Turn the Whole World Down, which was produced by Adam Fuest. The reformed act toured Spain in 2015 with new members Linda Lamb (bass), Adam Fuest (guitar), Helen Watt (violin), Phil Redfox O'Sullivan (drums), and Alex Valentine (keyboards). For the Spring Tour of Spain in 2016, Immaculate Fools were joined by touring members Christian Pattemore and Phil Andrews of Thieves of Time on bass. Between October 2015 and June 2016 Immaculate Fools performed 26 shows in Spain. In the summer of 2016, following Weatherill's relocation to Spain, the logistics of continuing the band in its current form became problematic. Adam Fuest and Kevin Weatherill parted company and Weatherill formed a new seven piece version of the band featuring local Spanish and UK musicians and continues to perform in Spain. In the spring of 2017, Weatherill released an album of new material under the name Immaculate Fools, titled Keep the Blade Sharp and began touring Spain to promote it. Kevin Weatherill also continues to perform under the name Dirty Ray with Paco Charl√≠n and Na√≠ma Acu√±a.

She was convicted along with her three accomplices, among them her lover, for the death of her husband.  Background  In 1716, at the age of 19, Maria Romberg was arranged to marry merchant Anders Broberg, 27 years her senior, in Bor√•s, against her will. Broberg was said to abuse Maria; he was called brutal and Maria's stepfather accused him of alcoholism.Forssell, Nils, Bor√•s stads historia D. 1, Bor√•s, 1952 In 1719, Maria started a relationship with her childhood friend, Haqvin Wijndruf, a member of one of the most wealthy and influential families in Bor√•s. The relationship was well known in the city, and many people acted as messengers for their letters.Forssell, Nils, Bor√•s stads historia D. 1, Bor√•s, 1952 In 1722, her husband called upon two vicars to lecture her.Forssell, Nils, Bor√•s stads historia D. 1, Bor√•s, 1952 After this, Maria and Haqvin made two attempts to poison Broberg, but failed.Forssell, Nils, Bor√•s stads historia D. 1, Bor√•s, 1952 Maria then hired a cunning woman called Romans Ingeborg, who was reputed to be able to perform magic, and who assured her that she had performed many murders for hire in the past. The three accomplices then made up plans. On one occasion, they tried to strangle him, but failed.Forssell, Nils, Bor√•s stads historia D. 1, Bor√•s, 1952 In 1724, they informed the maid Karin Andersdotter of their plans: Broberg had abused her, and she wanted revenge.Forssell, Nils, Bor√•s stads historia D. 1, Bor√•s, 1952  Murder  On 28 December 1724, Maria was again lectured by the vicars, and the same night, Maria, Haqvin, Ingeborg and Karin planned the murder. The three women went to Broberg's bedroom, where he was asleep, and Ingeborg hit him in the head until he died.Forssell, Nils, Bor√•s stads historia D. 1, Bor√•s, 1952 They then placed his body to look as if he had tripped and hit his head.Forssell, Nils, Bor√•s stads historia D. 1, Bor√•s, 1952 When the corpse was examined, he was thought to have been murdered, and so Maria and her three accomplices were accused of murder. Karin was the first to confess. When Maria heard this, she also confessed, and told Haqvin to do the same. Haqvin denied everything, claimed that she had several lovers beside him, and tried to escape, but was arrested and forced to confess.  Execution  On 23 February, Maria, Haqvin, Ingeborg, and Karin were found guilty and sentenced to death.Forssell, Nils, Bor√•s stads historia D. 1, Bor√•s, 1952 They were all decapitated, with some variations. Maria was decapitated and burned, Haqvin was decapitated and had his head nailed to a pole, Ingeborg had her hand cut off, and was then decapitated and burned. Karin was simply decapitated, and buried. The sentence was carried out on 14 April 1725. The affair ended the influence of the Wijndruf family in the city. Haqvin's brother Andreas was ordained a priest just four days later and emigrated to North America in the summer of 1725.

She has developed her own recognizable style. In her paintings, reality is difficult to separate from fiction. Hyperrealistic literality of details is not only a stylistic effort, but rather a manifestation of a certain perception of reality. Domanska‚Äôs paintings relate to the reality of uncontrolled permeation of imitation and original. The literary meaning of seemingly banal and superficial beauty of reproduced objects and situations is also the background of symbolic celebration of emotions, feelings, reflections and affirmations of nature.EUROPA (15) 85/05 (13 April 2005) dzia≈Ç WIZJE.

The original line-up was Joe Buttigieg on guitar, Greg Smith on lead vocals and bass guitar, and Matt Coffey on drums. In February 1988, Mick Sultana was recruited on lead guitar. They released two studio albums, Pity of Man (November 1989) and Kick 'Em Hard (January 1993). In July 1990 Steve More (ex- Enticer) had replaced Coffey on drums. They were influenced by Metallica, Sacred Reich and Nuclear Assault. Addictive disbanded in 1996. In 2004 both Buttigieg and Sultana joined a reformation of fellow thrash metallers, Mortal Sin. History Addictive were formed in 1987 in Blacktown by Greg Smith (vocals and bass guitar) and Joe Buttigieg (guitar), with Matt Coffey (drums) joining soon after. They expanded to a quartet when Mick Sultana (guitar) joined in February of the following year. In October 1988 they recorded a five-track extended play, Ward 74, which was released by the end of that year. The group completed a tour of Sydney, Newcastle and Canberra. Their first studio album, Pity of Man was released in November 1989 on the Survival label.

By September they had signed with Rattlesnake through Normal Records for European distribution of their debut album. In June 1991 they supported a gig by Mot√∂rhead at the Hordern Pavilion. Addictive's second album, Kick 'Em Hard, was recorded in 1991 with producer, Bob Daisley. The master tapes for the album went missing for over 18 months ‚Äì it was finally released in February 1993 ‚Äì by which time the band had fallen from favour. Gaines rated the album as 8.5 out of 10 observing that it was \\"still full-on thrash metal but had a more polished sound\\" despite changes in musical trends. Both albums were remastered, expanded and issued as a 2√óCD compilation, Kick ‚ÄòEm Hard (Rebooted Edition), in 2015 on the Divebomb label ‚Äì the writers of Hardrock Haven voted it as one of the top 10 albums of that year. Addictive continued to play live infrequently, but finally broke up in 1996. A short time later, Moore joined Dungeon.

The Arab Renaissance (Al-Nahda) of the late 19th and early 20th centuries did not reach Libya as early as other Arab lands, and Libyans contributed little to its initial development. However, Libya at this time developed its own literary tradition, centred on oral poetry, much of which expressed the suffering brought about by the Italian colonial period. Most of Libya's early literature was written in the east, in the cities of Benghazi and Derna: particularly Benghazi, because of its importance as an early Libyan capital and influence of the universities present there. They were also the urban areas closest to Cairo and Alexandria - uncontested areas of Arab culture at the time. Even today, most writers - despite being spread throughout the country, trace their inspiration to eastern, rather than western, Libya.Chorin, Ethan Translating Libya: The Modern Libyan Short Story Saqi/SOAS Press, 2008 pg. 189 Libyan literature has historically been very politicized. The Libyan literary movement can be traced to the Italian occupation of the early 20th century. Sulaiman al-Barouni, an important figure of the Libyan resistance to the Italian occupation, wrote the first book of Libyan poetry as well as publishing a newspaper called The Muslim Lion. After the Italian defeat in World War II, the focus of Libyan literature shifted to the fight for independence. The 1960s were a tumultuous decade for Libya, and this is reflected in the works of Libyan writers. Social change, the distribution of oil-wealth and the Six-Day War were a few of the most discussed topics. Following the 1969 coup d'etat which brought Muammar Gaddafi to power, the government established the Union of Libyan Writers. Thereafter, literature in the country took a much less antagonistic approach towards the government, more often supporting government policies than opposing. As very little Libyan literature has been translated, few Libyan authors have received much attention outside of the Arab World. Possibly Libya's best-known writer, Ibrahim Al-Koni, is all but unknown outside the Arab-speaking world. History =Early Libyan works= Prior to Italian invasion, Libyan literary journals were primarily concerned with politics. Journals of this period included al-'Asr al‚ÄìJadƒ´d (The New Age) in 1910 and al‚ÄìTarƒÅjim (The Translations) in 1897. It wasn't until the brutality of the Italian invasion that Libyan consciousness exposed itself in the form of the short story. Wahbi Bouri argues in the introduction of al-BawƒÅkir (The Vanguard), a collection of short stories he wrote from 1930 to 1960, that the Libyan short story was born in reaction to Italian occupation and Egyptian literary renaissance in Cairo and Alexandria. Specifically, copies of poems such as Benghazi the Eternal helped to sustain Libyan resistance. Italian policy of the time was to suppress indigenous Libyan cultural aspirations - therefore quelling any publications showing local literary influence. Perhaps the only publication of the time that had any Libyan roots was the Italian financed, Libya al-Mu·π£awwar (Illustrated Libya). While beginning as Italian propaganda, the magazine included work by Wahbi Bouri, considered the father of Libyan short stories. Libyan poet Khaled Mattawa remarks: :\\"Against claims that Libya has a limited body of literature, classicists may be quick to note that ancient Greek lyric poet Callimachus and the exquisite prose stylist Sinesius were Libyan. But students of Libyan history and literature will note a vast time gap between those ancient luminaries and the writers of today. [...] Libya has historically made a limited contribution to Arab literature\\". Many of Aesop's fables have been classified as part of the 'Libyan tales' genre in literary tradition although some scholars argue that the term \\"Libya\\" was used to describe works of Non-Egyptian territories in ancient Greece.AesopLobban, Richard Andrew, Was Aesop a Nubian Kummaji (Folkteller)?, Northeast African Studies - Volume 9, Number 1, 2002 (New Series), pp. 3 =1950 -1960= With the withdraw of European forces, a period of optimism was born ushered in by the return of educated Libyans who had lived in exile in Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon. Among the 1950s generation were famed writers Kamel Maghur, Ahmed Fagih, and Bashir Hashimi who all wrote with a sense of optimism reflecting the spirit of independence Libyan literature began to bloom in the late 1960s, with the writings of Sadeq al-Neihum, Khalifa al- Fakhri, Kamel Maghur (prose), Muhammad al-Shaltami and Ali al-Regeie (poetry). Many Libyan writers of the 1960s adhered to nationalist, socialist and generally progressive views. Some writers also produced works resenting the entry of American oil companies as an attack on their country. This period also simultaneously began to cast Americans (with their oil companies) and Jews (because of Israel's foundation in 1948) as outsiders as well as occasionally in the positive light of facilitators. = 1969-1986, Revolutionary Years = In 1969, a military coup brought Muammar Gaddafi to power. In the mid-1970s, the new government set up a single publishing house, and authors were required to write in support of the authorities. Those who refused were imprisoned, emigrated, or ceased writing. Authors like Kamel Maghur and Ahmed Fagih who had dominated the cultural landscape of the 1950s and 1960s continued to be the source of most literary production. =The New Libyan writers: Today= Censorship laws were loosened, but not abolished, in the early 1990s, resulting in a literary renewal. Some measure of dissent is expressed in contemporary literature published within Libya, but books remain censored and self-censored to a certain extent. In 2006 with the opening of Libya to the United States the nature of the novel changed. Internationally recognized Libyan writers include Laila Neihoum, Najwa BinShetwan, and Maryam Salama. Libyan short-story writer and translator Omar al-Kikli names Ghazi Gheblawi, Mohamed Mesrati (known as Mo. Mesrati) and Mohamed Al-Asfar and six others as the Libyan short-story writers \\"who have gained most prominence in the first decade of the new century.\\" Themes Contemporary Libyan literature is influenced by \\"local lore, North African and Eastern Mediterranean Arab literatures, and world literature at large\\" (K. Mattawa). √âmigr√© writers have also contributed significantly to Libyan literature, and include Ibrahim Al-Kouni, Ahmad Al-Faqih and Sadeq al-Neihum. A contemporary Libyan group was formed in the late 20th century called FC, with a leading pioneer named Penninah.

Wasmann was a supporter of evolution, although he did not accept the productivity of natural selection, the evolution of humans from other animals, or universal common descent of all life. Rather, he believed that common ancestry was restricted to what he called \\"natural species\\" which were generally larger groups than species (which he called \\"systematic species\\"), genera, or even families. His natural species he identified with the \\"paleontological species\\" of Melchior Neumayr. Wasmann also was involved in a long-running dispute with Ernst Haeckel over Monism.Robert J.

Early years Hall was born June 12, 1913, in Whitewright, Texas, to Benjamin Baxter Hall and Leila G. Hall, n√©e Cook. As a boy, he studied the saxophone and played in church, later played saxophone in a local combo called the Joy Makers. Hall performed with dance bands in the North Texas area in the 1930s and in 1934 began a two-year European tour as saxophonist with the Clarence Nemir Orchestra, where he developed his arranging skills. College Days The North Texas College of Music had been noted for years for its symphony orchestra, opera workshop, concert and marching bands, a cappella choir, and more than a dozen smaller performing groups. Gene Hall, then a graduate student at North Texas, was asked to teach dance band arranging to two students in 1942. Soon, enrollment in the class grew to fifteen students.

Occupying a large corner site on Queen's Park Road, it was designed in the 1880s by Sir Arthur Blomfield in the Early English style, and has been given listed building status because of its architectural importance. History Queen's Park was laid out as an ornamental park of in 1824. Charles Barry was hired to design decorative entrances and a villa for the park's owner. Housing development around the park had started in the 1810s and continued throughout the 19th century. The first Anglican place of worship in the area was built in 1875 and became a chapel of ease to St Mary's Church in Kemptown when that church was completed. The red-brick building was on the west side of Queen's Park Road. In 1880 a separate parish was established, and preparatory work on the new church started the following year on the opposite side of the road. The site was bought for ¬£900; the foundation stone was laid in 1882 by the Bishop of Chichester, Richard Durnford; and Arthur Blomfield finished the church in 1885, apart from a proposed spire which was never built because of a lack of money. The new St Luke's Church was consecrated on 16 April 1885. The 1875 building held services until then; it then became the church hall until it was gutted by fire and demolished in the 1970s, after which flats were built on the site. These flats were built on the site of the original church of 1875. The first vicar of St Luke's was Revd Walter Firth, a follower of Tractarianism; services were \\"High church\\" in style. He worked hard to alleviate poverty and improve people's lives in the densely populated parish, especially by establishing educational and charitable activities. This style of worship continued under subsequent vicars in the early decades of the church, and became re-established in the 1970s. A memorial to the then- incumbent vicar Arthur Young's son, who died in World War I, was erected in 1918; two years later a memorial to all parishioners who had died in the war was added. Finances were always tight, and electricity was not installed until 1947, at which time internal repairs were carried out and some new fittings were added. Despite this, the church was threatened with demolition in 1950; petitions and fundraising were successful in reversing this decision, which had it gone ahead would have resulted in parishioners transferring to St Martin's Church within a newly enlarged parish of St Martin. The parish of St Luke existed as a separate entity until 1974, when it was merged into the newly constituted Parish of the Resurrection. Six years earlier it had been enlarged substantially, both in area and in the number of parishioners served, when the nearby St Matthew's Church closed down and its congregation was transferred to St Luke's. On 1 February 2009 the Team Ministry and Parish of the Resurrection was dissolved and St Luke's once again became a separate parish in its own right. The last team vicar, Fr Christopher Woodman, became the first incumbent of the new parish. Since 2010, the Incumbent has been a Deacon-in-Charge, the Reverend Julie Newson. Architecture The church from the northwest The church is built predominantly of flint with mouldings and window dressings of stone. Internally very spacious, it can hold up to 900 people. Its south and west elevations face the street. At the east end is a three-bay chancel flanked by a Lady chapel and vestry to the south and north respectively. This adjoins the four-bay, north- and south-aisled nave, at the southwest corner of which is the octagonal tower. A substantial, three-stage structure with a shallow cap at the same height as the nave roof, the tower was in fact intended to be much taller and topped with a spire rising to ; but the extension and spire were never built. The entrance is in a porch which runs along the length of the west face. Lancet windows predominate, typical of the Early English Gothic architectural style of which St Luke's is a revival. The east face has a set of five grouped together between two buttresses. The Lady chapel has a similar group of three on its east side‚Äîwith stained glass by Charles Eamer Kempe‚Äîand three single lancets in the south face. The west face, above the entrance, has three paired lancets with small quatrefoil windows above them. The chancel and Lady chapel have vaulted wooden ceilings with corbelled supporting arches. The chancel and nave are linked by an arch and are at different levels. The nave roof is also of timber and is divided into sections corresponding with the four bays below. A highly decorative carved reredos in five sections is behind the altar. The church's most distinctive design element is the unusual layout of gables and windows in the north and south aisles; Nikolaus Pevsner described it as \\"curious\\" and a \\"disturbing motif\\". In the aisles, the bays have a sequence of alternating designs: one set has a cross-gable with timber barrel vault roof and a tall single window, and the other set has a lower, simple roof and a pair of small windows with a tracery design. The \\"curiosity\\" is that each gabled bay in the north aisle is opposed by a low-roofed bay in the south aisle and vice versa, rather than the pattern being identical in both aisles. An organ was installed in 1885 in a chamber in the east end of the nave. At the west end, one bay was converted in the 1960s into a room for general use. Internal fixtures include an octagonal font, balustraded pulpit, choir stall in the chancel and the reredos. The church today St Luke's was listed at Grade II on 26 August 1999. Worship is in a relaxed Catholic style, using Common Worship of the Church of England, and there is much use of music. There is one service at 10am every Sunday and a Eucharist on Wednesday.

Incumbent Democratic United States Senator Sam Nunn decided to retire instead of seeking a fifth term. The Republican Party nominated Guy Millner, a multi-millionaire businessman who was also the unsuccessful candidate who ran against Zell Miller in the 1994 gubernatorial election. Millner emerged as the victor from a crowded 6-person primary in July 1996. Max Cleland, the Secretary of State of Georgia ran unopposed in the Democratic primary. Libertarian Jack Cashin and Independent Arlene Rubinstein also entered the race, though neither one of them were \\"serious\\" candidates. Despite being held by Democrats since 1852, the election for this seat became tightly contested between Cleland and Millner. It was the closest race for that seat since at least 1852. Nonetheless, Cleland defeated Millner on November 5. He narrowly edged out a victory with 1,103,993 votes (48.87%) to Guy Millner's 1,073,969 votes (47.54%) - a margin of 1.33%. As of , this is the last time the Democrats have won the Class 2 Senate Seat from Georgia. Background The Class 2 United States Senate seat had been reliably Democratic, with a member of that party holding it since 1852. Additionally, no Republican had ever held the seat since it was established in 1789. In fact, during the previous election, Sam Nunn was unanimously re-elected and defeated Mike Hicks by an almost 60% margin in 1984. Republican Paul Coverdell narrowly unseated Democrat Wyche Fowler in Georgia's other United States Senate seat in 1992. On October 9, 1995, 4-term incumbent Class 2 Senator Sam Nunn announced his retirement. This left the seat open for the first time since 1972. Democratic Primary After the retirement of Sam Nunn, Democrats began seeking a successor for him. Eventually, Secretary of State of Georgia Max Cleland entered the race. Cleland was the only Democratic candidate to file for election, thus he became the nominee by default on July 9, 1996. During the primary, he received 517,697 votes - 100%. Republican Primary With the retirement of San Nunn, Republicans also saw opportunity with an open Senate seat in Georgia. Six candidates filled to enter the Primary Election and become the Republican Nominee after July 9, 1996, they were: * Paul Broun, candidate for Georgia's 3rd congressional district in 1990 and 1992 * Clint Day, Georgia Senate Senator since 1993 * Bruce Hatfield * Johnny Isakson, Georgia State Senator and 1990 Republican gubernatorial nominee * Guy Millner, multi-millionaire businessman and 1994 Republican gubernatorial nominee * Dean Parkison, Republican candidate for United States Senate in 1978, 1980, 1986, and 1992 Candidates There were four candidates on the ballot for the United States Senator from Georgia election in 1996. =Democratic= * Max Cleland, Secretary of State of Georgia =Republican= * Guy Millner, multi- millionaire businessman =Libertarian= * Jack Cashin, owner of a restaurant chain and publisher of Dare magazine =Independent= * Arlene Rubinstein Campaign After the Republican Primary, Guy Millner emerged as the nominee. Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, noted that defeated rival Johnny Isakson was more likely to win the moderate vote due to his pro-choice views on abortion. Several polls earlier that year showed Cleland defeating both Millner and Isakson. In contrast to Isakson's opinion, Guy Millner was opposed to abortion except in the case of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. Johnny Isakson was later elected United States Senator after Zell Miller retired from his seat in 2004. Opponent Max Cleland quickly labeled Millner as an extremist, saying that \\"I think people in this state want to elect a moderate ... not an extremist, not an ideologue, and not somebody hung up on some ideological agenda.\\" In response, Millner began campaigning on other issues to capture more moderate voters. Results On Election Day, Democratic nominee Max Cleland narrowly won against Republican Guy Millner. It was one of the closest United States Senate Elections in the history of Georgia. Cleland received 1,103,993 votes to Millner's 1,073,969 votes. Libertarian candidate Jack Cashin obtained 81,262 votes, while only 8 people voted for Independent Arlene Rubinstein. Since the Democratic-controlled Georgia General Assembly changed the run-off rules after the 1992 Senate election to only require a runoff if the winning candidate received less than 45% of the vote, no runoff was required. Republicans, once they took control of the General Assembly in 2005, changed the law back to require a run-off if less than 50% of the vote was received. Aftermath Following the election, Max Cleland was sworn-in as a United States Senator on January 7, 1997. After one term, Max Cleland faced a tough re-election bid in 2002. However, this time he was defeated by Republican Saxby Chambliss. Cleland did not pursue public office after 2002, but campaigned for John Kerry in 2004 and was selected by President of the United States Barack Obama to serve on the American Battle Monuments Commission starting in 2009. The Republican candidate in 1996, Guy Millner, ran for Governor of Georgia again in 1998, but lost to Democrat Roy Barnes. Millner did not seek public office again after his defeat in 1998.

It is the main base for the Ethiopian Air Force. History In 1946, the beginnings of what became the Ethiopian Air Force were moved from Lideta Airfield in Addis Ababa to Bishoftu. The former facility was instead utilized by Ethiopian Airlines. The initial group of 19 Swedes under Count Carl Gustaf von Rosen, who were to train the pilots and support personal, arrived there after leaving Sweden between 9 January and 16 July 1946. Both Ethiopian cadets and the Swedish instructors took part in constructing the first buildings on the base. Six Saab 91 Safir training airplanes were bought in Sweden and flown to the new airbase on 24 December 1946. On 10 November 1947, a fleet of 16 Saab-built B-17s was landed at Bishoftu by Swedish pilots. The airport has been used for civilian operations in the past, mainly when Bole Airport was unserviceable due to construction works. In 2005, the airport served 101,839 passengers. 2012 satellite imagery shows a number of helicopters, fighters and transport aircraft are based there.

A large aisled church with a central tower, the present building dates from the late 12th century but has fragments of Anglo-Saxon work. The church is a Grade I listed building. The dedication is to Saint Samson of Dol, born in Wales in the late 5th century, who was one of the founders of religion in Brittany.  History and architecture  A stone church was mentioned as standing on this site in c. 973. The 1086 Domesday Book recorded the church, on land held by Westminster Abbey. Small amounts of Anglo-Saxon stonework survive in the present building, in particular in the south wall of the nave. The north arcade was added in the late 12th century, while the south arcade is from a remodelling in the 13th. The chancel is 13th- century, remodelled in the 14th and 15th. To the north is the Hungerford chapel, probably built for Sir Edmund Hungerford (d. 1484). The tower was begun in the early 16th century and completed in the 1550s at the expense of the Duke of Northumberland and the Hungerford family. Nikolaus Pevsner wrote: \\"The distinguishing feature of the church is its proud and self-certain, somewhat heavy and certainly not elegant, crossing tower\\", while Simon Jenkins describes it in England's Thousand Best Churches as \\"massive rather than graceful\\". Restoration in 1863-4 was by Ewan Christian. Stained glass in the west window is by Kempe, 1888. In 1930 Martin Travers designed two windows and the decoration of the two altars.  Crosses in churchyard  A broken shaft of a medieval limestone cross, on a crude octagonal base, can be seen against the gable of a gatehouse at the northern perimeter of the churchyard. Town Cross, St Sampson's churchyard A 14th-century limestone cross stands in the northeast of the churchyard, complete with a carved head. This was the town cross which stood at the High Street crossroads until c. 1817-20 when the town hall was demolished. It is a Grade II* listed structure.  Parish  Until 1952, Cricklade's two churches ‚Äì St Sampson's and St Mary's ‚Äì had separate parishes. A united parish of Cricklade was created, and at the same time the benefice became 'The United Benefice of Cricklade with Latton' which included St John the Baptist at Latton and the redundant St Mary's at Eysey, near Latton (demolished 1953). In 1981 St Mary's was declared redundant, making St Sampson's the sole church of the parish.

The temple is located at Dwarka, Gujarat, India, one of the destinations of Char Dham, a Hindu pilgrimage circuit. The main shrine of the five storied building, supported by 72 pillars, is known as Jagat Mandir or Nija Mandir, archaeological findings suggest it to be 2,000 - 2,200 years old. The temple was enlarged in the 15th- 16th century.1988, P. N. Chopra, \\"Encyclopaedia of India, Volume 1\\", page.114 The Dwarkadhish Temple is a Pushtimarg temple, hence it follows the guidelines and rituals created by Vallabhacharya and Vitheleshnath. According to tradition, the original temple was believed to have been built by Krishna's grandson, Vajranabha, over the hari-griha (Krishna's residential place). The original structure was destroyed by Mahmud Begada in 1472, and subsequently rebuilt in the 15th-16th century. The temple became part of the Char Dham pilgrimage considered sacred by Hindus in India. Adi Shankaracharya, the 8th century Hindu theologian and philosopher, visited the shrine. The other three being comprising Rameswaram, Badrinath and Puri. Even today a memorial within the temple is dedicated to his visit. Dwarakadheesh is the 98th Divya Desam of Vishnu on the subcontinent, glorified in the Divya Prabandha sacred texts. it was rebuilt by Raja Jagat Singh Rathore. The temple is at an elevation of above mean sea-level. It faces west. The temple layout consists of a garbhagriha (Nijamandira or Harigraha) and an antarala (an antechamber). It is conjectured that this temple location is 2,500 years old where Krishna had built his city and a temple. However, the existing temple is dated to 16th century. Legend As per Hindu legend, Dwarka was built on a piece of land by Krishna that was reclaimed from the sea. Sage Durvasa once visited Krishna and his wife Rukmini. The sage wished that the pair took him to their palace. The pair readily agreed and started walking with the sage to their palace. After some distance, Rukmini got tired and she requested some water from Krishna. Krishna dug a mythical hole that brought in river Ganga to the place. Sage Durvasa was furious and cursed Rukmini to remain in the place. The temple where Rukmini's shrine is found, is believed to the place where she stood. History Stairs leading up to the main entrance of the temple The town of Dwarka in Gujarat has a history that dates back centuries, and mentioned in the Mahabharat epic as the Dwaraka Kingdom. Situated on the banks of river Gomti, the town is described in legend as the capital of Krishna. Evidence such as a stone block with script, the way the stones were dressed showing that dowels had been used, and an examination of anchors found on the site suggest that the harbour site dates only to historical times, with some of the underwater structure being late Medieval. Coastal erosion was probably the cause of the destruction of what was an ancient port. Hindus believe that the original temple was constructed by Vajranabh, the great grand son of Krishna, over the residential palace of Krishna. It was destroyed by Sultan Mahmud Begada in 1472. The current temple in Chaulukya style was constructed in 15-16th century. The temple covers area of 27-metre by 21-metre with east‚Äìwest length of 29-metre and north‚Äìsouth width of 23 metres. The tallest peak of the temple is 51.8 m high. Religious importance Since this site is associated with the ancient city of DvƒÅrakƒÅ and the Vedic era Krishna of Mahabharata, it is an important place of pilgrimage for Hindus. It is one of 3 main pilgrimage sites related to \\"Krishna\\" circuit, namely 48 kos parikrama of Kurukshetra in Haryana state, Braj Parikarma in Mathura of Uttar Pradesh state and Dwarka Parikrama (Dwarkadish Yatra) at Dwarkadhish Temple in Gujarat state. The flag atop the temple shows the sun and moon, which is believed to indicate that Krishna would be there till Sun and Moon exist on Earth. The flag is changed up to five times a day, but the symbol remains the same. The temple has a five-story structure built on seventy-two pillars. The temple spire is 78.3 m high. *The temple is constructed of limestone which is still in pristine condition. The temple shows intricate sculptural detailing done by successions of dynasties that ruled the region. The structure was not expanded much by these works. There are two entrances to the temple. The main entrance (north entrance) is called \\"Moksha Dwara\\" (Door to Salvation). This entrance takes one to the main market. The south entrance is called \\"Swarga Dwara\\" (Gate to Heaven). Outside this doorway are 56 steps that leads to the Gomati River.Chakravarti 1994, p. 140 The temple is open from 6.00 am to 1.00 pm and 5.00 pm to 9.30 pm. The Krishnajanmastami festival, or Gokulashtami, the birthday of Krishna was commissioned by Vallaba (1473-1531). According to a legend, Meera Bai, the princess cum saint, a staunch devotee of Krishna merged with the deity at this temple. It is one of the Sapta Puri, the seven holy cities of India. The temple is also the location of Dvaraka Pitha, one of the four (religious centers) established by Adi Shankaracharya (686-717) who pioneered unification of Hindu religious beliefs in the country. It is a four storied structure representing four established by Shankaracharya in different parts of the country. There are paintings on the walls here depicting the life history of Shankaracharya while the dome has carvings of Shiva in different postures. Structure It is a five storied edifice built over 72 pillars (sandstone temple with 60 pillars is also mentioned). The original temple had been built by Krishna's grandson over the Harigraha, the palace of Krishna. The temple has an assembly hall or audience hall. There are two important entrances to the temple, one is the main entry door which is called the Moksha Dwar (meaning \\"Door to Salvation\\") and the exit door which is known as the Swarga Dwar (meaning: \\"Gate to Heaven\\"). The main deity deified in the sanctum is of Dwarkadeesh, which is known as Trivikrama form of Vishnu and is depicted with four arms. On the chamber to the left of the main altar is the deity of Balarama, elder brother of Krishna. The chamber to the right houses the images of Pradyumna and Aniruddha, son and grandson of Krishna. In several shrines surrounding the central shrine there are images of goddess Radha, Rukmini, Jambavati, Satyabhama, Lakshmi, Devaki (Krishna's mother), Madhav Raoji (another name for Krishna), Rukmini, Jugal Swaroop (name for Krishna), Lakshmi Narayana. The temple spire rises to a height of and a very large flag with symbols of Sun and Moon is hoisted on it. The flag, triangular in shape, is of length. This flag is changed four times a day with a new one and Hindus pay a huge sum of money to hoist it by purchasing a new flag. The money received on this account is credited to the trust fund of the temple to meet the operation and maintenance expenses of the temple.

It is a simpler version of Entdecker, and is played with one or two players. The solitaire version's objective is completely different from the two player version's. Two-Player Version Each player, in turn, places a wooden ship on one of the starting spaces or on a tile already placed. At the beginning of the game, of course, the only spaces available are starting spaces. These spaces appear on three sides of the board; the fourth side is a continuation of the ocean frame, but the ship cannot start there. Then, the player picks one tile from the top of the pile. Each tile has four sides, with water or land on each side. All of the possible combinations that have water on at least one side are included, with varying frequencies, in the pile. (The water, land, water, land tiles show two island fragments, one on each side with a strait going down the middle, not the other way around.) Tiles placed into the board must match water to water and land to land. If a tile fits, the player must place it. Each player has pieces in one of the two colors (white or black) depicting one, two, or three scouts. Players may place one scout piece on the tile that was placed if it has land on it (if it is the WLWL piece, the scout piece may be placed on either side). If a tile does not fit, it is placed in front of the player. Later in the game, the player may choose to give up one scout piece from the supply in order to place one of these pieces on the board. If an empty space is completely surrounded, it is filled with reserve tiles of the correct variety, which are next to the board. If a number of spaces are surrounded with only land, they are filled with tiles from the reserve pile that have land on all four sides. The game can end in three ways: #When the tiles in the pile are used up. #When the entire board is filled. #When there are spaces that cannot be filled because of the side of the board that is considered water, but where the ship cannot start. If there are two or more consecutive spaces surrounded only by land and this fourth side, they cannot be filled. On each island where one player has a majority of the scouts, that player receives points equal to the number of the tiles in the island. If the two island fragments of a WLWL tile are joined by other pieces that go around them, the tile still only counts as one tile. If the players are tied, nobody scores points. Tiles in front of a player because they could not be placed are each worth -2 points if the player has not given up a scout piece to place them. The winner is the player with the most points. One-Player Version The scouts are not used in this game. The player repeatedly places the ship on the board and puts tiles out. A tile that does not fit is placed in a discard pile. The score is the sum of the squares of the number of tiles in each island, minus twenty points for each space that is not filled at the end of the game. This version of the game can be played online at PlayCatan, even though it is not strictly a Catan game. This is because of its relationship to the Catan series (also created by Klaus Teuber and published by Mayfair Games), and because its parent game, Entdecker, can be viewed as the discovery of the island of Catan, as the publisher says at this link: .

He is the brother of the cellist Csaba Szilvay and the father of the violinist R√©ka Szilvay. With his brother Csaba Szilvay he founded the Helsinki Strings, a youth orchestra, in 1972. They conducted it until they retired in 2010. Biography Szilvay was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1943, studied the violin at the B√©la Bart√≥k Conservatory and Pedagogics at the Budapest Music Academy where he graduated in 1966. He also studied law and political science at the ELTE University in Budapest and took his doctor‚Äôs degree in 1970. In the 1960s, he played violin in the Budapest Symphony Orchestra and the first violin in the Szilvay family quartet, which was a well-known ensemble at the time in Hungary. He also taught and conducted the Children and Youth Orchestra of the Hungarian State Radio and Television. In 1971, G√©za Szilvay started to teach the violin at the East Helsinki Music Institute, Finland and he served as Principal of the institute in 1984-2010. He also taught at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki in 1978-2010. In 2012, he embarked on an ongoing project ‚ÄúInternational Minifiddlers‚Äù where his Colourstrings classes are broadcast in real time through a video conferencing system across the world. G√©za Szilvay is the creator of the internationally renowned and successful Colourstrings teaching method that has been documented in 42 publications. Over the years, he developed the method step by step constantly revising and adding new elements to the material. The Colourstrings method interlinks the development of musical hearing, musical intellect, instrumental technique and the emotional world of a child and applies the principle of reinforcement of perception through joint functioning of the senses. Right from the start, he added group lessons and string orchestra training to individual tutoring. In 1972, G√©za Szilvay founded The Helsinki Junior Strings orchestra (now known as The Helsinki Strings). G√©za together with his brother Csaba Szilvay trained and conducted this string ensemble until 2010 and recorded 28 albums under Fuga, Finlandia, Apex and Warner labels. During these years, The Helsinki Strings have gained worldwide recognition through 38 international concert tours. Szilvay‚Äôs method of teaching soon had a strong impact on musical education in Finland. A large portion of his students have become professional musicians. He has inspired young parents and little kids with his TV programme ‚ÄúMini Fiddlers in the Music Land‚Äù in 55 episodes broadcast in the 1970s and 1980s by the Finnish Broadcasting Company YLE. Violin pedagogical elements were slipped into the screenplay through visits to various places in the Music Land. G√©za Szilvay gained international recognition not only as a violin pedagogue and creator of the Colourstrings method but also as an educator and conductor of children‚Äôs and youth orchestras. For 10 years, he headed the annual Prima Nota festival in Kuhmo, bringing together young string players from all over Finland and practising and performing age appropriate repertoire with them. He has given more than 200 lectures and workshops on his teaching method and philosophy in Europe, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, USA, Canada and Australia. In the ongoing International Mini Fiddlers project, he teaches pupils, violin pedagogues and university students of many countries in weekly video conferences. In 2015, the participating countries include Australia, Denmark, England, Faroe Islands, Finland, Germany, Greenland, Israel, South Korea and the United States.

The village is bypassed by the A419 road from Swindon to Cirencester. The parish includes the hamlet of Eysey, formerly a village with its own church and parish. Watercourses form several of the parish boundaries. In the northeast (also the county boundary) the boundary is the Ampney Brook; in the south, the Thames and its tributary the River Ray; in the northwest the River Churn, another tributary of the Thames.  History  Latton village lies near Ermin Street, the Roman road which ran southeast‚Äìnorthwest from Silchester to the present-day Cirencester and Gloucester. The Domesday Book of 1068 recorded a settlement of some 20 households at Latone, with two mills. Land at Latton and \\"Esi\\" was held by Reinbald, as recorded in a 1067 writ of William I. Latton and Eisey were granted in 1133 by Henry I to Cirencester Abbey on the abbey's foundation. In 1896 the parish of Eisey (as it was then written) was added to Latton parish, extending it to the east and south and more than doubling its area. In 1984, after the A419 had been straightened to bypass Cricklade, land on the town's side of the road was transferred to Cricklade parish. = Eysey = The ancient parish of Eisey or Eysey lay east of Latton. In the Middle Ages there were settlements at Eisey and Water Eaton, which have both dwindled to farms. There was a small church at Eisey from the 12th century or earlier until its closure in 1948; the church of St Mary that was demolished in 1953 was a rebuilding of 1844. There had been a dependant chapel at Water Eaton, dedicated to St Laurence, from the 12th century or earlier until the 17th. In 1819 a united parish of Latton with Eisey was created. Church Church of St John the Baptist The present Church of England parish church of St John dates from the 12th century. The lower part of the tower, the tower arch and chancel arch are from that century, and there is a late 12th century south door; the transepts are c. 1300. 19th-century restoration included partial rebuilding by William Butterfield in 1858-63; the nave was restored in 1992. The tower has five bells, four of them dated 1709 and made by the elder Abraham Rudhall. The church was designated as Grade I listed in 1955. In 1819, Latton was united with the neighbouring ecclesiastical parish of Eisey. In 1952 Latton was united with two Cricklade parishes, and outlying parts of the former Eisey parish were transferred to its neighbours. Today the parish is part of the Upper Thames benefice.  Transport  The Thames and Severn Canal, opened in 1789, passed through the parish, connecting Stroud with the Thames at Lechlade until its closure in 1933. Near the village was a junction with the North Wilts Canal, a branch of the Wilts & Berks Canal which provided a connection to Swindon from 1819 until 1914. The road which followed the route of Ermin Street was designated the A419 in 1922 and became a trunk road in 1946. In 1997, Latton village was bypassed to the west by a new section of the A419.  Economy  Gravel extraction began on a small scale in the 16th century, and extensive extraction of sand and gravel from land south-west of Ermin Street was begun in the mid 1990s. Two lakes from these workings form an extension of the Cotswold Water Park. The Co-Operative Wholesale Society had a creamery near Latton from 1935, which employed some 139 people in 1956; it closed in around 1996.

A president of the American Gynecological and Obstetrical Society, Andrews also served on the Norfolk City Council for 26 years and was mayor from 1992-1994.\\"Timeline: Mason Andrews' remarkable career\\", The Virginian- Pilot, October 14, 2006 America's first \\"test tube baby\\" Andrews had attended the birth of about 5,000 babies in Norfolk before delivering Elizabeth Carr by Caesarian section on December 28, 1981, at the Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS), which he had played a leading role in creating just a few years earlier.Sullivan, Patricia, \\"Mason Andrews; In Vitro Pioneer Physician\\", The Washington Post. October 15, 2006, page C8 Writing at the time of Andrews' death, Patricia Sullivan of The Washington Post observed that \\"[t]he birth of the first U.S. 'test-tube baby' gave hope to hundreds of thousands of U.S. women who were unable to become pregnant. Carr was the first of about 330,000 babies who have since been born through in vitro fertilization in the United States, according to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine.\\" Creation of a medical school Andrews' community service began during the 1950s as a member of the Norfolk Chamber of Commerce and the Health Welfare and Recreation Planning Council. While serving as president of the Norfolk County Medical Society, Andrews appointed a bipartisan committee to study the need for a medical school in the area. The study was able to convince the Virginia General Assembly of the need for a new medical school.The Papers of Mason C. Andrews, Old Dominion University In 1964, the Eastern Virginia Medical Center Authority was formed with the charge of developing the new medical school. Andrews served as the chairman of the authority from 1964-1970. Speaking in 2006, EVMS President Harry T. Lester stated that \\"Dr. Andrews is rightfully seen as the prime mover behind EVMS.\\"\\"EVMS honors the memory of its 'prime mover'\\", Eastern Virginia Medical School, November 1, 2006 Under Andrews' leadership, a medical center complex was built in an area that had once been slums. The medical complex now consists of the EVMS campus, Norfolk General Hospital, the Medical Tower, the Norfolk Public Health Department, Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters and the Tidewater Rehabilitation Institute. In addition, as chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at EVMS, Andrews was instrumental in bringing the team of Drs. Howard and Georgeanna Jones to Norfolk. The Drs. Jones specialized in treating infertility problems. In 1981, they brought international attention to Norfolk with the role they played in Elizabeth Carr's birth. With the success of the in-vitro fertilization program, the Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine was founded in 1983. Norfolk visionary During his tenure on the city council (1974-2000), Andrews was instrumental in the redevelopment of the downtown waterfront. Andrews introduced the developer of the Baltimore Inner Harbor, James Rouse, to Norfolk. Rouse designed the Waterside Festival Marketplace for the Norfolk waterfront. City officials largely credit Andrews for the opening of Waterside as well as Town Point Park and Nauticus on the waterfront and for the city's bold decision to spend tens of millions of dollars to open the $300 million MacArthur Center mall. MacArthur Center, considered a risky investment, has generated millions of dollars in direct tax revenue to the city above and beyond its debt service and has become a catalyst for development of Norfolk's historic retail center along Granby Street.Minium, Harry and Messina, Debbie, \\"Dr. Mason Andrews 1919 - 2006 Remembering Norfolk's visionary, Dr. Mason Andrews\\", The Virginian-Pilot, Oct 14, 2006, Page 1 Other downtown projects promoted by Andrews included the Norfolk campus of Tidewater Community College. \\"In many ways, he was the architect of downtown as we now know it,\\" said Cathy Coleman, of the Downtown Norfolk Council. Quoted by The Virginian- Pilot in 2006, Coleman remarked that \\"(Andrews') imprint is everywhere, from the waterfront to Main Street to Tidewater Community College to the medical center to the streetscapes ‚Äì it just goes on and on.\\" Andrews promoted a downtown development strategy that combined meticulous planning with millions of dollars of city money to lure private investment. Once the region's retail core, downtown had been decimated by suburban shopping malls. Waterfront property was considered so cheap that it was used for parking. Andrews championed downtown Norfolk as the Hampton Roads region's business and entertainment center. The waterfront, he said, should become the focal point of downtown life. By the time of his death, what was once regarded as his farfetched vision had been realized. Education and family Andrews graduated from Maury High School, and later received his bachelor's degree in Chemistry from Princeton University in 1940 and his M.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1943 where he completed his residency as well. Andrews taught Obstetrics and Gynecology at Johns Hopkins and later at EVMS. Andrews began a successful OB/GYN private practice in Norfolk in 1950. Andrews was married to Sabine Alston Goodman Andrews for 57 years. They had two daughters, Jean and Mason. Elizabeth Carr would grow up to become a newspaper reporter in Augusta, Maine and later worked for boston.com. \\"The running joke in my family was that Mason, whom we called Mace the Ace, had the plans for Waterside at the same time I was about to be born,\\" she said. \\"My parents always said we were Mace's two babies.\\" She said Andrews made a point of staying in touch with her, always called her on holidays and sent her a wedding gift. \\"I grew up on Mason's lap,\\" she said. \\"Every time we got together, he would make a point to take my family out to dinner and would always make sure I was keeping my grades up.\\" References External links *Norfolk Public Library: The Mayors of Norfolk * \\"Excerpts from Dr. Mason Andrews' speeches, essays\\", The Virginian-Pilot, October 14, 2006 * Krauss, Sam Fox, \\"Andrews '40 left mark on medicine\\", The Daily Princetonian, October 20, 2006 * \\"EVMS to name building for Mason Andrews\\", Eastern Virginia Medical School, January 25, 2007 * Mason Andrews Service and Science Building at the Norfolk Campus of Tidewater Community College 1919 births 2006 deaths Mayors of Norfolk, Virginia American gynecologists American obstetricians Princeton University alumni Johns Hopkins University alumni 20th-century American politicians ","title":"Mason Andrews"},{"id":"21147006","text":"Aleksandrowo is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Wronki, within Szamotu≈Çy County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, in west-central Poland.

These include violins, violas, cellos, double basses, viola d'amore, viola da gamba, etc. The French word for bowmaker (bow maker) is archetier for one who makes bows of the string family of instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass. Root of the word comes from archet‚Äîpronounced ‚Äîthe bow. A bow maker typically uses between 150 and 200 hairs from the tail of a horse for a violin bow. Bows for other members of the violin family typically have a wider ribbon, using more hairs. White hair generally produces a smoother sound and black hair (used mainly for double bass bows) is coarser, producing a rougher sound. Lower quality (inexpensive) bows often use nylon or synthetic hair. Rosin, a hard, sticky substance made from resin (sometimes mixed with wax), is regularly applied to the bow hair to increase friction. In making the stick of a bow, the initial part of the woodworking is done on a straight stick. According to James McKean, \\"the bow maker graduates the stick in precise gradations so that it is evenly flexible throughout.\\"*McKean, James N. (1996) Commonsense Instrument Care. San Anselmo, California: String Letter Publishing. These gradations were calculated by Fran√ßois Tourte, discussed below. In order to shape the curve or \\"camber\\" of the bow stick, the maker carefully heats the stick over a source of heat (such as an alcohol flame or a heat gun) a few inches at a time, bending the heated stick gradually to the proper shape. A metal or wooden template is often used to get the exact model's curve and shape while heating.  History  engraving of Fran√ßois Xavier Tourte 1818 Up until the standardization of the bow by Fran√ßois Tourte c1785, most bows with rare exceptions remained anonymous (before 1750). Gennady Filimonov And although Fran√ßois Tourte attained an enormous measure of fame in his own lifetime, the tradition of the anonymous bow maker was still so strong that theorists like Woldemar and Fetis called Tourte's new-model bow not the Tourte bow but the Viotti bow, after his contemporary the violinist. David Boyden (After his father's death, Tourte, in collaboration with the violin virtuoso G. B. Viotti, made important changes in the form of the bow in the Classical period between 1785 and 1790. They lengthened them slightly, to 74 ‚Äì 75 centimetres, and used more wood in the tip and a heavier nut.) With the dawn of a new era in the introduction of the modern bow design by Fran√ßois Tourte, so too was the importance placed on the bow maker rather than the luthier to produce such playing tools.  Quotes  \\"Giovanni Battista Viotti, the 18th- century violin virtuoso who is rumored to have consulted with Tourte on the bows formulation, to declare: Le violon, c‚Äôest l‚Äôarchet - the violin, it is the bow. The bow is so crucial that much of the music of Beethoven, Brahms and Schubert and their musical heirs would not be performable without it....\\" Saving the Music Tree \\"The French bow maker Fran√ßois-Xavier Tourte, more commonly known as Fran√ßois Tourte or Tourte le jeune, is often referred to as \\"the inventor of the modern bow,\\" or \\"the Stradivari of the bow.\\" His bows, dating from the end of the eighteenth century and the early decades of the nineteenth, had a marked effect upon the timbre of violins and upon performance practice, enabling new forms of expression and articulation to be developed, and in particular, facilitating the increased use of legato. Fran√ßois Joseph F√©tis's entry in the second, expanded edition of his Biographie universelle des musiciens et bibliographie g√©n√©rale de la musique (1860‚Äì65) has until recently been the only source of biographical information about Fran√ßois Tourte. Some thirty documents recently discovered in French archives provide further fresh insight into this maker's life and work.\\" Stewart Pollens, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York \\"Tourte - French family of bowmakers and luthiers. It Nicolas Pierre Tourte and his sons Nicolas L√©onard and Fran√ßois Xavier and perhaps Charles Tourte, son of Nicolas L√©onard.

It is located to the north-east of Prague, at the military airport Kbely. Creation of the museum During the mid 1960s, the Prague Military Museum commenced a programme to recover, restore and preserve historic aircraft from around the country for eventual display at Kbely. Initially, one hangar was used, and about fifty aircraft were placed on public display. The aircraft collection continued to grow, and one of the original Wagner-type hangars on the airfield was brought into use, and now contains the earliest aircraft types on display. Another Picha-type hangar has also been added to bring the number of hangars housing the large and varied collection to four. The aircraft collection The collection at Kbely now includes 275 aircraft, of which approximately 110 are on public display at any given time. The museum contains many Czech designed and Czech built aircraft dating from World War I through World War II and up to 1960's with a collection of supersonic jet fighters. Several unique types are on display, including the early 1920s-built Avia BH-11C L-BONK. The period before World War II is represented with aircraft such as the Avia B-534. World War II models include a Soviet-built Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmovik, Avia S-92 (Czech version of Messerschmitt Me-262A Schwalbe in typical Czech colour), Avia CS-92 (Messerschmitt Me-262B Schwalbe in typical German camouflage), Lavochkin La-7. The formerly displayed fully authentic Supermarine Spitfire LF.IX flown by a Czech squadron of the Royal Air Force was transferred to the National Technical Museum in Prague in 2008. The post- World War II period is represented by aircraft such as the Avia S-199 and double seated Avia CS-199 (Messerschmitt Bf-109G with Jumo engine) and the Aero C3A (Siebel Si-204). In addition to the many military aircraft and helicopters on display, there are several Soviet-designed airliners, some of which were built under licence in Czechoslovakia. Airliners on display include the Avia 14M (Ilyushin Il-14), an Avia 14T, an ex-CSA Ilyushin Il-18 and a CSA Tupolev Tu-104. Light aircraft exhibited include the Czech-built Praga E-114 Air Baby of 1936, a Mraz Sokol, an Aero 45, an Orlican L-40 Meta Sokol and a Zlin 22 Junak. Helicopters on display include a HC-2 Heli-Baby designed by VZLU (V√Ωzkumn√Ω a zku≈°ebn√≠ leteck√Ω √∫stav). After 1 January 1993, when Czechoslovakia was divided, several aircraft were transferred from the collection to the Slovak Republic for inclusion in that country's aviation museums. Also, in recent years, the museum has exchanged several Czech, and Soviet-designed aircraft for aircraft from the USA, UK, Sweden, Switzerland and other countries.

Description  The market cross stands in the centre of the town, at the north end of the High Street. It was built c.1490, English Heritage say \\"Late C15/early C16\\" possibly using limestone salvaged from the recently ruined part of Malmesbury Abbey, which then began just across the market square from the cross. An elaborately carved octagonal structure of the Perpendicular Period, it is recognised as one of the best preserved of its kind in England, and was made a Grade I listed building in 1949. A carving in relief of the Crucifixion and figures of several saints have survived the Reformation on the open lantern, although the lower niches for figures are now empty. Inside there is a lierne vaulted roof with carved bosses, springing from a central column with stone seating around it. There is a low wall or bench across all the outside arches except two. The building is over 40 ft. high, and today is nicknamed \\"the Birdcage\\", because of its appearance, and still serves to shelter market traders by day and as a meeting point at night. It was described by John Leland, who visited Malmesbury in 1542, as follows: > Malmesbyri hath a good quik [lively] market kept every Saturday.

Nilsson (born May 6, 1940) is an American artist, one of the original Hairy Who Chicago Imagists, a group in the 1960s and 1970s who turned to representational art. Her paintings \\"set forth a surreal mixture of fantasy and domesticity in a continuous parade of chaotic images.\\"Lisa Stein, \\"Nilsson's Colors Continue to Get More Intense\\", Chicago Tribune, Thursday, October 15, 1998, section 2, page 5 She is married to fellow-artist and Hairy Who member Jim Nutt.Barbara B.

Her father was a factory worker for Sunbeam and her mother a waitress. She grew up on the north side of Chicago and attended Lake View High School, while also attending extracurricular drawing classes. Against her parents' blue collar sensibilities, she attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she met her future husband, fellow student Jim Nutt. Nilsson and Nutt married in July 1961, and their son, Claude, was born in 1962. Although Nilsson originally painted with oil paints, she switched to watercolors when pregnant in order to avoid the hazards of turpentine.Christine Newman, \\"When Jim Met Gladys\\", \\"Chicago\\" Magazine, Vol. 60 No. 2, February 2011, pp. 78-81,92,146-148,164 She initially found it difficult to strike a balance between motherhood and her career in painting, though she states that she never considered giving up painting. [citation needed] In 1963, Nilsson and Nutt were introduced to School of the Art Institute of Chicago art history professor Whitney Halstead, who became a teacher, mentor, and friend. He introduced them in turn to Don Baum, exhibition director at the Hyde Park Art Center in Chicago. In 1964 Nilsson and Nutt became youth instructors at the Hyde Park Art Center. Artistic Style Gladys Nilsson's influences were far ranging and included German Expressionism, 15th Century Italian painting, Egyptian tomb murals, Cubism, and, more specifically, Whitney Halstead, Kathleen Blackshear, James Ensor, George Grosz, Paul Klee, Georges Seurat, John Marin, and Charles Burchfield. The result was a style that bordered on surrealism and pop, fantasy and cartoon. She took the human figure as her main subject, magnifying, multiplying, and distorting these figures as she saw fit. =The Hairy Who Years= In 1964, Jim Nutt and Gladys Nilsson began to teach children's classes at the Hyde Park Art Center in Chicago. They and James Falconer approached the center's exhibitions director, Don Baum, with the idea of a group show consisting of the three of them and Art Green and Suellen Rocca. Baum agreed, and also suggested they include Karl Wirsum. The name of the group show, \\"Hairy Who?\\", became the name of the group. It was coined by Karl Wirsum as a reference to WFMT art critic Harry Bouras.Dan Nadel, \\"Hairy Who's history of the Hairy Who.\\" The Ganzfeld 3. New York: Monday Morning, 2003. p. 121-2. There were exhibitions at the Hyde Park Art Center in 1966, 1967, 1968, and 1969. The 1968 exhibition traveled to the San Francisco Art Institute, and the last show, in 1969, traveled to the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. =Later career= In 1969, the influential Chicago gallery owner Phyllis Kind agreed to represent Nilsson and Jim Nutt, giving both of them their first solo shows. In that same year Nilsson and Nutt moved to Sacramento, California, where he was an assistant professor of art at Sacramento State College. In 1973, Nilsson was the first Hairy Who member to have a solo show at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Two of her paintings were stolen from the show. In 1974 Nilsson and her family returned to Chicago. They have lived in Wilmette since 1976. Her overall style has not shown significant development since the Hairy Who years. From the 1960s through to today, she continues to crowd her paintings with wild allegories of human debauchery that remain refined and elegant despite the wackiness of the figures. Loopy people are often woven into heterosexual pairings and though their bodies may appear to react to stimulation, it seems just as possible that the protruding genitalia and bulging breasts are more a result of the forces within the structure of the composition. There are also strong themes of human existence that range from childhood to motherhood, coming of age to female fantasies of male adoration. Though her focus has always been watercolor on paper, Nilsson has also worked with collage, increasingly so in 2014. She admits that at a young age she loved playing with cut-out paper dolls. In her recent work, Nilsson cuts out imagery from fashion magazines to explore female ideals of beauty. She had a retrospective of her art in the spring of 2010 at the Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art in Chicago. Gladys Nilsson, Untitled, approx.1992, watercolor and gouache on paper, 26x40 in.
