He started in magic in 1960, his senior year in high school. In 1967, Schneider graduated from Wayne State University with a degree in physics, after seven years in school part time. During his free time he studied magic working toward his goal of a career in professional magic. In 1960, Schneider developed the Matrix magic trick, a trick where four cards are placed over four coins. The coins then invisibly move between cards. Matrix is a modernized version of Yank Hoe's \\"Sympathetic Coins\\". In 1969, Schneider left his job as a mathematician for Uniroyal and accepted a position as a systems analyst for Univac, specializing in computers. Univac transferred him to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he was employed as a systems programmer. In 1972, he began writing and publishing magic books after the computer industry suffered a downturn. He worked as an editor of house organ Goldshadow Newsletter and also as a dealer for Goldshadow Industries. Schneider theorized that \\"misdirection, while essential for effective magic, is actually a supporting technique to greater concept of hiding the spectators' false assumptions\\".

Situated on Sawtooth Ridge, Courtney Peak is protected by the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness within the Okanogan National Forest. Courtney Peak ranks 78th on Washington's highest 100 peaks, and 81st on the \\"Bulger List\\". The nearest higher peak is Star Peak, to the southeast. Precipitation runoff on the west side of the mountain drains into nearby Lake Chelan via Fish Creek, whereas the north side of the mountain drains into Oval Creek, and the east side drains into Buttermilk Creek, both of which are tributaries of the Twisp River. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1985 to remember James (Ray) Courtney (1920-1982), a commercial packer and lifelong resident of Stehekin. The immediate vicinity of this peak was a favorite destination for his guided outings. Ray Courtney died in an accident while leading such a pack trip with 29 hikers when the horse he was riding lost its footing and fell down a gully. Southeast ridge of Courtney Climate Lying east of the Cascade crest, the area around Courtney Peak is a bit drier than areas to the west. Summers can bring warm temperatures and occasional thunderstorms. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. With its impressive height, Courtney Peak can have snow on it in late-spring and early-fall, and can be very cold in the winter. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Design and development As early as 1933, Alksandr Moskalyev was designing a rocket-powered, tailless aircraft with an ogival or gothic delta wing, wingtip fins and rudders, which would be able to fly faster than sound. Because no sufficiently powerful engines were available at the time, the Moskalyev SAM-4 Sigma never left the drawing board but it did lead to two interim types, the SAM-7 Sigma and SAM-9 Strela. The all-metal Sigma was intended to investigate the manoeuvrability and field of fire of a two seat, tailless, wingtip finned fighter aircraft, using a less radical low aspect ratio, trapezoidal plan wing. This low wing had two spars and trailing edges carrying inboard elevators and outboard ailerons. The fins bore balanced rudders; six Soviet diagrams show different profiles and no photographs of the completed Sigma are known. The Sigma was powered by a V-12 Mikulin AM-34 engine mounted ahead of the wing leading edge and driving a four blade, wooden propeller. At high speeds it was cooled with surface radiators, supplemented at low speed by a retractable radiator. The pilot sat over mid chord in an enclosed cockpit. The fuselage ended behind the trailing edge with a glazed and enclosed position for the rear gunner. It had conventional, retractable landing gear with single landing legs hinging inward on the forward spars. There was a small, semi-recessed tailwheel in the extreme rear fuselage. The Sigma was first flown in October 1935. It was judged dangerous to fly as it was hard to keep straight during take-offs and had a high landing speed of . Its flight characteristics were never fully explored and it never reached its estimated top speed of at altitude.

Ltd. was a London-based boutique private equity firm that specialized in investments in the Middle East and especially Iraq, where it was one of the largest such firms. It was in existence from 2001 to 2018. Origins The firm was founded by Basil Al Rahim ‚Äì who came from a wealthy Iraqi family and was a former executive for The Carlyle Group ‚Äì in 2001, with a number of wealthy figures from Arab and Gulf countries as partners. (Its origins lay in an earlier private equity firm, Safron Advisors, which had been founded in 1998 and which covered the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey.) Within the next couple of years, MerchantBridge expanded into the areas of corporate finance and government advisory work. The firm sought to embody a foreign direct investment aspect as well. The firm's headquarters were on Sloane Street in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea within London. A number of prominent Britons became advisors to MerchantBridge, including Norman Lamont, Peter Palumbo, Baron Palumbo, Elizabeth Symons, Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean, and Andrew Buxton. Investments In the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, MerchantBridge did a number of investment deals in that country. These included investments in Iraq by the Qatar National Bank, Qatar Telecom, and Lafarge Cement among others. The partnership with Lafarge was especially beneficial. The firm opened an office in Baghdad in November 2003. Al Rahim professed great faith in the potential of post-war Iraq as a business opportunity, saying in an April 2004 interview with the Financial News that he walked around Baghdad without security guards or concerns for his safety and that Iraq \\"is potentially the most interesting market of the next however many years. If the economic experiment goes right, we will see gross domestic product in Iraq grow 15-fold in the next seven or eight years. MerchantBridge is in a unique position, frankly, to be the leading player.\\" He was well- connected in political circles, as his sister Rend al-Rahim Francke was Ambassador of Iraq to the United States. According to the organization Corporate Watch, MerchantBridge ranked 44th out of 66 UK companies in terms of making money in post-invasion Iraq. MerchantBridge engaged in a number of investments elsewhere in the Middle East, such as a 2008 one with UBS that enabled the Swiss bank to set up operations in Saudi Arabia. By 2008, the firm had opened additional offices in Luxembourg, Saudi Arabia, and Dubai. MerchantBridge persisted in trying to tap the potential of Iraq. Given the difficulties of the Iraqi post-war insurgency and sectarian violence in that country, the business environment was a challenge, but by 2009 about a third of MerchantBridge's revenues came from investments in Iraq. Al Rahim said, \\"To win in Iraq you have to have a genuine desire to stay the course and navigate the obstacles.\\" In 2010 it sought to raise $50 million for a new investment vehicle, called the Mesopotamia Fund, in the country. It especially sought out investors in the United Kingdom. Eric Le Blan, the COO of MerchantBridge, said, \\"Similar to Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Gulf Cooperation Council in the previous decade, Iraq represents a unique investment opportunity and despite appearances is definitely open for business. Whilst other European countries such as France and Italy have recognised its huge potential, the UK's limited presence is noticeable. We are going to change that.\\" This first $50 million tranche of funds was indeed successfully raised. The firm did sometimes branch into other areas, such as the 2011 creation of the company UnXis, in partnership with Stephen Norris Capital Partners, to purchase the assets of troubled US software company The SCO Group. The acquisition had been in the works for two years at that point. Loss, legal actions, and dissolution On 4 February 2011, founder and CEO Basil Al Rahim was one of seven people who died in a plane crash aboard a company private jet flying from Sulaimaniyah International Airport in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, which crashed shortly after takeoff following an engine fire. Another MerchantBridge founding partner, Abdullah Lahoud, as well as two bankers from JP Morgan and three aircraft personnel, also died in the crash. The loss of Al Rahim and Lahoud left the firm, according to reporting in the Abu Dhabi newspaper The National, \\"in disarray\\", with \\"[its] future ... in question\\". Several senior executives left, with Le Blan, who became Acting CEO, the only one remaining. The firm's offices in Saudi Arabia and Dubai were closed. There was a legal dispute between Al Rahim's estate and shareholders of the firm regarding an investment the firm had made in Iraqi telecommunications company Asiacell. That dispute was settled out of court in 2012. By 2014, Al Rahim's estate, and some of the companies that MerchantBridge had invested in, were caught up before the High Court of Justice in London in another legal dispute, involving claims by a founding partner of the firm that Al Rahim had short-changed him regarding the investment in Asiacell. MerchantBridge became inactive, and in March 2018, it was dissolved and formally struck off the registry at Companies House.

A Finger Lickin' Good Dating Simulator is an otome dating sim developed by Psyop. The video game was commissioned by the restaurant chain KFC and released for free on Steam on September 24, 2019. A parody of conventional dating sims, the primary objective of the player is to develop a romantic relationship with a fictionalized version of KFC's founder Colonel Sanders, portrayed as an attractive classmate at a cooking school. The release of the game follows the reintroduction of Colonel Sanders into KFC's marketing campaigns in 2015, and is part of the company's strategy to make the Colonel a \\"part of pop culture\\", reimagining the historical figure for modern times. The game successfully received public attention due to the \\"can-you- believe-it\\" premise both before and after the game's release.  Gameplay  Screenshot of the game showing the Van Van and Colonel Sanders characters The game takes place over a three-day semester at the fictional University of Cooking School: Academy for Learning, where the player character is studying to become a chef. The player is presented with dialog choices that present opportunities to win Sanders' favor, as well as interact with the other characters in the story, including the player's best friend Miriam, rivals Aeshleigh and Van Van the Man Man, Sprinkles/Professor Dog, and other students Bob, Clank the robot, and the nameless Student. A single playthrough takes about an hour, not including replaying different story line branches.  Reception  I Love You, Colonel Sanders! received an overall lukewarm response from professional reviewers. In her review for Kotaku, Gita Jackson criticized the game's lack of emotional depth and over-reliance on \\"zaniness\\", comparing it unfavorably to other \\"goofy\\" dating sims like Hatoful Boyfriend and Nameless. Nicole Carpenter of Polygon reviewed the game in the context of KFC's apparent marketing strategy to distance the Colonel Sanders mascot from the actual person. She criticized it as \\"less of a game and more of a marketing stunt\\", with very little actual interactivity, and felt that it contributed to a trend in the video game industry of lack of respect for the dating sim genre. KeenGamers review by Dakota Gordon echoed other writer's criticism of the shallow gameplay, but conceded that KFC and Psyop obviously did not intend for the game to be taken seriously and that it was enjoyable when viewed with through a more casual lens, as evidenced by the 100% user approval rating on Steam at the time of writing. Gordon additionally praised the anime-inspired art and visuals of the game, in particular Van Van's design who was described as \\"right out of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\\". The art was also praised by Jenny Zhang of Eater, comparing it favorably to Ouran High School Host Club. The review-aggregator website Metacritic gave the game an aggregate score of 50/100 based on critic's reviews.

CCPAC, originally housed at George Washington Carver High School, was developed in 1982 to accommodate the growing need for specialized arts instruction for students. CCPAC began as a day program where students were bused from home schools to the Carver High School campus for magnet classes. As the program expanded and enrollment grew there became a need to find a new location. In 1994, MPS received a $7,000,000 federal grant to fund several magnet schools including Carver Creative and Performing Arts Center. A former shopping mall, Normandale Shopping Center, was selected as the future location for CCPAC. In 1995, a tornado destroyed the Normandale Shopping Center. CCPAC began to operate out of four locations while searching for a new home. In 1996, CCPAC to become a designated magnet school housed on the campus of the old Booker T.

In 1937, plans were made to open a senior high. A thirty-room unit was constructed after several of the original structures were demolished in 1948. A 123-foot underground tunnel was developed to connect each side of the campus. The adjoining auditorium-gymnasium was constructed in 1954. In 1956, Booker T. Washington became a high school. Booker T. Washington Magnet High School (1996-2018) In 1996, a federal grant enabled the school to become a designated magnet school housed on the campus of the old Booker T.

She served time in an Egyptian jail before she was released and she went to live in Israel.  Life  Ninio was born in Cairo in 1929. Her father Ya‚Äôacov was Bulgarian and her mother, Fanny, was Turkish. Her father died when she was young and she went to both Catholic and Jewish schools. Ninio joined a Jewish club, but she was more interested in basketball than in Zionism and she was considered to join Egypt's Olympic squad. Ninio was recruited to act as a liaison for an Israeli spy cell in 1951. She was the only woman and her colleagues noted how unafraid she was, although it is not clear that she was aware of the dangers involved in her activities. The cell became active in 1954 in activities that were intended to sour relations between Egypt and the Western countries. The members of the cell that she was in were arrested after one of the cell members had a device go off prematurely whilst he was at the cinema. This caused embarrassment in Israel and the Defence Minister, Pinhas Lavon's, resignation made this \\"the Lavon Affair\\". Lavon and the Prime Minister denied any knowledge of their activities, but Lavon was named by one of the accused. The trial began on 11 December and lasted until 27 January 1955; two of the accused (Moshe Marzouk and Shmuel Azar) were condemned to execution by hanging, two were acquitted, and the rest received lengthy prison terms. Maurice Orbach, on behalf of both Winston Churchill and the World Jewish Congress, went to Cairo to unsuccessfully plead for the lives of those sentenced to death. The trial was criticised in Israel as a show trial, although the Israeli public were led to believe that the defendants were innocent. It was said that evidence had been extracted by torture. Israeli President Zalman Shazar met with the released operatives in 1968, (from left to right): Ninio, Philip Nathanson, and Robert Dessa. After serving seven-year jail sentences, two of the imprisoned operatives (Meir Meyuhas and Meir Za'afran) were released in 1962. Ninio and the rest were freed in February 1968, in a secret addendum to a prisoner-of-war exchange. It was her marriage in 1971 that led to the Israeli people knowing more about the Lavon Affair. When she married Ely Boger, Golda Meir attended the celebrations and she chatted with Ninio about her time in prison. The meeting with Meir was taken as a sign by the authorities that more secrets could be revealed. Ninio attended Tel Aviv University and learnt Hebrew to add to the French and English she had learnt at school. Lt. Gen. Moshe Ya‚Äôalon recognised her work in 2005 when she, Robert Dassa and Meir Zafran were given a military rank in the Israeli military. Ninio died in Hod HaSharon in 2019.

Set in 1900s Andean Venezuelan gangland, it retells the story of Shakespeare's Macbeth. The film had a poor critical reception and low box office turnout. It was selected as the Venezuelan entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 76th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.  Synopsis  The story of Macbeth, King of Scotland is reimagined in early-twentieth-century Venezuela; the king is represented as Maximiliano (Max), a gang member. The gang, who hide in the mountains and subsist by stealing furniture and artwork from transport vans, is first lead by a man called Dur√°n; Max is one of the youngest members but also a favorite of Dur√°n's. At one point, Max sees witches in the mountains, who tell him that he will become the boss; shortly after this his wife, Mileidi (or Milady), convinces him to kill Dur√°n. Scared of the power and position he now holds, Max's mental state deteriorates. In the book Shakespeares After Shakespeare: An Encyclopedia of the Bard in Mass Media and Popular Culture, the film is described as a \\"predominantly faithful version\\" of the story; in the book Shakespeare on screen: Macbeth, the film is referred to as a \\"loose adaptation\\".  Cast  The cast of the film is from the Rajatabla theatre company, \\"the most Shakespearean company in Venezuela\\"; the main characters are played by Daniel Alvarado (as Max) and Karina G√≥mez (as Mileidi/Milady; pronounced m'lady). Dur√°n is played by Alfonso Rivas.  Production  Leonardo Henr√≠quez wrote the screenplay for Sangrador based on the Shakespeare play Macbeth. The film, which he also directed, is his third feature. He has said that he was experimenting with the story of Macbeth and the language of Shakespeare, saying that \\"although one of the reasons for making this film was to get into the aesthetic aspects of Macbeth\\", he also wanted to \\"[learn] from its perfect dramaturgy\\" and \\"see how far a playwright [Shakespeare] so alien, so embedded in his time, can cross the border of language and historical complexities.\\" Henr√≠quez also said at the time of the film's release that he thought the story of \\"a desperate madman [clumsy] for power\\" would be accessible in Latin America. The film was made in 2000 for less than $300,000, filming primarily in the southwestern Andes region of Venezuela, and was intended for release in 2002; its release date was pushed back many times and it was screened at many international film festivals before being shown in its own country. Ultimately, only two films were released in Venezuela in 2002; Sangrador was the only release in 2003. It is in black-and-white, with cinematography by Cesary Jaworski, art direction by Diego R√≠squez, and sound direction by Stefano Gramito. It was filmed on 35 mm movie film.  Reception  = Public and critical response = The film saw a year-end box office attendance of 31, earning Bs.120,800; by 2016 its total box office attendance was 142 people, and it had made Bs.432,550 during public release. However, it was submitted in 2003 as the Venezuelan entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, not being nominated, and was nominated as the Best Spanish Language Film at the 2004 Goya Awards. A review in Republica said that it was both a bad adaptation, referring to it as a \\"disgusting and appalling version of a great work\\", and a bad film. The review mainly sees the attempt at adaptation as bad for the film, saying that it is worse off for this; it does not stay close to the original; is \\"pretentious\\"; and will be scrutinized more for tackling such a famous work, thus exposing more failings. The review also criticizes the choice to make the film aesthetically black-and-white, suggesting this conflicts with the title (which means \\"bleeder\\") and noting that it makes the audience expect more depth than is present. Though accepting there were budget restrictions that caused extras to play living trees, the review criticizes the creative team for being too ambitious within their limits. The review generally criticizes the performances. In addition, it writes that some of Alvarado's speeches are good, but are responded to with such poor delivery that it becomes humorous; G√≥mez is praised for her acting skills and capturing the character of Lady Macbeth, but the reviewer equally notes that having one good actor among a poor cast makes the performances noticeably clash. Relating to the technological side, the reviewer notes the cinematography is good but also clashes with poorer aspects, and heavily criticizes the sound. Though the review repeatedly commends the effort and dedication of the production, it concludes that the film is bad. = Academic analysis = In academic literature, Diana Medina Mel√©ndez wrote that the film began a wave of early-21st-century adaptations made in the country. Alternative pdf Inmaculada Gordillo √Ålvarez notes that it is among the film adaptations that have taken the story of Macbeth and used it to frame a localized narrative. Hatchuel, Vienne-Guerrin, and Bladen write that the three witches are shown as naked, young and attractive, and that they have animal tattoos. This is imagery used in a later adaptation of Macbeth, which the authors see as \\"beyond a simple coincidence\\". The film is included in their analysis of modern adaptations choosing to make the witches attractive, suggested as fulfilling modern genre expectations. Mark Thornton Burnett finds that the film makes use of the Venezuelan landscape to reflect both the main character's internal struggle, through cloud forests, and the landscape of the original play, through nearby plains; he also writes that the \\"glimpses of fortifications\\" of the film show the real threat to the gang is from the landscape rather than outside people. In their book, Levenson and Ormsby write that the portrayal of Max veers into folk-heroism, bringing to mind national figures like Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and Hugo Ch√°vez. They add that the play being a \\"political tragedy\\" has been used in the film \\"at a number of registers [...] to reflect on militaristic authoritarianism in an explicitly Venezuelan guise\\", also using imagery of the Archangel Michael commanding a heavenly army. Further from this, the authors note that the film is characterized by extensive Catholic imagery.

Snowflake was founded in 1878, and incorporated in 1917. Some of the structures of historical significance are individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Snowflake has a historical district known as the Snowflake Townsite Historic District. The district is Roughly bounded by 3rd Street North, Stinson, 2nd Street South, and Hulet Street. Brief history Erastus SnowWilliam Jordan FlakeThe James M. Flake House The town of Snowflake is located by the White Mountains of Arizona. The Mogollon, Sinagua, Anasazi and Hohokam Tribes were the primary inhabitants of the region from 1100 to 1400 A.D. The area is home to the White Mountain and San Carlos Apache Tribes.White Mountains Arizona James Pearce was appointed by Erastus Snow, a Mormon Apostle,Snow, Charles C. Rich, Lorenzo Snow, and Franklin D. Richards were ordained on the same day to fill four vacancies in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. to begin the colonization process of the Silver Creek Valley in Arizona. During his journey he stopped at James Stinson's Ranch. Stinson was developing his land and according to Pearce, he asked for too much money and therefore Pearce moved three miles further down and set up a camp. Many families moved to the area where the camp was established and the community of Taylor was founded.National Register of Historic Places The founding of Snowflake In 1877, the LDS Church President Brigham Young asked William Jordan Flake, to start a settlement in the northern area of what was then the Arizona Territory. Flake and his family joined a wagon train which was headed for the Little Colorado River region of Arizona. After he arrived there, he was confronted with many hardships and began looking for a new place to live. He met James Stinson and was able to negotiate a price for the ranch which Stinson wanted to sell. Flake returned to Utah to seek the counsel and blessings of Erastus Snow. Snow gave Flake his advice and suggested that Flake divide the Stinson Ranch into city lots and first- and second-class farm plots. There were twenty blocks in the original townsite each containing 4 lots. The townsite was named Snowflake in honor of Erastus Snow and William Flake.History of Snowflake The residential areas of the town grew as settlers moved into Snowflake. The majority of the homes in the Snowflake Townsite Historic District were built of logs or adobe during this period. Skilled artisans were sent by the Latter Day Saints church in Utah to help with the settlers of new colonies. They taught their skills to the pioneers. Ralph Ramsay carved a horse's head and a large horseshoe in the middle of the third- story gable Of the three story house to adorn the home which he built for James Madison Flake. The first LDS church in Snowflake was the Stinson/Flake Ranch house which is actually the oldest house in Snowflake. In 1884, the officials of the territorial government used a federal law against polygamy to bring charges against some of the Mormon leaders. William J. Flake was among the accused and he was sent to the territorial prison in Yuma for six months. Fearing further prosecutions other Mormon leaders with plural wives fled the territory, some returning to Utah. Hard economic times fell upon Snowflake during this period, however the church in Utah lend them a helping hand. Wilford Woodruff, President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and President of the Board of Education for the Church, believed that Snowflake should establish an Academy for higher education. He wrote to the LDS Church leadership in regard to his thoughts. The Stake Board of Education in Snowflake approved the construction of the Stake Academy. The original Stake Academy building burned down in 1911 and was replaced by the current structure built in 1911.Snowflake Stake Academy Erastus Snow had recently appointed Jessie Nathaniel Smith to the presidency of the newly created Eastern Arizona Stake of Zion. Together with his son-in-law, John Riley Hulet and family, he moved to Snowflake in 1879. Hulet was one of the founders of the Snowflake Cooperative Store and the Arizona Cooperative Mercantile Institution. He became Snowflake's postmaster in 1883. William Jordan Flake died on August 10, 1932 in Snowflake. He was survived by 11 sons and nine daughters. Erastus Snow died on May 27, 1888 in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.Erastus Snow Though the Stinson/Flake Ranch House is the oldest house of the original Snowflake townsite, it is not the oldest structure there. The circa 1858, primitive cabin where William Jordan Flake once lived was relocated from Beaver, Utah, by the Flake families and is now located within the property of the house of James Madison Flake and family. Snowflake Townsite Historic District The Snowflake Townsite Historic District is roughly bounded by 3rd Street North, Stinson, 2nd Street South, and Hulet Street. The area consists of the 20 block area of the original townsite. The district contains residential and commercial buildings of various styles reflecting the historic appearance and development patterns prevalent in Snowflake and other Mormon-settled towns of the region.

She moved to the University of New England in Australia for her graduate studies and earned her master's degree in environmental management in 1999. Bell was a doctoral student at Murdoch University, where she worked on sustainability and technology policy and completed her PhD in 2004. In 2005 Bell joined University College London.  Research and career  After moving to the United Kingdom, Bell was awarded an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Research Fellowship on Living With Environmental Change. Her research considers urban water systems and infrastructure provision, and involves collaboration between engineers and their local communities. Bell has studied the ability of health systems to respond to climate change. She has worked with AECOM, Thames Water and Arup Group. She was promoted to Professor in September 2018. Bell identified that there was not much collaboration between engineers, architects and local communities. In an effort to mitigate this lack of communication, Bell founded the University College London Engineering Exchange. She worked with UCL Urban Laboratory to launch a review into social housing, which identified that demolition decisions are often made by professional bodies without adequate engagement with residents. She is part of the Community Water Management for a Liveable London (CAMELLIA), which looks to improve decision making through community and industry engagement. As part of CAMELLIA Bell has looked to make London's water supply more sustainable. Bell is committed to teaching and her efforts have been recognised by the Royal Academy of Engineering and University College London. She is a Fellow of the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management and Institution of Civil Engineers. = Selected publications =  *  References  Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:British women engineers Category:Academics of University College London Category:University of Western Australia alumni Category:University of New England (Australia) alumni Category:Murdoch University alumni Category:Fellows of the Institution of Civil Engineers Category:Environmental engineers ","title":"Sarah Bell (engineer)"},{"id":"62624018","text":"KFF Llapi () is a women's football club based in Podujev√´, Kosovo.

Lucy had many ailments but was adopted by Lisa Garner who campaigned with vet Marc Abraham to prevent further maltreatment of such dogs. To address this issue, an amendment to the existing licensing regulations was passed into law in May 2019 by Michael Gove. The instrument was the Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2019. The law came into effect in April 2020, with licensed commercial traders no longer allowed to sell kittens or puppies as pets if they were less than six months old and they had not been bred by the seller. Even though Lucy had been maltreated in Wales, where there were many puppy farms, the regulations only applied to England.

Gate faults like that are especially common in alpine ski racing, but can also occur in other sports like ski cross or snowboarding.  Rules  Steve Missillier right after straddling a slalom gate (Zagreb 2015) According to rule 661.4 of the International Ski Federation's international ski competition rules (ICR) a gate is passed correctly if both ski tips and both feet cross an imaginary line between two gate poles. This is not the case for a straddle which means a gate fault is committed. Most frequently straddles happen in slalom skiing where the athletes are able to run the narrowest line due to the flex-pole technique. In some cases straddles lead to falls, especially when the pressure induced by the pole loosens the binding of the inside ski. Continuing the race after a straddle (ICR rule 628.8) ‚Äì no matter whether it happens unnoticed or not ‚Äì demands a disqualificaton and eventually a fine of 999 Swiss francs.  Famous examples  In January 2012 several supposed straddles by Marcel Hirscher in the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup caused a controversy. After actually straddling a gate in the Wengen and Kitzb√ºhel slaloms without noticing, rumours spread that he might have also straddled the first gates during his victory runs in Zagreb and Adelboden. His rival and contender for the overall world cup Ivica Kosteliƒá was infuriated by that. After hours of video analysis, Hirscher and his mate Felix Neureuther who also was accused of straddling in the Zagreb race could be acquitted from the allegations. What was dubbed \\"Einf√§dler- Aff√§re\\" (\\"straddling affair\\") by Austrian media was settled by a public handshake between Hirscher/Neureuther and Kosteliƒá before the slalom night race in Schladming. From that on Hirscher used special fixtures for his ski tips (in German \\"Geierschn√§bel\\") that shall reduce the straddling risk while skiing through the gates the narrowest line possible. Possibly race-deciding straddles during important races occurred to Bode Miller and Benjamin Raich whilst competing for the Olympic gold medal at the alpine combined in Torino 2006 or Marcel Hirscher in the world championship slalom in Beaver Creek 2015. Stefan Luitz straddled the final gate of the first run during the Olympic giant slalom in Sochi 2014 just before crossing the finish line and setting the second best intermediate time.

Briscoe was known for his two autobiographies about spending much of his childhood living in Nazi Germany.  Biography  = Early life = Deutsche Jungvolk (junior section of the Hitler Youth) Paul Briscoe was born in Streatham, south-west London, on 12 July 1930. His father was a clerk who died in 1932 and his mother was a freelance journalist with fascist sympathies and little affection for her son whose care she primarily left to a nanny. In 1935, she took her son on a tour of Germany with her German boyfriend; they spent many months living in hotels and guesthouses around the country whilst Norah Briscoe wrote about the experience for British publications. When his mother returned home to continue her career and later drifted away from her fianc√©e, Briscoe was left with his parents in Miltenberg, Bavaria . He moved in with them permanently when he was six, so that he could attend school. Later in life, he would write that the ideology of the Nazi party and antisemitism was taught in his lessons and how at the age of eight years old he was taken by his teachers to a local synagogue and sent in to loot it during kristallnacht. When, at the outbreak of the second world war, his mother's attempts to get him back to the UK failed. Briscoe's foster family adopted him to spare the boy internment. Seeing the war as an opportunity to prove his loyalty to his adoptive family and nation, Briscoe became an enthusiastic member of the Hitler youth and in 1944 joined the auxiliary fire service where he was injured in an air raid. The following year he was an eyewitness to the surrender of Miltenberg by its Mayor and the town's occupation by American troops. In October 1945, a British Army officer came to collect him to return to his home country and mother. The two of them found a home and employment in a community for pacifists and misfits. Over the following years, Briscoe moved away from the worldview he had been taught as a child and began to look back on his participation in kristallnacht with shame. = Adulthood = In 1949, Briscoe returned to Germany on national service where he was sent to spy on neo-nazi groups in civilian clothing. After demobilisation he repaired historic buildings for the Ministry of Works. In 1956 he married Monica Larter, an infant schoolteacher. In 1960 he, too, qualified as a teacher and he went on to teach woodwork and German at schools in Essex and Suffolk. In 1975 he became joint manager of his wife's family farm at Framlingham, where he played an active part in the community as a church warden, conservationist and supporter of local charities. Near the end of his life, he gave many talks about his experiences in Britain and Germany and wrote two autobiographical memoirs, Foster Fatherland (2002) and My Friend the Enemy (2007).

He is best known for his figurative work in bronze, as well as natural and marine subjects in copper and limestone. MacCarthy‚Äôs sculpture range from small table top pieces to large public and corporate art works. Examples of his statues, monuments and plaques can be seen around Cork and Ireland, including a life-size bronze sculpture of Jack Lynch, Leader of Fianna F√°il and Irish Taoiseach, located in Blackpool, Cork. MacCarthy's work has exhibited in many respected galleries in Ireland and the UK. His sculptural pieces also feature in collections such as RT√â, The Arts Council, AIB, and The Office of Public Works; as well as private collections both in Ireland and abroad.  Early life and education  Thomas Kent, 1999, Cork Kent railway station, Cork. James MacCarthy was born in Dunmanway, West Cork, the second son of merchant Eugene Charles (Hugh) MacCarthy and Anna Connolly. From an early age MacCarthy showed an ability for drawing, painting and modelling and expressed an interest in attending art college. However, his father required that his son should firstly study baking at the Borough Polytechnic Institute, London. Afterwards, MacCarthy attended the National College of Art and Design (NCAD) in Dublin from 1968 ‚Äì 1970 at a time when the campus was based at Kildare Street, Dublin. It was at NCAD that he was taught the principles of sculpture under the tuition of Domhnall √ì Murchadha.  Career  Early in his career MacCarthy worked solely in plaster with pieces varing in size from busts to half-size figures. An interest in ceramics and pottery led him to the Kilkenny Design workshop where his work looked to traditional Irish influences. MacCarthy remained in Kilkenny for a year, after which he set up a studio in Cork working primarily in ceramics. However, MacCarthy returned to figurative sculpture led by an inherent desire and attraction for creating expressive three-dimensional forms. MacCarthy also began bronze casting his work, which is a skilled process and labour intensive, through mould making, and cast cleaning. Over a forty-year period MacCarthy was based out of his studio in Dunmanway where he worked on commissions and producing sculpural pieces for exhibition.  Sculpture  = Themes and style = A major theme of MacCarthy's was to explore the physicality of the female figure, something which was carried through his career, whether in the subject's private moments bathing or energetically modeling on the catwalk. Equestrian and marine subjects, animals of the Irish countryside, as well as aspects of Irish life such as the fair day were also creatively investigated. MacCarthy's appreciation of Cellini, Rodin, Remington and Stubbs can be seen in his early-period bronze sculpture with the work taking a robust and sensitive modelling manner, which was also underscored by the medium of clay. In later years MacCarthy switched to modelling in wax which allowed him a quicker and freer approach and he evolved a more mannerist style with the forms exaggerated often resulting in compositions that were unnaturally elegant. While primarily working in clay, and wax, MacCarthy also examined his core themes through the different mediums of limestone, copper and wood, with the latter two materials being used for more playful sculptural pieces. Danno O'Mahony, World Heavyweight Champion, 2001, Ballydehob, County Cork. = Commissions = Alongside gallery work, MacCarthy undertook public and private commissions. Some of these works included: * Loughrea Uileann Piper, life-size male figure, bronze, Loughrea, Galway * Ballinasloe Horse Fair ‚Äì Horse and Handler, life-size horse and male figure, bronze, Ballinasloe, Galway * Jack Lynch, B/L, T.D., An Taoiseach, life-size figure, bronze, Blackpool, Cork * Danno O'Mahony ‚Äì World Champion Wrestler, life-size male figure, bronze, Ballydehob, Cork * Thomas Kent, life-size bust, bronze, Kent railway station, Cork * Heron in the Reeds, limestone and bronze, Inchy Bridge, Timoleague, Cork * Tony Reddin, low-relief portrait, bronze, Mullagh GAA Club, Galway * Buttevent to Doneraile ‚Äì First Recorded Steeplechase, commemorative plaque, bronze, Buttevent, Cork  Painting  Primarily known as a sculptor, MacCarthy's output also extended to painting with his earliest work being conducted in this medium. While surrounding mountains and coastline of West Cork take prominence in MacCarthy's painting, the female figure also is a key subject either set within a location of landscape or interior. He painted primarily in oil or acrylic.

Written by Harold James, Professor of Economic History at Princeton University, the book details the history of the postwar monetary order amidst geopolitical tensions, economic challenges, and societal needs. In the book James argues, throughout the postwar years, the IMF was instrumental in providing relief and maintaining stability of the Bretton Woods system. It also played an important role in monetary matters of surveillance and information-sharing. The IMF promoted a system that was not rules-based, but rather cooperation-based. It was, however, challenged by nationalist governments and asymmetric capital flows on part of the United States. The book was commissioned for the 50th anniversary of the International Monetary Fund. The other books in the series include: * J.

He served as a member of the Bundestag from 1969 to 1972. Helms was notable for his 1972 party switch that threatened to collapse the government of Chancellor Willy Brandt. Early life and career Wilhelm Helms was born on 19 December 1923 in the Bissenhausen district of Twistringen, Germany. His father, Heinrich Helms died in 1941 while his brother, Heinrich, was killed in World War II. After high school, he was drafted into the Wehrmacht. He served in a tank crew on the Russian front and left the army in 1945. He worked his family‚Äôs farm after the war. Political career In 1956, he became involved in politics as a local councilor in his hometown, becoming the mayor in 1961. In 1963, he switched parties to join the Free Democratic Party and become a regional administrator. The party selected him to its list for the 1969 West German federal election and he entered the Bundestag. His Free Democrats entered into a coalition with the Social Democratic Party of Willy Brandt, giving the ruling coalition 251 votes, a majority of three votes. 1972 party switch Shortly after the 1972 Baden‚ÄêW√ºrttemberg state election in which the CDU/CSU won overwhelmingly, Helms announced that he would leave the Free Democrats and apply for membership in the Christian Democratic Union. With the coalition down to 249 members, Helms‚Äô party switch would shift the balance of power in the Bundestag. The opposition proposed a vote of no-confidence in the government to replace Brandt with Rainer Barzel. Helms suggested that he had disagreements over domestic policy and expressed reservations with the governments policy in Eastern Europe. Brandt‚Äôs government negotiated treaties with the Soviet Union and Poland that would coming for a vote. At the no- confidence vote, two CDU politicians voted to support Brandt while Helms would not reveal how he had voted. However, he later stated that he would support the vote for the treaties. Helms sat with the CDU for the remainder of his term. In the 1972 West German federal election, he was not re-elected to the Bundestag. Later career In 1979, Helms won a seat in the European Parliament from the CDU. He served on the Delegation for relations with Canada, the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Transport. He left the European Parliament in 1984. Personal life In 1944, he met his wife, Lya Schilmbller, who had been sent to work on the farm. The couple become engaged in 1946 and married in 1948. In 1990, Helms took issue with Brandt‚Äôs memoir, which suggested that Helms had a financial motive for switching parties. His suit was unsuccessful. Helms died on 8 December 2019 in Vechta, Germany at the age of 95.

The corresponding orthocenters, circumcenters, centroids, and centers of the nine-point circle are approached using projective properties of the triangles. Young became emeritus professor in 1941. She died March 4, 1963, at Wellesley. Solutions of AMM problems One of the features of American Mathematical Monthly is a section devoted to problems articulated by readers, and eventual solutions of said problems. The published solutions are chosen for their elegance, and five involving geometry were by Mabel Young. Given a point and a circle, find the locus of second circles where the radical axis of the two circles lies on the given point. Young‚Äôs analytical geometry solution established a condition on the radii.AMM 31(3):150 A given segment subtends an angle from a point on another line. As the point moves along its line, find the envelope of the bisectors of the angles. Young's solution established the class of the envelope curve using projective geometry.AMM 31(7): 354 Let a point and a pair of intersecting planes be fixed. Then as a variable line lies on the point, find the locus of the midpoint of the segment determined by the planes. Young's solution starts with a line p through the point and parallel to the intersection of the planes. She identified the locus as a hyperbolic cylinder through use of a third parallel midway between the others that is the projective harmonic conjugate of a line at infinity.AMM 31(7): 356 In a triangle ABC the feet of the altitudes and midpoints of the sides are used to define three involutions. The problem was to show that the double points of these involutions are three pairs of opposite vertices of a complete quadrilateral. Young's solution used the radical axis of the circumcircle and nine-point circle of the triangle.AMM 37(7): 383 Young proposed construction of a strophoid: Form triangle AOB from a fixed point A and a variable B on circle centered at O. Then the locus of the orthocenter of AOB is a strophoid.AMM 38(3): 170 Another problem required the concurrence of three lines determined by a triangle's altitudes and angle bisectors. Young's solution pointed to the Gergonne point and Nagel point of the triangle to obtain the concurrence.AMM 38(3): 177 References * Boston Globe (March 5, 1963) \\"Mabel Young 89, headed math department at Wellesley College\\"  Category:1872 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Wellesley College faculty Category:Geometers Category:Mathematics educators Category:American women mathematicians Category:20th-century American women scientists Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:20th-century women mathematicians ","title":"Mabel Minerva Young"},{"id":"62624696","text":"Perro amor may refer to: *Perro amor (Colombian TV series), a 1998 Colombian telenovela *Perro amor (American TV series), a 2010 American Spanish-language telenovela ","title":"Perro amor"},{"id":"62624710","text":"The Rivi√®re Gauthier is a tributary of the Saguenay River, flowing in the territory of the city of Saguenay (sector La Baie), in the administrative region of Saguenay‚ÄìLac-Saint-Jean, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.

Its mouth is located in the Rivi√®re-du-Moulin district, in the east of the Chicoutimi borough in Saguenay. The river is known for its urban park, the Rivi√®re-du-Moulin park, located on its banks near its mouth. The upper part of the Moulin river valley is served by the forest roads R0287 and by a secondary road descending part of the valley; this upper part is also indirectly served by the route 175 which passes on the west side. A few other secondary forest roads serve the \\"rivi√®re du Moulin\\" valley, mainly for forestry and recreational tourism activities. In addition to the urban and industrial area, crossing the Chicoutimi sector of the city of Saguenay, forestry is the main economic activity in this valley; recreational tourism, second.

The work generated controversy from the moment it was unveiled, and even after its removal by ministerial order in 1978. In 1979, Merik√© Wiler called it the most controversial piece of Canadian public art ever commissioned during the fourteen years of Canada's public art funding scheme. It was hauled away and cut into pieces on two occasions, before and after being installed in front of another federal government building, and finally reinstalled at its intended location once more in 1997, nearly twenty years after its removal. Inspiration No. 1 Northern was intended to be a metaphor for fields of wheat, represented in multi-layer rectangular shapes and painted the \\"brilliant\\" yellow of harvest wheat, representing Canada's hardy top grade, red spring wheat hybrid of the same name that dominates the prairies in the fall. History =Commission= During the 1960s and 1970s, the Canadian government acted regularly as a patron of the arts, and the Department of Public Works had a fine art program in which 1% of the construction costs for federal buildings open to the public would be spent on commissioning art. Architectural firm Smith Carter had recently designed and built the new Canadian Grain Commission building, and recommended that it be bestowed with a large scale exterior sculpture, but no art allowance had been designated in the construction budget, and in June 1972 the firm notified the Department of Public Works. The Western Region Office responded that there were no funds available for art. In April 1973, Ernest J. Smith, the building's principal architect, met with Regional Committee member Kenneth Lochhead and they \\"mutually agreed\\" that the building required a major contemporary work of art for the fore court, determining a budget of $50,000, with Smith to follow up with a list of artists (the Regional Office had not changed its position). In June 1974, with no funds forthcoming, Smith suggested the Commission might rent a work of art from the Art Bank, but its advisory committee members disagreed: after ten years, the rental fees would exceed the value of the art. The following July, a competition was proposed between ten invited artists, with each to receive $500 for their maquette (scale model) and travel expenses. In January 1975, Nugent and four other artists, Henry Saxe, Ulysse Comtois, Ricardo Gomez, and Hugh Leroy, were chosen by Smith (with Kenneth Lochhead's advice). Public Works Headquarters determined that the funds would come from the Western Region's Accommodation Capital. The Advisory Committee selected Nugent's work. Grain Commission building. =Installation and reception= Earl Baxter, chairman of the Board of Grain Commissioners, attended the meeting at which Nugent's proposal was selected and expressed reservations about its design. Over his objections, the work was installed in late 1975. Baxter continued to complain, applying to officials as far up in the chain of command as Public Works Minister C.M. Drury, but finding himself ignored, canvassed employees, and shortly after the work's 1976 unveiling, obtained 300 signatures signed in protest (a dozen employees liked it). Before the official unveiling, then Agriculture Minister Eugene Whelan called the work \\"a waste of taxpayers' moneys.\\" Margarite Pinney, then chief of the fine arts program for Public Works, said Whelan was criticizing a piece of art work he had never seen: \\"We have been trying for some time to get a piece of sculpture for a federal building in western Canada and on the eve of an unveiling we have unfair comments from the minister\\". Winnipeg Tribune columnist Vic Grant said it should be plowed under and left to decompose, while others \\"went from there, proposing that its creator... be plowed under with it.\\" According to the federal government's Cultural Property Inventory, in addition to complaints from employees and the general public that the work was \\"ugly and meaningless\\", there were also \\"charges that the piece was dangerous in the winter because someone might walk into it and injure themselves.\\" Catherine Anderson-Dolcini believes that many people were either unaware of what the work represented, or else resented representation of the wheat in abstract form, and that much anger, stemmed from a lack of public involvement during the selection process. The controversy continued for eighteen months. Mayo Graham of the Public Works Capital Region Advisory Committee felt that \\"both the sculpture and its location\\" were fine, but was not happy with what he called the \\"bus 'hut,' bench, and surrounding planting\\", as he wrote in a letter to Bob Osler, Acting Chief of Environmental Design, dated 9 August 1977: > Frankly, I think that we should care enough about the sculpture to highlight > it... rather than try to hide or detract from it with these other > unattractive elements. I hope there is still the possibility of convincing > those in charge to keep the Nugent sculpture in place. =Removals and re-installations= By July 1978, Baxter had prevailed: local Public Works officials were fed up with the controversy, and with the blessing of the new Public Works Minister Judd Buchanan, announced that No. 1 Northern would be \\"cut in pieces\\" and moved \\"somewhere\\" on 1 August. Nugent heard about this while working at his studio in Lumsden, Saskatchewan and a legal standoff began. Canadian Artists Representation filed an action to stop the removal of Nugent's work; the sculptor was given one month to choose between two sites, though he felt that neither one was suitable. Accounts of what happened next vary; there were rumours that \\"it simply disappeared one night and no one claimed to know who was responsible.\\" Late in the night of 31 August, against the protestations of Nugent's lawyer, officials dismantled the work (possibly while legal proceedings were ongoing) when it was cut up and taken to a federal warehouse in Lockport. Nugent said afterwards: \\"They can decide what to do with it now... It seems futile to sue.\\" But sue Nugent did, for \\"damages to the artist's reputation\\", as well as breach of contract. Two years later, No. 1 Northern was reinstalled in front of a Revenue Canada building, the Winnipeg Taxation Centre on Stapon Road. Upset that his work had not been supported the first time around, Nugent said he was not interested in the re- installation, and that since the sculpture had been cut into pieces and reassembled \\"it wasn't his original work anymore.\\" \\"I've disowned it... The minute the government vandalized it I disowned it.\\" In 1993, the work was quietly moved a second time, this time to a Winnipeg scrapyard in the salvage area, \\"in pieces\\", unbeknownst to Nugent, who asked for the public's help in finding the piece. A Public Works spokesperson later said it was moved because new pathways into the building passed too near the sculpture and the department was concerned \\"children might climb on it\\". In Spring 1997, Nugent discovered what had become of his work and complained, along with many other artists, about the way Public Works stored pieces of art it owned. The department made a commitment to restoring the sculpture and finding a prominent, public setting for it following public reaction to news of its deterioration. Later the same year, almost twenty years after it was removed, No. 1 Northern was reinstalled in front of the Grain Commission building. Another two decades later, Di Brandt, Winnipeg's first poet laureate, suggested that as the Winnipeg Arts Council's contemporary public art program has developed, Nugent's work no longer seems risqu√©: \\"It brightens up the grey streets, and provides a nice horizontal homage to our Prairie landscape and agricultural heritage among all those tall vertical buildings.\\" References Category:20th-century sculptures Category:Steel sculptures in Canada Category:Public art in Canada ","title":"No. 1 Northern"},{"id":"62625525","text":"Camille Thomasina Schrier (; born June 30, 1995) is a Miss America titleholder and previous pageant titleholder.

Frank. Overview Frank promoted the diet in his book Dr. Frank's No-Aging Diet, first published in 1976.Frank, Benjamin S. (1976). Dr. Frank's No-Aging Diet. Dial Press. The book stresses the importance of nucleic acid as a cell builder. The diet advocates the consumption of foods heavy in RNA (ribonucleic acid) such as sardines four times a week, other seafood three times a week, calf's liver, lentils and soybeans.Stare, Frederic J; Whelan, Elizabeth M. (1983). The One Hundred Percent Natural, Purely Organic, Cholesterol-Free, Megavitamin, Low- Carbohydrate Nutrition Hoax. New York: Atheneum. pp. 82-84. Frank stated that the diet could slow the aging process and could cure many ailments.Coggins, Peter R. (1978). Dr. Franks No-Aging Diet by Benjamin S. Frank, M. D. Delaware Medical Journal 50 (1): 60. He believed that sardines and other foods high in nucleic-acid content can erase wrinkles could make people look fifteen years younger.Deutsch, Ronald M. (1976). Realities of Nutrition. Bull Publishing Co. pp. 188-189. Stuckey, William K. (October 11, 1976). The \\"No-Aging Diet\\": Something Fishy Here. New York 9: 73-74. In 1977, authors Barbara Friedlander and Marilyn Petersen authored Dr. Frank's No-Aging Diet Cookbook. The cook included recipes for nucleic-acid rich foods.Shih, Tian-Chu. (1991). Health Related Cookbooks: A Bibliography. The Scarecrow Press. p. 248. Criticism The diet is extremely unbalanced and is a health danger to those with hypertension because of the high salt content of the sardines.Hines, Terence. (1988). Chapter Health and Nutrition Quackery. In Pseudoscience and the Paranormal: A Critical Examination of the Evidence. Prometheus Books. p. 253. It has been described as a \\"dangerous and especially bizarre diet\\". The book was criticized for false advertising.Fraud Against the Elderly: Connecticut. (1981). U.S. Government Printing Office. p. 8 There is no scientific evidence that the human body can benefit from extra dietary nucleic acids because during digestion they are destroyed and broken down to simpler compounds. Nutritionists Fredrick J. Stare and Elizabeth Whelan commented that \\"the particularly ludicrous part of Frank's theory totally ignored in his book is the fact that genetic material is extremely specific. If the nucleic acids of a sardine were to have any direct effect on our bodies, about the most we could expect would be to grow fins and improve our swimming!.\\" Biochemist Harold A. Harper from University of California noted that the diet \\"is absolute, sheer quackery. I repeat that statement. It is totally unscientific from A to Z. To anyone who knows the remotest thing about chemistry, [Frank's] theory reads like a comic book.\\" See also *High-protein diet References Further reading *Rita Storey et al. (1982).

The course of bras de Jacob crosses the northwest part of the zec Mars-Moulin. The upper part of this small valley is served by the Lac-du-Bois-Joli road which passes on the north shore of Lac Jacob. A few other secondary forest roads serve the valley of the Jacob's arm, mainly for forestry and recreational tourism activities.Open Street Map - Accessed January 24, 2019 Forestry is the main economic activity in this valley; recreational tourism, second.

It was not the first, and by no means the only stock exchange in Adelaide, but was notable in its alternative use as a venue for large public meetings and performances. History =George Green= George Green (c. 1820 ‚Äì 20 January 1895) arrived in South Australia in March 1848 aboard David Malcolm from London. He had studied civil engineering in Britain, but finding little demand for the profession, turned to land surveying, with offices at 65 King William Street adjacent the Bank of Australasia from 1850. By June 1853 he was advertising as a land agent and auctioneer with offices at the same address, under he title \\"Exchange Auction Mart\\" (still operating 1886). He also acted as a gold buyer for some of the banks, was for a time a director of the Moonta mines, and managed \\"Green's Exchange Room\\", which operated from May 1853 to at least November 1889. Green had an arrangement with one William Green of Melbourne, who conducted a similar business from premises at 74 Queen Street, Melbourne later 30 Queen Street as \\"Green's Land, Share, and Adelaide Agency\\" later land agent and auctioneer at 71 Russell Street, proved insolvent 1863, back to 74 Queen Street in 1864. His subsequent history and relationship with George Green (if any) is yet to be found. Green entered into partnership with J. H. Parr as auctioneers and commission agents sometime before September 1857 and W. G. Luxmoore joined before November that year. The partnership Green, Parr & Luxmoore was dissolved in March 1863. He had a separate partnership with William Wadham (1824‚Äì1895) from around 1857; Wadham moved to partnership with George Dutton Green (1 May 1850 ‚Äì 27 April 1911) as Green & Co. Green built a home on Palmer Place, and Wadham built a residence,. \\"Rhyllon\\", a few doors away. He retired around 1880, though his involvement with the Exchange ceased around 1875, and returned to England, where he died, leaving a widow, two sons and two daughters. =The building= In 1854 Green remodeled the interior, to make a large open room suitable for meetings, concerts and receptions, though the pillars supporting the roof structure made it unsuitable for use as a ballroom. On both sides of the main entrance to the Exchange were offices of the South Australian Telegraph Department. Charles Todd, the Superintendent of Telegraphs, had those on the lefthand side, and the public offices on the right. The Exchange room was directly behind these offices; and on each side of the gallery which overlooked \\"The Room\\" (which had a glass roof) was a number of small professional offices, occupied by such as solicitor Henry Hay Mildred. The offices over the Telegraph Office were occupied by solicitors Belt, Cullen, & Wigley. Businessmen mentioned as habitu√©s include T. F. Monteith, F. P. Bayley, C. J. Barry, William Mitchell, Walter Duffield, Capt. John Hart, John Dunn, Beeby & Dunstan and Thomas Magarey. The southern side was then a vacant block, with a garden behind the railing fence; later an extension of the Bank of Australasia. The northern side was a wine and spirits store used by R. H. Wigg, later the Bank of South Australia, and the Union Bank. Scott, Young, & Co., drapers, occupied the next building, the rear of which housed Henry Noltenius' wine store. The building was later leased by Hill, Mills, & Co., railway carriers, and their successors C. R. Darton & Co. This building occupied the northernmost site of what became Bowman's Arcade, which occupied most of the eastern half of Town Acre 109. Green's lease elapsed shortly after his son George Dutton Green and others erected the Pirie Street Exchange, and the site reverted to T. G. Waterhouse, for whom Broken Hill Chambers (opened 1890), was built on the site by William McLean Brothers Joseph and Oliver and William Rigg having died some years before. of the Melbourne firm of McLean Brothers, Rigg & Co. to the design of English & Soward. A feature of the building was a glass-roofed arcade running clear through to Gilbert Place. The freehold was sold to William Kither acting for Keith Bowman, and renamed Bowman's Arcade, which served Adelaide for a hundred years, and home of John Mack's camera shop. ;A few highlights *The first meeting of Stock Exchange members was held at Green's Exchange Rooms on 9 October 1854. *A hastily-called meeting of prominent citizens planned a farewell to Governor Young, who had been summarily transferred to Van Diemen's Land. *Green's Exchange was not only used for general meetings of the Adelaide Choral Society, but also for their concerts. *Meetings of the South Australian Chamber of Commerce were also held there. *A gathering full to overflowing was called in March 1856 to protest Governor MacDonnell's sacking (through Police Commissioner Warburton) of Superintendent of Police Tolmer, by all events a zealous and efficient officer, and the hero of the Gold Escort, while promoting more sociable but less diligent officers. *Green's Exchange was used by Rev. John Crawford Woods as a meeting-place for Unitarian Christians and for promoting socially progressive causes. *A well-attended public meeting was held on 31 August 1858 at Green's Exchange, presided by Governor MacDonnell, formally to found the Aborigines' Friends' Association.C. E. Bartlett A Brief History of the Point McLeay Reserve and District Aborigines' Friends' Association 1959 *On 1 September 1858 a very large meeting almost unanimously called on the City Council to borrow ¬£30,000 to build a Town Hall, and other public amenities. Other Exchanges of the 1800s *Bryce Ross ( ‚Äì February 1870) hosted Adelaide's first Stock Exchange in Hindley Street; Crampton's (later Ware's) Exchange Hotel adjacent. Gresham Street was later extended through Acre 47 to Hindley Street, just west of the Exchange site, then became Gilbert Place. :The Exchange Hotel (previously Australian Arms, owned by Samuel Payne of Payneham fame) was a popular venue for large business meetings. *J. Bentham Neales opened the Adelaide Commercial Exchange or Adelaide Exchange in front of his Auction Mart (also on Acre 47) at the corner of Hindley and King William streets in 1846, with Ross as manager/secretary and 200 subscribers. *W. H. George, painter and glazier, opened his Royal Exchange on Hindley Street in April 1848, promising facilities as close to those of Lloyds or the Jerusalem coffee house in London as the colony could supply. Ross retaliated with the assertion that the Adelaide Commercial Exchange would be moving to a larger venue. George was proved insolvent later that year. :In 1849 George Coppin opened his Royal Exchange Hotel on Hindley Street, which was used for business meetings. *G. Dutton Green, son of George Green, followed his father as a real estate agent, and was a member of the Exchange Land Company which founded the Pirie Street stock exchange on the site of King's timber yard. Other members were Henry and Frank Rymill (who owned the lease on the land), Joseph Fisher, William Kay, James Hill, J. C. Lovely (c. 1842‚Äì1915), and H. L. Vosz. \\"Adelaide New Exchange\\" was opened on 1 July 1880 at 22‚Äì30 Pirie Street, east of what is now Exchange Place. :An association, The Stock Exchange of South Australia, was founded there in May 1887. This exchange, which saw much business during the boom years of Broken Hill, moved to Comstock Chambers 90‚Äì92 King William Street (adjacent temporary premises of the Stock Exchange of Adelaide) in August 1891, and was wound up in October 1893. *In 1887 John Robb built the Royal Exchange, King William Street, Royal Exchange\\" at 96‚Äì98 King William Street on the site of D & W Murray's between Grenfell and Pirie streets. Designed by Wright, Reed & Beaver, it was one of the largest and handsomest in Australasia. The Adelaide Stock Exchange was founded there by Gavin F. Gardner and others. W. B. Carr was its long-serving president and its only life member. :The building was acquired by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in 1922. *The Stock Exchange of Adelaide Ltd., an Association founded in September 1887 by G. S. Aldridge, Henry Bellingham and others, first met on 3 October 1887 in Dutton Green's Pirie Street rooms, then from March 1888 in the Exchange Room of the Town Hall. They had a (No. 2) room at 86‚Äì88 King William Street 1888‚Äì1891, then for a time they used \\"The Barn\\", once a wool store on McHenry Street, (which runs through Town Acres 168 and 169 from Gawler Place) which had been purchased by the Association. In 1892 they moved to premises on King William Street. In 1901 they moved into their own premises, built by W. C. Torode to a design by architects Dunn & Fuller. A feature of the building was the \\"Federation Window\\", produced by Morris & Co., and commissioned by Sir George Brookman, a member. :In 1991 the Exchange left the building, which was purchased by the State Government, had it restored, and in 2009 reopened as The Science Exchange for Royal Institution of Australia.

Design The Pierce-Arrow armoured AA lorry was an open topped armoured lorry based on an imported American Pierce- Arrow Motor Car Company 5-ton truck chassis with added armoured bodywork and mounting a QF 2-pounder (40 mm) AA \\"pom-pom\\" gun. The Pierce-Arrow had a front mounted engine protected by folding armoured panels, behind the engine was an enclosed driver's compartment with two armoured shutters, whilst the open- topped fighting compartment was at the rear. In addition to the 2-pounder \\"pom-pom\\", the vehicle was provided with one or more .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun for which four mountings were provided, the fighting compartment included storage for ammunition and other equipment, whilst further ammunition storage was provided on the sides of the vehicle. It is estimated that fully loaded the vehicle weighed around . The first 32 Pierce-Arrow armoured AA lorries were fitted with armoured plate, whilst the last 16 were fitted with armoured plate, the armour was bolted to a frame fitted to the chassis. The 4x2 rear wheel driven chassis had a wheelbase of , it had leaf spring suspension and a 4-cylinder petrol engine that delivered . History On 30 December 1914 the Admiralty placed an order with Wolseley Motors Ltd for 48 Pierce-Arrow truck chassis to be converted to self-propelled anti-aircraft gun carriers for use by the Royal Marine Artillery Anti-Aircraft Brigade, all 48 were delivered between April and June 1915. thumb The Royal Marine Artillery Anti-Aircraft Brigade had an establishment of 16 QF 2-pounder \\"pom-pom\\" guns which were to be fitted to the vehicles, the remaining vehicles were to be kept as spares, the weapon systems were to be employed in four 4-gun batteries. Due to shortages of 2-pounders only two batteries received the vehicles by the end of April 1915, they were immediately dispatched to France. Arriving at the front on 28 April, their first victory was claimed two days later on 30 April when the first enemy aircraft was shot down. As more 2-pounders became available a third battery was added in August 1915 with the forth and final battery becoming operational in September. During their period of employment with the Royal Marine Artillery Anti-Aircraft Brigade from April 1915 to the time they were replaced in service by QF 13-pounder 9 cwt guns in 1917, the Pierce-Arrows claimed over twenty German aircraft shot down. The vehicle's contribution was to force enemy reconnaissance aircraft to fly at much greater altitude of up to where they were much less effective. The No 1 Squadron, Royal Naval Armoured Car Division under Commander Oliver Locker- Lampson had one Pierce-Arrow during their expedition to Russia and the Causasus. Peerless armoured AA lorry In January and February 1915 the War Office ordered a further 16 armoured AA lorries from Wolseley Ltd for use by the Imperial Russian Army, although these were built on the chassis of a Peerless Motor Company 5-ton truck. The Peerless chassis had almost identical dimensions to the Pierce-Arrow so practically the same armour was used, they were, like the Pierce-Arrows, armed with a 2-pounder \\"pom-pom\\" and a Vickers machine gun. Delivered to Russia in 1916, the Russians subsequently fitted some with a small turret in place of the 2-pounder.

History To clear the place for the building, the buildings on Znamenka, Vozdvizhenka, and Arbatskaya Square were demolished. In particular, the house where Nikolai Rubinstein and Pyotr Tchaikovsky lived in their youth was destroyed, as well as the hotel where Sergei Rachmaninoff lived. In the courtyard of the building is the ground lobby of the Moscow Metro station Arbatskaya of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line. During the construction of the building, new exits from the lobby through the building were arranged towards Vozdvizhenka, and the old ones, to Arbatskaya Square, were closed. Architecture The General Staff building occupies an entire quarter. One of its facades faces Arbatskaya Square. The building has eight floors. The walls are decorated with marble, Ural stone ‚Äì a coil and granite. Facades have horizontal and vertical division. The architectural style as a whole is characteristic of the Soviet administrative buildings of the 1960s‚Äì1970s, but at the same time, there are certain features postmodernism in the design of the portals and in the drawing of the crowning part of the structure.

It has rough ironbark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and barrel-shaped or conical fruit. Description Eucalyptus scopulorum is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has soft, corky, pale grey bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section and dull greyish green leaves that are egg-shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of dull green on both sides, lance- shaped to broadly lance-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets in groups of seven on an branched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to diamond-shaped, long and about wide with a conical operculum. Flowering has been recorded in October and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody barrel-shaped or conical capsule long and wide with the valves below rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus scopulorum was first formally described in 1997 by Ken Hill in the journal Telopea from specimens he collected in the Gibraltar Range State Forest in 1996. The specific epithet (scopulorum) is from the Latin word scopulus meaning \\"a cliff\\", referring to the usual habitat of this species.

Copper Peak is situated 80 miles northeast of Seattle in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, on land managed by the Wenatchee National Forest. Copper Peak ranks 22nd on Washington's highest 100 peaks, and 19th on the \\"Bulger List\\". The nearest higher peak is Mount Fernow, to the south. Precipitation runoff from the mountain and meltwater from the glacier on the southeast slope drains into nearby Lake Chelan via Railroad Creek. The first ascent of the peak was made in August 1937 by Franklin Bennet, Edgar Courtwright, and Toivo Hagman.http://www.rhinoclimbs.com/WA100HighestFAChronology.htm The peak's name refers to an abandoned copper mine that once operated at the northeast base of the peak. Climate Lying east of the Cascade crest, the area around Copper Peak is a bit drier than areas to the west. Summers can bring warm temperatures and occasional thunderstorms. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes.

Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. snow-covered Copper Peak The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation.

Acting career =Film= In 1999, Buie starred in Mystery, Alaska, playing a Canadian ice hockey player named Connor Banks who is arrested for a shooting. Buie told a Los Angeles Times interviewer that the cast practiced hockey so much that many of the film's scenes on the ice rink were performed by the actors themselves rather than stand-ins. Saying he was \\"immensely proud of that\\", Buie described himself as \\"a mediocre hockey player who gets to live the dream in this film\\". In 2010, Buie appeared with co-stars Elizabeth Banks, Ty Simpkins, Russell Crowe, and Moran Atias at the New York premiere of The Next Three Days, a feature film in which he played the role of Mick Brennan.

Buie portrayed Fox News anchor Bret Baier in the 2019 film Bombshell, about the Roger Ailes scandal at the conservative network. In a pictorial review, USA Today compared his appearance to Baier's, along with the other leading cast members to their Fox News characters. In a wide-ranging, interview by Adnan Virk on the Cinephile with Adnan Virk podcast in December 2019, Buie discussed various film roles he had had, as well as his thoughts on other recent films and their casts, and his long standing friendship with Russell Crowe.

It is native to south-east Asia. Description The threestripe gourami normally shows one or two, almost never three, dark stripes running the length of its body but there it lacks any strip along the base of the anal fin. The elongated reare anal fin rays do not reach beyond the middle of the caudal fin which is lanceolate in shape. The dorsal, anal and caudal fin have red margins and are marked with many blue spots. Males are larger than the females and have elongated rays in the pelvic, dorsal, anal, and caudal fins. It can attain a length of with the largest males measured at . It is intermediate in size between its congeners, being smaller than the croaking gourami (Trichopsis vittata) and larger than the pygmy gourami (T. pumila). Distribution The threestripe gourami is found throughout the Mekong basin from Laos, through Thailand and Cambodia, including the Tonle Sap to the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. In Thailand it is also found throughoutin the Chao Praya river system. Habitat and biology The threestripe gourami occurs in still to slow-moving, lowland waters. It can be found in a variety of habitats among which are swamp forest, peat swamps, floodplains, river tributaries, irrigation canals, paddy fields, and roadside ditches. It appears to prefer very slow flowing or still waters where there is a dense growth of aquatic vegetation or thick plant cover along the shores. The breeding male creates a bubblenest among floating plants and when that is compete he will display to the female. When the female is ready to mate she will move to directly beneath the bubblenestand the male will wrap his body around hers. As she spawns the male simultaneously fertilises the eggs. The female normally produces about ten eggs per mating and after fertilisation these float up into the bubblenest with any stray eggs being collected by the male and placed in the nest. Spawning may be repeated several times until the female runs out of eggs. After spawning is complete the male guards the nest, the eggs usually hatching after 48 hours. The species in the genus Trichopsis make audible sounds using a specialised pectoral mechanism which is unique within the gouramis. The structure is made up of modified tendons of the pectoral fin with muscles which are stretched and plucked by the bottom of the front fin rays of the pectoral fin in like the strings of a guitar. Each pectoral fin can be beaten in turn, and can produce short or long bursts of sound which are produced by both sexes. Sound is mainly produced when the fish are interacting antagonistically or courting. Each species of Trichopsis has its own patterns of producing sounds. These fishes may be able to settle antagonistic interactions as they can use the sounds produced to assess the condition and fitness of nearby fishes. Females produce a ‚Äòpurring‚Äô sounds when initiating spawning, and in this aspect they are unique among fishes. Species description and etymology The threestripe gourami was formally described in 1962 by Werner Ladiges. The type locality is given as Nam-Mun at Korat, 135 miles northeast of Bangkok. The species was first discovered and imported to Europe by the German aquarist Dietrich Schaller, who is honoured in its specific name. Human use The threestripe gourami is uncommon in the aquarium trade and is said to be infrequently available. Live specimens taken from the wild are normally used for breeding to provide fish for the aquarium trade. It is discarded if caught among foodfish.

With It was deemed notable as \\"a spectacularly sited and beautifully developed example of a hipped-roofed two-story house with boxy massing.

Here, however, the floor space of the virtually square main block is extended not to the rear in response to a narrow city lot, but to the side in a two-story sun and sleeping-porch ell. This maximizes the exposure of the house to its extraordinary closeup view of the Snake River. The execution and detail of the house are superior; it is altogether perhaps the firm's single most successful essay in a style which they generally handled well.

It is a Grade II listed building. History In 1880, the newly- appointed vicar of All Saints, Brompton-by-Sawdon, the Rev. Francis Chambers, instigated a series of improvements to the church, including the closure of its original churchyard, and its replacement by a new cemetery. The construction of a chapel of rest in the new cemetery was financed by Sir George Cayley, the local squire, resident at Brompton Hall. Cayley's architect was Temple Lushington Moore, then aged 33, whose subsequent career saw him design about 40 new churches, and restore many more, becoming \\"England's leading ecclesiastical architect from the mid-Edwardian years\\". () Architecture and description The chapel comprises a broad gable facing the cemetery, with an asymmetrical bell tower ending in a pyramidal roof. Pevsner, in his Yorkshire: The North Riding volume, records its \\"wonderfully lopsided\\" appearance, but does not attribute the chapel to Moore. The chapel was designated a Grade II listed building on 3 September 2019.

It is located near the metro station of the same name, between the streets U Kunratick√©ho lesa, Roztylsk√° and the D1 motorway toward Brno. Westfield Chodov is the largest shopping center in the Czech Republic with 300 shops, and the retail floor area is 100.000 m2, the second largest in the country behind shopping centre Let≈àany. The owner of Westfield Chodov is the company Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield. It was built in 2005, with a major expansion occurred in 2017. It receives 13 million customers annually, employing approximately 8,000 people. There is free WiFi throughout Westfield Chodov. It houses fashion shops, a Cinema City multiplex cinema, perfume and makeup boutiques, fast-food restaurants, cafes, restaurants, flower shops, bookstores, jewellery boutiques, electronic shops, sporting goods, dry cleaners, and shoe repair services. There are also banks, travel agencies, mobile phone operators, children's corners, and hairdressers.  History  = Plans= Until the 1950s the site was a field known as Chodov field. After Chodov became part of Prague in 1968, construction began in the area. On 12 July 1971 the D1 motorway was completed and on 7 November 1980 the Budovatel≈Ø metro station (today Chodov) was opened, and a new bus terminal was built there. Construction of the adjoining settlement of Ji≈æn√≠ Mƒõsto II began in 1979. The first plans for the construction of this large area included building up to fifteen-story hotels. At the end of the 1980s, construction of the R≈Ø≈æe shopping center began. It was completed in 1991 after the Velvet Revolution, but demolished in 2015. Around the same time, the Devƒõtsil cultural house on Roztylsk√° Street began to be built, but due to changes to the original socialist concept and a lack of finance, the construction was soon stopped, with only a part of the foundation built. Until 2004, the site currently occupied by Westfield Chodov was an undeveloped area aside from these unfinished constructions. = Construction = Construction of Westfield Chodov in 2005 Construction of the center began in May 2004, despite protests from some local citizens. The construction ran according to schedule, but aggravated the surrounding environment with increased noise, dirt, and dust, with work often continuing overnight. Another problem was the re-routing of pedestrian walkways in the vicinity, which extended the journeys of residents to the metro and for shopping. The project also included a total reconstruction of parts of U Kunratick√©ho lesa, Roztylsk√°, Pod Chodov and Brnƒõnsk√° (D1 motorway), which mostly meant repair of road surfaces and preparation of branches for planned parking space. A new downhill ramp from the D1 motorway was also built, at the junction with Pod Chodov street. Westfield Chodov viewed from D1 motorway The overground sections of Chodov metro station were completely rebuilt. The old shelters and backgrounds from the 1980s were gradually dismantled and replaced with new exits, which were integrated with the main pavements being redesigned as part of the construction of the shopping center. The bridge over the D1 motorway was also completely rebuilt. The complex was designed by the German architectural studio Obermeyer Helika. The total area was 55 500m2, and the construction lasted 19 months. The primary investor for the project was the French company Unibail-Rodamco, the developer of AM Development; about four billion crowns were invested in the construction. Several companies, including Skanska and APB Plze≈à, participated in their own construction. The opening ceremony took place on 9 November 2005, attended by Pavel B√©m, the Mayor of Prague, and Marta ≈†orfov√°, the Mayor of Prague 11. Large numbers of shoppers went to the center from early in the morning to buy goods in the various promotional offers. = Extension = Part of Westfield Chodov built between 2015 and 2017 In the second half of 2014, new office space was built, which subsequently housed Unibail-Rodamco's Czech Republic headquarters. Several retail outlets were also created. Further expansion of the complex took place between 2015 and 2017. First, at the beginning of 2015, the old shopping center R≈Ø≈æe and the temporary parking lot of the Chodov Center were demolished, to make way for expansion. In 2016, the construction of a new part of the complex started, while the existing premises were renovated. The developer Unibail-Rodamco invested 4.4 billion crowns into the project, making it one of the largest retail project investments in the Czech Republic. A new section opened on 11 October 2017, expanding the complex by about one-third. Over 40,000 m2 of commercial space was added to the existing 58,600 m2, giving the center a total area of 102.266 m2. The expansion includes a new food court, called \\"Grand Kitchen\\", and the largest branch of the Cinema City chain, with 18 screens and a total area of 5,783 m2, including a VIP screening room and 4DX cinema. The expansion also includes a sauna world, relaxation zones, children's corners and \\"The Designer Gallery\\" presenting Czech and foreign design brands. The renovated building is more colourful and has more complex architectural elements. At the time of opening, all retail units were leased. In 2017 Westfield Chodov won the \\"Best of Realty\\" competition in the category of shopping malls in the Czech Republic. = Rebranding = The shopping center was officially known as Centrum Chodov (sometimes referred to as OC Chodov) until September 26, 2019 when the center has been rebranded as Westfield Chodov to match the global brand of flagship shopping centers of Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, joining numerous centers in France, UK, Poland, Sweden and the USA.  Design  alt= The reconstructed center completed in 2017 resembled two large concrete blocks without windows, with a large gate for cars (underpass Roztylsk√° street). In 2017, the center was extended to the west. In total, the building has seven floors (marked -4 to 2), of which shops occupy floors -2, 0 and 1. Floors -4, -3, -2 and -1 serve as an underground car park and 2 floors are reserved for the car park of the park and ride system connecting to metro C at Chodov, one of the largest in Prague with a capacity of over 600 cars. On the roof (floor 2) there is a fitness center, a caf√©, office space, engine rooms and more parking spaces. Various types of marble and decorative stone are often used in the interior of the business section. Floors 0 and 1 are divided into pedestrian \\"streets\\" that connect similar \\"squares\\". The southern section of the center features a \\"turret\\", which extends into three floors and darkens in the dark. In the second part of the center there is a monumental circular area, whose walls are plastered with a brick decoration. Long ropes planted with bulbs hang From the ceiling of this space. Close to the hypermarket on floor -2 is a glass chandelier by artist Bo≈ôek ≈†√≠pek, entitled Reversed Tree, from Skl√°ren Nov√Ω Bor in the past.  Shops  Interior of Westfield Chodov There are 272 classical shops and 42 restaurants (2019), including fashion shops, perfume and makeup boutiques, flower shops, bookstores, jewellery boutiques, electronic shops, sporting goods, dry cleaners, and shoe repair services, as well as banks, travel agencies, mobile phone operators, hairdressers, and cafes. The biggest sales area is Albert hypermarket in the center of the building (floor -2) with a sales area of 13,000 m2. Retailers with branches in the shopping center include AJ Armani Jeans, Tommy Hilfiger, H&M;, Zara, Promod, Swarovski, Sephora, MAC, Crabtree & Evelyn, Nike, and Foot Locker. Cafes and restaurants are situated throughout the center, with a dedicated fast food area in the first and second floor of the south-western part of the center. Before the reconstruction of 2017, this zone was located on the first floor of the northern part of the building overlooking the D1 and old Chodov.  Traffic availability  Westfield Chodov is served by the Prague Metro C station Chodov. There is a large bus stop on Roztylsk√° Street served by bus lines 115, 135, 154, 177 and 197, as of January 2017. It is next to the Czech D1 motorway leading to the center of Prague and Brno and Ostrava. Under the center there are three floors of underground car parks with 2,667 parking spaces (including park and ride). Bicycle parking spaces are also available ‚Äì stands or paid boxes.

Special efforts have been devoted to the development of Gaussian pointless finite element methods, including a nodal integration technique with various advantages.  Leblond's kinetic theory  This is an approach established by Leblond in his work on phase transformations. The theory proposes an evolutionary model to quantify the composition of the different phases of a crystalline material during heat treatment. The method is based on experimentally established CRT (Continuous Cooling Transformation) diagrams to compose TTT (Time-Temperature- Transformation) diagrams, which are widely used for numerical simulation or for the manufacture of industrial parts. The theory posits the equivalent volume fraction of a constituent yeq as the stationary solution of the evolution equations describing the phase change kinetics: : \\\\dot{y} = f ( y,T ) \\\\quad et \\\\quad f ( y_{eq},T )=0 \\\\, \\\\rightarrow stationnart phase We then suppose in anisothermal condition that the real fraction y is close to yeq, it is then possible to approximate the real value Y by a Taylor development at order 1: : f ( y,T )= f ( y_{eq},T )+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial f ( y_{eq},T )}{\\\\partial y}(y - y_{eq}) The evolution is given by : : \\\\dot{y} = \\\\frac{y - y_{eq}}{ \\\\tau (T)} \\\\quad et \\\\quad \\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau} = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial f ( y_{eq},T )}{\\\\partial y} : œÑ is determined on the one hand by the incubation period (critical time) and on the other hand by the cooling rates T. There are also other formalisms such as the theory of Kirkaldy, Johnson-Mehl-Avrami or Waeckel. One of the most classical, quite old, is that of Johnson-Mehl-Avrami. The model proposed by Jean-Baptiste Leblod is in fact based on this classical model by generalizing it on two points: 1) it considers any number of phases and transformations between these phases, and not just two phases and a single transformation; 2) the transformations can remain, after an infinitely long time, partial, and not necessarily complete as in the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model (this is linked to the existence, in the new model, of fractions \\"at equilibrium\\" of the phases towards which the system evolves after an infinite time, not necessarily equal to 0 or 1 but which can take any value between these limits). The Leblond model is designed for applications in the thermometallurgical treatment of steels; this explains its success with the modellers of these treatments.

The measurement is done while having surfactants, nanoparticles or other surface active compounds present at the interface. Unlike in bulk rheology, the deformation of the bulk phase is not of interest in interfacial rheology and its effect is aimed to be minimized. Instead, the flow of the surface active compounds is of interest. The deformation of the interface can be done either by changing the size or shape of the interface. Therefore interfacial rheological methods can be divided into two categories: dilational and shear rheology methods.  Interfacial dilational rheology  Pulsating drop method for dilatational interfacial rheology In dilatational interfacial rheology, the size of the interface is changing over time. The change in the surface stress or surface tension of the interface is being measured during this deformation. Based on the response, interfacial viscoelasticity is calculated according ot well established theories: \\\\left\\\\vert E \\\\right\\\\vert = {d\\\\gamma \\\\over dlnA}=A{d\\\\gamma \\\\over dA} \\\\begin{align} E' & = \\\\left\\\\vert E \\\\right\\\\vert\\\\cos\\\\delta \\\\end{align} \\\\begin{align} E & = \\\\left\\\\vert E \\\\right\\\\vert\\\\sin\\\\delta \\\\end{align} where * E is the complex surface dilatational modulus * Œ≥ is the surface tension or interfacial tension of the interface * A is the interfacial area * Œ¥ is the phase angle difference between the surface tension and area * E‚Äô' is the elastic (storage) modulus * E‚Äô is the viscous (loss) modulus Most commonly, the measurement of dilational interfacial rheology is conducted with an optical tensiometer combined to a pulsating drop module. A pendant droplet with surface active molecules in it is formed and pulsated sinusoidally. The changes in the interfacial area causes changes in the molecular interactions which then changes the surface tension. Typical measurements include performing a frequency sweep for the solution to study the kinetics of the surfactant. In another measurement method suitable especially for insoluble surfactants, a Langmuir trough is used in an oscillating barrier mode. In this case, two barriers that limit the interfacial area are being oscillated sinusoidally and the change in surface tension measured.  Interfacial shear rheology  Interfacial shear rheology with the needle method In interfacial shear rheology, the interfacial area remains the same throughout the measurement. Instead, the interfacial area is sheared in order to be able to measure the surface stress present. The equations are similar to dilatational interfacial rheology but shear modulus is often marked with G instead of E like in dilational methods. In a general case, G and E are not equal. Since interfacial rheological properties are relatively weak, it causes challenges for the measurement equipment. For high sensitivity, it's essential to maximize the contribution of the interface while minimizing the contribution of the bulk phase. Boussinesq number. Bo, depicts how sensitive a measurement method is for detecting the interfacial viscoelasticity. The commercialized measurement techniques for interfacial shear rheology include magnetic needle method, rotating ring method and rotating bicone method. The magnetic needle method, developed by Brooks et al., has the highest Boussinesq number of the commercialized methods. In this method, a thin magnetic needle is oscillated at the interface using a magnetic field. By following the movement of the needle with a camera, the viscoelastic properties of the interface can be detected. This method is often used in combination with a Langmuir trough in order to be able to conduct the experiment as a function of the packing density of the molecules or particles.  Applications  When surfactants are present in a liquid, they tend to adsorb in the liquid-air or liquid-liquid interface. Interfacial rheology deals with the response of the adsorbed interfacial layer on the deformation. The response depends on the layer composition, and thus interfacial rheology is relevant in many applications in which adsorbed layer play a crucial role, for example in development surfactants, foams and emulsions. Many biological systems like pulmonary lung surfactant and meibum are dependent on interfacial viscoelasticity for their functionality. Interfacial rheology enables the study of surfactant kinetics, and the viscoelastic properties of the adsorbed interfacial layer correlate well with emulsion and foam stability. Surfactants and surface active polymers used for stabilising emulsions and foams in food and cosmetic industries. Polymers, such as proteins, are surface active and tend to adsorb at the interface, where they can change conformation and influence the interfacial properties. Natural surfactants like asphaltenes and resins stabilize water- oil emulsions in crude oil applications, and by understanding their behavior the crude oil separation process can be enhanced. Also enhanced oil recovery efficiency can be optimized.

Biography Born May Renault in Vannes on 13 December 1907 she was better known as Maisie. Her father was L√©on Renault, professor of philosophy and English and inspector general of an insurance company and her mother Marie Decker was daughter of composer Th√©odore Decker. Maisie Renault came from a family of ten. Her brother was Gilbert Renault, Colonel R√©my. The family was strongly resistance oriented. Her other siblings included Isabelle, born on 26 August 1923 and Philippe, born 29 March 1915, killed in L√ºbeck-Neustadt Bay, 3 May 1945, both members of the Confr√©rie Notre Dame-Castille network and both also deported. In 1925 when her father died Renault gave up school to help her mother. She took a job at the Banque de France in Vannes. She spent a short time with her brother Gilbert in Gabon before returning home as the accountant for an agricultural cooperative. Gilbert founded an intelligence network in France called the Confr√©rie Notre-Dame. It was \\"considered to be the most important intelligence network in Free France\\". Renault joined in December 1940 and by the same time the following year she joined their Paris headquarters on rue Madame. Renault was responsible for sorting the information to go to London, prioritising it and transcribing the coded language and ensuring the radio operators had the details needed. The network was infiltrated and the first arrests began in June 1942. Renault was arrested on 13 June 1942 with her sister Madeleine Cestari. They managed to ensure their brothers escape. Renault gave away no information during her interrogation. Deportation Renault was sent to Ravensbr√ºck in August 1944. She later wrote a memoir, La Grande Mis√®re, about the events. Initially Renault was isolated and kept incommunicado in La Sant√© prison, then in Fresnes Prison until March 1943 before she was moved to Romainville and Compi√®gne. It was there she met Germaine Tillion's mother. In February 1944 she returned to Romainville. 15 August 1944, Renault was sent by train to the Ravensbr√ºck camp. She arrived 21 August. Renault was one of only seventeen survivors of her group of 550 people. The camp was liberated on 22 April 1945. Renault and her sister were taken to Copenhagen and then on to Sweden. They were cared for by the Red Cross. They left Sweden in July 1945 and were brought back to Paris. They were reunited with their brother Gilbert there. Memoirs As soon as Renault's health was stable and she had received all the necessary medical care, she began to write down her memories of the deportation. She asked her brother to edit it and rearrange it into chapters but he decided to leave it as she had written it. She completed it in August 1947 in Arradon and in 1948 it was published as La Grande Mis√®re. The book became famous and received the Grand prix V√©rit√©. Renault then returned home to Vannes in 1959, and went back to work in the cooperative, until her retirement. She never stopped testifying about what she experienced, especially in the schools of Morbihan. Renault died in Vannes in 2003. Awards Renault received the Legion of Honor, the Croix de Guerre and the Resistance medal. In 2002, she was promoted to the rank of commander in the Legion of Honor.

Generalizing ideas from his thesis, together with Uriel Frisch and Brosl Hasslacher, they foundFrisch U., Hasslacher B. , and Pomeau Y., ¬´ Lattice-gas automata for the Navier‚ÄìStokes equation ¬ª, Physical Review Letters, 1986. 56(14), pp. 1505‚Äì8 a very simplified microscopic fluid model (FHP model) which allows to simulate very efficiently the complex movements of a real fluid Frisch, U., d'Humieres, D., Hasslacher, B., Lallemand, P., Pomeau, Y., & Rivet, J.

Los Alamos National Lab., NM (USA); Observatoire de Nice, 06 (France); Ecole Normale Superieure, 75-Paris (France).. He was a pioneer of Lattice Boltzmann Models and played a historical role in the Timeline of computational physics. Reflecting on the situation of the transition to turbulence in parallel flows, he showedPomeau, Y., ¬´ Front motion, metastability and subcritical bifurcations in hydrodynamics ¬ª, Physica D, 1986. 23 (1-3), pp. 3-11 that turbulence is caused by a contagion mechanism, and not by local instability. Front can be static or mobile depending on the conditions of the system, and the causes of the motion can be the variation of a free energy, where the most energetically favorable state invades the less favorable one. The consequence is that this transition belongs to the class of directed percolation phenomena in statistical physics, which has also been amply confirmed by experimental and numerical studies. In dynamical systems theory, the structure and length of the attractors of a network corresponds to the dynamic phase of the network. The stability of Boolean network depends on the connections of their nodes. A Boolean network can exhibit stable, critical or chaotic behavior. This phenomenon is governed by a critical value of the average number of connections of nodes (K_{c}), and can be characterized by the Hamming distance as distance measure. If p_{i}=p=const. for every node, the transition between the stable and chaotic range depends on p . Bernard Derrida and Yves Pomeau proved that , the critical value of the average number of connections is K_{c}=1/[2p(1-p)] . From his more recent work we must distinguish those concerning a phenomenon typically out of equilibrium, that of the emission of photons by an atom maintained in an excited state by an intense field that creates Rabi oscillations. The theory of this phenomenon requires a precise consideration of the statistical concepts of quantum mechanics in a theory satisfying the fundamental constraints of such a theory. With Martine Le Berre and Jean Ginibre they showedPomeau Y., Le Berre M. and Ginibre J., ¬´ Ultimate Statistical Physics, Fluorescence of a single atom ¬ª, J. Stat. Phys. Special Issue, 26 (2016) that the good theory was that of a Kolmogorov equation based on the existence of a small parameter, the ratio of the photon emission rate to the atomic frequency itself. With his student Basile Audoly and Martine Ben Amar, they developedAudoly B. and Pomeau Y., Elasticity and Geometry, Oxford University Press, Oxford 2010, x + 586 pages a theory of large deformations of elastic plates which led them to introduce the concept of \\"d-cone\\", that is, a geometrical cone preserving the overall developability of the surface, an idea now taken up by the solid mechanics community. The theory of superconductivity is based on the idea of the formation of pairs of electrons that become more or less bosons undergoing Bose-Einstein condensation. This pair formation would explain the halving of the flux quantum in a superconducting loop. Together with Len Pismen and Sergio Rica Pismen, L., Pomeau Y., and Rica S., ¬´ Core structure and oscillations of spinor vortices ¬ª, Physica D, 1998. 117 (1/4), pp. 167‚Äì80 they have shown that, going back to Onsager's idea explaining the quantification of the circulation in fundamental quantum states, it is not necessary to use the notion of electron pairs to understand this halving of the circulation quantum. A droplet of nonwetting viscous liquid moves on an inclined plane by rolling along it. Together with Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan, he gave a scaling law for the uniform speed of such a droplet Bonn, D., Eggers, J., Indekeu, J., Meunier, J. and Rolley, E., ¬´ Wetting and spreading ¬ª, Reviews of modern physics, (2009) 81(2), p.739 . With Christiane Normand, and Manuel Garc√≠a Velarde, he studied convective instability BCross, M.C. and Hohenberg, P.C., ¬´ Pattern formation outside of equilibrium. ¬ª, Reviews of modern physics, (1993) 65(3), p.851. . Apart from simple situations, capillarity remains an area where fundamental questions remain. He showedPomeau Y., ¬´ Repr√©sentation de la ligne de contact mobile ¬ª, CRAS S√©rie, iib, t. 328 (2000), pp. 411‚Äì416 that the discrepancies appearing in the hydrodynamics of the moving contact line on a solid surface could only be eliminated by taking into account the evaporation/condensation near this line. Capillary forces are almost always insignificant in solid mechanics. Nevertheless, with Serge Mora and collaboratorsMora S. et al., ¬´ Capillarity driven instability of a soft solid ¬ª, Phys Rev. Lett, 205, (2010) they have shown theoretically and experimentally that soft gel filaments are subject to Rayleigh-Plateau instability, an instability never observed before for a solid.

Born in Glasgow, Fulton worked as an iron moulder, joining the Associated Iron Moulders of Scotland (AIMS) union, and also the Independent Labour Party. He was elected to the union's executive council, and by the early 1910s was its vice-chair. In 1913, Fulton was elected as one of three assistant secretaries of AIMS, alongside John Whyte and Robert Smith, with a remit to focus on the new benefits scheme administered by the union. He proved successful, and in August 1918 he was elected as general secretary of the union. He worked closely with the union's president, Tom Bell, and supported the Clyde Workers' Committee, giving strike pay to its members who took industrial action. With the end of World War I, employment in the foundries declined, and the union's membership fell. In 1920, AIMS merged with several other unions, to form the National Union of Foundry Workers. Fulton was elected as the union's assistant general secretary, then in 1922 he won election as general secretary. Given the difficult position of the union, he stated that \\"I do not know whether congratulations or sympathies are most appropriate to anyone elected to the General Secretaryship of a Trade Union at the present time\\". The CWS Bank extended credit to the union, the journal was put out quarterly rather than monthly, and the union proposed higher contributions and lower benefits to members. This stabilised the union's finances, although membership continued to fall. Fulton became ill in 1925, but kept his condition secret until his death in May.

He is a corresponding member of the French Academy of sciences and a member of the French Academy of Technologies.  Biography  Civil Engineer at the √âcole des Mines de Paris (1963), Master of Science in Physics and Mathematics at the Faculty of Sciences in Paris (1965), Doctor of State in Physics at the Faculty of Sciences in Paris (1970), he was a CNRS researcher at the √âcole Polytechnique (1964-1972), Professor of Mechanics at the University of Paris- XIII (1972-89), Research Director at the CNRS at the √âcole Polytechnique (1990-2006) then at ENSAM Paris (2007-2009) and Professor of Mechanics at the √âcole Polytechnique (1990-2004). He has also taught in other higher education establishments (Pierre-et-Marie-Curie University, √âcole des mines de Paris, √âcole nationale des ponts et chauss√©es, √âcole nationale sup√©rieure de techniques avanc√©es, √âcole centrale Paris).  Scientific work  Andr√© Zaoui's scientific work covers the fields of research, training and collective research animation. They are focused on the transition from microscopic to macroscopic material mechanics, at the crossroads between the mechanics of continuous media and materials science. His research work has been devoted to investigating the relationships between the microstructure of mesoscale materials (scale of polycrystal grains, inclusions or fibres in composites, phase domains in multiphase materials...) and their macroscopic mechanical behaviour, both in deformation and damage. In this framework, his contributions focus on the design, development and use of theoretical, methodological and experimental tools to link the microscopic and macroscopic scales in materials mechanics. He first (1964-72) studied the viscoplasticity of metals, in particular updating and interpreting the phenomenon of \\"creep hesitation \\":L. Brun, A. Zaoui, ¬´ Sur l‚Äôh√©sitation au fluage, C. Gr. F ¬ª, Rh√©ologie, 5, (1967), p. 267-284 to this end, he contributed to the development of models of the transition from single to polycrystal in elasto(visco)plasticity by proposing a critique of previous models and a secant formulation of the self-coherent model for non-linear behaviours.A.

Design The Pierce-Arrow armoured lorry was a turreted armoured lorry based on an imported American Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company 5-ton truck chassis with added armoured bodywork, it was armed with a turreted QF 3-pounder Vickers gun. The Pierce-Arrow had a front mounted engine protected by folding armoured panels, behind the engine was an enclosed driver's compartment a single two armoured shutter, the turret was behind the driver's compartment. The Pierce-Arrow armoured lorry used the same chassis as the Pierce-Arrow armoured AA lorry, it used identical bonnet armour as the latter whilst the driver's compartment was reduced to half width to allow the main gun to fire forwards. History Construction of the two Pierce-Arrow armoured lorries was carried out by W. G. Allen & Sons in Tipton, who used armoured plate for the fighting compartment, the turret turntables were manufactured by John Shearman & Co at Newport, Wales, where the RNAS had a depot to service armoured cars. The two vehicles were dispatched to Russia in 1916 with No 1 Squadron, Royal Naval Armoured Car Division under Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson for the expedition to Russia and the Causasus. Throughout the campaign the Pierce-Arrows provided heavy fire support to the lighter Lanchester armoured cars that made up the bulk of the force. In Russia the weight proved to be too heavy for the chassis so the turrets were removed, and the guns were mounted on a pedestal with a shield, and the hull sides were filled in with flat plates.

Early life Nagendra Saklani was born on 16 November 1920 in the village of Pujar Gaon in Saklana Patti of the princely state of Tehri Garhwal. He studied in Dehradun up to class X. During his school days he came in contact with the Praja Mandal activities in the erstwhile princely state of Tehri and joined the organization to actively participate in the freedom movement. Last letter of Nagendra Saklani from Kirti Nagar a day before his death. Sachhidanand Painuli collection Political activism Saklani was actively involved in organizing the activities of Praja Mandal, an offshoot of the Congress that worked exclusively in the princely states of India during the British occupation. Gradually he shifted his allegiance to the communist ideology. He was amongst the first batch of students of Anand Swaroop Bhardwaj, a young Marxist from Allahabad, sent to Dehradun to formally establish the communist party in the Garhwal region. Together with Brijendra Gupta, Nagendra Saklani started actively supporting the peasants' movement within the princely state of Tehri. He was actively involved in the Kadakot (Dangchoura) peasants uprising by providing assistance to the peasant leader Dada Daulat Ram. His activities infuriated a faction of Praja Mandal leaders who were interested in following a liberal approach in dealing with the King of the princely state of Tehri. Consequently, he was expelled from the Praja Mandal Party. However few young activists like Bhudev Lakhera, Trepan Singh Negi and Inder Singh Rana continued to collaborate with Nagendra Saklani in assisting the peasants' movement. Nagendra Saklani also worked in the British Garhwal region. He was amongst the core team members that assisted Chandra Singh Garhwali during his Pauri election campaign of 1946. =Saklana Dhandhak= On 15 August 1947, India became an independent country, however, rule of the king in the princely state of Tehri still continued. The villagers of the Saklana revolted against the new taxes imposed by the Jageerdar of Saklana, a small state within the princely state of Tehri. On 13 September 1947, the King sent an army contingent to Saklana to enforce new taxes and collect penalties from the villages. Collective fines of more than 13000 rupees were imposed on the villages. The army contingent sent under the command of Markanday Thapliyal started confiscating the properties of the villagers. Most of the villagers fled to village Kyara bordering the district of Dehradun in independent India. Nagendra Saklani assisted in establishing the refugee camp at Kyara. He organized the villagers who eventually went back to fight with the forces of Tehri state. In a surprise move, the villagers fought back and arrested the police party at Manjhgoan Akhodi in Saklana. The police party was escorted to the boundary of Saklana in a big procession and sent back to Tehri. A few days later the Muaafidar (landlord) of Sakalana Patti cancelled all its treaties with the princely state and announced the merger of Saklana with the union of India. Trepan Singh Negi with funeral Bier of Nagendra Saklani =Kirti Nagar incident= In his last letter dated 10 January 1948, Nagendra Saklani wrote that ‚Äò yesterday we organized a meeting of 600 volunteers at Kirti Nagar and gave an ultimatum to the Sub Divisional Magistrate to vacate the place, which they obliged. The police and army also surrendered and left in motors for Narendranagar. Kirti Nagar is free from the Tehri state and is now part of India. People from adjoining villages are now marching towards Kirti Nagar to join the mission. We have appointed Raghunandan Pratap Dangwal (M.A., L. L. B.) as the new S.D.O. of Kirti Nagar under President Daulat Ram. A brave peasant Manju Singh Kandari has been appointed as the new inspector of police. Tomorrow early, we are planning to march towards Tehri and the plan is to take Tehri by 15 January‚Äô. However next day, that is on 11 January 1948, a contingent of royal army under the command of Jagdish Dobhal arrived from Narendra Nagar with orders to forcibly retake the Kirti Nagar court and other buildings. During the violent confrontation Dobhal shot Molu Ram Bhardari and fled from the scene. The mob chased the killer and other officers and ranks. Nagendra Saklani was leading the chase and he managed to catch Dobhal before he could enter the nearby forest. Nagendra Saklani was shot dead by Jagdish Dobhal in point-blank range as he grabbed his legs. =Funeral procession= Following the violence, all the state officers were arrested by the mob including SDO Jagdish Dobhal. They were locked in a court room with volunteers as guards as the angry crowd wanted an instant justice. Trepan Singh Negi a Praja Mandal activist, Devi Dutt Tiwari a communist leader, Dada Daulat Ram, a peasant leader and Triloki Nath Purvar a congress volunteer played an important role in controlling the crowd. Arrangements were made for the cremation of the martyrs next morning. However arrival of an agitated Chandra Singh Garhwali early next morning turned the entire sequence of events. Chandra Singh Garhwali suggested taking the bodies of the martyrs to Tehri. Everyone agreed and they immediately started their march towards Tehri. It took three days to reach Tehri, the capital of the princely state of Tehri. Thousands of villagers joined the funeral procession. The police post along the route surrendered in front of the procession. The SDO Dobhal and other captured state functionaries also marched as prisoners. The kings army and administration also surrendered on 14th January. The state was now in the hands of revolutionaries who ran the administration till 1st August 1949, when the princely state of Tehri was legally merged within the union of India.

It was founded in Torino in 2015 to coordinate all the activities which, up to that moment, had been conducted individually by the brands to promote their historical and cultural heritage.  History  The Alfa Romeo Museum in Arese Heritage HUB The Fiat 600 Multipla exhibited at the V&A; Museum in London during the retrospetcive \\"Cars: Accelerating the Modern World\\" In the 1960s and 1970s, several Italian automotive manufacturers (that later merged into the FCA Group) launched programmes to protect and promote their historical heritage, which led to the opening of the Centro Storico Fiat (Fiat Historical Center) in Turin in 1963 and, later, of the Lancia Museum in 1971. The Museo Storico Alfa Romeo opened in Arese a few years later, in 1976. Both the Alfa Romeo Museum and the Centro Storico Fiat are still in operation and house the automotive collections and historical production records of their respective brands, in addition to archival collections which include technical drawings and designs, advertising materials, financial and industrial documentation, films and images. In the same years, Fiat acquired Autobianchi in 1968, Ferrari and Lancia in 1969, Abarth in 1971, Alfa Romeo in 1986 and finally Innocenti and Maserati in 1990. The Lancia Museum, located in Borgo San Paolo in Turin closed in 1993 and the cars of its collection were transferred to an industrial building belonging to the Fiat Group in Beinasco. Abarth was relaunched in the 2000s. The operational autonomy of the brand was supported by an operation aimed at taking advantage of its historical heritage. The collection of the brands's record-breaking and rally racing cars was put on display in the new Abarth headquarters, located in the industrial hub of Mirafiori. Certification and restoration services dedicated to the vintage cars of the brand were activated in parallel. Fiat S.p.A. and Chrysler Group in 2014 merged to become FCA and FCA Heritage was founded the following year to expand the Abarth experience to the Alfa Romeo, Fiat and Lancia brands. Roberto Giolito was named head of FCA Heritage. The automotive designer had led the Centro Stile Fiat (FCA EMEA Design Center) and is the creator of Fiat Multipla and Fiat 500.  Location  In 2019, the department opened its operational headquarters, the \\"Heritage HUB\\". The multi-functional space is located in a former Fiat mechanical workshop in the Mirafiori plant called Officina 81. The 15,000 square metre surface area of the building houses staff offices, a central area dedicated to meetings and workshops, the classic car sales service showroom, an exhibition celebrating the 80th anniversary of the Mirafiori plant and a selection of the company's collection of vintage cars consisting of more than 300 models mostly made by Fiat and Abarth and, to a lesser extent, by Alfa Romeo, in addition to the entire Lancia collection previously kept in Beinasco. Of the 300 cars on display in the Heritage Hub, 64 feature in eight thematic areas with eight models each. In addition to the over 300 cars at the Hub, the FCA Heritage collection includes some 30 vintage Fiat cars on display in the Centro Storico Fiat and more than 250 Alfa Romeo cars kept in the Alfa Romeo Museum in Arese.  Activities and services  FCA Heritage works to protect the historical heritage of the brands of the Group by periodically restoring and maintaining the cars in the company's collection. FCA Heritage has listed and mapped all the official Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Lancia and Abarth clubs and takes part in international exhibitions dedicated to vintage cars in official capacity, including Concours d'Elegance, rallies, classic car gatherings and specialised motor shows, such as Goodwood Festival of Speed, R√©tromobile, the Geneva Motor Show, Mille Miglia, the Cesana-Sestriere rally and Targa Florio. FCA Heritage donated a Fiat 500 F to the MOMA in New York and has established relationships with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Triennale Design Museum in Milan, the Mus√©e National de la Voiture in Compi√®gne and the Technik Museum in Sinsheim which in 2019 dedicated the opening exhibition of its new display area to the history of Alfa Romeo. A number of services are offered to Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Lancia and Abarth classic car owners, including certification of authenticity, certificate of origin and a vintage car restoration and repair service, as well as a classic car trading programme, called ‚ÄúReloaded by Creators‚Äù .

In the 18th and 19th century, stomachers became large, eye- catching pieces of jewellery to be worn with formal court gowns or ball gowns. Like the tiara, it was a jewel pre-eminently suited to expressing social status.  Description  A stomacher is worn on the centre panel of the bodice of a dress, which is also called stomacher. A stomacher can consist of one element, or more If it consists of one element, this is best described as a large and elaborate brooch to be worn at the top of the bodice, in the centre of the neckline. A stomacher that consists of more than one element often has the overall shape of an inverted triangle: the element to be worn at the neckline is widest, with the lower elements tapering downwards towards the waist and covering the entire centre panel of the bodice. The elements can usually also be worn individually. Ever since the Renaissance, the centre panels of bodices were adorned with precious stones and pearls that were sewn to the fabric. The stomacher as a separate piece of jewellery became popular in the second half of the 18th century and was worn until the beginning of the 20th century. It was mainly worn with ball gowns or ceremonial gowns for events at court. Stomachers were made of gold, silver or platinum and richly decorated with precious stones and pearls. Because of its weight, a large stomacher could only be worn if the bodice of the gown was corsetted. In some countries, a similar, but simpler, piece of jewellery is part of the traditional folk costume. A stomacher could be part of a parure, a set of jewellery with the same design. Stomachers went out of fashion at the beginning of the 20th century. Nowadays, an antique stomacher (or one of its elements) is occasionally worn as a brooch with an evening gown. It is then usually worn on the shoulder or on the belt, and not on the neckline.

Examples of such decisions are choosing the location for a warehouse or planning the regions for a marketing campaign. Data, information and framing conditions are visualized on maps in order to derive recommendations for action. In comparison to geographic information systems (GIS), which primarily aim at the representation of information on maps (descriptive analytics), Geographic analytics additionally focuses on making business decisions based on the data visualization on the map (prescriptive analytics). Background Purely mathematically based approaches that are used in data analytics in order to support management decisions often have the disadvantage that they require a large amount of data. This often results in considerable efforts for gathering, cleaning and understanding the data. Furthermore, there can be ‚Äúintangible‚Äù framing conditions that are disruptive to any purely data-driven optimization solution. Example logistics: For the task to find the optimal location for a warehouse in a logistics network, so-called Center of Gravity models are being used. To minimize the cost, these models use transport volume data, customer locations, cost data, etc., in order to determine the optimal location. However, there are often framing conditions - for example, traffic infrastructure, borders, regulatory and even physical hurdles ‚Äì which are difficult to be mathematically described and modelled. In practice, such framing conditions are often only recognized at the end of the data-driven analysis. The framing conditions then have to be included into the model, and the model then has to be recalculated. As a worst case, the approach to the problem has to be done from scratch. This results in delays of the decision making process and often goes along with significant additional efforts. Application and objective Geographic analytics starts with the visualization of basic data on a map. By involving experts from the field, the visualization is then being used in order to determine framing conditions and focal points of the business problem. As a result, the solution space, i.e. the number of possible solutions of the data analysis, is being reduced. In addition, framing conditions as well as data errors are being recognized in this early stage of the analysis. Only then, traditional data analytics methods are coming into play to find the optimal solution to the problem. With this approach, much less data is required for the overall analysis and time and effort for the analysis is being significantly reduced. Impracticable and flawed solutions are being identified and excluded upfront. Areas of application Geographic analytics is being used in connection with data analyses in order to support management decisions that contain a geographical component, such as location decisions, marketing campaigns, service center placements, etc. =Example Industries= *Logistics / Supply chain management Example: Planning the location of a distribution center to minimize logistics costs when distributing products to customers. *Retail trade Example: Opening of a new shop at a strategically favorable location for commuters *Oil and gas Industry Example: Planning the locations of test wells in order to develop a new oil field at the lowest possible cost. =Example business areas= *Marketing Example: Development of a regional marketing campaign for a new product *Infrastructure Example: Traffic planning / planning of traffic expansions in a large city to reduce congestion times *Services Example: Planning the placement of ATMs in order to achieve the highest possible degree of coverage in a region Etymology The term and the methodology of geographic analytics were first described in 2013 by Jozo Acksteiner and Claudia Trautmann in the Supply Chain Management Review.

He is one of the founding fathers of Bayelsa state. He was a member of a high-powered delegation of Ijaws that lobbied the Nbanefo Panel for state creation during regional agitations for the creation of additional states in Nigeria. Agbedi, a ranking member of the Nigeria federal House of Representatives represents Sagbama/Ek eremor federal constituency of Bayelsa State. He was first elected to the green chamber in the third republic in 1992, but spent only a year in the parliament when the third republic was aborted and the parliament dissolved. Agbedi returned to the house of representatives in 2015. He was Bayelsa State chairman of People's Democratic Party, PDP during the term of Goodluck Jonathan as Governor of the state until 2007. In 2011 and 2019, Agbedi made unsuccessful attempts to be the governor of oil rich state of Bayelsa nicknamed ‚ÄúThe creek Haven‚Äù.  Early life and education  Agbedi was born in Aghoro, a coastal community in Ekeremor Local Government Area of Bayelsa. He attended State School, Aghoro, and Oproza Grammar School, Patani for his primary and secondary school education. He earned Nigeria Certificate in Education (NCE), majoring in English and History from College of Education, Warri, Delta State. He holds Bachelor of Education (B. Ed) in English from University of Port Harcourt and masters (M. Sc) in Public Administration from University of Abuja. Agbedi, a professional teacher excelled in his career and rose to higher ranks of Confidential Secretary to the Secretary, Local Teaching Service Committee, Pay Officer. Agbedi was a member, Adhoc Committee on Verification of Primary/Post Primary School Teachers, and was Confidential Secretary to the Military Panel on Screening and Verification of staff of Burutu LGA, Delta State. He left public service for private business in the mid-80s.  Political career  =Party political offices= Agbedi became an active politician after joining National Republican Convention (NRC) in 1992, and soon became Secretary of the party in his local council of Ekeremor. NRC was proscribed after the military take-over of government in 1993. In 1998, Agbedi joined the newly registered United Nigeria Congress Party (UNCP) in preparation for the return to democratic rule in 1999. He was a member of UNCP screening committee for the Bayelsa state assembly. He ran for UNCP nomination to run for the Bayelsa-West Senatorial District but lose at his party's primary emerging first runner-up in 1998. He later joined the People's Democratic Party (PDP), serving in different capacities including Special Assistant to the Chairman, PDP Computerized Membership Registration Committee in Bayelsa State in 2001. He was secretary of the PDP National Committee on Supervising, Monitoring and Conduct of Congresses/Convention of 2001 in Abia State. In 2002, Agbedi contested in the PDP primary election for a ticket to run for Bayelsa West Senatorial District but lose. In 2007, Governor Goodluck Jonathan who was the vice president elect at the time appointed Agbedi to the Transition Committee on Handover of Power in Government of Bayelsa State to governor Timipre Sylva. =Bayelsa State PDP Chairman= In 2005, Agbedi was elected Chairman of Bayelsa State PDP during the administration of Governor Goodluck Jonathan. Agbedi led PDP governorship campaign that brought Timipre Sylva to power as governor of Bayelsa State in 2007 following the nomination of Governor Jonathan for vice president which he later won. But Agbedi fell out with Governor Sylva and opted to resign his PDP chairmanship position after criticising Sylva that his government was failing. PDP leaders in the state including then vice president of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan prevailed on Agbedi to remain in his position. In 2008, Governor Sylva instigated crisis in the party that led to the removal of Agbedi from office as Bayelsa State PDP Chairman in February that year. =DG Governor Dickson campaign= Agbedi was Director General of Siriake Dickson governorship campaign for his first and second term campaigns in 2012 and 2015. Agbedi led Dickson and PDP to victory in both elections. In the 2012 governorship election, Dickson won with 417,500 or 88.7 per cent of the total votes cast in the election. Imoro Kubor of the Change Advocacy Party, CAP came second in that election with 22,534 votes. =Political appointments= Agbedi was a Senior Legislative Aide to the President of the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. In 2012, Governor Siriake Dickson appointed Agbedi a senior special adviser on political matters. He resigned from this position in 2014 to run for Sagbama/Ekeremor Federal Constituency in Bayelsa State.  Election to House of Representatives  =Election to the 3rd National Assembly in the 3rd Republic= Agbedi was first elected to the National Assembly of the Federal Republic of Nigeria during the 3rd Assembly in the Third Republic in 1992 representing Ekeremor Federal Constituency then of Rivers State. He held membership assignment on house committees on Public Accounts and Sports and Youth Development in the 3rd Assembly. Agbedi was the youngest member in the 3rd assembly. In 1993, the third republic was aborted after General Ibrahim Babangida annulled the disputed June 12, 1993 presidential election. Moshood Kashmawo Abiola was the acclaimed winner of the election. Agbedi returned to his home state after the dissolution of the assembly and continued his grass root mobilisation under different community services retaining and gaining more of his grass root popularity until democracy returned in 1999. =Return to the National Assembly in the 4th Republic= Agbedi started the race to return to the national assembly in 2014 after resigning from his position in the government of Governor Siriake Dickson as senior special adviser on political matters. He contested in the PDP primary election for nomination to run for Sagbama/Ekeremor federal constituency seat in the national assembly scoring 100 votes beating Stella Dorgu backed by President Goodluck Jonathan. He won in the general election in 2015. In 2019, Agbedi ran for a return ticket to the national assembly and won to a third term in the house.  Race for governor  = 2011 Governorship race = Agbedi ran twice un-successfully for governor of Bayelsa State on the platform of PDP. His first attempt was in 2011 when he ran for the PDP nomination against incumbent Governor Timipre Sylva who was running for a second term. It was widely speculated that Agbedi was being sponsored to run against governor Sylva by President Goodluck Jonathan. But agbedi denied that he was being sponsored by anyone. Ahead of the party primary, the PDP Screening Committee disqualified both Agbedi and Sylva from contesting in the party's primary. This ended Agbedi's first attempt to be governor of the state. Agbedi transferred his campaign structure and supporters to Siriake Dickson who eventually won the party's primary in 2011. Dickson in turn appointed Agbedi as Director General of his governorship campaign organisation and proceeded to victory in the general election. = 2019 Governorship race = In 2019, Agbedi made a second attempt to be governor of Bayelsa. At a public declaration of interest to run for governor in July 2019, Agbedi declared himself the most qualified candidate. ‚ÄúOf course, I consider myself popular to win election in Bayelsa, simply because the people know me for who I am. I have a character, I have exhibited transparency, I have exhibited sincerity and the people know that I can be trusted‚Äù. Ahead of his party's primary, several issues came up against Agbedi including the issue of zoning or rotation of governor among the three senatorial districts in the state. Agbedi from a zone that had already produced governors dismissed the zoning principle and continued his campaign. Few weeks to the party primary election, Governor Dickson announced three persons as his preferred candidates. Senator Douye Diri was one of the ‚ÄúAnointed candidates‚Äù. Agbedi reacted almost immediately describing the decision as ‚Äúfairy tale‚Äù and said Dickson had no preferred candidates. Douye Diri won the primary election but the result was disputed saying Governor Dickson manipulated the process.

Various unions of foundry workers met at the London International Trade Union Congress of 1888, and the British Friendly Society of Iron Founders (FSIF) proposed that a \\"Federation of all Iron Moulders' Unions in the World\\" be established. The proposal was revived in 1891, when the FSIF established links with the Iron Moulders' Society of Victoria, Iron Molders' Union of North America, Machinery Moulders' Union of America, shortly followed by the Hungarian Trade Union of Ironfounders. The group also corresponded with the Iron and Metal Founders and Their Labourers of Lower Austria, a Swiss union and three other Australian unions, but by the end of 1892, it had ceased to operate. In 1898, the International Secretariat of Foundry Workers was established. It operated until 1904, when it merged into the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF). In 1949, a mixture of opposition to the federation's withdrawal from the World Federation of Trade Unions, and the IMF's refusal to create a sectoral organisation for foundry workers, led six unions to form the International Federation of Foundry Workers (IFF). This consisted of the National Union of Foundry Workers, International Molders and Foundry Workers Union of North America, and four Scandinavian unions. The unions retained their IMF membership, and in 1951, the IMF organised a foundry workers' sectoral meeting, which agreed to establish a foundry workers' section. The IMF committee vetoed the proposal, arguing that foundry work cut across many areas of the federation's work, and it offered only a consultation among foundry workers about the best way to represent them. Despite this, the IFF dissolved in 1954.

The son of Michael Bacon, he was likely born in England and emigrated to Dedham in 1640 with his father. His father had moved to Ireland about seven years before they moved to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. From his father's will, he inherited land in Dorchester and most of Michael's land in Dedham. He frequently served in a number of positions and on a number of committees, including four years as selectman beginning in 1661. Bacon was one of the signers of the petition of the town of Dedham against the Indians of Natick that was sent to the governor, his council, and General Court on May 7, 1662. Previously, he surveyed and laid out the 2,000 acres that had been granted to the Indians but then revoked. When a dispute arose about the allotment of land, Bacon signed the petition stating asking for mediation. He ran afoul of local laws in 1671 for attempting to sell some of his land to a non-Dedhamite without permission. He was a member of Captain Timothy Dwight's company in King Philip's War and was stationed at the garrison in Wrentham in 1676. He married Rebecca Hall on December 17, 1651, and together they had nine children: John, Rebecca, Daniel, Sarah, Samuel, Thomas, Susanna, Mary, and Stephen. He resided in Dedham until his death on June 17, 1683. At the time of his death, he owned 24 cattle, a relatively modest sized herd that was typical of Dedham in that era.

Biography  Trainee then Research Associate at the CNRS at the Paris Observatory, then at the Nice Observatory, he became an Astronomer at the Nice Observatory in 1972. He is Honorary Astronomer at the Observatoire de la C√¥te d'Azur since 2015. He was Director of the Centre de D√©pouillement des Clich√©s Astronomiques at the Institut National d'Astronomie et de G√©ophysique between 1973 and 1981. He was also director of the Cassiopeia laboratory (UMR CNRS/OCA) between 2004 and 2007. He experimented with Andr√© Lallemand's electronic camera in 1970 at the 1.93 m telescope at the Haute-Provence Observatory. The asteroid Bijaoui was named in his honour.  Scientific work  His research work has focused on various themes related to astronomical imaging. During the preparation of his thesis, he contributed to the development of electronography with the study and interpretation of the properties of Andr√© Lallemand's electronic camera. In parallel, he was involved in its exploitation for astrophysical purposes. With the creation in 1973 of the Centre de D√©pouillement des Clich√©s Astronomiques at Nice Observatory, he was involved in the development of new methods for the analysis of astrophysical data and in the creation of software to exploit them for the French astronomical community.Bijaoui A., Skybackground estimation and application , Astron. and Astrophys., v.84, 1980, p. 81-84Bijaoui A. et Froeschl√© M., A new algorithm to determine image edges.

Most of her scientific and research work was devoted to the study of non-biological, so-called colloidal, turbidity of beer and methods of delaying its production during storage. She participated in scientific, educational and publishing activities in the Czech Republic and abroad, and published 538 items, mostly in foreign journals. In 2012, Basarova was awarded the State Medal of Merit. Early life and education Gabriela (\\"G√°bina\\") Basa≈ôov√° was born in Plze≈à, 17 January 1934. She graduated from high school, where chemistry and mathematics were among her favorite subjects. During her studies, she worked in laboratories, in a waterworks, distillery, canning factory, and in Plze≈à breweries, after which, she decided to study brewing. In 1952, she graduated from the University of Chemistry and Technology, Prague (Vysok√° ≈°kola chemicko-technologick√° v Praze; V≈†CHT), majoring in fermentation chemistry and technology, specializing in malting and brewing. In the following years, she gradually gained scientific and pedagogical degrees in the Czech Republic.

In providing technological assistance, it cooperated with Czech, Slovak, Yugoslav, Bulgarian and other breweries. In 1981, Basarova was appointed professor of fermentation chemistry and bioengineering in the field of malting and brewing; and became the external head of the Institute of Fermentation Chemistry and Bioengineering, ICT Prague, where in 1982, she became permanently employment. She led the institute for the next 25 years until 1997, lecturing on the subjects of malting, brewing, modern biotechnology, viticulture, and bioecology. In her scientific and research work, she dealt with the properties of raw materials and their influence on beer quality, innovations of technological processes and analytical methods for the needs of malting and brewing, study of brewing yeast metabolism and importance of yeast strains for characteristic beer types, as well as technological variants of their reduction. Most of her scientific and research work was devoted to the study of non-biological, so-called colloidal, turbidity of beer and methods of delaying their production during storage. This work was followed by the introduction of optimal technological stabilization procedures in order to increase the physical-chemical stability of beer. In addition to the management of the institute (formerly the name of the department) at the ICT, she was for many years chair of the committee for state examinations and defense of diploma theses in the field of fermentation chemistry and bioengineering, chairman of the committees for defense of candidate (CSc.).

It is now part of the Slovak National Library and preserved in the former Apponyi family castle in Oponice, Slovakia. History Anton Georg Apponyi started the collection around 1774 and had already amassed 30,000 volumes by the late 1770s. He kept most of his collection in Vienna, with some items held in his Hungarian country castle in H≈ëgy√©sz. Following his death in 1817, his son Anton (Antal) bought out his siblings' share, for the financing of which he had to sell several thousands of books. In 1825, Anton Apponyi decided to move it all to a dedicated building open to the public in Pressburg (Pozsony, today's Bratislava), making it the first public library in the territory of today's Slovakia. The move was celebrated at the time as a Hungarian patriotic gesture, since Pressburg was then part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The building in Kecske Street (, today in ), no longer extant, was ceremonially opened in the spring of 1827, with a monumental facade displaying the Apponyi heraldic arms and the Latin inscription LITERIS IN PATRIA AUGENDIS (\\"for the development of letters in the fatherland\\"). In 1846, following disagreements with the municipality on the library's management and cost- sharing, Anton Apponyi closed the Pressburg facility and moved its content to the Apponyi family's ancestral home in Appony (now Oponice, Slovakia), where a dedicated neoclassical wing was built for that purpose. The library stayed there until World War II, despite some of its contents being dispersed in sales because of the Apponyi family's recurrent financial needs. In particular, Count Lajos Apponyi sold a \\"choice portion\\" of it \\"comprising extraordinarily rare works\\" at Sotheby's in London in November 1892. More of the contents was dispersed in the late 1930s following the end of Apponyi family ownership of the Oponice domain in 1935, and lost to negligence during Communism. Some of remaining books were transferred by the Matica slovensk√° to its facility in Bratislava in 1965, then all of them (including those in Bratislava) to Martin in 1972, while the wooden interior of the library wing in Oponice was destroyed. The damaged books were restored in Martin, then the library was again transferred to storage in in 1992, and eventually reinstalled in Oponice in 2011 following the Apponyi castle's renovation. Librarians and scholars The creation of the library owes much to Agostino Michelazzi (1732-1820), a former Jesuit who built it up on behalf of Count Anton Georg Apponyi. The next major figure in the library's management was Karl Anton Gruber von Grubenfels (1760-1840), a lesser nobleman from Szeged who also authored a number of fiction works, poems and theater plays in German as well as a Historia linguae ungaricae (History of the Hungarian Language) published in Pressburg in 1830. Gruber appears to have been instrumental in persuading Count Anton Apponyi to move the library from Vienna to Pressburg in the early 1820s, and remained Librarian of the Apponyi Public Library until 1833. Franciscan friar and historian V≈°evlad J. Gajdo≈° (1907-1978) studied and preserved the Apponyi Library while working at the Matica slovensk√° between 1956 and 1958. As of 2015, the Custodian of the Apponyi Library was Peter Kr√°lik. In 2012 he received the Crystal Wing Award for his role in the restoration of the library. Current status The remaining portion of the original collection has been kept since 2011 in the renovated Apponyi Castle in Oponice, Slovakia as a branch of the Slovak National Library, together with parts of the collection assembled by the Zay (or Zai) family from Uhrovec (Ugr√≥cz), formerly stored in Bojnice Castle and also studied by V≈°evlad J. Gajdo≈°. The rest of the castle is operated as a luxury hotel, branded Chateau- Appony. Most of the Library's books are in Latin, French and German. Fewer titles are in Italian, Hungarian and Russian. There are also some in Spanish, Arabic and Hebrew, but none in Slovak. This is ironic but not surprising, given the comparatively late emergence of Slovak as a written language, and the Apponyi family's association with Magyarization policies. In chronological terms, 3% of the prints are from the 16th century, 13% from the 17th century, 33% from the 18th century, 37% from the 19th century, and 12% from the 20th century, with the remaining 1.5% without indication of publication date.

(Original description)The small shell has a narrow and slender shape. The rather long spire shows a conical shape. The protoconch is polygyrous, conoidal, with convex whorls and a pointed apex. The teleoconch contains six whorls. The first one is convex and finely ribbed. The others are biangular, the height of which exceeds half the width. They are separated by linear and wavy sutures, ornated with thick ribs, spaced apart, forming two knots crenellated by the two angles which share the height in three equal spaces. There is only spiral nets on the body whorl, the two upper regions are smooth.The body whorl measures more than five-eighths of the total length. It is ovally attenuated at the base, on which sinuous ribs extend, crossed by an alternating reticulation, which tightens by winding around the siphonal canal. The aperture is very narrow, with almost parallel edges, truncated by the siphonal canal. The outer lip is straight. The columella is slightly callous and almost straight.Cossmann, Maurice.

In its first phase, the corridor with approximately connects Itapevi and Jandira, along with stations Itapevi, Engenheiro Cardoso, Sagrado Cora√ß√£o and Jandira. History The region interconnected through Estrada Velha de Itu, used by tropeiros for trips between S√£o Paulo, Carapicu√≠ba Village, Santana de Parna√≠ba, Sorocaba and Itu. Throughout the 20th century, roads were built, as the old road towards Itu was replaced by a highway (current SP-312) on 1 May 1922. This road became (beside Sorocabana railway and future Castelo Branco and Raposo Tavares highways) one of the transport corridors that boosted the region growth, being one of the points of population densification that went there. In 1934, the first regular bus lines began operating between Carapicu√≠ba, Largo da Batata and Lapa, which became the main regional centres of West Side S√£o Paulo. In the next 30 years, the cities of S√£o Paulo, Santana de Para√≠ba and Cotia break up, creating new cities: Itapevi (1949), Barueri (1949), Osasco (1962), Carapicu√≠ba (1964) and Jandira (1964). Until then, the public transportation was controlled by the state through permissions, creating dozens of companies and small vehicle owners. This situation is changed in the 1970s with the creation of EMTU, which starts regulating the intermunicipal lines. In the same decade, the first modernization project of this transport corridor was made. The Prefecture of S√£o Paulo suggests the installing of a trolleybus corridor between Largo da Batata and Osasco. Besides the construction was never initiated, EMTU keeps planning the corridor (now called West Road Corridor) through the 1980s and 1990s.

He opposed the takeover of the province by al-Hasan ibn Ubayd Allah ibn Tughj and joined the Qarmatians, fighting with them against the Fatimids until 974. After the defeat of the second Qarmatian invasion of Egypt in that year, Akhu Muslim fled to Arabia, pursued by Fatimid agents. He was betrayed in the end by his Qarmatian allies, who poisoned him near Basra. Family Akhu Muslim was a descendant of Husayn ibn Ali through Ali Zayn al- Abidin, who had settled in Medina after Husayn's death in the Battle of Karbala. There the Husaynids had become the most prominent local family, and in the early 10th century, some of them had migrated to Egypt. Akhu Muslim's father, Ubayd Allah, and uncle, al-Hasan, settled in Ramla, the chief city of Palestine. Akhu Muslim had two older brothers: Abu Ja'far Muslim, the elder brother, who was considered the leading Alid of his time and after whom Akhu Muslim himself was nicknamed, and Abu'l-Husayn Isa. Akhu Muslim married Sufia, the sister of the emir of Mecca, Ja'far ibn Muhammad al-Hasani. Career under the Ikhshidids Contemporary accounts and later historians portray Akhu Muslim as a proud and haughty man; Kafur's court fool, Sibawaih, is known to have frequently ridiculed him for this. Nevertheless, Akhu Muslim apparently possessed some military ability, as he was entrusted by the Ikhshidid ruler Abu'l-Misk Kafur with command of an army sent to protect the Hajj pilgrimage of 965 from attacks by the Bedouin tribe of the Banu Sulaym in Syria. Although not entirely successful in his mission‚Äîthe constant Bedouin and Qarmatian raids on the overland Hajj caravans and the inability of the Ikhshidid regime to stop them led to their temporary cessation after 965‚Äîa few months before his death in April 968, Kafur appointed Akhu Muslim as governor of Palestine. After Kafur's death, an Ikhshidid prince, al-Hasan ibn Ubayd Allah ibn Tughj, had been named governor of Syria and Palestine. He arrived at Ramla to assume his post, but Akhu Muslim refused to surrender it. Allying himself with a local Bedouin leader, Timal al-Khafaji of the Banu Uqayl, Akhu Muslim attacked al-Hasan near Ramla, but was defeated. Akhu Muslim did not give up his ambitions, however: claiming for himself the heritage of the Alids, he is reported to have proclaimed himself caliph and to have claimed the title of Mahdi. When the Qarmatians invaded Syria and attacked al-Hasan at Ramla in October 968, Akhu Muslim joined them. The Ikhshidid prince was defeated and obliged to pay tribute to the Qarmatians, while Akhu Muslim, who distinguished himself in the battle, was given a command in the Qarmatian army. In Qarmatian service against the Fatimids According to the 15th-century historian Idris Imad al-Din, Akhu Muslim led the Fatimid expedition against Byzantine-held Antioch in 970, which was abandoned after the defeat at the Battle of Alexandretta. This is obviously an error, however, as Akhu Muslim was staunchly opposed to the Fatimids and at the time was allied with the Qarmatians against them. In August/September 971, the Qarmatians under al- Hasan al-A'sam defeated the Fatimid general Ja'far ibn Fallah and captured Damascus, before once again taking Ramla. A Fatimid army sent to reinforce Ibn Fallah under Sa'adat ibn Hayyan withdrew to Jaffa, and Akhu Muslim was placed in charge of besieging it, along with the Qarmatian Abu'l-Munaja Abdallah ibn Ali and the Uqayli leader Zalim ibn Mawhub, while al-A'sam led the bulk of his forces into Egypt. The invasion ended in defeat before Fustat in December, and the Qarmatians withdrew to Palestine to regroup. The Fatimids went into the counteroffensive in 972, and managed to break the siege of Jaffa. Akhu Muslim was the nominal leader of the allied Qarmatian‚ÄìBedouin army against the Fatimids, but the alliance disintegrated in 973 due to infighting between the Qarmatians and the Bedouin, allowing the Fatimids to seize again control of Palestine and southern Syria. This new ascendancy did not last long, as the Qarmatians regrouped and drove the Fatimids out of the area in 973. In spring 974, the Qarmatians even launched a second invasion of Egypt, where the local populace, exhausted by the Fatimids' heavy taxation, supported them. While the main Qarmatian army under al-A'sam occupied the Nile Delta, Akhu Muslim led a smaller force south, bypassed the Fatimid capital Cairo, and encamped between Asyut and Akhmim. From there he drove out the Fatimid tax officials, and raised the kharaj tax for his own account. Akhu Muslim's appearance in Egypt upset the hitherto rather amicable relations between the Fatimid dynasty and the ashraf families, as a number of ahsraf, especially younger sons, began to flock to his banner. Among those who joined him or tried to were his brother's son Ja'far ibn Muslim, a son and grandson of the chief Husaynid sharif of Damascus, Abu'l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn al-Aqiqi, and the brother and son of the chief Hasanid sharif of Fustat, Abu Isma'il Ibrahim al-Rassi. Alarmed, both Caliph al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah and the Fatimid chief missionary, Abu Ja'far Nasr, who had befriended Akhu Muslim before the Fatimid conquest, wrote to him to persuade him to abandon the Qarmatian cause, but in vain. In early April, Akhu Muslim defeated a Fatimid army sent against Akhmim. At the end of the month, however, the Fatimids under al-Mu'izz's son Abdallah managed to destroy the main Qarmatian army near Ayn Shams. The Fatimids now turned south to eliminate Akhu Muslim. The latter, having been warned by carrier pigeon, of their approach, could not hope to stand against them with his small army. He dispersed his men, and fled in the company of a single Bedouin. While watering his horse at the Nile, Akhu Muslim narrowly escaped capture by a Fatimid patrol; his Bedouin companion allowed himself to be caught and claimed to be Akhu Muslim, giving the latter the opportunity to escape. After an arduous journey, narrated in detail by al-Maqrizi, Akhu Muslim managed to cross Egypt and made for the Hejaz, where evidently hoped to find shelter with his brother-in-law. Flight to Arabia and death When he landed at the port of Aynuna, he was again nearly captured by a Fatimid patrol: the soldiers seized his coat, but he cut it with his sword and managed to escape the pursuit thanks to the speed of his horse. He settled in the great mosque of Medina for a while, until notices for his arrest were put up across the city; he then moved on, making for al-Ahsa, the capital of the Qarmatian state of Bahrayn. The Qarmatians gave him scant welcome and support, and Akhu Muslim once again departed, now determined to seek the aid of the Buyids in Baghdad. He was betrayed by his erstwhile allies, however: threatened by the Buyids, the Qarmatians had opened negotiations with the Fatimids, and as a token of good faith, moved to eliminate the troublesome Akhu Muslim. One of their agents followed him, and poisoned his milk. After much suffering, Akhu Muslim died on the next morning, near Basra.

Taxonomy It was described as a subspecies of the little yellow-shouldered bat (Sturnira lilium) in 1917 by American zoologist Edward Alphonso Goldman and given the trinomen S. lilium parvidens. The holotype had been collected in 1903 by Goldman and Edward William Nelson at \\"Papayo\\", given as northwest of Acapulco, Mexico. The species name \\"parvidens\\" derives from Latin parvus, meaning \\"small\\", and dens, meaning \\"tooth\\". The little yellow-shouldered bat has been recognized as a species complex, and some authors have considered S. parvidens as a separate species since 2000. In 2013, a genetic study further supported that it should be recognized as a full species. It forms a clade with Sturnira bakeri. Description Individuals have a forearm length of approximately . It has small teeth. The fur of its back is dark brown, with individual hairs possessing three or four color bands. Its belly fur is paler in color with tricolored hairs. Its face is brownish-gray.

It was written by MacColl and Gavin Povey, and produced by Steve Lillywhite. The song's music video was directed by Nick Morris and produced by Fiona O'Mahoney. MacColl also performed the song on Wogan, which was broadcast on 24 June 1985. Background \\"He's on the Beach\\" was inspired by a friend of MacColl's named Terry, who emigrated to Australia and sent postcards to her. Speaking of the song, MacColl told Record Mirror in 1985: \\"It's a summer single and I'm sure people will rush out and buy it if the clouds cleared. The single has no hidden depths, it's just about a bloke out in Australia enjoying himself.\\" Although MacColl's previous single \\"A New England\\" reached the UK Top Ten earlier in the year, \\"He's on the Beach\\" was not a commercial success. After its failure, MacColl primarily worked as a session backing singer and also recorded the UK number two hit \\"Fairytale of New York\\" with The Pogues in 1987. She returned as a solo artist with her album Kite in 1989. In 1995, MacColl performed an acoustic version of \\"He's on the Beach\\" as part of a four-track session for BBC Radio 1. It was later included on her compilation album What Do Pretty Girls Do?, released in 1998. Critical reception Upon its release, Graham K. Smith of Record Mirror wrote: \\"All [MacColl's] usual ingredients are here - sometime bittersweet but ultimately optimistic lyric, hefty, pacey backbeat, just the right amount of memorable jangling and those trebly harmonised vocals. A tribute to lost love? A yearning for sunnier climes? A summer hit? All these, and more...\\" Anne Lambert of Number One commented: \\"It's even better than \\"A New England\\", more bouncy and with a chorus that stays in your brain after just one listen.\\" Chris Heath of Smash Hits wrote: \\"Even though Kirsty wrote this herself it sounds very much like \\"A New England\\" - lots of shiny guitars above which a million Kirsty MacColls breathlessly sing the tune.\\" Paul Massey of Aberdeen Evening Express commented: \\"Snazzy pop, but much too like \\"A New England\\" I'm afraid. A disappointment from someone as talented as Kirsty.\\" In a review of MacColl's 1995 compilation album Galore, Larry Printz of The Morning Call described the song as \\"Spector-esque\\".

King's \\"Spanish Harlem\\" and \\"Stand By Me\\"; Brian Hyland's \\"Sealed with a Kiss\\"; and Neil Sedaka's \\"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do\\". Life and career Applebaum was born in Newark, New Jersey, United States. He started playing piano aged 7, after a doctor suggested it would help heal a broken finger, and began taking lessons. By the age of 12 he had started writing arrangements for his school band, and played at local weddings and events, and in clubs. He wrote arrangements for Cootie Williams, Lucky Millinder, and others, before serving in World War II in Germany, where he joined the US Army band. After leaving the military, he joined music publishers Edwin H. Morris & Co, and began composing. His reputation as an arranger grew, and he worked with bandleaders such as Benny Goodman, Harry James and Charlie Ventura, as well as Jimmy Durante. He is co-credited as writer of the Billy Eckstine and Sarah Vaughan hit \\"Passing Strangers\\". Mort Palitz of Jubilee Records asked Applebaum to arrange songs on a 1958 album, Scotch Mist, by Marilynn Lovell, and he also orchestrated Al Martino's 1959 album Swing Along. \\"Open Your Ears: Stan Applebaum, the master of arranging, tells his secrets\\", Allegro, vol.114 no.12, December 2014.

King on his solo hits \\"Spanish Harlem\\" and \\"Stand By Me\\". Among the other recording artists whose hits were arranged by Applebaum were Connie Francis, Neil Sedaka, Brook Benton, Brian Hyland, Joanie Sommers, and Bobby Vinton. In all, Applebaum is credited with working on over 25 top 10 hit records. In 1963, Warner Brothers Records released the album Hollywood's Bad but Beautiful Girls, credited to Applebaum and featuring his piano playing. Applebaum was also a prolific writer of over 1,500 commercials, notably writing the Pan Am jingle \\"Makes the Going Great\\" - later the basis of a ballet by George Balanchine - and winning four Clio Awards. He also wrote a number of piano instruction books. From the 1980s, he was for fifteen years the principal orchestrator and arranger for the New York Pops.

Majors, an eighteen-year- old student at Barnard College, was reportedly attacked by three teenagers as part of a robbery. Majors was then attacked with a knife multiple times, resulting in death by stabbing. One of the suspects, a thirteen-year-old, was arrested the following day and charged with felony murder. Two months later, two fourteen-year-old suspects were also charged with murder. On June 3, 2020, the 13-year-old (since turned 14) pleaded guilty in family court to robbery in the first degree. Trial dates, in adult court, have not yet been set for the suspects who were 14 years old at the time of the incident. Background Morningside Park experienced seventeen robberies in the spring of 2019 compared to seven robberies the year before. The suspects in these robberies were mostly younger juveniles between the ages of twelve and fourteen. The robberies usually involved ‚Äúthe same kids over and over.‚Äù According to a report, Barnard College was absent from the local crime briefings in the months leading up to Majors‚Äôs killing though Barnard did receive regular briefings from the NYPD and a safety briefing was part of freshman orientation. Attack The staircase at 116th Street, near where Majors was found On December 11, 2019, Majors was walking in Morningside Park, several blocks from Barnard College. Shortly before 7:00 p.m., was attacked by \\"between one to three people\\" on a staircase near 116th Street and Morningside Drive. Police speculated that the attack was a \\"robbery gone wrong\\". According to the thirteen-year-old suspect's confession, around dinnertime, the three suspects went to the park to rob people. They considered several potential victims but finally settled on attacking Majors. The suspect told police that his two accomplices had grabbed Majors, and used a choke-hold as a restraint while searching for items to take. Majors struggled and refused to hand over a mobile phone. The suspect also told police that one of the robbers stabbed Majors with a knife. According to a witness, a male yelled at Majors to ‚ÄúGimme your phone.‚Äù Majors then screamed for help, yelling, ‚ÄúHelp me! I‚Äôm being robbed!‚Äù According to the thirteen-year-old suspect, Majors bit one of the attacker's fingers hard, causing it to bleed. The suspect admitted in his confession that the alleged attacker stabbed Majors after being bit. Majors was stabbed several times in the chest, with one stab wound piercing her heart. After the altercation, the attackers went through Majors' pockets and fled. Majors then attempted to climb up the steep stairs found at the park's entrance nearest to the university. Majors staggered up the stairs and collapsed at the corner of Morningside Drive and 116th Street, before being found by a security guard at the top of the staircase. While still conscious, Majors told a witness of the events at the park. Police responded to the attack after a 911 call, finding Majors with multiple stab wounds. Majors was pronounced dead at Mount Sinai Morningside Hospital. Investigation and suspects The day after the incident, the police arrested a thirteen-year-old male and charged him with felony murder and felony robbery. The suspect was arrested after being caught trespassing while wearing clothes and sneakers that matched the description given of the suspects. Judge Carol Goldstein set the suspect's trial date for March 16. She also denied requests by his lawyers for him to be released into his aunt and uncle‚Äôs custody, due to the seriousness of the charges against him. In order to avoid the missteps that occurred during the Central Park Five case 30 years prior, police called in prosecutors early on in the case. Additionally, all questioning of the thirteen-year-old was video recorded. A second suspect, who is fourteen, was arrested and released on December 12. Police were unable to locate the third suspect, a fourteen-year-old, for two weeks, but apprehended him on December 26 after publicly releasing his photograph. According to The New York Times, detectives believe that some members of the fourteen-year-old‚Äôs family were hiding him until the bite mark on his hand had time to heal. After being questioned, the boy was released into the custody of his attorneys pending further investigation. In January 2020, it was announced that the case against the two fourteen-year-old suspects would go before a grand Jury. On February 14, 2020, one of the fourteen-year-olds who had been arrested on December 26, was indicted by a grand jury. The New York City Police Department re-arrested him and charged him as an adult with two counts of second-degree murder, one count of first-degree robbery and three counts of second-degree robbery. According to a criminal complaint, DNA belonging to this suspect was found under Majors' fingernails. The suspect allegedly confessed to his incarcerated father during a recorded phone conversation. According to court papers, ‚Äúthe defendant stated in substance that he was in the park and tried to take the girl‚Äôs phone and ‚Äòshe was hanging onto her phone‚Äô and that he hit her with a knife.‚Äù In February, another suspect, aged fourteen, was arrested. He was charged as an adult with a count of second degree murder,, two counts of first-degree robbery and one count of second-degree robbery. Both fourteen- year-old suspects were arraigned on February 19 and pleaded not guilty. On June 3, 2020, the 13-year-old male arrested the day after the incident, and who had since turned 14, pleaded guilty in family court to robbery in the first degree. Police investigation of surveillance footage had shown that this juvenile, the youngest of the three in the group, had not touched Majors during the crime, which the prosecutor said had contributed, along with his young age and clean record, to their decision to drop the murder charge if the boy pleaded guilty to the robbery. On June 15 he was sentenced to eighteen months in detention. Though Majors's parents were not present at the sentencing, they submitted a victim impact statement which was read in court. In the statement, they criticized the deal that led to the offender's guilty plea and argued that he ‚Äúhas shown a complete lack of remorse or contrition for his role in the killing of Tess Majors.‚Äù They also said: ‚ÄúBy his own admission, the respondent picked up a knife that had fallen to the ground and handed it to an individual who then used it to stab Tess Majors to death...The family can‚Äôt help but wonder what would have happened if that knife had been left on the ground.‚Äù  Victim  Tessa Rane Majors (May 11, 2001 December 11, 2019), also known as Tess, was from Charlottesville, Virginia. She graduated from St. Anne's-Belfield School in May 2019. Majors was completing her first semester as a freshman at Barnard College, a private all-women's school in Manhattan. Majors sang and played bass in a band, Patient 0, which had recently released an album. Her band had played its first gig in New York City that fall and was scheduled to play two more shows in Charlottesville during winter break. Majors also led the creative writing club in high school, ran cross-country, and volunteered on political campaigns. Majors had an interest in journalism, interning at the Augusta Free Press during the spring of 2019, and she planned to study journalism in college. Her father is an English professor at James Madison University, and the author of six books. Aftermath The attack prompted new security measures at Morningside Park, including 24-hour guard booths outside the park. The operation hours of the evening safety shuttle bus have also been extended. Additional funding was promised for security measures at Morningside Park, as well as fixing the outdoor lighting. NYPD committed additional officers for patrolling the park, and Columbia University pledged more security guards. New York City Council member Mark D. Levine announced he was \\"committed to finding the money to put in the cameras we need for sensitive areas that aren't covered\\", speaking of adding security cameras that could be monitored in real time by police officers. Reaction The incident garnered considerable news coverage and was referred to as a political football, in part because violent crime has fallen significantly in New York City in recent years. The case was particularly notable due to the young ages of the suspects; juveniles under the age of fifteen account for only a small fraction (significantly less than 1%) of those arrested for murder each year.FBI ‚Äî Table 20 In addition, the suspects are African-American and the killing is reported to have \\"resurfaced the longstanding racial and class tensions between Columbia University and the fast-gentrifying neighborhood of Harlem\\". The New York Times has compared the case to the 1989 Central Park jogger case, which occurred nearby in the North Woods of Central Park; both cases involved \\"a young white woman attacked in a park and even younger teenage suspects\\". This comparison to the jogger case was echoed by Time and the Star Tribune. Gale Brewer, the borough president of Manhattan, urged detectives to proceed with caution to avoid an outcome similar to the jogger case. In an effort to avoid the mistakes made by police 30 years prior, all questioning of the suspects in the Tessa Majors case has been video recorded. New York magazine called it a defining, once-in-a- generation crime for New Yorkers.

It was built in 1857 as an overnight stop on the Dubuque‚ÄìSt. Paul Stage Road, a frontier mail and stagecoach route through Iowa and Minnesota. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 for its local significance in the themes of architecture, exploration/settlement, and transportation. It was nominated for being one of Minnesota's few surviving stagecoach inns, for its stone architecture, and for its association with the pioneer era of Harmony Township. With . Origins The first settler-colonists moved to what would be known as Harmony, in southeast Minnesota Territory, in 1853. A primary concern was establishing regular communication and trade between local residents and other communities. The answer came a year later when the Dubuque‚ÄìSt. Paul Trail was established and Harmony Township was chosen as a stop along the mail and stagecoach route. Recent immigrant Daniel Dayton, seeing a business opportunity in the trail's arrival, built a single-story log building in 1855 in the village of Big Spring, northwest of Harmony. He first provided food and drinks to weary travelers but soon offered overnight accommodations. In 1857, Dayton built a two-and-a-half-story limestone addition to the structure with walls that were thick. Its windows, arranged in a six-over-six pattern, had double-hung sashes, limestone sills, and detailed lintels. Its gabled, pitched roof supported two brick chimneys. Use Dayton painted \\"Ravine House\\" on a shingle and hung it above the building's front door to welcome visitors. The first and second floors contained framed beds, slide-out trundles, and floor mattresses for overnight guests; extra sleeping space was available in the small attic. In addition to providing rooms to travelers, Ravine House also functioned as a livery, a store, a post office, and a private farm residence. Dayton and his sons, Aaron and Zara, operated Ravine House as an overnight stop for stagecoach travelers until 1866, when use of the Dubuque‚ÄìSt. Paul Trail declined due to the arrival of the railroads. Although a railroad line (the Milwaukee Road) wouldn't arrive in Harmony until 1879, other lines opened across the region in the 1860s and 1870s, drawing away traffic from the once-busy stage route. While operating Ravine House, Dayton served in the Minnesota Legislature and as Harmony Township's chairman, clerk, and postmaster. Later history Daniel Dayton died in 1895. Ravine House was then used as a private residence for several decades until 1952, when it was abandoned and used as feed and hay storage for livestock. The building soon fell into disrepair. A passionate group of local preservationists, however, decided to renovate it in the 1970s. Work crews replaced the windows and roof, repaired wood floors, and stabilized the foundation. Every effort was made to return the historic structure to its original condition, and in 1977, Ravine House was added to the National Register.

Smith was awarded a Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 1983 for her dissertation, Dental Attrition in Hunter- Gatherers and Agriculturalists.  Employment and teaching experience  From 1978-1983, she worked as a research assistant and research investigator in the Center for Human Growth and Development at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. After receiving her Ph.D., Smith was a visiting assistant professor in the Department of Anthropology at Arizona State University from 1984-1985. Since 1989, she has been an assistant research scientist at the University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology. Starting in March 2018, Smith started as a research professor in the Center for Advanced Study of Human Paleobiology at The George Washington University in Washington, D.C.

She evaluated the dental development of an accused immigrant to determine whether that individual was a juvenile or an adult at the time of the crime, which was a death penalty offense.  Field and museum work  The majority of Smith's work has either been in expeditions to sites or research in museums in countries in Northern Europe and Eastern Africa. Smith's research mainly concentrated on dental morphology. Some of her most-cited publications include:  *  Research  Smith is known for her research in the field of life history. She studies growth and development, from modern humans to early hominids to primates. Her research focuses on the evolution of life history. In her own words, life history includes ‚Äú‚Äòwhen to be born, when to be weaned, when to stop growing, when to reproduce, and when to die,‚Äô and for toothed mammals we might include, ‚Äòwhen to erupt teeth,‚Äô because teeth process the foods that power all the choices.\\" Smith has written over 50 published articles since 1979 in the field of anthropology. Her early work focused on the significance of tooth wear in dating. In 1984, she published ‚ÄúPatterns of molar wear in hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists,‚Äù which contrasts the molar wear between hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists to learn more about the evolution of human diet. Smith is also prominent in the field of tooth emergence. Her research into dental development made major contributions to the scientific understanding of the maturation of early hominids and the evolution of human life history. Her significant publications have focused on tooth emergence, weaning, wear, and their impact on life cycle. In 1991, she published ‚ÄúDental Development and the Evolution of Life History in Hominidae,‚Äù in which she suggested that the life history of australopiths was similar to that of apes, whereas the life histories of later hominids were more similar to modern humans. Her article ‚ÄúMortality and the magnitude of the ‚Äòwild effect‚Äô in chimpanzee tooth emergence‚Äù described how captivity affects the rate of tooth emergence in chimpanzees, and its larger implications for our understanding of primate life history. In her 1995 article, ‚ÄúToward A Life History of the Hominidae,‚Äù she cites the importance of the comparative method in her research. In the article, she suggests that the life history of australopiths was much closer to that of apes than modern humans, but at some point, the life cycle of hominids slowed to the rate and structure seen in Homo sapiens. Though a lot about this transition remains unknown, Smith emphasizes that new comparative methods of study will hopefully reveal further insights. Her 1996 article, ‚ÄúEvolution of the human life cycle,‚Äù written with Barry Bogin, describes the five stages of human postnatal development. The article suggests that the human pattern is first seen in Homo erectus. Her work has been influenced by her detailed research on three juvenile skeletons: the type specimen of Darwinius masillae, the Nariokotome Homo erectus skeleton, and the type specimen of Maiacetus inuus. All three skeletons were crucial to her conclusions about the evolution of life history in the hominin clade. Her work with the Nariokotome skeleton, in particular, culminated with the publication of ‚ÄúGrowth and Development of the Nariokotome Youth, KNM-WT 15000‚Äù in 2009, which set out the evolution of the slow rate of maturation in the genus Homo. She is currently researching the differences in life history between primates and other mammals, with a particular focus on birth, infancy, weaning, tooth eruption, and the transition to independent feeding.

Upon hearing news of a force of Gauls entering Latium and encamping near Pedum, the Romans resolved to appoint Gaius Sulpicius Peticus as dictator, who, along with his magister equitum, Marcus Valerius Poplicola, quickly set off for Pedum in anticipation of an easy victory.Liv. 7 12 Upon reaching Pedum, Peticus, to the displeasure of his men, ordered that no soldier be permitted to attack without his command. Peticus's men soon began publicly voicing their distaste for the dictator's orders. The opposition culminated when Sextus Tullius, one of Peticus's senior centurions, delivered a speech to his men, denouncing Peticus's choice and effectively convincing Peticius to engage with the Gauls.Liv. 7 13 Battle Skirmishing began between Romans and Gauls shortly after Tullius's address, prompting Peticus to formulate a strategy. Peticus decided to send a mix of muleteers and cavalry atop a nearby mountain, and lined up the rest of his forces along the plains near base of the mountain.Liv. 7 14 The Gauls were quick to attack after they spotted the Romans descending the mountain, but the move ultimately resulted in disorder, and the Romans were able to rout both the right and left flanks of the Gaulish forces, driving them to retreat. At this, Peticus ordered his cavalry and muleteers to intercept the fleeing Gallic army.Liv. 7 15 Aftermath Peticus, Poplicola, and the Roman force returned to Rome with a considerable amount of gold taken from the Gallic camps.

It dates to 1746 and was constructed by , viceroy of Brazil, to supply water to a prison, soldiers, and residents. The fountain is located to the southeast of the settlement of Morro de S√£o Paulo, and was the most advanced water supply system in colonial Brazil. It was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1943. History Andr√© de Melo e Castro (1668-1753), viceroy of Brazil, built the three-spouted fountain to serve a local prison, soldiers on the Island of Tinhar√©, and resident. The fountain may have been built on the site of a smaller, earlier fountain discovered by Simao Barreto in the 17th century as part of the construction of Church of Our Lady of Luz (Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Luz). Dom Pedro II, during a tour of Morro de Sao Paulo in 1859, recorded the existence of \\"a public fountain with three spouts.\\" Illegal excavations were made at the fountain in 1933 and 1946 in search of buried treasures; both excavations caused damage to the structure. The quality of water in the fountain has deteriorated due to the strain of large-scale tourism on the water and sanitation system of Morro de Sao Paulo. Location The fountain is located at the southeast of the small settlement of Morro de S√£o Paulo. The fountain is located below the street level and is accessible by stairs. Structure The Fonte Grande of Morro de S√£o Paulo has a rectangular plan with a vault. It consists of a feed stream; a vaulted adduction gallery; a circular cistern covered by a brick, tiled dome in the shape of a half-orange; a wastewater catchment; an iron chute; stairs, and a drainage system. The fountain is accessed by a staircase with gray and white marble flooring. Its frontispiece is of Bahian sandstone. It is crowned by a baroque pediment with volutes and a diamond-shaped pinnacle. A cartouche is at center with an inscription reading: > \\"The Most Illustrious and Honorable Andr√© de Melo de Castro, Count of > Galveas Virei and Captain General of the Sea and Land of the State of Brazil > had this font made 1746.\\" IPHAN performed basic conservation works on the fountain in 1946 and 1954.

A transpacific flight is the flight of an aircraft across the Pacific Ocean from Asia or Australia to North America, Central America, or South America, or vice versa. Such flights have been made by fixed-wing aircraft, balloons and other types of aircraft. Though less common than transatlantic flights, transpacific flights have been commercially available since the mid-1930s and have been used for transport of cargo and passengers across the Pacific Ocean. The time and distance of transpacific flights are longer than transatlantic flights. The first transpacific flight occurred several years after the first transatlantic flight. History In 1927, Ernie Smith and Emory Bronte attempted the first civilian transpacific flight bound for Maui, Hawaii starting from Oakland, California. The duo \\"flew 25 hours and two minutes at 6,000 feet in a single-engine Travel Air 5000 monoplane, but ran out of gas and safely crash-landed on Molokai\\". A memorial was constructed to mark \\"the historic end to the first civilian transpacific flight\\". =First transpacific flight= Southern Cross 1928 A photograph commemorating the first trans-Pacific flight. In 1928, Charles Kingsford Smith and his crew were the first to cross the Pacific by air. Smith and Australian aviator, Charles Ulm, arrived in the United States and began to search for an aircraft. Famed Australian polar explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins sold them a Fokker F.VII/3m monoplane, which they named the Southern Cross. At 8:54 a.m. on 31 May 1928, Kingsford Smith and his crew left Oakland, California, to attempt the first trans-Pacific flight to Australia. The flight was in three stages. The first, from Oakland to Wheeler Army Airfield, Hawaii, was , taking an uneventful 27 hours 25 minutes (87.54 mph). They took off from Barking Sands on Mana, Kauai, since the runway at Wheeler was not long enough. They headed for Suva, Fiji, away, taking 34 hours 30 minutes (91.45 mph). This was the most demanding portion of the journey, as they flew through a massive lightning storm near the equator. The third leg was the shortest, in 20 hours (84.15 mph), and crossed the Australian coastline near Ballina before turning north to fly to Brisbane, where they landed at 10.50 a.m. on 9 June. The total flight distance was approximately . Kingsford Smith was met by a huge crowd of 26,000 at Eagle Farm Airport, and was welcomed as a hero.Aviators - Charles Kingsford-Smith - (includes photo of the plaque commemorating the flight across the Pacific and the landing at Brisbane on 9 June 1928)Photo of Southern Cross, and welcoming crowd, at Eagle Farm on 9 June 1928 (National Archives of Australia) Ulm was the relief pilot. The other crewmen were Americans, they were James Warner, the radio operator, and Captain Harry Lyon, the navigator and engineer. The National Film and Sound Archive of Australia has a film biography of Kingsford Smith, called An Airman Remembers,National Film and Sound Archive of Australia: 'An Airman Remembers' on australianscreen online and recordings of Kingsford Smith and Ulm talking about the journey.National Film and Sound Archive of Australia: 'Our Heroes of the Air' =Kingsford Smith's second flight= In early November 1934, Smith undertook a second transpacific flight. The 1928 transpacific flight took 27 hours and 28 minutes and his 1934 flight took 14 hours and 59 minutes. By this point seven pilots, one of them a woman, had died attempting transpacific flights. =First non-stop flight= On 5 October 1931, Clyde Pangborn, with co-pilot Hugh Herndon Jr, while piloting a Bellanca called Miss Veedol, crash-landed the plane in the hills of East Wenatchee, Washington, in the central part of the state, becoming the first people to fly non-stop across the northern Pacific Ocean. The 41-hour flight from Sabishiro Beach, Misawa, Aomori Prefecture, Japan, won them the 1931 Harmon Trophy, which symbolized the greatest achievement in flight for that year. The plane was \\"heavily modified to carry 930 gallons of fuel\\" and made without landing gear to save fuel. =Other attempts= In July 1929, Harold Bromley attempted to fly from Tacoma, Washington to Tokyo, Japan in an orange Lockheed Vega monoplane purchased by lumberman, John Buffelen, who raised $25,000 to acquire the plane. The gasoline tanks were overfilled causing gasoline to pour onto the windshield and into Bromley's goggles temporarily blinding him. The plane crashed by the runway, Bromley was unhurt and would later try again to cross the Pacific Ocean. Commercial flights In 1935, the beginning of commercial transpacific flights to and from California began operation. On 22 November 1935, \\"Pan American Airlines' China Clipper launched its first transpacific flight, covering a distance of 8,000 miles\\". A large \\"Martin M-130 seaplane departed from Alameda, in the Bay Area, and island-hopped to Oahu, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, and the Philippines before arriving in Canton, China, with a cargo of mail\\". A year later passenger flights using the same route was inaugurated by Pan American. California became the undisputed national leader of transpacific flights. For the next year, Pan American planned for passenger flights, the China Clipper and its sister ships, the Philippine Clipper and Hawaii Clipper, focused on cargo transport including mail across the Pacific during this time. The route was ready for passenger service by October 1936. Records In November 1981, the first successful transpacific balloon crossing was made in the balloon Double Eagle V. It launched from Nagashima, Japan on November 10, 1981, and landed in Mendocino National Forest in California 84 hours and 31 minutes later, covering a record . The four-man crew consisted of Albuquerque balloonists Ben Abruzzo, Larry Newman, and Ron Clark, and thrill-seeking restaurateur Rocky Aoki, who helped fund the flight. After crossing the Pacific the helium-filled Double Eagle V, weighed down by ice and buffeted by a storm, crash-landed in northern California, ending the nearly 6,000-mile flight. No one was hurt. On February 21, 1995, Fossett was the first person to make a solo flight across the Pacific Ocean in a balloon from South Korea to Leader, Saskatchewan. On 25 January 2015, pilots Troy Bradley and Leonid Tiukhtyaev flying the Two Eagles Balloon, surpassed the Double Eagle II duration record and Double Eagle V distance record after traveling across the Pacific.. In 2015 and 2016, Solar Impulse 2 made a transpacific crossing while attempting to circumnavigate the world. The plane landed in Mountain View, California after three days of continuous flying from Hawaii. The pilots only slept 20 minutes at a time, and the plane's cockpit had no heating or air conditioning. The plane was piloted by two Swiss pilots, Bertrand Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, and Andr√© Borschberg, a Swiss engineer and entrepreneur.

The term \\"melanocytoma\\" was introduced by Limas and Tio in 1972. Histology Histologically, the tumor is described by large, uniformly shaped polyhedral nevus cells that are pigmented and closely packed Typically, it lacks signs of malignancy such as high mitotic rate, necroses or infiltrative growth. Like the malignant melanoma, it shows an immunohistological profile with S-100 protein-, vimentin- and HMB-45-positive tumor cells. Optic melanocytoma Most commonly the melanocytoma is found on or adjacent to the optic nerve as the optical melanocytoma. The lesion can be found at any age. Location and size could lead to clinical symptoms.While the melanocytoma is generally considered to be a benign tumor, it has a potential for growth, recurrence, and transformation to a malignant melanoma. Because malignant transformation is rare, optical melanocytomas can usually be observed. Thus, in asymptomatic patients, regular observation by fundoscopy is indicated, perhaps supported by ocular ultrasonography.P. M. Sharma u. a.: Malignant transformation of optic disc melanocytoma? A clinical dilemma at presentation with a review of the literature. In: Ophthalmologica 216, 2002, S. 292‚Äì295. (Review). Meningeal melanocytoma The meningeal melanocytoma is found on the leptomeninges of the brain, typically in the area of the base of the brain and brain stem, or the spine. Symptoms may be absent or related to growth and location. Like with the optic version, growth, recurrence, and malignant transformation are the main problems. Meningeal melanocytomas represent 0.06-0.1% of brain tumors. In a 2003 review of 95 cases by Rahimi-Movaghar et al, 45 were intracranial (mostly supratentorial) and 50 spinal or along spinal roots. The authors noted that the median age was 40 years for patients with intracranial and 49 for those with spinal tumors. Lesions were more common in women (57.9%). The review showed a recurrence rate of 26.3% and a death rate of 10.5% over 46 months. A 2001 review by Rades et al concluded that complete resection is the best treatment. If resection is incomplete, postoperative radiotherapy should be applied. Differential diagnosis Pigmented tumors raise the possibility of a malignant melanoma, a condition that may present diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas. In the differential diagnosis, schwannoma and meningioma with pigmentation are to be considered as well. Veterinary medicine Melanocytomas have been described in animals, for instance, dogs and cats.Wilcock B, Dubielzig RR, Render JA.

Overview  Trastuzumab deruxtecan is an antibody-drug conjugate that includes a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed antibody trastuzumab and a topoisomerase I inhibitor conjugate deruxtecan (a derivative of exatecan).A HER2-Targeting Antibody‚ÄìDrug Conjugate, Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (DS-8201a), Enhances Antitumor Immunity in a Mouse Model It was approved for use in the United States in December 2019. Side effects and label warnings The most common side effects are nausea, fatigue, vomiting, alopecia (hair loss), constipation, decreased appetite, anemia (hemoglobin in blood is below the reference range), decreased neutrophil count (white blood cells that help lead your body's immune system response to fight infection), diarrhea, leukopenia (other white blood cells that help the immune system), cough and decreased platelet count (component of blood whose function is to react to bleeding from blood vessel injury by clumping, thereby initiating a blood clot). The prescribing information for fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki includes a boxed warning to advise health care professionals and patients about the risk of interstitial lung disease (a group of lung conditions that causes scarring of lung tissues) and embryo-fetal toxicity. Interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis (inflammation of lung tissue), including cases resulting in death, have been reported with fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki.  History  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved fam- trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in December 2019. The application for fam- trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was granted accelerated approval, fast track designation, and breakthrough therapy designation. The FDA approved fam- trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki based on the results of one clinical trial enrolling 184 female patients with HER2-positive, unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer who had received two or more prior anti-HER2 therapies in the metastatic setting. These patients were heavily pretreated in the metastatic setting, receiving between two and 17 therapies prior to receiving fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki. Patients in the clinical trial received fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki every three weeks and tumor imagining was obtained every six weeks. The overall response rate was 60.3%, which reflects the percentage of patients that had a certain amount of tumor shrinkage with a median duration of response of 14.8 months. The FDA granted the approval of Enhertu to Daiichi Sankyo.

She investigates the filamentous growth of Candida albicans, a fungal pathogen that causes several diseases. She is also interested in how C. albicans interacts with its host during colonisation and invasive diseases. She is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Society for Microbiology.  Early life and education  Kumamoto studied biology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), graduating in 1976. She remained there for her doctoral degree before moving to Harvard Medical School for a postdoctoral research position in 1980. She joined Stanford University as a research associate and joined Tufts University in 1986. Her early work involved monitoring the mechanism of action of E.coli. She studied the mutant strains of E.Coli that were defective in exporting the periplasmatic protein maltose binding protein into the periplasm from the cytoplasm. She showed that these mutants were defective in the gene SecB and went on to study the mechanism of action of this protein; showing that it had chaperone activity and was selective in its binding to exported protein precursors.  Research and career  Kumamoto is a Professor of Molecular Biology & Microbiology at Tufts University. Her research considers Candida albicans (C. albicans), a fungal pathogen that can causes several diseases. C. albicans typically colonises the gastrointestinal tract of humans without causing any problems, but when the host organism becomes immunocompromised the pathogen produces invasive lesions that are associated with candidiasis. Candidiasis is complicated to diagnose and can be fatal. Kumamoto demonstrated that low levels of the protein Efg1p permit fast growth of C. albicans, whereas high levels suppress the growth. In particular, Kumamoto studies the environmental conditions that cause C. albicans to grow in filamentous, elongated cells, which are able to invade and destroy biological tissue and enter the bloodstream. Early in her career, Kumamoto demonstrated that this filamentous growth occurs when the organism is grown in contact with an agar medium. She showed that the CZF1 gene is a regulator of the filamentation response, and that Mkc1 and Cek1 (MAP kinases) are activated when cells are grown in contact with the agar. She has demonstrated that certain dietary fats, including coconut oil, can suppress the growth of C. albicans in the gut, decreasing the risk of fungal infections. It has been proposed that this finding will decrease the need for antifungal drugs and could be used to decrease the amount of C. albicans in the guts of premature infants. In 2019, Kumamoto reported the first results of a clinical trial that involved supplementing the diets of preterm infants with medium-chain triglycerides to reduce the amount of C. albicans in the gastrointestinal tract. Kumamoto has also studied candida auris a fungus that was identified in 2009 that appears to withstand anti-fungal drugs. She is interested in the mechanism by which C. albicans interacts with its host during colonisation and invasive degrees. For example, Kumamoto has demonstrated that the interaction of C. albicans with other pathogens can influence its virulence.

In 2011, he led the Golden Eagles to their first Ohio Valley Conference championship victory in 36 years. That same year, he helped the Golden Eagles break 9 program records including points scored in a season (355), highest scoring average in a season (32.3 points per game), and most first downs in a season (238). He was the recipient of the Robert Hill Johnson Award. He graduated from Tennessee Tech with a Bachelor's Degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Coaching career =Tennessee Tech= In 2013, Lamb was hired as the quarterbacks coach at Tennessee Tech. =Mercer= In 2014, Lamb was hired as the quarterbacks coach at Mercer. Lamb's focus while at Mercer was on player development. He helped the Bears' quarterbacks set a new program record for passing yards. He coached Mercer quarterback, John Russ, and played an instrumental part in his recognition on the CFPA FCS Offensive Player of the Year Watch List. =Tennessee Tech (second stint)= In 2018, Lamb was hired as the offensive coordinator at Tennessee Tech. During his stint at Tennessee Tech, he engineered a remarkable turnaround in the program's offense. In 2017 and 2018 combined, the Golden Eagles won just 2 games. During the 2019 season, with Lamb's assistance, the Golden Eagles improved their overall record to 6-6. In 2019, the Golden Eagles accumulated 348 total scoring points which was 58% greater than other scoring offenses in the Ohio Valley Conference. His achievements at Tennessee Tech could arguably be considered one of the greatest Division 1 football program turnarounds the Football Championship Subdivision has seen. =Gardner‚ÄìWebb= On December 14, 2019, Lamb was named the head coach at Gardner‚ÄìWebb University, replacing Carroll McCray.

It served in India and the Middle East during World War I, one of its batteries being captured at the Siege of Kut in Mesopotamia in 1916, and another seeing active service in the Third Afghan War of 1919. Although reformed after the war, the unit was broken up in 1927. Origin When the Volunteer Force was subsumed into the Territorial Force (TF) in 1908 under the Haldane Reforms, the 2nd Hampshire Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers) was reorganised to provide two Royal Field Artillery (RFA) brigades for the TF's new Wessex Division: the I (or 1st) Wessex Brigade at Southsea (from HQ and Nos 1‚Äì8 Companies) and the IV (or 4th) Wessex Brigade on the Isle of Wight (from Nos 10 and 11 Companies). Generally, the fourth RFA brigade in each TF division was equipped with howitzers, and the Wessex was no exception. However, by 1910 seniority had been asserted, and the IV Wessex was redesignated II Wessex (Howitzer) Brigade, RFA, with the following organisation:Frederick, p. 682.Litchfield, p. 93.Monthly Army List, various dates.London Gazette, 20 March 1908.London Gazette, 14 October 1910.43rd Divisional Artillery at Long, Long Trail. * Headquarters (HQ) at Ryde, Isle of Wight (IoW)Ryde at Drill Hall Project * 4th Hampshire (Howitzer) Battery at Zig-Zag Road, Ventnor, IoWVentnor at Drill Hall ProjectHampshire & Isle of Wight at Great War Centenary Drill Halls. * 5th Hampshire (Howitzer) Battery at Freshwater, IoW,Freshwater at Drill Hall Project with a drill station at Drill Hall Road, Newport, IoWNewport at Drill Hall Project * 2nd Wessex (Howitzer) Ammunition Column at Ryde Each TF howitzer battery was equipped with four obsolescent 5-inch howitzers.Becke, pp. 43‚Äì8. On the eve of World War I the brigade was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel H.L. Powell, a retired Regular Army major. World War I =Mobilisation= Territorial gunners training with a 5-inch howitzer before World War I. On 29 July 1914 the Wessex Division was on Salisbury Plain carrying out its annual training camp when 'precautionary orders' were received, and next day the division took up emergency war stations in Somerset, Devon and Cornwall. The order to mobilise arrived on the evening of 4 August. Between 10 and 13 August the division concentrated on Salisbury Plain and began war training.43rd (1st Wessex) Division at Long, Long Trail. On 24 September, at the special request of the Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum the Wessex Division accepted liability for service in British India to relieve the Regular Army units there for service on the Western Front. The division's infantry battalions and artillery brigades (without their brigade ammunition columns) embarked at Southampton on 8 October and were convoyed to Bombay, disembarking on 9 November. Each battery went ashore with 5 officers and 140 other ranks. The battalions and batteries were immediately distributed to garrisons across India, and the Wessex Division never saw service as a whole, though it was formally numbered the 43rd (1st Wessex) Division in 1915. Meanwhile, those men who had been left behind, together with the recruits who were flooding in, formed reserve or 2nd Line units, the titles of which were the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. The 2/II Wessex Brigade formed immediately after the 1st Line sailed for India. Recruitment and training for the 2nd Wessex Division proceeded so quickly that on 25 November it was decided to send that to India as well, and most units embarked on 12 December 1914, becoming the 45th (2nd Wessex) Division in 1915. However, the 2/II Wessex Brigade was one of the units left behind in England.Becke, pp. 55‚Äì60.45th (2nd Wessex) Division at Long, Long Trail.45th Divisional Artillery at Long, Long Trail. =1/II Wessex (H) Brigade= On arrival in India the 1/II Wessex (H) Brigade was stationed at Lucknow and reverted to peacetime conditions. By early 1915 the need was growing for troops to be sent to various theatres of war, and the first units of the 1st Wessex Division to go on active service were 1/5th Hampshire (H) Battery and 1/4th Battalion Hampshire Regiment, which were sent to Mesopotamia in March.Farndale, p. 354. 1/5th Hampshire (H) Battery 5-inch howitzer photographed in a desert setting. The battery landed at Basra on 23 March 1915 with 12th Indian Division to join Indian Expeditionary Force 'D'. Soon afterwards it transferred to 6th (Poona) Division, which had been in action against Turkish forces in Mesopotamia since the previous November. In April 1915 the column under Maj-Gen Charles Townshend began its advance up the Tigris. At the Battle of Amara on 31 May, 6th (Poona) Division captured a series of hills, powerfully supported by heavy guns firing from river barges and the howitzers of 1/5th Hampshire Bty firing from Fort Snipe, though the battery was out of range when the infantry took the last hill. The attack was resumed the next day, with the guns concentrating on Abu Aran, and Amara fell on 2 June.Farndale, pp. 203‚Äì8.Moberly, Appendix VIII, p. 477.Perry, pp. 76‚Äì8. 12th Indian Division then began to advance up the Euphrates towards Nasiriyah. When it ran into serious opposition in 14 July, reinforcements were sent across from the Tigris, including a section of 1/5th Hampshire Bty. The renewed attack went in on 24 July, with the howitzers firing on enemy trenches at Thorneycroft Point. As the infantry advanced the guns lifted in front of them; by 13.00 the enemy were in full retreat, driven out once more by the guns. 1/5th Hampshire Bty then returned to the Tigris.Farndale, pp. 209‚Äì10. =Battle of Es Sinn= On 22 August Townshend was ordered to advance further up the Tigris to capture Kut al-Amara. He reached Sannaiyat in mid- September and then brought up his guns, including 1/5th Hampshire Bty. The concentration was complete by 25 September, and he launched his attack with two columns, either side of the river. A section of 1/5th Hampshire Bty accompanied the smaller Column B on the north side. On the night of 27/28 September Townshend switched the bulk of 6th (Poona) Division from the south to the north side, to make the main attack against the northern redoubt at 08.45. The attacking infantry were given covering fire by 1/5th Hampshire and other batteries as they advanced over open ground to take the redoubt. The howitzers were then pushed up to fire in support of the attack on the southern redoubt. By mid-afternoon the exhausted infantry were closing in on the final objective when a Turkish counter-attack came in. All guns engaged this new threat, and it was driven back. By dawn on 29 September the Turkish troops were streaming back towards Baghdad. They halted to prepare new defences at Ctesiphon, from Kut and only in front of Baghdad, while Townshend followed up as far as Aziziya.Farndale, pp. 211‚Äì3. =Battle of Ctesiphon= After a logistical build-up, Townshend was authorised to resume his march on Baghdad on 14 November, his force including 1/5th Hampshire Bty, which consisted of 3 officers, 108 British other ranks and 41 Indian other ranks.Farndale, p. 214.Moberly, pp. 34‚Äì9; Appendix IX, p. 480; Appendix XI, p. 483. By 19 November he was at Lajj, but the Turkish position at Ctesiphon blocked his route. He attacked on the morning of 22 November with four columns, 1/5th Hampshire Bty accompanying Column A, which was to make the decisive attack on the redoubt known as 'Vital Point' or VP after the other columns had made preparatory and flanking attacks. Column A launched its assault at 09.00; 1/5th Hampshires' howitzers and a battery of field guns had been bombarding VP for some time, and now brought down such fire on the objective that the Turks could not withstand it, and the infantry advanced right up to the bursting shells to take the objective by 10.00. At 13.00 Turkish guns attacked the column with concentrated fire, causing heavy casualties, but by 13.30 they had lost their entire front line and Column A was pressing on to the second line. A Turkish counter-attack was seen coming in, but the guns swung onto this new target and stopped it at a range of . Townshend called off his attacks at 17.00. when night fell.Farndale, pp. 215‚Äì7.Moberly, pp. 63, 67, 69‚Äì70, 79‚Äì80, 85‚Äì9. Next morning it became clear how costly the victory had been in terms of infantry casualties, and Townshend had to adopt a defensive posture: 1/5th Hampshire Bty was posted around 'Water Redoubt'. Townshend's force threw back Turkish attacks all day and by the morning of 24 November both sides were too exhausted to continue the fight (1/5th Hampshire Bty had lost 1 man killed, 1 officer, 2 British and 1 Indian other ranks wounded). Townshend had no offensive capacity left, and (unlike the Turks) no reinforcements in prospect. Water and ammunition were also short. He fell back to Lajj and then Aziziya, and by 29 November he was at Umm-at-Tubal, where he formed a camp with his rear to the river. On 1 December he put in a sharp attack on the gathering Turks, with rapid artillery fire that completely disorganised them while he resumed his retreat. On 3 December his exhausted force struggled into Kut al- Amara.Farndale, pp. 217‚Äì9.Moberly, pp. 90‚Äì101, 111‚Äì8; Appendix XII, p. 485. =Siege of Kut= The first Turkish shells fell on the town on 6 December, beginning a long siege. 1/5th Hampshire Bty was stationed with the bulk of the artillery at the Brick Kiln, near the fort where the artillery observation posts (OPs) were positioned. Heavy artillery bombardment of the town and probing infantry attacks began on 8 December and continued until 13 December. The main Turkish attack was made on 24 December following a pre-dawn bombardment that switched onto the Fort at 07.00, putting some guns out of action and cutting the telephone from the OPs. The bombardment suddenly stopped at 11.00 and a massive Turkish infantry attack was made against the breaches blown in the walls of the fort. After bitter fighting, with every gun in the British garrison firing, the assault was driven out. A second attempt by moonlight at 20.00 was also halted, the heavy guns and howitzers firing Lyddite shells into the Turkish trenches whose position was precisely known. After a third attack at 02.30 on 25 December, the Turks made no further attempt to take Kut by storm. From now on the town was blockaded and shelled while Turkish attention was concentrated on preventing the British relieving force getting through from Basra.Farndale, pp. 221‚Äì3.Moberly, pp. 164‚Äì73, 176‚Äì81. By April 1916 the situation in Kut was desperate. Casualties from the continual shellfire were mounting and food was running out, despite attempts to air-drop supplies to the garrison. The artillery horses had been killed for food before the end of March, though many of the Indian troops refused to eat them. The last attempt to break through failed on 22 April and Townshend was authorised to negotiate a surrender. The Turks demanded unconditional surrender so 1/5th Hampshire Bty blew up their guns and remaining ammunition on 28 April before marching into captivity the following day under their battery commander, Maj H.G. Thomson.Farndale, pp. 225‚Äì5.Moberly, pp. 163, 439‚Äì41, 449‚Äì52, 456‚Äì8. The 1/5th Hampshire Bty and a company of the 1/4th Hampshire Regiment had been the only TF units in the besieged garrison. There are no exact figures, but is believed that about one-third of the prisoners died in captivity before the end of the war.Moberly, p. 460. 1/4th Hampshire (H) Battery In September 1915 1/4th Hampshire (H) Battery was sent from India to Aden, where it landed and joined the Aden Expeditionary Force on 13 September. The port of Aden had been threatened by a Turkish force but after some action in June and July 1915 it simply watched the British garrison. No attempt to attack was made by either side for the rest of the war.Farndale, p. 357. 18-pounder gun preserved at the Imperial War Museum. 1/4th Hampshire Bty returned to India on 14 August 1916. It left its 5-inch howitzers behind for 2/1st Devonshire Battery from 2/IV Wessex Brigade that relieved it, and on arrival in India it was rearmed with modern 18-pounder field guns and ceased to be a howitzer battery. In 1917 it was redesignated 1089 Battery RFA, and was brought up to an establishment of six guns when it was joined by a section from 2/2nd Devonshire Battery. 1/II Wessex Brigade was renumbered as CCXVI (216) Brigade during 1916, although it consisted only of the returned 1089 (1/4th Hampshire) Bty. However, by April 1917 it was joined by 1097 Bty from CCXXV Bde (the former 2/1st Hampshire Bty from 2/I Wessex Bde) and 1104 Bty from CCXXVII Bde (the former 2/1 Wiltshire Bty from 2/III Wessex Bde). By July 1918 1104 Bty had transferred on to CCXVIII Bde.Farndale, p. 382.Frederick, p. 694. After the end of World War I 1089 Battery was still serving in India when the Third Afghan War broke out. It accompanied the 47th Mobile Indian Brigade during the brief campaign. =2/II Wessex (H) Brigade= 2nd Wessex Division's artillery had been scattered around southern England while forming. After the rest of the division sailed for India 2/II Wessex Brigade was sent to the Isle of Wight in early 1915. In January 1916 it moved to Winchester and was numbered CCXXVI (226) Bde. Later it became part of 'E' Reserve Battery, training gunners for service overseas. It was at Bordon Camp from October 1916 to October 1918, and then at Larkhill until demobilisation in January 1919. Postwar The 2nd Wessex Brigade was reformed in 1920 with the following organisation:Frederick, p. 516. * Brigade HQ at Drill Hall, Ryde, IoW * 5th Hampshire Battery * 6th Hampshire Battery * 7th Hampshire Battery ‚Äì from the former 3rd Wessex Brigade * 1st Wiltshire Battery ‚Äì from the former 3rd Wessex Brigade When the TF was reconstituted as the Territorial Army the following year, the brigade was renumbered 55th (Wessex) Brigade, RFA with the following organisation: * Brigade HQ at Drill Hall, Ryde, IoW * 217 (Hampshire) Bty at Drill Hall, Freshwater, IoW * 218 (Hampshire) Bty at Drill Hall, Bournemouth * 219 (Hampshire) Bty (Howitzer) at Newport, IoW * 220 (Wiltshire) Bty at Drill Hall, Swindon The 1st (Ryde) Cadet Corps was affiliated to the brigade. The brigade was designated a Field Brigade in 1924 when the RFA was merged into the Royal Artillery. Disbandment However, in 1927 the brigade was broken up: the Hampshire elements transferred to form two batteries in the 95th (Hampshire Yeomanry) Field Brigade while the Wiltshire elements joined the West Somerset Yeomanry batteries from 94th (Somerset and Dorset Yeomanry) Field Brigade to form a new 55th (Wessex) Field Brigade with headquarters at Taunton.Litchfield, pp. 95, 209.

Early life and education Judge was born to parents Valentine and Tony Judge, and named after her aunt, Phoebe Legere. She grew up in Chicago with her three siblings, and attended university at Bennington College, graduating in 2005. She eventually started interning at a public radio station in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, which led her to enroll at the Salt Institute for Documentary Studies. Career After graduating, Judge worked for several years as a journalist for public radio, beginning with a two-and-a-half-year stint working as a reporter for Mississippi Public Broadcasting. She left to go to India to report and produce for a documentary on the country. After returning from India, Judge landed a job with The Story with Dick Gordon. While planning to do an interview on wrongful imprisonment with her colleagues at North Carolina Public Radio, Judge said, \\"Very quickly, once we started reading about the number of exonerees, about the number of potentially innocent people in jail ... it was clear that this was going to be more than one show, that this deserved to become a series.‚Äù Their investigation became ‚ÄúAfter Innocence: Exoneration in America,‚Äù a series that aired June 10‚Äì13, 2013 on the program The Story for American Public Media. When The Story ended in 2013, Judge and two colleagues, Lauren Spohrer and Eric Mennel, decided to create their own program. Spohrer came up with the idea for the show while they were brainstorming on Judge's back porch. They released the first episode of Criminal in January 2014. During the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, Judge started a limited series podcast called \\"Phoebe Reads a Mystery,\\" where she reads a chapter of a novel each day, the first of which was Agatha Christie's first novel The Mysterious Affair at Styles. She continued to conduct interviews for and anchor WUNC's program of Here & Now until 2015, when she transitioned into filling in for vacants shifts. The change came with Criminal's increased production schedule to one episode every two weeks. She has been invited for guest interviews on other podcasts including The Murder Squad. She also continued to guest host The State of Things. Public image Judge's voice has drawn commentary in the media. Alexis Soloski, theater critic at The New York Times, wrote that \\"no matter how strange or ghastly the crime, the voice of the host Phoebe Judge somehow remains implacable and oddly soothing.\\" The Star Tribune said \\"Judge's sweetly modulated voice serves as a calm foil to the blood-soaked stories.\\" Judge herself has said, \\"I hope my voice shows reverence, to not only the topic and subject, but also the guest.\\" Personal life Judge says that she is \\"rigid\\" because she tends to be inflexible about certain habits, such as running 50 miles a month, preferring to eat scheduled meals, and maintaining a regular sleep schedule. She is fond of long walks \\"for the fun of it,\\" and will sometimes walk for miles, then call someone to pick her up. Each year, she takes a two-week trip to northernmost Maine, where she vacations Internet-free. Her sister Chloe, 13 months her junior, passed away in 2015. Judge's namesake aunt, Phoebe Legere, is a singer, painter, and musician who is the maestro of the Lower East Side Children's Chorus of the Theater for the New City. Judge lives with her partner, Sara, in Durham, North Carolina.
