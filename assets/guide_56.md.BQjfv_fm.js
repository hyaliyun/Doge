It is considered the most valuable painting by a Brazilian artist, having reached the value of $1.4 million, paid by the Argentine collector Eduardo Costantini in an auction in 1995. It is currently displayed at the Latin American Art Museum of Buenos Aires (Spanish: Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires, MALBA) in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The composition: one man, the sun and a cactus ‚Äì inspired Oswald de Andrade to write the Anthropophagite Manifesto and consequently create Anthropophagic Movement, intended to \\"swallow\\" European culture and turn it into something culturally very Brazilian.  The painting  Tarsila described the subject of the painting as \\"a monstrous solitary figure, enormous feet, sitting on a green plain, the hand supporting the featherweight minuscule head. In front a cactus exploding in an absurd flower.\\"Amaral, Aracy A. Tarsila: Sua Obra e Seu Tempo, S√£o Paulo, Tenenge, 1986 p. 104. This \\"monstrous\\" figure is, in fact, human. An unadorned, undressed, sexless, and ageless human whose anatomy has been distorted. Beginning with a huge foot and hand at the bottom of the picture, the figure slowly shrinks to a tiny head at the top. The background of the painting suggests a natural setting. Here, earth is depicted as a simple small green mound upon which the subject sits. The vegetation is represented by a cactus at the right of the figure and a golden sun or flower which crowns the composition. The sky is a plain pale blue background. The style of Abaporu can be traced back to the French modernists, specially Fernand L√©ger, who taught Tarsila in Paris in 1924. However, the closest resemblance of Abaporu can be found in the Spanish Surrealists, Pablo Picasso and Joan Mir√≥, who also painted a figure with an oversized foot in 1924.  Provenance  After Tarsila's death in 1973, the painting passed to Pietro Maria Bardi's art gallery, who sold it to the art collector √ârico Stickel. In 1984 the painting was purchased by the amount of $250 thousand by Raul de Souza Dantas Forbes, who then auctioned the painting at Christie's New York City in 1995.

Life He was educated at Westminster, and matriculated as a sizar of St. John's College, Cambridge, 22 February 1564. where he completed his exercises for the degree of B. A. about 1567. In February 1572, he was granted the degree of B.A. at Oxford by virtue of his residence at Cambridge, and a month later proceeded M.A. in the same university after obtaining a dispensation which relieved him of the necessity of residence. Anthony Wood says that he was a member first of Christ Church, Oxford or Broadgates Hall, Oxford, and afterwards of Exeter College, Oxford (the university register does not mention his connection with any college). He was incorporated M.A. at Cambridge on 16 December 1573, proceeded B.D. at Cambridge in 1577, and D.D. in 1589, being incorporated B.D. at Oxford 19 May 1579. He was a preacher licensed by Cambridge University in 1580, and presented books to St. John's College, Cambridge, 29 April 1579. Grant became head-master of Westminster School in 1572, after serving as assistant master for about two years previously. He retained that office for twenty years, and was succeeded by William Camden in February 1593. On 15 December 1587 he wrote a Latin letter to the queen begging to be released from teaching after seventeen years' service. The next vacant prebend at Westminster was granted him by letters patent 14 November 1575, and he became a prebendary or canon 27 May 1577.

It is of interest because it may form in intermediate-level nuclear waste stores when cellulose is degraded by the calcium hydroxide in cements such as Portland cement. The calcium salt of the alpha form of ISA is very crystalline and quite insoluble in cold water, but in hot water it is soluble. ISA is thought to form by means of a series of reactions in which calcium ions acting as lewis acids catalyze two of the three steps. The first step is likely to be a rearrangement of the reducing sugar end of the cellulose (or lactose) into a keto sugar, the second step is likely to be a reaction similar to the base catalyzed dehydration which often occurs after an aldol reaction. In this second step an alkoxide (derived from a sugar) takes the role of the hydroxide leaving group, this second step is not likely to require the lewis acidity of the calcium. The final step is a benzilic acid rearrangement from a 1,2-diketone (1,5,6-trihydroxyhexane-2,3-dione) which is formed from the carbohydrate. Under acidic conditions sugars tend to form furans such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural by a series of dehydrations of the carbohydrate. In acidic solutions the acid tends to form a 5-membered ring (lactone) by forming an ester between the carboxylic acid group and one of the alcohols. When treated under anhydrous conditions with acetone, an acid and a dehydration agent two of the alcohol groups can be protected as a cyclic acetone acetal thus leaving behind only one alcohol, prolonged treatment with 2,2-dimethoxypropane forms a protected form of ISA where all four of the alcohol groups are protected as acetone acetals and the carboxylic acid is in the form of the methyl ester. These protected forms of ISA have been used as a starting material for chiral organic compounds anthracyclines.  Relevance for nuclear waste disposal  Since 1993, the diastereomers of isosaccharinic acid have received particular attention in the literature due to its ability to complex a range of radionuclides, potentially affecting the migration of radionuclides. ISA is formed as a result of interactions between cellulosic materials present within the intermediate level waste inventory various countries and the alkalinity resulting from the use of cementitious materials in the construction of a deep geological repository. Download pdf. Greenfield et al. (1993), have discovered that ISA and constituents formed in a cellulose degradation leachate were capable of forming soluble complexes with thorium, uranium (IV) and plutonium. In the case of plutonium, ISA concentrations higher than 10‚àí5 M were capable of increasing solubility above pH 12.0, where concentrations of 1-5 √ó 10‚àí3 M were found to increase the solubility by an order of magnitude from 10‚àí5 to 10‚àí4 M. Allard et al. (2006) found that a concentration of ISA of 2 √ó 10‚àí3 M could increase plutonium solubility by a factor of 2 √ó 105. In addition a range of studies on the complexation properties of Œ±-isosaccharinic acid in alkaline solutions with various metals of different valence, including nickel (II), europium (III), americium (III) and thorium (IV), have been conducted. Vercammen et al. (2001) showed that although Ca(Œ±-ISA)2 is sparingly soluble, both europium (III) and thorium (IV) were capable of forming soluble complexes with ISA between pH 10.7 and 13.3, where a mixed metal complex was observed in the presence of thorium. Wieland et al. (2002) also observed that Œ±-ISA prevented the uptake of thorium by hardened cement pastes. Warwick et al. (2003) have also shown that ISA is capable of influencing the solubility of both uranium and nickel through complexation. Tits et al. (2005) observed that in the absence of ISA, europium, americium and thorium will sorb onto calcite aggregates present in concrete within an ILW GDF. Should ISA concentrations within the disposal facility exceed 10‚àí5 mol L‚àí1 (2 √ó 10‚àí5 mol L‚àí1 in the case of Th(IV)), it was reported that the sorption onto calcite would be significantly affected such that the radionuclides studied would no longer be sorbed to the cement and instead be complexed by ISA. The effect of cellulose degradation products on radionuclide solubility and sorption is the subject of a study from 2013. Cellulose degradation product leachates were first produced by contacting cellulose sources (wood, rad wipes or cotton wool) with calcium hydroxide (pH 12.7) under anaerobic conditions. Analysis of the leachates across 1 000 days suggested that the primary product of the degradation was ISA, although a range of other organic compounds were formed and varied across cellulose source. In these experiments both ISA and X-ISA were able to increase the solubility of europium at pH 12, where in experiments with thorium ISA had a more profound effect on thorium solubility than X-ISA, for which little effect was observed. More recently, a systematic study was published on the interactions between plutionium, ISA, and cement, as well as sorption. The investigation was focused on repository-like conditions, including high pH due to cementitious materials and low redox potential. The predominant species at various conditions were identified, including qaternary materials such as Ca(II)Pu(IV)(OH)3ISA‚ÄìH+. The sorption of Pu on cement was found to be significantly lowered due to complexation with ISA.  Microbial activity in a geological disposal facility  ISA also represents a major carbon source within a geological disposal facility (GDF) since it comprises >70% of cellulose degradation products as a result of alkaline hydrolysis. The high pH associated with the massive use of concrete in such a facility means that microbial activity may or may not occur within the alkaline disturbed zone depending on the local microbial consortia intruding upon or surrounding such a facility in the post closure phase. Initial studies have shown that both alpha and beta forms of ISA are readily available for microbial activity under the anaerobic conditions expected within the far field of a disposal facility or within ungrouted waste packages. Since the pH of pore water within the near field of a disposal facility is expected to fall from 13.5 to 12.5 ‚àí 10 over tens of thousands of years, the ability of micro-organisms to adapt to these alkaline pH values has also been investigated. Mesophilic consortia have been shown to adapt to a pH of 10 within a number of weeks, ISA degradation ceased above pH 11.0. Microbial consortia from hyperalkaline environments in which exposure to pH > 11.0 has occurred for over a century have also been exposed to ISA generated from the alkaline hydrolysis of organic matter in situ. This consortia was readily capable of degrading ISA. It can also exist as polymicrobial flocculates, which has shown to be able of survival up to pH 12.5. As a result, the impact of microbial activity within a GDF is expected to be through the degradation of ISA's and production of gas, which may create overpressure but also through the generation of 14C bearing gases.

A member of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), he is a former member of the Croatian Parliament. A physician by vocation, Hebrang had served three terms as Croatia's Minister of Health (1990‚Äì1992, 1993‚Äì1998, and 2003‚Äì2005) and spent three months as Minister of Defence (May‚ÄìOctober 1998) under six different Prime Ministers. In addition, he was his party's candidate in the 2009‚Äì10 Croatian presidential election, eventually finishing third behind Ivo Josipoviƒá, and Milan Bandiƒá, winning 12 percent of the vote in the first round. Early life Andrija Hebrang was born in Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Serbia), to Andrija Hebrang, a prominent Croatian-Yugoslav politician and Olga Strauss, who came from a well-to-do Pakrac Jewish family. Her parents saw to her education, and she learned to play piano, and to speak French and German. Hebrang father joined the Communist party and fought for the Partisans in World War II, becoming a close friend and adviser to Marshall Josip Broz Tito, eventually becoming a high ranking government member. However, in the late 1940s he fell out of favor with senior Party members, was arrested for treason by the Yugoslav government, and subsequently disappeared. The date of his death and the circumstances are unknown, though it is presumed he died ca. 1949 in a Belgrade prison; the circumstances remain unclear and his body was never recovered. Usta≈°e killed 16 members of Hebrang family during the Holocaust and another 10 members of his family have been killed by the communist regime of newly founded SFR Yugoslavia. Young Andrija, along with his mother and siblings were put under house arrest in 1948. His mother Olga was imprisoned for twelve years and the children were sent to live with their aunt Ilona in Zagreb. They lived very poorly, as Ilona's husband was sent to the prison camp at Goli Otok for several years and she was made to raise the three young children alone. Andrija saw his mother again when he was eleven and she was released from prison in 1960. The family was forced to change their surname to \\"Markovac\\" in order for Olga to find employment. After finishing gymnasium, Hebrang enrolled at the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb where he received his doctorate specializing in radiology and oncology, and began teaching at the university as a professor in 1985. He is married to Danijela Vrhovski-Hebrang, a doctor of medical biochemistry at the University of Zagreb, and they have three children. Political career In 1990, he became a member of the newly formed Croatian Democratic Union. He became the Minister of Health from 1990 to 1992 and again from 1993 to 1998. During the Croatian War of Independence he served as a coordinator of the armed forces from 1993-1994. He was first elected to the Croatian parliament in 1993 and again in 1995. After the death of the Minister of Defense Gojko ≈†u≈°ak in 1998, he temporarily took over the position for four months. Afterwards, he pulled himself out of political life. He returned in 2001 as a member of the Croatian True Revival party led by Miroslav Tuƒëman, but after talks with the new head of the HDZ Ivo Sanader, he returned to the Croatian Democratic Union. After the HDZ's victory in the Croatian parliamentary elections of 2003, he joined Sanader's government as one of the two vice-presidents and the Minister of Health and Social Welfare from 2003-2005. Due to health reasons, he gave up his positions in government and returned to being a member of the parliament. Presidential run In July 2009, he was chosen by the HDZ to be their candidate for the 2009‚Äì2010 presidential election.

It was formed along with other fourteen selsoviets in April 1924 and occupied the territory of the former Nizhnetoyemskaya Volost of the former Solvychegodsky Uyezd of Northern Dvina Governorate. The administrative center of the selsoviet is located in the village of Burtsevskaya, at the confluence of the Nizhnyaya Toyma and the Northern Dvina. The volost had been attested through archive records since the 16th century, but its name, known since the 12th century, refers to ancient Finno-Ugric peoples that were then already extinct or assimilated. A station on the ancient trading route along the Northern Dvina River, in the end of the 17th century the volost became a hub of the Old Believers flight to the north. The government suppressed the dissenters, the Russian Orthodox Church responded with continuous missionary activities, and in the 19th century the village was brought back into official Orthodoxy. The craftsmen of the volost developed a unique school of folk painting, notable for its use of black, red and gilding over a white background. This art, limited to household artifacts like distaff boards and murals over log houses and Russian stoves, remained unknown to historians and collectors until Olga Kruglova rediscovered it in 1959. Geography A community in this area developed at the confluence of the Nizhnyaya Toyma and the Northern Dvina Rivers. The Nizhnyaya Toyma River freezes in November, thaws in late April or May, and allows commercial timber rafting.Nizhnyaya Toyma River entry in Russian in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia. Its valley, with an area of 1740 square kilometers, is continuously covered with small hills and ridges. These terminal moraine ridges mark the southernmost extreme of the prehistoric glacier expansion.Demidov et al., p. 330 Yury Arbat, an ethnographer who studied the folk art of Arkhangelsk outback in the 1960s, described the place: > Nizhnyaya Toyma is not a village ... but a group of villages under a common > title.

At least some of these villages, according to Arbat, sported traditional large, spacious Pomor type log houses with carved balconies and traditional exterior murals in local style. History Etymology The toponym Toyma is common to all northern Russian territories, from Toyma in Karelia to Toyma River in the Republic of Tatarstan. It relates to an extinct Finno-Ugric ethnonym of the same name known to the Novgorodians since (at least) the beginning of the 12th century. Janet Martin considered Toima (sic) the southern extreme of Novgorodian control over the Dvina basin in this period.Martin 2004, p. 57 The first mention of Toyma, paying tribute to Novgorodians, is dated 1137Martin 2004, p. 55, provides a list of tax-paying possessions of Novgorod in 1137, including Toyma. but there is no evidence that the word Toyma relates to the present-day area or its neighbor, Verkhnetoyemsky Selsoviet. The 1219 chronicle mentions ethnonym toymokary (). The 1237 Tale of the Death of the Russian Land mentions \\"Toyma pagans\\" living between \\"the Karelians\\" and Veliky Ustyug (),Original Russian version of the Tale of the Death of the Russian Land, second paragraph. a location roughly aligned with the Northern Dvina basin. Russian linguists argue whether the ethnonym Toyma relates to a specific tribe, a tribal group, a language or a whole continuum of Finno-Ugric languages.Matveev 2007, provides a roundup of opposing views on the subject Evgeny Chelimsky applied ethnonym Toyma to the wide area in the southern part of Northern Dvina basin and wrote that it is equivalent to the Northern Finns in Aleksandr Matveyev's classification.Chelimsky 2006, pp.38‚Äì39 Matveyev objected, writing that the Northern Finnish continuum was considerably wider than Toyma's, and that the hypothetical Toyma people occupied only a minor portion of it.Matveyev 2007, p. 23 He preferred to equate the Toyma with a particular tribe that lived in Nizhnaya Toyma area, and noted that it also could belong to Permic languages.Matveyev 2007, p. 24 At any rate, the Toymas disappeared before the 17th century, when their existence could be recorded in Muscovite sources, either through russification or through earlier assimilation by other Finno- Ugric tribes. Trade route The west-east trade route along the Northern Dvina from Scandinavia and Novgorod to Bjarmaland has been known since the early Middle Ages but then the name of Toyma disappeared from Russian records until 1552, when Ivan IV of Moscow subordinated Toyma lands to the chief of Vaginsky Uyezd. The travel along the Northern Dvina has been extensively documented by the 1663 Dutch embassy to Muscovy headed by Koenraad van Klenk. The complete travel from the Netherlands to Moscow via Nordcap and Arkhangelsk took 175 days (return route: 125 days). The upstream travel from Arkhangelsk to Nizhnyaya Toyma took 14 days, from Nizhnyaya Toyma to Veliky Ustyug 11 days (downstream: 5 and 5 days).Koenraad van Klenk (in Russian) (1900 edition). Voyagie van den Heere Koenraad van Klenk, ambassadeur aen zyne Zaarsche Majesteyt van Moscovien. Comments by the Russian editors, chapter VII. Raskol According to the 1676‚Äì1681 population audit, Nizhnetoymenskaya Volost consisted of 34 villages with only 171 households (including 33 abandoned houses).History of Verkhaya Toyma land (in Russian) Local records attested significant decrease in population: some men were drafted into the troops, others left to seek fortune in Siberia, or simply disappeared. At the same time the Northern Dvina River became an escape route for the Old Believers, prosecuted by the government. The first record of the dissidents settling in Permogorye is dated 1686.Shchipin 2008, chapter 1 In March 1690, 212 dissidents from different volosts burned themselves in Cherevkovo in protest against a punitive expedition searching the area. Self-immolations continued through the 18th century, police raids‚Äîuntil 1905. Cherevkovo, a village close to the Nizhnyaya Toyma, became a major Old Believers shrine and held its faith until the 1930s. The Nizhnyaya Toyma River hosted settlements of the Aaronovtsy, a pro-marriage branch of the Filippovtsy sect established in the beginning of the 19th century. Two other denominations active in the region were the Fedoseevtsy and the Danilovtsy.Shchipin 2008, chapter 2. The official church considered Nizhnyaya Toyma and Cherevkovo areas especially dangerous (as opposed to the \\"safe\\" Verkhnyaya Uftyuga nearby) and maintained active missionaries in the area until the October Revolution; the volost even hosted missionary conventions.Alekseyeva 2000 The grand mainstream Church of Theotokos Orans, now dilapidated after decades of neglect, was erected in 1818. The volost, once completely \\"dissident\\", firmly returned into communion with the official church in the second half of the 19th century; isolated communities of Old Believers survived in nearby forests into the 20th century. Civil War In 1919, the volost, as part of the whole upper Northern Dvina, became the site of a final battle between the British occupation forces and the Bolshevik troops. In the beginning of the 1919 campaign the area was used by the air wing of the Red North Dvina flotilla. Wheeled planes were stored in canvas tents on the coast, seaplanes on barges equipped with slipway ramps (leaky floats forced the Reds to pull their seaplanes out of water after each flight).Shirokorad 2006, part IV chapter 2 In May‚ÄìJune the Red airplanes relocated to Puchuga; on June 17 the British airplanes attacked the Puchuga airfield and destroyed 11 Red airplanes on the ground. Naval action also concentrated around Puchuga and gradually moved upstream. The British employed river monitors (M27, M31, M33, Humber and Saikala), fast small boats and Fairey-IIIB seaplanes, one of which was shot down on July 14; local peasants caught the crew and gave them to the Reds. The Bolsheviks operated makeshift gunboats carrying guns up to 130-mm caliber (the gunboats equipped in Petrograd with 203-mm guns were not yet ready for action). They harassed their enemy with anchored and free-floating naval mines but the British easily recovered these mines and reused them against the Reds. On August 10, the British routed the Bolshevik ground forces near Borok (Boretskaya); the remaining Bolsheviks broke through the woods to the villages near the Nizhnyaya Toyma. Their flotilla was temporarily split into two screening units guarding the villages of Puchuga and Sludka; ground forces marched forward to intercept the British. On the night of August 13‚Äì14, the British secretly moved their ground artillery in the rear of the Bolshevik gunboats and shelled them down at close distance; Bolshevik infantry, again, retreated to the Nizhnyaya Toyma. They were not aware that the British action was merely a diversion covering their general evacuation from Northern Russia.Shirokorad 2006, part IV chapter 3 The Bolshevik flotilla on the Northern Dvina existed until May 1920; minesweeping of the river was not completed until 1921. Painting school A spinning distaff board from the Nizhnyaya Toyma area featuring traditional tripartite layout. Discovery The volost was a center of traditional wood painting crafts discovered only in 1959 by ethnographers from the Zagorsk Museum.Arbat 1968, chapter 1 The Zagorsk Expedition, led by Olga Kruglova, looked for the survivors of the Permogorye tradition of painting in black and red colours over a yellow background. Their favorite motifs were the Sirin Bird and the black horses, symbols of a wealthy household. Historians found plenty of these artifacts in and around Permogorye and Mokraya Yedoma (both names refer to clusters of villages rather than standalone communities), and as they traveled some 150 kilometers downstream the Northern Dvina River, to the Nizhnyaya Toyma, they discovered a yet unknown and completely different type of painting. Motifs and colours Toyma artists employed cinnabar painting over either white or gilded background, and their signature motif was a festive marriage ride hauled by two horses.Arbat 1968, chapter 2 Two notable families of painters, the Tretyakovs and the Menshikovs, employed black, red, green, rarely blue and pink paint over a white background; one horse in their marriage rides was uniformly gilded, another was red or green with silver trim. These families produced folk artists and Orthodox icon painters, and the folk line of their art reused the motifs and layout found in icons. They Red (day) and black (night) horses. Fragment of a spinning distaff board from the Nizhnyaya Toyma area. Leonid Latynin also noted the tree motif, common to all Northern Russian folk art.Latynin 2006, chapter 1. Similar motifs were practiced in nearby Borok and Puchuga. Victor Vasilenko classified Nizhaya Toyma painting under Shenkursk art heading (after the nearby town of Shenkursk) although, according to Yury Arbat, a Toyma-Borok art would be more descriptive. The latter name, however, is ambiguous because the village of Toyma in Komi Republic had its own distinct painting tradition based on the Mezen school and unrelated to Nizhnaya Toyma.Utkina 2003. A typical spinning distaff from Toyma is divided vertically into three parts. The lower third features the trademark marriage ride, usually with only one human figure‚Äîthe bridegroom. The middle third is filled with a complex floral ornament, sometimes with mythical birds. The upper and the most standardized part of the board is split horizontally into three \\"windows\\". Two side windows are adorned with images of pot flowers, in between them was a central tree of life motif. Yury Arbat linked strict geometric division of the Toyma board to the Orthodox iconostasis design. Decline By the 1960s, the craftsmen of the selsoviet still remembered their best painters of the 19th century (Ivan Tretyakov the elder, 1837‚Äì1922) and maintained their traditions. The oldest painter witnessed by Arbat, a 95-year-old spinster from Borok, was still painting spinning distaffs, but most active craftsmen had already switched to interior murals over Russian stoves and into painting handmade wallpaper. This placed them at disadvantage to artists from Khokhloma or Palekh who produced small, portable and marketable artifacts: the art of Toyma remained locked in peasant houses until they crumbled or burnt down, unknown even to collectors from Arkhangelsk.

In this capacity, he helped Sima obtain control of an armed structure, and, taking the party's side during the Legionnaires' rebellion of 1941, helped organize it in combat against Antonescu. Captured and tried, Petrovicescu spent the longer part of World War II in confinement or house arrest. He was retried for war crimes two years after King Michael's Coup of August 1944, and sentenced to life imprisonment. He died in Aiud Prison almost two years after a Romanian communist regime had been established. Biography Born in T√¢rgu Jiu, Petrovicescu attended the military school for infantry in Craiova from 1896 to 1899, the officers' school in Bucharest from 1899 to 1900, and the military school for infantry and cavalry from 1906 to 1908. During World War I Romanian Campaign, he fought on the Moldavian front. Following the Union of Bessarabia with Romania in 1918, Petrovicescu, by then a high-ranking officer, was named chief of the general staff in that province's territorial command. Later, until 1933, he was royal commissioner at the Chi»ôinƒÉu army corps.Neagoe, p. 570 After being named brigadier general, at the beginning of 1934, he was transferred to the national capital, where he served as royal commissioner at the Bucharest Military Tribunal. In this capacity, he was part of a panel of judges who tried the Iron Guard (Legionnaire) assassins of Prime Minister Ion G. Duca and their moral accomplices. The latter category included Guard leaders Codreanu and retired general Gheorghe Cantacuzino-GrƒÉnicerul, as well as prominent affiliates such as Gheorghe Clime, Nichifor Crainic, and Mihai Stelescu.Ornea, p. 300 He voted to convict the assassins themselves (the Nicadori), but supported the acquittal of Codreanu and Cantacuzino-GrƒÉnicerul. He soon after secretly joined the banned Guard and, in recognition for his stance during the trial, was named a member of its senate. At Codreanu's trial in April‚ÄìMay 1938, Petrovicescu appeared as a witness for the defence, praising Codreanu's \\"proper behaviour\\" and \\"patriotism\\". Due to his repeatedly expressed pro-Iron Guard sympathies, King Carol II retired him in September 1938.Neagoe, p. 571 Two years later, following Carol's abdication and the assumption of power by General Ion Antonescu and the Guard (together ruling a National Legionary State, with Antonescu as ConducƒÉtor and Prime Minister), the new ruling party recommended Petrovicescu as Interior Minister, and he assumed that post. In October 1940, upon the recommendation of vice premier and new Legion head Horia Sima, Antonescu promoted Petrovicescu to the rank of divisional general retroactive to June 1, 1938, and returned him to active duty. As minister, he worked with Sima to create a well-armed Legionary police force, and actively supported arresting or even killing politicians who in the past had suppressed the Guard.Deletant, p. 60-61, 66; Neagoe, p. 571 The new police force also turned itself into a tool of racial repression, targeting the Jewish-Romanian community.Deletant, p. 60 Petrovicescu irritated Antonescu by upholding public acts of violent retribution, and this fall-out acquired importance by the close of 1940. In particular, the ConducƒÉtor suspected his Legionnaire subordinate of having played a part in organizing the Jilava Massacre of November 1940, during which the political elite associated with Carol's rule was mass murdered.Deletant, p. 61 On January 19, 1941, after the Nazi German Major D√∂ring had been mysteriously assassinated in Bucharest, Sima's faction publicly questioned Antonescu's commitment to Romania's Axis allies, and the ConducƒÉtor used the occasion to strip Petrovicescu of his cabinet office.Deletant, p. 64-65; Ornea, p. 343 The official explanation for his decision was that Petrovicescu had not taken the proper measures to secure the perimeter within nine hours of D√∂ring's shooting.Deletant, p. 64 The next day, as Antonescu signaled his marginalization of the Guard, a large part of the country was gripped by a Legionnaires' rebellion. At an early stage of the riots, leading Guard member Viorel Trifa issued a manifesto which directly blamed the \\"brave and upright\\" minister's dismissal on Antonescu's alleged sympathy for \\"the British government of freemasons\\", accompanying such claims with antisemitic language.Deletant, p. 65 Other such theories popularized by the Legionnaires had it that Antonescu had personally encouraged Demetrios Sarandos, D√∂ring's Greek-Turkish killer, to carry out his action, thus aiming to discredit Petrovicescu's political abilities.Deletant, p. 299 Petrovicescu was an important destabilising element during the subsequent events, which saw his and the Guard's fall into disgrace. He is believed to have had the personal initiative for one of the most notorious acts of violence carried out at the time, by ordering the Legionnaires to occupy the headquarters of the Siguran»õa Statului secret police and open fire on the soldiers and civilians outside.Deletant, p. 300 Petrovicescu was arrested and tried along with other former Legionnaire government officials. In summer 1941, he was sentenced to five or sevenDeletant, p. 302 years' imprisonment. In 1944, he was sent to Sibiu to live under house arrest.Deletant, p. 302; Neagoe, p. 571 Following King Michael's Coup, which changed Romania's political orientation away from the Axis, Petrovicescu was again arrested, being held in the prisons of Alba Iulia and later Sibiu. In 1946, he was tried (simultaneously with Antonescu himself) before the first of a series of Romanian People's Tribunals as a war criminal.Deletant, p. 347; Neagoe, p. 571 Sentenced to life imprisonment, he was sent to Aiud prison after his appeal was rejected. He died there three years later.

During that time he has won one All-Ireland winners' medal and two Leinster winners' medals. In 1957 O'Brien captained the team to the All-Ireland title. At club level O'Brien was a three-time county club championship medalist with St. Mary's. Musical career A long-time amateur musician, in 1962 O'Brien became a professional musician when his band the Clubmen went professional; O'Brien played the piano accordion for the band rather than the more typical Irish button accordion. Dermot O'Brien and the Clubmen had considerable musical success, with their hit single \\"The Merry Ploughboy\\" (a cover of a Dominic Behan song about joining the Irish Republican Army) reaching the top of the Irish Singles Chart in only seven days and holding that position for six weeks in late 1966. The single was rushed to market to compete with a Top 100-ranking cover of the same song by the Abbey Tavern Singers. In the late 1960s, O'Brien began his own RT√â show called \\"The Styles of O'Brien\\". In 2018, Brown University students started a Dermot O'Brien appreciation club.

Named after engine designer Sir Harry Ricardo it featured an innovative four valve head design and was capable of over 70 mph, set three world speed records and won a gold medal in the 1923 International Six Day Trial. Development 1925 Triumph Ricardo Developed around a 499cc single-cylinder four overhead valve four- stroke commissioned by Triumph from engine expert Ricardo, the Triumph Ricardo was a replacement for the aging Triumph side-valves. Ricardo produced a number of prototypes aimed at reducing thermal stress on the inadequate valve materials available, while improving airflow through increased valve area. Harry Ricardo's final design had the four valves operated by the existing tappet mechanism and set a new standard for the power output possible from a 500cc single-cylinder engine, achieving over 20 bhp - the same as a 1500cc car engine of the time. Capable of 70 mph, the four-valve head allowed more efficient gas flow and the spark plug could be positioned in the middle for optimum combustion. Each pair of valves was parallel, at 90 degrees to each other, with the valve stems and springs exposed, as were the long pushrods which ran on the outside of the engine. A light alloy piston ran in a steel cylinder barrel and the cylinder head was made of cast iron. The rest of the cycle parts were based on Triumph's well proven Triumph Model H side-valve. This had a poor reputation for handling, however, and was not really built for the more powerful four valve engine. On later models the oil system (which had relied on a manual hand pump) was replaced with an external oil pump. The 'Riccy' continued in production as a sports model until 1928. Racing success As well as developing the four valve engine, Harry Ricardo was also very interested in formulating new racing fuels and the effects of fuel octane on engine performance. Triumph had a poor result when three Ricardo's competed in the 1921 Isle of Man TT, with only one completed the race but a 'Model R' Fast Roadster model was entered in the 1922 Senior TT, ridden by Ricardo's assistant and fellow engine designer Frank Halford, who came 13th. Halford on a tuned Triumph Ricardo fitted with a bronze alloy cylinder head of his own design also recorded a lap of the race track at Brooklands at 68 mph, broke the Brooklands hour record at 76.74 mph the flying mile at 87.8 mph. Much of the credit went to the new racing fuel which was eventually banned. In 1923 a 'Model R' Fast Roadster model won a gold medal in the ISDT.

It was composed and arranged by Jonathan Coulton and was performed by Ellen McLain, who portrayed the Portal antagonist and subject of the song, GLaDOS. The song originated in a meeting between two Valve developers and Coulton about him writing a song for the company, which Coulton accepted as he was a fan of Valve's Half-Life series, to which Portal is related. The song was released on The Orange Box Soundtrack on December 21, 2007, along with an exclusive vocal mix not heard in the game. The song is displayed on what appears to be a computer console, playing after GLaDOS is defeated by protagonist Chell, with the lyrics revealing that GLaDOS is, in fact, \\"still alive.\\" The song received praise for its humor and the quality of its performance. It has been featured in multiple venues, including at the 2009 Press Start -Symphony of Games-, a yearly Japanese concert event to showcase the musical works of video games. It was also featured as a free downloadable song for the Rock Band series, originally released on April 1, 2008. A rerecorded version, with Sara Quin on lead vocals, appears on Coulton's 2011 album Artificial Heart. History and recording Jonathan Coulton, the composer of \\"Still Alive\\" The song \\"Still Alive\\" was written by Jonathan Coulton and performed by Ellen McLain for the 2007 video game Portal. McLain also provides the voice for GLaDOS in this song, an artificial intelligence and the game's antagonist. \\"Still Alive\\" is sung from the perspective of GLaDOS, used as the song that runs over the game's credits. By the end of the game, Chell, the game's protagonist who has been misled and placed in life- threatening situations within the game's testing facility setting by GLaDOS, eventually defeated her. However, the song disputes this, with GLaDOS exclaiming that she was still alive and that things were a success. She also exclaims that she is still testing, and references the Combine invasion of Earth in the Half-Life series. The song itself is also present as a samba instrumental version through in-game radios at certain points in the game. Coulton was approached by two Valve designers following a concert in Seattle, Washington. They asked him if he would like to write music for the company. Coulton was a fan of Half-Life, so he immediately accepted. After discussing what they should do, he and the designers settled on Portal. By this point, a few months before the release of The Orange Box, Valve's writers had created a large amount of backstory for GLaDOS and other aspects of Portal, which Coulton used to write the lyrics. As GLaDOS grew more important to Portals story, McLain was asked to sing for the game, since she was a trained operatic soprano, given a scratch vocal version by Coulton. McLain's singing, which Coulton described as conveying \\"emotion in a non-emotional way,\\" was modified to sound computerized. The overall process about six weeks to complete. Coulton found it difficult to get GLaDOS' voice out of his head. Kim Swift, lead designer of Portal, explained that the song was chosen to play during the credits because they wanted to leave players feeling happy. When Coulton began work on a theme for the Portal-connected video game Lego Dimensions, he exclaimed that the song was a \\"phenomenon ... out of control,\\" and that the song benefited from the writing and its context in the game. He found composing the Lego Dimensions song easier to do once he accepted that he would not be able to make a song as big as \\"Still Alive\\" again. In other media It was featured in The Orange Box Original Soundtrack released on Steam, containing both the original version and remix sung by Coulton himself. It was given a remix by singer Sarah Covey in the album, \\"The Greatest Video Game Music 2\\". It had been played live at the third Video Games Live concert, and released as part of the album Video Games Live Level 3. Coulton worked with They Might Be Giants songwriter John Flansburgh on a new version of \\"Still Alive\\" for an album by Coulton in 2013. It was included in the Vitamin String Quartet's Geek Wedding Album. A vinyl disc was released to celebrate Portals 10th anniversary in 2017, featuring \\"Still Alive\\". The song is also present in Valve's zombie-themed Left 4 Dead 2, which can be selected to play on a jukebox in three different campaigns. The opening line for \\"Still Alive\\" (\\"This was a triumph. I'm making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS.\\") was featured in the Valve game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. This was thought to be an alternate reality game about a potential Portal sequel, but was later confirmed to just be an Easter egg. In the Portal game mod \\"Portal Prelude\\", a remix of \\"Still Alive\\" can be heard on several radios throughout the game, however, they are not performed by GLaDOS. The spin-off Bridge Constructor Portal features a cameo appearance of the song. A Christmas-themed remix of \\"Still Alive\\" was created for Valve's Aperture Science website, showing a moving image of the Weighted Companion Cube with a Santa Claus hat, ending with a message reading \\"HAPPY [HOLIDAY NAME HERE]\\". A special Microsoft Windows port of the Xbox Live Arcade title, Chime, includes \\"Still Alive\\" as an additional music stage for the game. In Rock Band \\"Still Alive\\" was featured as a downloadable song in multiple games in the Rock Band series, including Rock Band, Rock Band 2, and Rock Band Unplugged. It was included for free on the Xbox 360, Wii and PlayStation 3 to thank players for supporting the series. After complaints about Rock Band Unpluggeds version not being free, this was rectified and anyone who paid for it had their money refunded. After a content pack for Rock Band was hacked, a list of songs purported to be included was released which included \\"Still Alive\\". Jonathan Coulton and three others performed this song on Rock Band, announcing its presence in the title as a downloadable song. Coulton's version with Sara Quin, as appears on his album Artificial Heart, was later released through the Rock Band Network as well. Live performances The song was also performed at the 2009 Press Start -Symphony of Games-, a yearly Japanese concert event to showcase the musical works of video games. \\"Still Alive\\" is the first Western song to be performed at the show, which included a Japanese translation by Kazushige Nojima, a writer of several Final Fantasy games, and arrangement for the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. Masahiro Sakurai, director of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, demonstrated the game to the audience prior to the performance, given the minimal exposure of Portal in Japan. The vocals were done by vocalist Mariko Otsuka. Reception \\"Still Alive\\" has been met with significant praise, called \\"legendary\\" by USgamer writer Nadia Oxford and identified by Vice writer Jagger Gravning as the most famous lyric-based video game song. It is credited with earning Coulton a \\"cult status.\\" A large majority of video game critics who awarded Portal game of the year mentioned \\"Still Alive\\" as one of the game's qualities, while Portal designer Chet Faliszek felt that it was part of why Portal was special. It was called the credits sequence and song the most memorable moment of 2007 by the Australian Broadcasting Company's television series, Good Game. Former LucasArts employee and Sinistar designer Noah Falstein felt that the song enhanced the game, and that more games should craft a song for the end that fits them as well as Coulton was able to fit \\"Still Alive\\". He praised McLain's performance as \\"pitch-perfect\\" and the song as \\"catchy.\\" IGN writer Ryan Geddes calling it the best game-ending song of all time, while Mashable writer Kellen Beck found it one of the most recognizable. The song's singer, McLain, praised Coulton for capturing GLaDOS in the song as well as he did. The song was given the \\"Best Original Vocal - Pop Song\\" award by the Game Audio Network Guild during their 2008 awards. Coulton experienced a surge in popularity after the release of Portal due to the song's release. It was later performed live by original singer Ellen McLain for the first time at Anime Midwest in Chicago. In the book The Art of Videogames, author Grant Tavinor stated that while he was in hysterics by the song, he got the sense of artistic completion upon hearing it. 1UP.com's Alice Liang called the ending to Portal \\"catchy, charming, surprising, and humorously bittersweet\\". On the eve of Portal 2s release, Forbes editor David Ewart called the song \\"surprising, funny, catchy, and unforgettable\\", and considered its opening line \\"This was a triumph\\" as a \\"modern shibboleth\\". Kyle Hilliard of Game Informer included the song in a list of surprising musical numbers in video games, while fellow Game Informer writer Michael Leri featured it in a list of \\"awesome\\" non-interactive credits sequences. UGO writer Melissa Meli felt sick of the song due to how often they hear it, but still recognized the game's soundtrack as \\"one of the most endearing and original soundtracks in gaming history.\\" Sara Goodwin of The Mary Sue called it one of the best villain songs, calling it \\"pretty\\" and the lyrics \\"amazing and chilling.\\" The Press Start -Symphony of Games- performance received criticism from Video Game Music Online author Cedille, who felt that the lyrics sounded \\"childish\\" when translated into Japanese, and that the singer gave a \\"faceless performance\\" that made it \\"painful and dreadful.\\" Cedille was appreciative of the efforts made to demonstrate Portal to Japanese audiences, but questioned the need to translate it into Japanese and feature a different singer. The Covey remix in \\"The Greatest Video Game Music 2\\" album was considered a weaker song in said album, with fellow Video Game Music Online Jon Hammond finding the instrumental aspects nice, but feeling that Covey sounded like she was trying too hard to sing well, sacrificing the song's humor. Video Game Music Online critic Oliver Jia felt that the original version of \\"Still Alive\\" was one of the most memorable video game themes, but felt that the performance on the Video Games Live Level 3 album ruined it due both to the fact that they used a live recording that sounded worse than other songs on the album, but also due to the crowd singing and clapping along, making it sound \\"overly cheesy and poorly done.\\" Due to the success of the song, Coulton was brought on to work on the soundtrack of the sequel, Portal 2. Paste Magazine writer Nathan Spicer felt that it was a video game song that could be enjoyed regardless of someone's familiarity with Portal.

His career ended in scandal, which resulted in a ten-year prison sentence. He died during his sentence at the New Jersey State Prison in Trenton. Biography Early life and career Levi Jarrard was the son of Jonas Jarrard, a wagon maker, and Ereminah Dalrymple. Levi married first to Jane Lewis Trowbridge, and had three children: David, William and Mary Jane. Jane died on August 9, 1848 in Pennsylvania. Not long after, Jarrard married secondly on December 24, 1849 to Margaret Evans, a daughter of William and Elizabeth (Snyder) Evans. They had a total of eleven children: James, Ellen, Elwood, William, Winfield, Esther, Henry, Elizabeth, Charles, Frederick and Emma. He worked first as a ship chandler and later became the Superintendent of the Delaware and Raritan Towing Company. He also owned a tobacco plant and a grocery store. Jarrard was elected to the New Jersey State Senate for Middlesex County in 1871. He held this position until 1876. Afterward, he served as Collector of Middlesex County, New Jersey. In 1881, Jarrard succeed Joseph F. Fisher as US Postmaster of New Brunswick, New Jersey, by being appointed by President Chester A. Arthur and serving from 1881 until 1883. Scandal On May 18, 1883, he was reported missing. At the time he went missing, Jarrard was postmaster for New Brunswick, New Jersey. While he was missing, the books at his office were reviewed, and large amounts of money appeared to be missing, and suspicions arose that Jarrard had stolen over $20,000. When it became apparent that he would not return, a dispute arose as to who would succeed him as county collector. County Collector Fisher, who preceded Jarrard in office, had also been accused of stealing money. When the dispute worsened, President Chester A. Arthur stepped in to settle the dispute by selecting John F. Babcock as postmaster on June 8, 1883. In June 1883, Jarrard was accused of stealing $39,000 from the county and falsifying the books. A $1,000 reward for his capture was issued by the Board of Freeholders of New Brunswick on July 7, 1883. Exile It was later discovered that Levi Jarrard fled to Canada, and spent most of his time in Niagara Falls. He had leased a hotel at Windsor, and called it the British-American Hotel. He was furnishing it at the time when he was questioned by detectives sent by Pinkerton. At this time, he was living under an assumed name. Jarrard was detained at Niagara Falls, Ontario, on the afternoon of August 1, 1883, and held there at police headquarters. He was arrested and remanded by Judge Baxter of County Welland. New Brunswick lawyers J. Kearney Rice and Robert Adrian went to Canada to participate in the extradition case. They met Jarrard at Police Headquarters, where Jarrard was delighted to see them. Afterward, Jarrard was put in jail to await the extradition trial. On August 27, his trial began in the County Welland court, with Judge Baxter proceeding. On December 17, 1883, the Court of Common Pleas dismissed Jarrard's attempt to be discharged. The Chief-Justice stated that they have accused Jarrard of forgery and that he had stolen an estimated $36,000. The extradition case was argued in the Court of Appeals on February 5, 1884. In the case, Jarrard's defense was that he owned the books that were allegedly altered and that a clerk altered them. He also said that Freehold Evans of the finance committee had audited the account and said it was correct. The extradition case was settled on March 4, 1884, in a unanimous decision. Jarrard was charged with forgery. Trial Constable Loper and Detective Wood brought him back to New Jersey. Loper later testified in court that Jarrard was traveling under the name of H. Beaver. Anticipating Jarrard's arrival, Sherriff Disham had \\"two cells cleaned and furnished as comfortably as possible, one for use as a sleeping room, the other for use as a reception room.\\" Jarrard was put on trial in New Brunswick on April 22, 1884, on a charge of forgery. In court, he was represented by Howard McSherry, William T. Hoffman, a former judge, and Counselor Ryerson. On April 24, Ryerson opened up the defense by blaming Jarrard's clerk, Deshler, for altering the data in the books. David Gilliand, a janitor for Jarrard, testified that Jarrard was out of town in New York the day that Deshler claims Jarrard told him to change the forgeries in the book. Days later, Gilliand testifies that he saw Deshler in the Collector's office, and saw that Deshler was \\"scratching something out with an eraser.\\" When Gilliand questioned him, Deshler told him that he was \\"trying to save himself‚Äîor 'the boss'‚Äîfrom State prison\\" and order Gilliand not to say anything about it. During a cross-examination, Gilliand had admitted to have been frequently in prison. When it was Jarrard's turn to testify, he stated that he was not in the Collector's office on May 14, but in New York, confirming Gilliand's statements. On April 26, Jarrard was convicted of forgery; sentencing was postponed for two weeks, because Jarrard had requested a new trial, which was pending. However, the sentencing actually occurred on April 29; he was sentenced to 10 years in prison and was to pay a fine of $1,000 for forgery. Death Jarrard died during his sentence on April 26, 1886. Previously, his friends, fellow politicians, and family had signed a petition for his release, but it was refused. His widow, Margaret, later joined their son in Michigan. See also *Levi D.

Plot Mr. Ronald Gibb (Tim Daly) is a high school history teacher. Although he is depicted as a creative if weak-willed teacher, his students lack interest for the subject matter. One of his students, Ally Palmer (Hayden Panettiere) is a popular teenage girl and local celebrity. She was featured in a television commercial for her father's car dealership. Mr. Gibb secretly has a crush on Ally. He stares at her inappropriately multiple times a day. One day after school, he overhears Ally and her boyfriend Brett (John Gallagher, Jr.) get into a big argument. She no longer has a ride home from school, so he offers to take her home. Mr. Gibb and Ally are photographed just as she spontaneously kisses him on the lips (to thank him for giving her an unexpected A), and as such the school board deems his behavior unacceptable and unprofessional. She goes missing after he drops her off at her house. The news reports that a kidnapping has occurred. Mr. Gibb is the primary suspect because police officials find evidence that he was with Ally moments before she was kidnapped. The film follows Gibb as he copes with public humiliation and ends with a sudden twist in the final minutes.

In 2002 he helped to initiate a long-term archaeology project at New Philadelphia, Illinois, a multi-racial town that was founded by a freed African American in 1836. In the 1860s the railroad bypassed New Philadelphia and by the 1920s it was virtually abandoned.Walker, Juliet, 1983, Free Frank: A Black Pioneer on the Antebellum Frontier.University Press of Kentucky, Lexington In 2002 and 2003 the University of Maryland partnered with the Illinois State Museum (ISM), the University of Illinois (UI), and the friends group, the New Philadelphia Association (NPA), to perform an archaeological survey of the land. In 2004, UMCP received a 3-year National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates award that allowed Shackel to partner with UI and ISM to train undergraduates in archaeology and explore issues of race, class and ethnicity on the Illinois western frontier.Shackel, Paul A. 2010 Remembering New Philadelphia.

In 1897, 25 miners of eastern European descent were killed while protesting for equal pay and better working conditions. Documentary research, oral histories and archaeological excavations of the domestic sites of coal miners and laborers in the coal patch towns of northeastern Pennsylvania is now the emphasis of the Anthracite Heritage Project. Since 2015, archaeology, preservation and heritage research has been conducted at Eckley Miners' Village, which is overseen by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. This research focuses on issues related to labor, class, and historic and contemporary immigration.

Biography Family background and education He was the eldest of three sons born to The Reverend Reynell Wreford Hay and his wife Margaret Alice (n√©e Bolton). His grandfather William Hay was a merchant and ship owner from Bishopwearmouth, while his uncle, William Delisle Hay, was a novelist and mycologist. At the time of his birth his father was teaching at Newchurch Grammar School, Lancashire, but in 1892 was appointed the rector of Garsdon and Lea in Wiltshire. He was educated at Armstrong College, Newcastle (then part of Durham University, now part of Newcastle University). World War I After serving as a cadet in the Officers' Training Corps, on 27 January 1915 Hay was commissioned as a second lieutenant (on probation) in the 3rd Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment, alongside his brothers Guy Baldwin Hay (1890‚Äì1951) and Roger Bolton Hay (1895‚Äì1917). On 2 February 1916 he was appointed a temporary supernumerary lieutenant, and on 24 June, while attached to the 1st Battalion of the West Yorkshires, was awarded the Military Cross. His citation read: :2nd Lieutenant Hugh Allport Hay, Special Reserve, West Yorkshire Regiment (attd. 1st Bn.). ::For gallantry and ability. He made a very close reconnaissance of enemy trenches prior to attack, and in the attack itself led his platoon with great ability. He has served for many months in the front line, and has proved himself a capable leader. He relinquished his temporary rank on 4 July, but was promoted to full lieutenant on 26 September. In mid-1917 Hay was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps, receiving Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 5481 and being appointed a flying officer on 29 November. Hay was posted to No. 11 Squadron RFC in early 1918 to fly the Bristol F.2 Fighter.Shores et.al. (1990), pp.188‚Äì189. On 1 April, the Army's Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) were merged to form the Royal Air Force, and a week later, on the 7th, Hay gained his first victory when he and observer/gunner Sergeant P. A. Sherlock drove down an Albatros C 'out of control' over Gr√©villers. On 4 May he and Sherlock shot a Pfalz D.III down in flames over Marquion, and on 11 August, with 2nd Lieutenant E. J. Norris, he did the same to an Albatros D.V south of P√©ronne. On 26 August Hay was appointed a temporary captain while serving as a flight commander, and on 6 September, Hay and Lieutenant A. H. Craig destroyed and drove down two Fokker D.VIIs west of Cambrai. Hay left the RAF after the war, being transferred to the unemployed list on 2 June 1919. World War II Hay returned to military service just prior to World War II, serving in an anti-aircraft unit of the Territorial Army. He was commissioned as a captain, and appointed administration officer of the 1/5th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, on 23 March 1939. Hay relinquished his post of administration officer on 2 September, and on 1 August 1940 his unit was transferred and renamed, becoming the 54th Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery. He served throughout the war, finally relinquishing his commission, having exceeded the age limit, on 22 August 1945, and was granted the honorary rank of major.

Background Bred by Charles W. Wacker III, Prince Royal was sired was the undefeated Italian runner and leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland, Ribot. His dam, Pange, also produced Senibility, the grand-dam of the Breeders' Cup Turf winner Theatrical Prince Royal was sold to Italy's Dr. Carlo Bassignana at the December 1961 Tattersalls sale for approximately $10,600 and sent into training with Giuseppe Galbiati in Italy. Racing career The colt began his career in racing at age two in Italy where he had one win in four of his 1963 starts with a third-place finish in Italy's most important race for his age group, the Gran Criterium. Racing at age three in 1964, Prince Royal won his first three starts before finishing fourth in the Gran Premio d'Italia. He came back to win the Gran Premio di Milano and ran away from the opposition to win the Premio Besana by fifteen lengths. Prince Royal was then sent to race in France. He ran in the Prix Royal-Oak in poor racing condition and was held back, finishing last to Baron Guy de Rothschild's winning colt, Barbieri. Negotiations, which had been going on prior to the Prix Royal-Oak, saw American Rex Ellsworth purchase Prince Royal for a reported US$400,000 who turned him over to French trainer, Georges Bridgland. For his new owner and trainer, Prince Royal was next entered in the October 4th running of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Up against older horses, the three-year-old colt won the forty-third running of France's most important race. Following Prince Royal's Arc victory he was retired from racing and sent to the United States where he was registered as \\"Prince Royal II\\". Assessment In 1964, the Independent Timeform organisation awarded Prince Royal a rating of 134, making him the highest-rated three-year-old colt of the season ahead of The Derby winner Santa Claus. In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Prince Royal as an \\"average\\" winner of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Prince Royal was the Italian Champion Three-Year-Old Colt of 1964. Stud record Prince Royal served stud duty at owner Rex Ellworth's breeding operation in Southern California's Chino Valley from 1965 through 1973. He met with little success as a stallion, siring just seven stakes race winners from 268 foals. He did however have one son, Unconscious, who won the 1971 San Felipe Handicap and the 1972 Strub Stakes. Acquired by a Japanese breeder, he stood at stud in Japan from 1974 to 1983 and died on 4 August 1983.

He was also the founder of the Sisters of Saint Martha. Reggio distinguished himself during an earthquake that struck his diocese in 1887. He tended to the injured in the rubble and led initiatives to direct diocesan resources towards the displaced and the injured; while in Genoa he collaborated with Bishop Giovanni Battista Scalabrini in tending to immigrants through a range of different pastoral initiatives. Reggio's cause for sainthood opened in 1983 though initiatives had been made prior to this to collect documents in relation to his life and episcopal tenure; he was named as Venerable in 1997 and the miraculous cure of a Chilean girl led to his beatification in Saint Peter's Square on 3 September 2000. Life Education and priesthood Tommaso Reggio was born in Genoa on 9 January 1818 to Marquis Giovanni Giacomo Reggio and Angela Maria Pareto; he was baptized on 10 January in the archdiocesan cathedral of San Lorenzo. He made his First Communion and received his Confirmation on 10 April 1828 from the Bishop of Saluzzo Antonio Podest√†. Reggio received his initial education at home from a private teacher and then his high school education in Genoa from the Somaschi Fathers and on 1 August 1838 received his bachelor of law from the Genoa college. On 24 March 1839 he decided to become a priest and underwent his philosophical and theological education in preparation for the priesthood. He received his ordination to the priesthood on 18 September 1841 after the conclusion of his ecclesial studies from Cardinal Placido Maria Tadini; he celebrated his first Mass in Gavi in Alessandria in the church of San Maurizio. On 15 July 1842 he graduated from the Genoa college in theological studies and received his doctorate in those studies in 1843. Reggio was appointed in 1843 as the vice-rector of seminarians in Genoa while later serving as the rector of seminarians in Chiavari from 1845 until 1851. In 1851 he returned to Genoa where he served as the abbot of Santa Maria Assunta in Carignano since his appointment as such on 26 May. He helped found The Catholic Standard on 26 July 1849 which was a newspaper but was to later close the paper on 14 March 1874 (with its final issue) after the papal declaration that the faithful could not vote in elections. It also put to rest his hopes - and that of others - for establishing a political organization based on the teachings of the faith. Episcopate He was named as the Bishop of Ventimiglia and as the titular Bishop of Tanis; he received his episcopal consecration in mid-1877. The diocese was so poor to the point that he had to travel on a mule to visit his parishes while making three pastoral visitations to the parishes in 1877, 1882 and 1889 while celebrating the first diocesan synod on 8 March 1880. He founded the Sisters of Saint Martha on 15 October 1878 which he determined was to be a congregation devoted to caring for the poor. He opened new parishes and also organized three diocesan gathering of bishops and priests and focused on liturgical revival. In addition to this he set up teaching programs across the diocese and began the restorative work of the Genoa Cathedral. Following an earthquake in 1887 in his diocese he worked with the victims in the rubble and he ordered his priests to use all of their resources to help the displaced peoples. He founded orphanages at Ventimiglia and Sanremo for those children who had lost their families in the quake. This great aid he rendered saw the Italian government award him as a Knight of the Cross of Ss. Maurizio e Lazzaro in 1887. In 1892 he asked Pope Leo XIII to relieve him of his duties but the pope appointed him instead as the Archbishop of Genoa where he was enthroned on 10 August in a grand celebration. He set up a network for immigrants and worked alongside Bishop Giovanni Battista Scalabrini to that end. On 2 April 1892 he ordained August Czartoryski as a priest. He celebrated an archdiocesan synod in 1893. Reggio also presided over the funeral of Umberto I on 8 August 1900 with papal permission to do so. Death Reggio made a pilgrimage on 13 September 1901 to Triora due to the unveiling of a new statue of Jesus Christ on Mount Saccarello with diocesan priests; he could not ascend the mountain due to being struck with a sudden and violent knee pain forcing him to remain in bed. Infection soon settled in and worsened despite dressings and kneepads that failed to help heal him. He died in the afternoon on 22 November 1901 at 2:20pm with his last words being: \\"God, God, God alone is enough for me\\". Ambrogio Daffra - his successor in Ventimiglia - said not long after his death: \\"I have witnessed the death of a saint\\". His remains were interred in Genoa after the funeral at the cathedral but later relocated in 1951. His order received the papal decree of praise from Pope Pius XI on 13 May 1928 who also granted pontifical approval later on 21 May 1935; in 2008 his order had 527 religious in 63 houses in countries such as Argentina and Lebanon. The first biographical account of his life was published in 1926. Beatification The beatification cause opened on 26 May 1983 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause and titled Reggio as a Servant of God; Cardinal Giuseppe Siri oversaw the diocesan process of investigation from 1983 until 1984 when all documents were sealed and boxes and sent to the C.C.S. in Rome who validated the process on 23 November 1992. The cause's officials compiled the Positio dossier though submitted it to the C.C.S. in two parts in 1991 and later in 1994 for investigation. Six historians approved the cause on 24 November 1992 as did the nine theologians later on 23 September 1997 in a unanimous decision. Cardinal Giovanni Canestri convened a meeting of the C.C.S. on 2 December 1997 who approved the cause as well. Reggio was named as Venerable on 18 December 1997 after Pope John Paul II confirmed his life of heroic virtue. Reggio's beatification depended on the approval of a miraculous healing that neither medicine or science could explain. One such case was investigated in Valpara√≠so in Chile in 1995 (Jorge Medina oversaw the diocesan process) before all the evidence was sent to the C.C.S. who validated the diocesan investigation on 18 October 1996. The medical panel of experts approved this case on 29 January 1998 as did the theologians on 5 May 1998 and the C.C.S. on 6 October 1998. John Paul II approved this miracle on 21 December 1998 and beatified Reggio on 3 September 2000 in Saint Peter's Square before a crowd of 80 000 people. Miracle The miracle that led to Reggio's beatification in 2000 was the miraculous healing of the girl Pabla Valdenegro Romero (b. 1979) who suffered from Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome - or polyradiculoneuritis - along with albumin-cytological dissociation ascending paralysis with cranial nerve involvement and quadriplegia as well as prolonged lung failure and two cardiac arrests as well as subcutaneous emphysema and other complications. This instantaneous healing came on 10 November 1985.

Originally built as the Eastwood Theater in 1929, the Barrymore was founded by Richard \\"Sich\\" Slone and Tom Peterson in 1987 in an attempt to revive Madison's declining Schenk-Atwood neighborhood. The theater has hosted almost 3,000 shows and events including rock concerts, films, plays, dance recitals, broadcasts, political rallies, children's programming, and community events. Today the Barrymore is owned by the Schenk-Atwood Revitalization Association with Steve Sperling as general manager. It is an independent, community-based theater, owned by a nonprofit corporation. History Eastwood Theater (1929‚Äì1967) The building of a large east side theater was first announced in January 1924 after the purchase of the Gottlieb Maisch property at 2090 Atwood Avenue. The site had been the location of eastside fall festivals since 1922. The project was initiated in part by E. M. Michalson, who owned the Palace Theater on nearby Winnebago St. Promising a stage for local groups to use, the theater gained the support of members of the East Side Business Men's Association, who later formed the Eastwood Theater Company in October 1928. Capitalized at $50,000, the corporation had 125 stockholders with banker Herman J. Loftsgordon as president. Ground was broken by Loftsgordon on April 30, 1929. Designed by architects Frederic J. Klein and H. C. Alford, the exterior octagonal dome was done in an Italian Renaissance style while the auditorium was designed in a Spanish colonial style with tile-roofed arches running along the walls. Twinkling star lights were put in the ceiling and a lighting effect projected clouds passing overhead. The theater had a capacity of 980, with 225 of those seats being in the balcony. Using local contractors, Vogel Brothers Construction saw to the installation of modern innovations in acoustics and fireproofing. The first theater in Wisconsin designed specifically for sound motion pictures, the Eastwood featured a $15,000 Western Electric Vitaphone system. The cost of the entire project neared $250,000. The first manager was A. P. Desormeaux, formerly of the downtown Strand Theater. The Eastwood opened on Friday, December 27, 1929. At the theater's dedication Madison Mayor Albert G. Schmedeman said \\"This building is absolutely essential to the progress of the east side.\\" WIBA radio organist Dave Welton performed on a Kilgen theatre organ \\"opus 4420,\\" size 2/8, before the program, which featured the all- talking Mack Sennett comedy Midnight Daddies. Two nights later the Eastwood held a midnight screening on New Year's Eve. A month later they were hosting a county play competition to a packed house. Despite the Eastwood's initial success in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929, the theater building corporation struggled with debt after the project had gone $40,000 over budget. In 1930 local builders Vogel Brothers took out a $55,000 lien against the theater, taking over the building April 1931. After the resignation of Desormeaux, the Eastwood was leased to a succession of managers over the next 15 years. Desormeaux later said matinees were out of the question for a neighborhood theater like the Eastwood, and that rent was \\"impossible.\\" The Eastwood primarily screened double features of second-run films in addition to special features and live events. In the early 1930s organ recitals were broadcast live daily over WIBA, and the appearances by country music stars popularized on Chicago's WLS radio drew crowds. There were also occasional vaudeville performances, including an appearance by the conjoined Godino Brothers in 1932. Air conditioning was installed in 1938. As World War II loomed, \\"four-minute men\\" gave short speeches between features in favor of war preparedness. In December 1943 defense workers from the nearby Ray-O-Vac and Gisholt Machinery Company plants were the first in the country to see a \\"War Department Report\\" propaganda film designed to tamp down optimism by taking a candid view of the war. The Eastwood was sold in 1946 to Carl Lunenschloss and Walter Brucken, who owned the Avalon Theater in Platteville, WI. In 1948 the theater was remodeled and added to Standard Theaters, a Milwaukee chain that owned 25 other theaters in nine Wisconsin cities. At the same time the Eastwood became the temporary home of Trinity Lutheran Church as their Winnebago Street home was being rebuilt. Sunday, Christmas and Easter services were delivered from the Eastwood stage for over three years. The theater also experienced episodes of juvenile deliquency, with an Eastwood parking attendant being awarded \\"special police powers\\" to deal with \\"difficulties\\" in the theater's rear parking lot. Gisholt Machinery workers held union votes at the theater, and the Madison PTA sponsored many children's film series and cartoons. In 1965 the Madison Theater Guild doubted that a civic auditorium planned downtown would be sufficient for their needs, and urged the city to buy the Eastwood Theater for $160,000 and remodel it for $100,000. The Guild later reconsidered. Cinema Theater (1967‚Äì1987) In 1966 Milwaukee theater chain 20th Century Theaters opened the Hilldale Theater on Madison's west side. The Hilldale was quite successful with its screenings of art house and foreign films, and the next year 20th Century sought to repeat that formula with the purchase of the Eastwood Theater in 1967, having leased it previously. Beginning in October 1967 the interior was extensively remodeled, with the octagonal tower sealed off with a drop ceiling and the auditorium gutted of its Spanish tiled porticos. The number of seats was reduced by 200 to 825. The lobby was paneled and carpeted, mod lighting fixtures were installed plus a modern vending stand. Renamed the Cinema Theater, it opened on December 20, 1967 with Madison Mayor Otto Festge in attendance. The theater debuted with an extended run of director John Huston's The Bible. The Cinema showed art house fare like 2001: A Space Odyssey and Midnight Cowboy while also trying to retain special features for children. The theater began to show more mainstream movies in the 1970s, along with second-run films cast off from 20th Century's downtown theaters. The theater also began to show pornographic movies in the early 1970s. Frequently alternating with children's features, the theater later showed X-rated movies exclusively in the early 1980s. Barrymore Theatre (1987‚Äìpresent) By the 1980s, the Schenk-Atwood area had declined since its heyday as one of Madison's first suburban shopping areas. In the 1970s a commuter bypass was installed and shopping malls opened on the outskirts of the city. Many Schenk's Corners stores had closed, and crime was on the upswing. The Cinema Theater itself was held up in 1982. In 1986, Richard Slone and Tom Petersen began fundraising in the community with the goal of purchasing the theater, refurbishing it, and converting it to an arthouse movie theater that would also host live music, theater productions and community events. The X-rated movie titles on the Cinema marquee had hindered any neighborhood redevelopment, and Slone and Petersen were able to find many backers who wanted to revive the area, including Trinity Lutheran Church and the CEO of Madison Kipp Corporation, Reed Coleman. Another early investor was future (now current) general manager of the Barrymore, Steve Sperling. Once the theater (plus its three attached storefronts) was bought for $150,000 and renovated for $100,000 more, the Barrymore Theatre (named after the famous acting family) opened on July 10, 1987. As a one-screen moviehouse that competed with other theaters for Madison's sophisticated film- goers, the Barrymore began losing money immediately, and soon converted to a $2 budget cinema. As a music venue, however, it began to find its audience with a lineup of diverse acts, including rock, folk, world beat and women's music acts. In 1988 the theater acquired a license to sell beer and wine, and a new restaurant tenant opened in the theater's corner storefront the next year. Petersen having left the enterprise, Slone struggled to pay the bills while running a money-losing business. In order to meet a crucial bank payment, the theater launched a successful \\"Give a Buck\\" campaign in 1990, but the debt still remained. Yet the goal of reviving the neighborhood was starting to succeed with the opening of new restaurants and bars. In 1992 the theater was bought by the nonprofit Schenk Atwood Revitalization Association, a group formed in 1979 as an offshoot of the East Side Businessman's Association. The new Barrymore board adopted a practice of no longer screening feature films. The theater also stopped bidding against local promoters for touring acts and instead concentrated on renting the house to others. They also hired a new general manager, Sherri Wilder, who had previously been house manager. With the 800-seat auditorium being the right size for many of the bands touring at the time, the Barrymore began to turn a profit for the first time. With the departure of Wilder in 1996, Steve Sperling was hired as general manager.

Biography Family background and education He was the youngest of three sons born to The Reverend Reynell Wreford Hay, rector of Garsdon and Lea in Wiltshire, and his wife Margaret Alice (n√©e Bolton). His grandfather William Hay was a merchant and ship owner from Bishopwearmouth, while his uncle, William Delisle Hay, was a novelist and mycologist. Hay was educated at Dean Close School, Cheltenham, and at Blundell's School, Tiverton, and was preparing to enrol at Oxford University when the war broke out. World War I After serving as a cadet in the Officers' Training Corps, on 27 January 1915 Hay was commissioned as a second lieutenant (on probation) in the 3rd Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment, alongside his brothers Hugh Allport Hay (1889‚Äì1965) and Guy Baldwin Hay (1890‚Äì1951). He was confirmed in his rank on 19 November, and received orders sending him into the front lines in July 1915, but a motor-cycling accident delayed his departure until February 1916. He served in the trenches until August, when he was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps. Hay returned to England to train as a pilot, and was appointed a flying officer on 28 March 1917. He returned to France in April 1917, and joined No. 48 Squadron, the first to be equipped with the Bristol F.2 Fighter.Shores et.al. (1990), p.189. Hay began his victory string during Bloody April, taking a share with Fred Holliday, Anthony Wall, Ernest Moore, and William Winkler in the shooting down of an Albatros D.III over Vimy on the 23rd, and another over Cagnicourt the following day. On 27 April he shared in the destruction of a reconnaissance aircraft over Vitry with Maurice Benjamin and William Price. Hay had two further solo victories, destroying another D.III over Etaing on 15 June, and driving down a fourth over Ghistelles on 12 July. His final total was two aircraft destroyed and three driven down out of control. Hay was reported missing in action on 17 July, and it was later reported that he died as a result of wounds while a prisoner of the Germans the same day. He had been awarded the Military Cross in June, which was gazetted posthumously on 24 July. His citation read: :Lieutenant Roger Bolton Hay, West Yorkshire Regiment, Special Reserve and Royal Flying Corps. ::For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. On several occasions he has shown the utmost courage and dash in attacking and dispersing hostile aircraft in superior numbers. His willingness to undertake the most hazardous duties has at all times set a fine example to other pilots and observers of his squadron. Hay is buried in the New Communal Cemetery at Oostende, Belgium.

Skycycle released a self-produced demo tape named Siren in 1997, and after playing a show in the L.A.-based club The Dragonfly on Halloween night that year, MCA Records A&R; executive Tom Sarig offered them a record deal, leading up to the issuing of their six-song debut EP Breathing Water in January 1998. The band insisted on Ken Andrews to be the record producer, recorder and mixer, for being \\"the perfect guy to put in just that special touch\\". In the same year, Skycycle performed and produced the songs \\"The Ghost Is Here\\" and \\"It's Terror Time Again\\" for the Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island soundtrack.  Ones and Zeros and the Napster trial  Skycycle continued to record a full- length album named Ones and Zeros in 1998, which was mixed and produced by Tim Palmer and contained several songs Isaacs wrote touring in the rock opera Tommy as part of his \\"pop opera\\" Strawberry. According to Isaacs, \\"The title and overall concept of Ones and Zeros refers to the future of society via the information superhighway and the way that we're able to take the wealth of the world's knowledge ‚Äì history, science, entertainment, art and commerce ‚Äì and reduce everything down to ones and zeros.\\" After finishing recording the twelve tracks in January 1999, the band was pressured by MCA to reformat the album and to rerecord certain tracks before the album would be released, which the band considered \\"substantial and unwanted input from the recording label\\". The changes were ready by July 1999 and the album was initially scheduled for release on August 21, 1999, while the song \\"Last Girl on Earth\\" was released as a single and received substantial radio airplay. MCA postponed the release of Ones and Zeros for several reasons, including \\"that the Christmas season was a better season for established artists\\". Skycycle's belief \\"that the quickly increasing popularity of the Internet could make MP3 a viable and effective promotional tool\\", combined with the growing impatience of the fans due to the many delays, led to the band releasing several songs as free MP3s on their website, which was still rarely done in that time. Although the release and distribution of MP3s were not covered in their contract, Isaacs was told \\"that the presence of MP3s on our site was 'upsetting' MCA executives [and] that this order came from the highest regions of the corporate structure at MCA and Universal, which believed that any support for the MP3 format was unacceptable.\\" Although they took down the MP3s, Skycycle were dropped from MCA on January 26, 2000 and Ones and Zeros was never released. On July 26, 2000, Isaacs testified in the A&M;/Leiber vs. Napster lawsuit, using the case of Skycycle as an example of \\"what we, and hundreds of other bands, have been through with the antiquated business model of the major label\\", and showing that it is possible to generate interest for a band by allowing people to listen to their music through media such as Napster. Isaacs illustrated their struggles with how the record label's advance payments for recording costs were recoupable by contract, meaning that the record company would recoup its investment before the band would receive money. As Skycycle were dismissed but never fully released from their contracts, MCA could demand payment of its recoupable expenses even if Skycycle were signed to another label. Due to their contract's restrictions, the band considered self-publishing the album, but ultimately decided to give away Ones and Zeros in full as free download from their website, showing their early support of free trading of music as a promotional activity. Skycycle additionally became part of Napster's new artists‚Äô program in early May 2000.  Later years  Drummer Rob Brown left the band as he pursued a career in jazz music. He was replaced with Chris Cano in March 2000. Skycycle continued to play and write music for about a year, and among others recorded an alternate version of the song \\"Antebellum\\", which was included on the 2000 compilation album Happy Meals Vol. 2: The Perfect Marriage. They disbanded in September 2000, and held one final reunion show on October 22, 2002. In 2004, Steve Isaacs formed the supergroup The Panic Channel together with several Jane's Addiction members. They released the album (ONe) in 2006, but went on an indefinite hiatus indefinently.

It is the third installment in the NBA 2K series of video games and it was developed by Visual Concepts and published by Sega Sports. It was released on October 24https://segaretro.org/NBA_2K2, 2001 on the Dreamcast and later ported to the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and the Xbox in 2002 after Sega discontinued the Dreamcast. NBA 2K2 featured more street courts such as Mosswood, Fonde Rec Center, Venice Beach, etc. The game still featured the old street courts like in the previous game NBA 2K1. It was the first NBA 2K game to be released multi-platform on the series, and also the last to be on the Dreamcast. The cover athlete is Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia 76ers. It is also one of the few games to cross all the 6th generation platforms, alongside Puyo Pop Fever and Capcom vs. SNK 2. The game along with the rest of the 2K titles on the Dreamcast have had their online components revived and are completely playable online. https://dreamcastlive.net/games/ Overview NBA 2K2 now offers a number of new features designed to improve upon Sega Sports' basketball franchise, which began on the Dreamcast in 1999. In addition to the NBA teams, players, and stadiums from the 2001‚Äì02 season, the game includes five legends teams starring legends such as Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Julius Erving, Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, and Bill Russell. Each player's abilities reflect those based on the 2001‚Äì02 season, so the location of shots is important depending on the athlete. Moves such as crossover dribbles, pump fakes, speed bursts, and both icon and directional passing allow players multiple options to move the ball down the court. While approaching the net, players can press a single button to pass to the man closest to the basket or use their athlete's size advantage to back down a defender. Players can also call for a pick with a press of the button, pass out of a shot, or select one of four in- game offensive plays from a roster of 16. Defensive moves include steals, a combination block and jump button, as well as the ability to face up a ball handler, double-team a star player, commit an intentional foul, and call one of seven defensive sets such as Man-to-Man or Half-Court Trap. Before playing a game, adjustments can be made for game speed, quarter length, and difficulty. In-game features include instant replay and a choice of five different camera angles. User statistics as well as season and franchise progress can be saved after each game. Features Modes of play include Exhibition, an adjustable Season (from 14 to 82 games), Practice, Tourney, Playoffs, Fantasy, where players can create a custom tournament or league after drafting, and Franchise, which involves signing free agents, cutting players, making trades, and scouting for new talent before embarking on consecutive seasons. Players can also edit or create a team using ten custom logos as well as design their own star athlete from scratch. Differences from Dreamcast There are differences from Dreamcast and the other three consoles PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Nintendo GameCube. The Dreamcast version is similar to the previous game NBA 2K1. The PlayStation 2 version has differences from the Dreamcast version. On the PlayStation 2, the intro featured R.O.C. the rapper on the intro, where Hip-Hop soloist LUNATIC was featured on the Dreamcast version. On the Dreamcast version, choosing a team on Exhibition, they show \\"Home\\" and \\"Away\\" on the screen. The PlayStation 2 version did not show these on the screen. The loading screen on the game had a background music showing the title and the basketball on the PS2 version, but with the Dreamcast however, the loading had it very similar to NBA 2K1 with the background music with a crowd cheering in the ending. The starting of the game with the Dreamcast version shows \\"Today's Game\\" (like in the previous 2K games) whatever team you chose shows it there but with PS2 it does not show this feature. The PS2 version only shows just the team and the logo. While playing Street courses (on the PS2 version) shows a background music on the game while playing. On the Dreamcast version did not have BGM's but have SFX sounds on the background. On the PS2 version, playing the practice mode shows a stadium like in \\"Exhibition\\" mode. But on the Dreamcast version, have a practice basketball gym just like in the previous NBA 2K games. Reception The game received \\"universal acclaim\\" on all platforms except the PlayStation 2 version, which received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

It is not an annual award; rather, the Commissioner presents it at his discretion. The trophy is a gold baseball sitting atop a cylindrical silver base, created by Tiffany & Co. The award has been presented fourteen times by Commissioner Bud Selig: eleven times to players, once to a team, and twice to a non-player. Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa were the first to receive the award for their parts in the 1998 MLB home run record chase. The most recent recipient is Derek Jeter (2014), who was honored in the final year of his career for being \\"one of the most accomplished shortstops of all-time\\". The 2001 Seattle Mariners won the award as a team for posting a 116‚Äì46 record one season after losing Alex Rodriguez to the Texas Rangers. Roberto Clemente, the 2006 awardee, is the only player to receive the award posthumously; his award was accepted by his wife, Vera. Three years after McGwire and Sosa were honored, Cal Ripken, Jr. and Tony Gwynn, both of whom retired after the 2001 season, received the award and were honored at the 2001 MLB All-Star Game; Ripken was elected to the American League All-Star team as a starter at third base, while Gwynn was later added as an honorary member of the National League team. During the first inning of the game, Rodriguez, who had been elected the starter at shortstop‚Äîthe position at which Ripken played for most of his career‚Äîswitched positions with Ripken for the first inning of the game as a tribute. Including the presentation of the award to the Mariners following the season, the 2001 season's three awards are the most presented in a single year. Barry Bonds received the award in 2002, becoming the third player so honored for breaking the single-season home run record. Bonds was the first of two players to receive the award that season, along with Rickey Henderson. The award was given in each year from 2004 until 2007: Roger Clemens was honored during the 2004 All-Star Game, and Ichiro Suzuki was presented with the award for breaking the single-season hits record in 2005. Rachel Robinson was honored in 2007, receiving the award for establishing the Jackie Robinson Foundation. She was the first woman and the first non-player to be thus honored.

In World War I he became a flying ace, and spent most of World War II as a prisoner of the Japanese. World War I Born in Hunstanton, Norfolk, Herring enlisted into the 16th (County of London) Battalion (Queen's Westminster Rifles), The London Regiment, part of the Territorial Force, before the outbreak of the war, and was sent to France in November 1914 to fight on the Western Front. On 1 March 1917 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 20th Battalion, London Regiment, and then transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in August, where he trained as an observer/gunner before being assigned to 48 Squadron, flying the Bristol F.2 Fighter, on 20 November 1917. Between January and March 1918 Herring shot down five enemy aircraft: *On 25 January Herring and his pilot Lieutenant Hugh William Elliott, were reconnoitring enemy positions over Sequehart when they were attacked by Leutnant Heinrich Kroll, Staffelf√ºhrer of Jasta 24, in an Albatros D.III. Herring fired several machine gun bursts, until Kroll span away, and was forced to crash-land his damaged aircraft behind the German front lines. * On 28 January while over Beaurevoir on another reconnaissance mission, Herring and his pilot 2nd Lieutenant Frank Cecil Ransley, attacked a formation of four enemy aircraft, and saw one, a Rumpler, spin out of control. * On 9 February, with 2nd Lieutenant Herbert Henry Hartley, he claimed an Albatros D.V shot down over Guise. * On 16 March 1918, over Bellicourt-Bellenglise with Lieutenant P. Burrows, he claimed another D.V and a DFW C. On 26 March Herring was severely wounded during a dogfight, and returned to England on 4 April. On 23 January 1919 he was injured again in a flying accident. As a result of his injuries Herring finally relinquished his commission on 15 July 1919. World War II Herring was commissioned as a pilot officer in the General Duties Branch of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve on 21 December 1941 and was stationed in the Far East. On 1 February 1942, during the Malayan Campaign, he was granted an Immediate Emergency Commission as a second lieutenant on the General List of the British Army, relinquishing his RAF commission, to serve as a company commander, with the rank of captain in Dalforce, the Chinese Anti-Japanese Volunteer Battalion. He was captured by the Japanese at the fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942. He was promoted to flying officer on 1 October 1942, but this was cancelled on 28 May 1943. While a prisoner in Changi he was promoted to the rank of major by Lieutenant Colonel Edward Barclay Holmes, commander of British and Australian troops in Changi. He was finally released after the Japanese surrender in August 1945. Awards On 22 June 1918 Herring was awarded the Military Cross. His citation read: :2nd Lt. Robert Samuel Herring, London Regiment and RFC. :For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He carried out a valuable reconnaissance under heavy fire from the ground, obtaining valuable information and engaging enemy troops with machine-gun fire with good effect. On another occasion, while on a photographic reconnaissance he was attacked by six enemy triplanes. He drove them all off after a hard fight and returned with his photographs. He has driven down four enemy machines out of control and has set a splendid example of determination and resource.

They are only a single file track in width and not suitable for walkers or persons walking side by side. Prairie marsh trail is a circular trail from just beyond the midpoint of the accessible trail back to the end of the accessible trail. Savanna trail is circular trail from the eastern edge of the Prairie marsh trail, returning to the same point on the marsh trail. Location The prairie is located on West Main Street, Griffith, Indiana. The area is accessible from a parking lot on Main Street (E 53rd St) just east of Kennedy Avenue. A trail, leads off through the prairie to the east. Wildlife and plants Rare habitats exist in the Hoosier Prairie Preserve, including the dry black oak barrens, wetland pools, and moist prairies. The areas support over 350 native plants. Of these, 43 are uncommon or rarely seen within Indiana. These rare plants include the white wild indigo, prairie parsley, Indian paintbrush, rose pogonia and the tall Indian grass. Some unusual creatures seen in the prairie include the red-headed woodpecker, sedge wrens and the brown butterfly. Among the prairie \\"potholes', which hold water most of the year, there will be reptiles and amphibians. Restoration The field where the parking lot is located along Main Street, south and west towards Kennedy Avenue is an old wheat field. As late at 1970, it was planted in of winter wheat. It was purchased as a buffer for the prairie. With little assistance, the field has begun to revert to native prairie. Prairie maintenance is dependent upon a natural regime of fire, which has been suppressed in this urban area. Therefore, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources has assisted the regeneration by mechanically removing trees, woody brush and implementing 'prescribed fires'. Evidence of the success of the restoration can be seen in the increase in prairie indicator plants and birds: *Flora (Plants) **Big bluestem **Tall coreopsis **Goldenrod **Asters *Fauna (specifically birds) **Meadowlarks **Sparrows **Goldfinch **Bobolink Prairie marsh trail The Prairie Marsh trail is a loop trail that passes through two habitats, a tallgrass prairie and a marsh. This area is considered a virgin prairie as it has never been tilled or grazed. Both the prairie and the marsh are dependent upon fire to maintain their openness and diversity of plant life. The prairie continues to exist because the plants have adapted to fire by developing roots structures that survive underground as the fire sweeps across the surface removing woody and non-prairie plants. The specialized root structures include rhizomes, bulbs, corms, and tubers. Prairie plants send their roots down a few inches to as much as .

This habitat mimics the pine savannas in the Northern Woods allowing brackens and sweetferns to thrive amid the prairie vegetation. This is an Oak Savanna with widely spaced trees, predominately oaks surrounded by an understory of wildflowers and grasses. These savannas can survive through droughts because the oaks and the prairie plants have taproots that reach down to the water table.

The situation spanned most of the grain-producing regions of the country: Ukraine, Moldova and parts of central Russia. The conditions were caused by drought, the effects of which were exacerbated by the devastation caused by World War II. The grain harvest in 1946 totaled 39.6 million tons ‚Äì barely 40% of the yield in 1940. With the war, there was a significant decrease in the number of able-bodied men in the rural population, retreating to 1931 levels. There was a shortage of agricultural machinery and horses. The Soviet government with its grain reserves provided relief to rural areas and appealed to the United Nations for relief. Assistance also came from the Ukrainian (mainly Ruthenian) diaspora and Russians from eastern Ukraine and from North America, which minimized mortality.http://ecsocman.hse.ru/data/579/695/1217/004.POPOV.pdfhttp://www.demoscope.ru/weekly/2004/0173/analit06.php While the cause of the famine is generally attributed to the drought in combination with the existing infrastructural and economic damage of the war, some historians have criticized the government's response as being not as effective as it could have been.Michael Ellman , The 1947 Soviet Famine and the Entitlement Approach to Famines Cambridge Journal of Economics 24 (2000): 603‚Äì630. For example, during the crisis, the USSR continued with export obligations under the fourth five-year plan, with the majority of it going to the Soviet zone of occupied Germany, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia to consolidate the new Eastern Bloc.Hanson, P. 2003: The rise and fall of the Soviet economy: An economic history of the USSR from 1945. Pearson Education Limited: London. Partly as a result of this famine, unlike many countries in Europe and North America, the Soviet Union did not experience a post-war baby boom. Prompted by the drought and famine of 1946‚Äì47, the so-called \\"Great Plan for the Transformation of Nature\\" was put forth which consisted of a number of ambitious projects in land improvement. In Moldova Between 1946 and 1947, there were a minimum of 115,000Charles King, The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture, Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 2000. . p. 96 to over 300,000 recorded deaths linked to starvation, especially in Transnistria. At the same time according to Moldova SocialistƒÉ newsletter from 28 January 1947, the Moldavian SSR surpassed planned productions of butter (by 33.2%), sunflower oil (by 39.5%), meat products (by 32.5%), canned food (by 101.9%). 34 cases of cannibalism were discovered by authorities during the 1946‚Äì47, but many others remained undiscovered. Even Khrushchev, in his 1970 memoir Khrushchev Remembers, gives first and second-hand accounts of cannibalism among starving Ruthenians/Ukrainians. In Ukraine From 1938 to 1949 Nikita Khrushchev was the head of the Communist Party of Ukraine (CP[b]U), which means that he played the role of a governor for Joseph Stalin in Moscow, who was head of state of the Soviet Union and who held massive sway over domestic policy. During a brief period between February and December 1947, Lazar Kaganovich stood in for Khrushchev due to what was claimed to be an illness. Khrushchev had been a long time close associate of Lazar Kaganovich who was the head of the CP(b)U from 1925 to 1928. During that time Kaganovich had been responsible for implementing collectivization of agriculture in Ukraine and was involved with the aggressive repression of the so-called kulaks (Russian term) and kurkuli (Ukrainian term) ‚Äì who were private farmers who were not members of collective farms that were labelled by the communists as being wealthy. They were deemed exploiters of the people for hiring labour, which became a monopoly right claimed by the communist state. By bringing in Kaganovich in 1947 it is an indication that Stalin wanted someone who was a hardliner against the kurkuli that was already experienced in collectivization and repressive measures against farmers that were being imposed at the time and was willing to implement them ruthlessly. This makes Stalin, Khrushchev, and Kaganovich the main communist leaders responsible for the famine in Ukraine in 1946‚Äì47. During the 1920s in Ukraine Khrushchev had been rapidly promoted by Kaganovich through various senior posts and had been his prot√©g√©. In 1929, Khrushchev moved to Moscow to continue his education, which he never completed. After the end of Kaganovich's first governorship of Ukraine in 1928, he was recalled to Moscow and replaced by Stanislav Kosior. Khrushchev later replaced Kosior as head of the CP(b)U and governor of Ukraine in 1938. Kaganovich and Kosior are considered to be the key people responsible for implementing the policies that led to the earlier Holodomor famine- genocide in Ukraine, which was the most severe in 1932‚Äì33. As the absolute dictator at the time, Joseph Stalin held ultimate responsibility, since he set the overall policy for the Soviet Union and his governors had to carry out his orders in Ukraine. Joseph Stalin admitted to Winston Churchill in Yalta that his collectivization policies during that period cost the lives of 10 million people over 4 years. He would have not exaggerated such a figure, since the official Soviet policy was to conceal and downplay those issues. Kosior was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1935 for \\"remarkable success in the field of agriculture.\\"Guide to the history of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union 1898 ‚Äì 1991. knowbysight.info After WW2 when Soviet rule extended to western Ukraine the similar collectivization policies which had earlier taken place in Ukraine and Russia during the 1920s and 1930s were imposed there as well. Similar to eastern Ukraine during collectivization, there was strong resistance to those and other Soviet policies from the local population which was largely suppressed by 1952. In Ukraine and Russia collectivization coincided with repression and mass famines due to excessive grain requisitions, which is recognized as the main direct policy that caused the famines. That was a policy which was developed originally by Alexander Tsiurupa in 1917‚Äì18, which became a standard repressive policy of using food as a weapon in many communist countries afterward associated with collectivization and mass famines. Despite poor harvests due to drought, in 1946 Khrushchev set excessive grain collection quotas for Ukraine which resulted in a massive famine.–í–µ—Å–µ–ª–æ–≤–∞, –û.–ú., –ú–∞—Ä–æ—á–∫–æ, –í.–Ü., –ú–æ–≤—á–∞–Ω, –û.–ú. –ì–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–º–æ—Ä–∏ –≤ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ : 1921-23, 1932-33, 1946-47. –ó–ª–æ—á–∏–Ω–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥—É.- –î—Ä–æ–≥–æ–±–∏—á : –í–∏–¥–∞–≤–Ω–∏—á–∞ —Ñ—ñ—Ä–º–∞ ¬´–í—ñ–¥—Ä–æ–¥–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—è¬ª, 2008. - 273 —Å.. - –°. 274-286 (—Ä–µ–∫–æ–º–µ–Ω. –ª—ñ—Ç–µ—Ä.).

Collective farms were required to hand over 52% of their harvests to the communist government.Tompson, William J. (1995), Khrushchev: A Political Life, St. Martin's Press, Although it has been claimed that he tried to reduce the quotas in late 1946, this was not allowed by Stalin. Khrushchev was closely associated with Kaganovich who along with Kosior were found by a court in Kiyiv in 2010 to have been the some of the main persons responsible for the Holodomor of 1932‚Äì33. Since Kaganovich was brought in to replace Khrushchev temporarily in 1947 as communist governor in Ukraine, it strongly suggests that the famine of 1946‚Äì47 was also a deliberate policy like the previous famine in 1932‚Äì33 which Khrushchev would have certainly known about since he had been part of leadership of the CP(b)U and of the Soviet Union. Stalin who was ultimately responsible for the famine of 1946‚Äì1947 was well-aware that excessive grain requisitions would cause a mass famine, similar to what he had deliberately done in 1932‚Äì33. In the spring of 1946 Khrushchev had told Stalin about the famine. Stalin who glorified himself with the title of \\"father of all peoples\\" called it a lie and did not allow it to be officially recognized or remedied, similar to the famine of 1932‚Äì33. This was in contrast to the first major Soviet famine of 1921‚Äì23 which was officially recognized and several foreign relief missions were allowed. The official death toll was 5 million persons for that famine, which was recognized in the Volga Basin. The more severe famine at the time in southern Ukraine and in the Don region was not recognized and was still subject to continued grain requisitions.Yakovlev, Alexander, N. (2002) A Century of Violence in Soviet Russia. New Haven and London: Yale University Press. The 1946‚Äì47 famine in Ukraine affected most of the country except for areas in a few western provinces where the resistance to the forced food requisitions helped to save the people from starvation. Information about the famine in 1946‚Äì47 was similarly concealed by the Soviet government as was the famine in 1932‚Äì33. Until 1988, it was forbidden for academics in the Soviet Union to research those issues.–í–µ—Å–µ–ª–æ–≤–∞, –û.–ú., –ú–∞—Ä–æ—á–∫–æ,–í.–Ü., –ú–æ–≤—á–∞–Ω,–û.–ú. –ì–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–º–æ—Ä–∏ –≤ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ : 1921-23, 1932-33, 1946-47. –ó–ª–æ—á–∏–Ω–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥—É.- –î—Ä–æ–≥–æ–±–∏—á : –í–∏–¥–∞–≤–Ω–∏—á–∞ —Ñ—ñ—Ä–º–∞ ¬´–í—ñ–¥—Ä–æ–¥–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—è¬ª, 2008. - 273 —Å.. - C.178, - C.256 In the post WW2 famine of 1946-47 there were approximately 400,000‚Äì500,000 children and teenagers that died, who made up a third of the victims.–í–µ—Å–µ–ª–æ–≤–∞, –û.–ú., –ú–∞—Ä–æ—á–∫–æ,–í.–Ü., –ú–æ–≤—á–∞–Ω, –û.–ú. –ì–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–º–æ—Ä–∏ –≤ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ : 1921-23, 1932-33, 1946-47. –ó–ª–æ—á–∏–Ω–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥—É.- –î—Ä–æ–≥–æ–±–∏—á : –í–∏–¥–∞–≤–Ω–∏—á–∞ —Ñ—ñ—Ä–º–∞ ¬´–í—ñ–¥—Ä–æ–¥–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—è¬ª, 2008. - 273 —Å.. - C.247 There were many recorded cases of cannibalism. It also resulted in a significant increase in various types of illnesses because of a lack of food. As in the 1930s, there were groups of people who would be sent around to collect dead bodies that were put into mass graves. Similarly to 1932‚Äì33, it was mostly a rural famine. Soviet policies such as unrealistic food production and excessive requisition quotas, forced grain collections and confiscations, low or no pay for collective farm workers and excessive taxes pushed the rural population to famine. The amount of food that was confiscated and taken out of Ukraine would have been enough to feed the population and avoid the famine. Although there was a drought and a reduced harvest, it was an artificial famine caused by the communist government in Ukraine due to its policies. Traditionally farmers were used to periodic droughts and set aside reserves for such times. Once the communist government collectivized agriculture, the land and harvest belonged to it and farmers were reduced to the status of being employees working on collective farms and were unable to set aside reserves from what they produced. Between 1946 and 48 in the Soviet Union an estimated 1 million tons of grain was wasted and spoiled in storage which could have also been used instead for famine relief and saved many lives. During the famine although it was not the majority of the harvest, considerable amounts of grain were still exported abroad. In most places, the post WW2 famine in Ukraine started in 1945 with the imposition of excessive grain collection policies by the Soviets. It became more severe during 1946 and peaked in the winter and spring of 1947. By the fall of 1947 it began to subside, but continued in many areas until the late 1940s. There was still malnutrition and inadequate food in the early 1950s. It affected all of Ukraine, but the mortality was most severe in the southern parts of the country. The famine was severe in central Ukraine as well. It was not as severe in western Ukraine due to a better harvest there and the fact that collectivization was only being implemented there, which had not deprived families of an independent food production source. This made full confiscation of food more difficult for the Soviet authorities because of many more point sources of food availability and production than in a collective farm system where they had much more control. Because many parts of western Ukraine are a forested mountainous region and a high level of active resistance where the geography favoured them, the population was able to hide away some food and prevent it from being taken away, which allowed more people to survive and avoid starvation. In western Ukraine the population suffered proportionally more from repression than from famine during those years compared to other parts of the country. Between 1945 and 1953 there were severe repressions in Ukraine including mass arrests of tens of thousands of people and mass deportations. This included the deportation into exile of an estimated 500,000 people from western Ukraine between 1946 and 1949.–í–µ—Å–µ–ª–æ–≤–∞, –û.–ú., –ú–∞—Ä–æ—á–∫–æ, –í.–Ü., –ú–æ–≤—á–∞–Ω, –û.–ú. –ì–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–º–æ—Ä–∏ –≤ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ: 1921-23, 1932-33, 1946-47. –ó–ª–æ—á–∏–Ω–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥—É.- –î—Ä–æ–≥–æ–±–∏—á : –í–∏–¥–∞–≤–Ω–∏—á–∞ —Ñ—ñ—Ä–º–∞ ¬´–í—ñ–¥—Ä–æ–¥–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—è¬ª, 2008. - 273 —Å.. - C.264-267 In Russia In the summer of 1946 there was a famine in the provinces of Rostov, Voronezh, Orel, Kursk and Tambov which was made worse by a poor harvest caused by drought and excessively high grain collection targets. Those were based on quotas set on too high production expectations which Stalin was unwilling to reduce in many areas. This was also a repetition of the too-high quotas and excessive grain collections which led to the 1932‚Äì33 Holodomor famine-genocide which is recognized as having been a deliberate policy. The autumn and winter of 1946‚Äì47 was the worst part of the famine, in which at least 500,000 persons perished.Courtois, S., Werth, N. ,Pann√©, J. ,Paczkowski, A., Bartosek,K., Margolin, J. (1999) The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression. Cambridge and London: Harvard University Press. p. 233 Two decrees were passed on June 5, 1947 which were similar to the law of August 7, 1932 for the protection of state property, which in Ukraine was known as the \\"Law of Five Spikelets\\" (Ears of Wheat) and in Russia the \\"Law of Three Spikelets\\", or simply the \\"Law of Spikelets.\\" The 1947 law was not as strict as the 1932 law which included death sentences and much lengthier prison sentences for the same offenses, including for very minor thefts. The 1947 law was still very strict and made severe punishments for anyone who attacked state property such as a collective farm. It is understandable that the people would be upset with collective farms and the state which monopolized food production during the time of a famine, when the very food that they had produced was being taken away from the starving people who were dying as a result. That was precisely why the law was passed to help to push through those repressive policies and punish resistance which they knew would take place. According to the 1947 decrees attacks on state property were punishable by 5 to 25 years in prison. For even very small thefts of a few ears of wheat by starving people the punishment was up to 1 year in prison, which gave the law its name from the people. For stealing a few kilograms of grain a person could have been sent to 8 to 10 years in the gulag labour camps. Someone knowing of theft or preparations of theft who did not report it to the authorities could have been sentenced from 1 to 3 years in prison.Courtois, S., Werth,N., Pann√©,J., Paczkowski,A., Bartosek,K.,Margolin,J.(1999) The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression.

History Early Years: 1992-1997 In the spring of 1992, three musicians Tommy Becker, Louis Caverly, and Derric Oliver attending the University of the Pacific in Stockton, CA formed the band, Phacehead, drawing people toward a new, positive sound. They began exploring many of the musical and lyrical ideas that would later become the basis of their Adventure Pop sound. Louis and Derric both grew up in San Diego enduring formal classical training while also absorbing a world of musical styles and genres from J.S. Bach to Rock Music. Despite having both grown up in the same town, they didn't meet until one fateful day hanging out in a garage on Rosemarie Lane (right off University of Pacific campus) playing music with members of the Archania house band. In 1993 they recorded their first studio demo (produced by George Frangadakis) of songs written by Tommy Becker. In spring of 1994, after graduating from University of Pacific, the band relocated to San Francisco, California and started recording and playing out in clubs such as The Last Day Saloon on Clement Street, San Francisco In 1996, the band produced a self-titled EP (at Found Sound in South San Francisco) and officially changed their name to The Formers. The session captured the interest of several San Francisco club promoters and received airplay on college radio station KEXP in Berkeley, California. In the fall of 1997, the band decided that time off was necessary for them to individually refine their sound and rediscover sanity, or in some cases, insanity. This turned out to be a five-year break. Rediscovered: 2002-2004 In the summer of 2002, the original three members Tommy Becker, Louis Caverly and Derric Oliver reunited and resumed rehearsing and recording new material while assembling local musicians for live performances. Louis Caverly had moved back from London, UK in early 2002. Derric Oliver had been working with Pro-Tools and was writing and recording under the name Holiday. Prior to 2002 they ran into each other a couple of times and would trade new recordings. Louis Caverly quotes, \\"we would literally run into each other in airports and Derric would hand me his latest demo as we were running to catch our respective flights, it was surreal. The demos sounded hot, I knew there was something there.\\" The band name again changed to Holiday and the Adventure Pop Collective, marrying the idea of the great Billie Holiday, taking a holiday, the Adventure Pop sound, and the influence of everyone that had left their mark on the band, respectively, the collective. GOOD (album) Holiday and the Adventure Pop Collective, released early June 2003, was quickly followed by Start All Over again (EP), Wide Open (EP) and Potential is a Dangerous Thing (EP), all released before the end of 2003. Early reviews were positive and the band started to get noticed after being reviewed by highly acclaimed American music critic Dave Marsh. He referred to their sound as \\"instantly memorable music with an ultimately unified sound.\\" Commercial Releases: 2004-current Become (album) Holiday and the Adventure Pop Collective was recorded October 2004 with Ben Moore at Big Fish studios in their home base of Encinitas, California. Striving for an organic, live sound, the album was recorded and mixed in 21 days on 24-track analog tape.

One-by- one the band dwindled to three, morphing the longest running, consistently solidified line-up featuring Derric Oliver singing and playing guitar and horns, Louis Caverly singing and playing fiddle and keys, and Michael Taylor Hahn playing the drums. They played more than 200 shows from 2005-2007 before Hahn departed the band late in 2007. On March 6, 2008, Dallas, TX, day two of Holiday and the Adventure Pop Collective‚Äôs first U.S. tour (supporting Atlantic Records‚Äô Louis XIV (band)), their new drummer went AWOL in the middle of the night, quitting the tour without a word or note of explanation. The trio quickly became a duo facing a choice: quit the tour and go home, or continue without a drummer. The decision to continue took about four seconds, and their second decision took about four more seconds. They officially changed their band name, once and for all, to The Los Dos Bros. They released two new albums in 2008 (recording under the name Holiday and the Adventure Pop Collective but later re-manufactured the albums under the new name The Los Dos Bros), Songs for Feeling Strong (EP) The Los Dos Bros, and Greek Gods in the West (CD + DVD ‚ÄòLive from the Henry Miller Library, Big Sur, CA‚Äô) The Los Dos Bros.

They hoped to gain publicity for it by winning the outstanding prize for the first non-stop Atlantic crossing but a first flight accident made them miss their opportunity. Two were built but none sold as airliners. Design and development Orders for military aircraft ended in 1918 with the First World War and the outlook for manufacturers considering the commercial market was made more gloomy by the large number of war surplus aircraft available. The publicity associated with the first non-stop Atlantic crossing, which came with the additional bonus of the ¬£10,000 prize for the first such flight by a British aircraft on offer by the Daily Mail since before the war, was sought by many companies. Thus in late 1918 and early 1919 the Alliance Aeroplane Company, Boulton & Paul, Fairey Aviation Company, Handley Page, Martinsyde, Short Brothers, Sopwith and Vickers Ltd were preparing competitors. The P.8 Atlantic was Boulton & Paul's entrant and was also intended to be the prototype for an airliner. The Atlantic had some similarity to the earlier Boulton & Paul Bourges and indeed some structural commonality, for the Bourges Mk 1B was cannibalised to produce the first of two Atlantics. Though Boulton & Paul were beginning to think about metal framed aircraft, the Atlantic was traditionally built from wood, albeit with many metal fittings and joints. It was a three-bay twin-engined biplane with wings that were neither staggered nor swept and were of parallel chord, though the lower wing was narrower than the upper. Ailerons were fitted on both wings and as on the Bourges their horn balances projected beyond the wingtips. The two 450 hp (336 kW) Napier Lion water-cooled engines were mounted on top of the lower wings just inside the innermost interplane struts. They were cooled with a retractable radiator mounted under the fuselage between the undercarriage legs. The fin and horn balanced rudder had a near-circular profile, but the tailplane was quite rectangular, carrying unbalanced elevators. The tailplane incidence was adjustable from the cockpit for trim and there was a pair of ancillary fins mounted on the tailplane to hold the aircraft straight when flying on one engine. The fins could be rotated from the cockpit and locked to cope with the asymmetry. The lower part of the fuselage was built on the same four longerons as in the Bourges, giving it a rectangular look, but the upper part was built up with fairings so that the fuselage entirely filled the gap between the wings. Needing no gunner's position, the nose of the Atlantic was rounded off. Above it and in front of the wings the pilot's cockpit was, unusually for its day enclosed with a canopy, giving him an excellent protected view. In the first prototype, the machine intended for the Atlantic crossing attempt, there was a windowed cabin immediately behind the cockpit with positions for a radio operator and navigator, one of whom could also act as relief pilot. Behind them the fuselage was filled with six fuel tanks holding 800 Imperial gallons (3.64 m3)Flight 15 May 1919 p. 634 giving a design range of 3,850 miles (6,195 km). In an emergency the fuel could be dumped in 75 s and the empty tanks would help the aircraft float. Any aircraft fuelled to fly the Atlantic was going to be heavy and undercarriage design was critical, as Martinsyde found to their cost. The Atlantic used a split axle arrangement: on each side the short main leg extended from below the forward and innermost interplane strut. There was a second member back to below the aft interplane strut and an axle from the large single wheel upwards and inwards, hinged to the lower fuselage longeron. Shocks were absorbed by a combination of oleo-pneumatic and bungee elastic components. At 21 ft 0 in (6.40 m) the track was very wide.\\"The Boulton & Paul Commercial Machine\\", Flight 30 October 1919, vol. XI, no. 44, pp. 1416‚Äì1422. Contemporary technical description with photographs and drawings. The Atlantic had several features which fitted it for the crossing attempt. Like the Bourges, it handled well and could be trimmed to fly almost hands off, with only minor rudder nudges to hold direction. It was even possible, with the use of a cockpit lever to lock the elevators and ailerons and at the same time transfer rudder control to the wheel that normally operated the ailerons. Its cruising speed of 116 mph (187 km/h) was considerably higher than its competitors. After using two hours worth of fuel it could maintain height on one engine alone, or equivalently hold altitude on half power with two engines. There was great pressure on all teams in early 1919 and the company's management had assembled a large group to observe the first flight which probably led to the disastrous first flight of the Atlantic in April. The Boulton & Paul test pilot Frank Courtney had run up each engine to full power, but separately, not together. Just after take-off one engine failed and the Atlantic crashed with heavy damage though happily leaving Courtney unharmed. It turned out that there was a fuel fault which only acted when full flow to both engines was required. Work on a second Atlantic began using what they could of the second Bourges which had crashed and Boulton & Paul immediately began to adapt it for the crossing. Before they could complete it, John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown had made the first non-stop Atlantic crossing in their Vickers Vimy on 14‚Äì15 June 1919 and Boulton & Paul abandoned their preparations.Brew, Boulton Paul Aircraft Tempus Publishing 2001 p 29 The company had always seen the second Atlantic as a promising airliner prototype and returned to this project. It first flew on 10 May 1920, bearing the civil registration G-EAPE. It was never fitted out as an airliner, Boulton & Paul realising that different companies might want different layouts, but a separate fuselage mock-up was built and artists' impressions had been released earlier.Flight 17 April 1919 p. 504 Knowing that some pilots preferred open cockpits, Boulton & Paul offered a choice of canopy or simple windscreen. The \\"Commercial\\" as it was sometimes known had windowed cabins for three in front of the wing and another for four behind. The cabins had two separate external doors. In between and below the wing the 100 Imperial gallons (0.45 m3) fuel tank was fixed in the upper part of the fuselage, partly to minimise trim changes and partly to allow the engines to be gravity fed. Despite the safety features provided by the two engines and the Atlantic's ability to hold altitude on one, plus its high cruising speed and (non-fuel) disposable load of 1,870 lb (848 kg), economics were against it when competing with the single Lion powered de Havilland DH.18 which carried eight rather than seven passengers. Although 6 were planned, no orders came and no more Atlantics were built.

The surviving structures-- which include the cabin, springhouse, and corn crib-- were once part of a farm that belonged to the Walker Sisters-- five spinster sisters who became local legends due to their adherence to traditional ways of living. The sisters inherited the farm from their father, and after the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was formed in the 1930s, they obtained a lifetime lease. The National Park Service gained control of the property in 1964 when the last Walker sister died. The surviving structures were placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Former Great Smoky Mountains National Park historian Paul Gordon wrote, \\"of all the people who once lived in what is now Great Smoky Mountains National Park, none exhibited better the character of the mountain people than the Walker family.\\" While part of the Walker Cabin was built in the 1840s (this section later became the cabin's kitchen) by an early Little Greenbrier settler, the present cabin is mostly the work of Wiley King (1800-1859) and John Walker (1841-1921), the latter being the father of the Walker Sisters. Walker built the farm's corn crib in the 1870s, and in 1882 he helped build the nearby Little Greenbrier School.Paul Gordon, , 31 July 1973. Retrieved: 2009-09-18. An article about the Walker Sisters appeared in the April 27, 1947 edition of the Saturday Evening Post. Location The Walker Sisters Place is located at the upper (northern) end of Little Greenbrier, a narrow valley carved into the southwestern slope of Cove Mountain by Little Brier Branch. The flat in which the cabin and outbuildings are situated has since become known as Five Sisters Cove. Cove Mountain rises to the north and east, and the southwestern flank of Cove Mountain, known as Little Mountain, rises to the west. The Little Brier Gap Trail connects the area to the Metcalf Bottoms picnic area along Little River Gorge Road to the south, and a gravel maintenance road connects the area to Wears Valley Gap Road (which accesses Wears Valley) to the west. The Cove Mountain Trail connects the area with the Sugarlands Visitor Center opposite Cove Mountain to the east. History Walker Cabin, showing the older section and porch in the foreground, and the newer section rising behind it In the 1820s, much of what is now Little Greenbrier was purchased by John Renfro, although little is known of Renfro. Early Little Greenbrier settler Arthur \\"Brice\\" McFalls, who moved to the area from South Carolina,Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountain Association, 1994), p. 218. bought what is now the Walker Place from Renfro in 1838. McFalls probably built the smaller half of the Walker Cabin shortly thereafter. Wiley King (1800-1859) purchased the land in 1853, and built all but the chimney of the larger, 2-story half of the Walker Cabin. His sons completed the chimney shortly after his death. In 1866, King's daughter, Margaret (1846-1909), married John Walker, a Union Army veteran who had just returned from the Civil War. The Walkers moved into the cabin in 1870, and in subsequent years dismantled the McFalls cabin and reassembled it as a wing of the Walker Cabin for use as a kitchen. Walker also built the cabin's porch during this period. In 1909, Walker deeded the land to five of his daughters-- Margaret (1870-1962), Martha (1877-1951), Nancy (1880-1931), Louisa (1882-1964), and Hettie (1889-1947-- and his youngest son, Giles (Walker's other five children had married and moved away). In 1921, Giles deeded his share of the land to his sisters. While the mountain communities in the surrounding valleys began to modernize to some extent after World War I, the Walker Sisters clung to the old way of life, which emphasized self-reliance. The sisters raised sheep and grew corn and cotton, sometimes plowing their own fields. They made their own clothes from the wool and cotton they had raised, and became well known for their Christmas feasts, which consisted almost wholly of food they had grown themselves.Bonnie Trentham Myers, The Walker Sisters: Spirited Women of the Smokies (Maryville, Tennessee: Myers & Myers Publishing, 2004), pp. 2-10. In 1933, the Great Smoky Mountains Park Commission, charged with purchasing property for the creation of the national park, unsuccessfully tried to persuade the Walker Sisters to sell their land. Fearing bad publicity, the Commission refused to initiate a condemnation suit. The Walker Sisters finally agreed to sell the property in 1941 in exchange for a lifetime lease.Daniel Pierce, The Great Smokies: From Natural Habitat to National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2000), p. 168. Historical structures Corn crib The Walker Cabin is an L-shaped log cabin, with a porch filling out the gap in the \\"L\\" to make a rectangle. The cabin's kitchen, which is believed to have been built by Brice McFalls in the 1840s, consists of one story measuring by , and has a door leading to the porch and a door to the larger half of the cabin. The larger cabin, built by Wiley King in the 1850s, consists of one-and-one-half stories measuring by . Both cabins are built of hewn logs with half-dovetail notching, and contain sawn board floors. Both have gabled, shingled roofs, and both have stone-and-mud chimneys. Springhouse The Walker corn crib is a by structure built of hewn logs with half-dovetail notching. The structure's large gabled roof overhangs both sides of the crib considerably, creating ample shed space. The interior of the crib has a puncheon floor, and is accessed by a door at the west end. These structures were sometimes called \\"plunder sheds,\\" as farmers used them to store miscellaneous items such as barbed wire, brooms, firewood, and tools.Ed Trout, Historic Buildings of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 1995), pp. 6-7. The Walker springhouse is an by structure built of hewn logs with half-dovetail notching. The gabled roof is supported by poles, and a board-and a board and batten door allows access. The interior contains a stone trough through which a spring once flowed, cooling the interior. The interior walls contain small storage shelves. Before the advent of refrigerators, springhouses were used to keep perishable items cool.

During his work in a quinine factory in the late 1890s, he started to work on the at-that-time-new field of radiochemistry and started the production of radium. In the period between 1902 and 1904, he was able to isolate a new element emanium. In a now controversially reviewed process, it was stated that emanium is identical to actinium, which was discovered by Andr√©-Louis Debierne in 1899. Life and work After studying in Berlin with Carl Liebermann, he received his Ph.D at the University of G√∂ttingen. Giesel worked at the Chininfabrik Braunschweig. Besides his work in the factory, Giesel's focus was on radiochemistry. Shortly after publication of the discovery of polonium in the summer of 1898, he started to isolate the new element from the waste of uranium production in the chemical plant E. de Ha√´n in Hanover. By March 1899 he could present the first radium to the chemical society of Braunschweig and by mid-1899 he published his results on radium. Giesel improved the separation of radium from barium by using the bromides instead of the chlorides for the fractional crystallization. He produced large quantities of pure radium and polonium for commercial applications from uranium ore. Even William Ramsay and Frederick Soddy were buying radium from the factory of Giesel. The use of Sidot's blende (zinc sulfide) instead of barium platinocyanide as a luminescence material to make the radioactive rays visible was a commonly accepted improvement. He did several self-experiments with radioactive substances and was able to affirm the damaging effects of radioactive radiation on skin. Because of prolonged contact with radioactive material, fingers of his right hand had to be amputated and he suffered from lung cancer. He died of lung cancer in 1927. His name was included on the Monument to the X-ray and Radium Martyrs of All Nations erected in Hamburg, Germany in 1936. The discovery of emanium Giesel isolated from pitchblende a lanthanum-containing fraction which showed unique properties. He produced several compounds of the new element, and after studying for two years he was confident enough to give the new element the name emanium. He was aware of the discovery of actinium by Andr√©-Louis Debierne. In publications from 1899 and 1890 Debierne does not give the exact procedures to obtain actinium, but from the description of chemical properties which he described as similar to titanium (1899) or similar to thorium (1890) it was clear for Giesel that the two elements must be different. A later comparison of the two elements by Otto Hahn, Otto Sackur and others showed that the two elements were identical. Debierne's name was retained because it had seniority. Giesel stated in one of his publications that the sample Debierne provided for the comparison was a lanthanum fraction obtained by the same process he used and not the titanium or thorium fractions from earlier publications. This fact never led to an open controversy but the history of the discovery stayed questionable, and publications from 1971 argue that the claims of Andr√©-Louis Debierne in 1904 conflict with the publications in 1899 and 1890, making Giesel the real discoverer of actinium. A less confrontational vision of scientific discovery is proposed by Adloff. He suggests that hindsight criticism of the early publications should be mitigated by the nascent state of radiochemistry, highlights the prudence of Debierne's claims in the original papers, and notes that nobody can contend that Debierne's substance did not contain actinium. Debierne, who is now considered by the vast majority of historians as the discoverer, lost interest in the element and left the topic. Giesel, on the other hand, can rightfully be credited with the first preparation of radiochemically pure actinium and with the identification of its atomic number 89.

It is contrasted with a transaction based method of service delivery in which citizens consume public services which are conceived of and provided by governments. Co-production is possible in the private and non-profit sectors in addition to the public sector. In contrast with traditional citizen involvement, citizens are not only consulted, but are part of the conception, design, steering, and management of services.Christian Bason Leading public sector innovation: Co-creating for a better society, Bristol, Policy Press, 2010  Some definitions  An organisation called the Co-production Network for Wales describes co-production as \\"an asset-based approach to public services that enables people providing and people receiving services to share power and responsibility, and to work together in equal, reciprocal and caring relationships\\".Co-production Network for Wales According to Governance International, co-production is about \\"public service organisations and citizens making better use of each other‚Äôs assets, resources and contributions\\".Governance International  Emergence  Experiments on co- production on public services have been launched in many countries, from Denmark to Malaysia, the UK and the US. The term 'co-production' was originally coined in the late 1970s by Elinor Ostrom and colleagues at Indiana University to explain why neighbourhood crime rates went up in Chicago when the city's police officers retreated from the street into cars.new economics foundation (2008) Co-production: A manifesto for growing the core economyThe new economics foundation/NESTA (2009) The Challenge of Co-production Similarly to Jane Jacobs' assessment of the importance of long-time residents to the safety and vitality of New York's old neighbourhoods, Ostrom noted that by becoming detached from people and their everyday lives on the streets, Chicago's police force lost an essential source of insider information, making it harder for them to do their work as effectively. What Ostrom and her colleagues were recognising was that services ‚Äì in this case policing ‚Äì rely as much upon the unacknowledged knowledge, assets and efforts of service 'users' as the expertise of professional providers. It was the informal understanding of local communities and the on the ground relationships they had developed with police officers that had helped keep crime levels down. In short, the police needed the community as much as the community needed the police. The concept of the 'core economy', first articulated by Neva Goodwin and subsequently developed by Edgar S. Cahn, is helpful in explaining this further. The core economy is made up of all the resources embedded in people's everyday lives ‚Äì time, energy, wisdom, experience, knowledge and skills ‚Äì and the relationships between them ‚Äì love, empathy, watchfulness, care, reciprocity, teaching and learning. Similar to the role played by the operating system of a computer, the core economy is the basic, yet essential, platform upon which 'specialist programmes' in society, the market economy and public services run. Our specialised services dealing with crime, education, care, health and so on are all underpinned by the family, the neighbourhood, community and civil society. This understanding has helped to radically reframe the potential role of 'users' and 'professionals' in the process of producing services. Far from being passive consumers, or needy drains on public finances, people, their family, friends and communities are understood as important agents with the capacity to design and even deliver services with improved outcomes. Professionals, for their part, need to find ways of engaging meaningfully with the core economy; helping it to grow, flourish and realise its full potential ‚Äì not atrophy as a result of neglect or exploitation. Significantly, as the New Economics Foundation (NEF) note: \\"This is not about consultation or participation ‚Äì except in the broadest sense. The point is not to consult more, or involve people more in decisions; it is to encourage them to use the human skills and experience they have to help deliver public or voluntary services. It is, according to Elizabeth Hoodless at Community Service Volunteers, about \\"broadening and deepening\\" public services so that they are no longer the preserve of professionals or commissioners, but a shared responsibility, both building and using a multi- faceted network of mutual support\\".  Canada  In Canada, a team of professionals has created a prototype based on this approach: Co-Create Canada, which aims to increase citizens' trust in government by connecting citizens who want to be engaged in the development of policies and programs with government change agents. This would enable the co-creation of new solutions aimed at improving policies and programs and leverage dispersed resources both inside and outside of government to solve problems faster. The model would employ several strategies (Ref. Adamira Tijerino): # Connecting citizens who want to get engaged in a particular area of interest with public servants who are specialists and involved in the area of interest. # Humanizing public servants by allowing them to go beyond their job description and empowering them by recognizing their individual skill sets (via the use of open badges). # Develop a wide range of tools (e.g., Connect.gc.ca website, mobile app and engagement mechanisms) to serve as the platform for these connections, leveraging current government IT infrastructure. # Propose an evaluation component to measure success. What has emerged from this thinking is a new agenda; a challenge to the way professionals are expected to work, and to policy-makers who are setting targets as indicators of success; a way of helping to explain why things currently do not work as well as they could; a call for an alternative way of doing things.  Italy  By the initiative of three mental health professionals and a group of volunteers (now the association ‚Äò180amici‚Äô), a centre co‚Äêproduced by the public mental health services and a citizen association with many members with lived experiences of mental health issues and their family members opened in 2008. The centre - named \\"Marco Cavallo\\" - was officially recognized by the Apulia region as an experimental centre of co‚Äêproduction in 2012. In 2015, the association ‚Äò180amici‚Äô asked the Italian National Research Council to evaluate the Marco Cavallo Center using a collaborative approach. The research compared the coproduced Marco Cavallo Center to mental health services in the same region and found that users of the co‚Äêproduced centre reported a significantly reduced rate of hospitalizations compared with users of traditional mental health services. Furthermore, 39% of users of the co‚Äêproduced centre reported a reduction or even withdrawal from psychiatric medications against 22% of the comparison group. In the participants' experiences, the co‚Äêproduced service focused on (i) parity and respectful relationships, (ii) people's strengths, (iii) freedom, (iv) psychological continuity, (v) social inclusion, and (vi) recovery orientation. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland The 4Pi National Involvement Standards (developed and produced by people with lived experience) were formally launched at the National Survivor User Network (NSUN) AGM 29 January 2013. This framework established some basic principles to encourage people to think of involvement in terms of principles, purpose, presence, process and impact(4Pi). The 4Pi National Involvement Standards influences people beyond the boundaries of NSUN. Wales In Wales, the Co-production Network for Wales was launched in May 2016. The project is funded by the Big Lottery for three years and is a partnership between the Co-production Network for Wales, WCVA and the project host Cartrefi Cymru. Their collective aim is to help transform our public services by embedding co-production as the primary approach to commissioning, design, delivery and evaluation in Wales. The Network patrons are Edgar Cahn and Julian Tudor-Hart.  Namibia  The Shack Dwellers Federation of Namibia, which is composed of women-led savings groups in low-income areas, has worked with the city government of Windhoek to access sanitation services and secure housing. In addition to improving living standards, the federation's self-help strategy for co-production aims to build political influence and organizing capacity amongst low-income urban residents.  New Zealand  The initiation of preserving the environment for the future generation alongside protecting economic, social and cultural well-being is a great example of co- production in public services. Iwi, hap≈´, and community groups were initiated to join the monitoring, protection and enhancement of the natural resources. The principles of effective co-governance and co-management were: * to build and maintain the common understanding of goals and expected achievements; * to build the frameworks, processes, structures, and understanding about the way people work together; * to involve people with needed experiences and capacity; * to be transparent about the process, performance, achievements and challenges; * to plan for financial sustainability and to be ready for change. Based on this principles, many co-operational events took place. For example, North Otago aquatic restoration. The success was based also on the deep analysis of the people's values and needs. Only because North Otago meant a lot to people they had a strong incentive to participate in the restoration.  Concepts of co-production  Co-production is based on the production of own services and resources by citizens, completely or in part. It involves the willingness of citizens or users together with public services to design, implement and improve the delivery of services in order to innovate and transform public services. Co-production includes co-management and co- governance.  Co-management  The concept of co-management implies the introduction of a third party (citizens, users, private organization or other public organization) into the process of management of the delivery of the service. The involvement of the third party actually takes place from the nineteenth century, however, it was not defined as a concept back then. Co- management creates the phenomenon by bringing relations between different organizations to internal production process and creating new networks, which in some cases brings strong positive impact, however, can be seen as negative due to the lack of accountability and increasing competition between different networks.  Co-governance  The concept of co-governance lies under the arrangement of the third party and public agencies if decision making and planning of public services.  Co-design  Co-designing refers to the process of a collective knowledge sharing and knowledge creation. Key components of a co-design process should involve: * Intentionally involving target users in designing solutions; * Postponing design decisions until after gathering feedback; * Synthesising feedback from target users into insights; * Developing solutions based on feedback.  Co-delivery  Co-delivery implies the improvement of outcomes with a collective effort. It is usually implemented as non-profit organization.  Co-assessment  Co-assessment refers to the monitoring of public service quality and outcomes. Co-assessment of public services brings a radically different perspective to deciding what works ‚Äì and what doesn‚Äôt. However, co-assessment can carry potential risks such as: lack of knowledge, lack of resources, time consumption.  Challenges  Co-production, as a method, approach and mind-set, is very different from traditional models of service provision. As has been shown, it fundamentally alters the relationship between service providers and users; it emphasises people as active agents, not passive beneficiaries; and, in large part because of this alternative process, it tends to lead towards better, more preventative outcomes in the long-term. Because of its radically different nature, however, people wishing to practice co-production face a number of significant challenges. As NEF/NESTA comments: \\"Overall, the challenge seems to amount to one clear problem. Co-production, even in the most successful and dramatic examples, barely fits the standard shape of public services or charities or the systems we have developed to 'deliver' support, even though [in the UK] policy documents express ambitions to empower and engage local communities, to devolve power and increase individuals' choice and control.\\" This misfit makes practising co-production difficult, and mainstreaming good practice particularly so. Existing structures and frameworks work against, not with, co-production. In order for it to flourish as a viable alternative to the expensive and in many cases failing, status quo change needs to take place. NEF/NESTA highlight four areas where such change will be required; * Funding and Commissioning: Commissioners of public money will need to change their established ways of doing things. Applying strict quantitative targets and stipulating rigid, short-term outputs with a mind to economic efficiency acts as a barrier to co-produced service models. In order to 'commission for change' narrow outputs need to be broadened and complemented by outcomes based commissioning. * Generating evidence and making the case for co-production: The obvious reason why many commissioning frameworks favour outputs over outcomes is that they are simply measured, making it deceptively easy to evaluate success or failure. But real success is not easily measurable. Nor are many of the preventative benefits of co-production easy to quantify. Making the case for co-production and capturing its complex and myriad benefits is a key challenge. * Taking successful approaches to scale: It is fair to say that the majority of examples where co-production is being successfully practiced take place at a local scale. To a great extent this has been instrumental to their success; they are rooted in local realities, have grown organically from the ground based on local assets and ideas and emphasise the importance of face-to-face relationships. There is a potential tension to be overcome here; ensuring that a service remains locally rooted, whilst simultaneously expanding the scope of coverage nationally. Where this has been achieved (see KeyRing, Shared Lives and LAC in Australia) the tendency towards replication and blueprinting has been strongly resisted. Instead of simplistically transplanting a 'model' in new regions, these organisations have taken forward a common 'method' that involves engaging with local assets and resources in a consistent way. Co-production also suits smaller organisations (traditionally those in the third sector) that are more used to working in less structured and hierarchical ways. This is something that large public sector structures are much less used to doing. If co- production is to be a mainstream way of working across public sector services, a structural and cultural shift will also need to take place. * Developing required professional skills: Years of working to narrowly defined roles and job descriptions has understandably led to many public service professionals seeing their 'clients' through circumscribed lenses; as patients that need to be cared for, rather than people who could be enabled. It can also be difficult for any professional to relinquish control and 'hand over the stick'; not only does this challenge occupational identities but it also confers a greater sense of risk ‚Äì co-production can be 'messy' and is inimical to rigid control. If the hearts and minds of those delivering services on the ground cannot be changed, and if the necessary skills associated with relinquishing control are not embedded, co-production is likely to be constrained. A Service User's Perspective \\"The language and movement for co- production is one expression of this. But it is a slow process and sadly whatever the politics of governments; whether they favour state or market, too often for all the rhetoric, other people still make key decisions about us and our lives, whether we are talking about the NHS, welfare reform or the education system. And we know that this is inefficient and wasteful. Instead, listen to people on the receiving end. Make sure discussions and decision- making processes are as accessible and inclusive as possible so their diverse views and voices can be heard. Most of all, subject schemes for co-production to a ruthless test. Service users and their organisations must always be in the room, on the committee, in the decision-making body. Then we're really likely to get somewhere ‚Äì doing it together.\\" ‚Äî Peter Beresford OBE  Criticisms and responses  * It makes additional demands of people who rely on services and who are by definition already 'in need'. However, a response to this is that the active engagement of people who have previously been seen as passive recipients is largely positive, enabling them to make services work for them, growing their own confidence and capacity. Nevertheless, in co- production approaches it is important to consider equality around the burden placed on people's time. * It is a cover for the withdrawal of services and minimises the accountability of the state; blurring the lines of responsibility for the quality of service. If co-production is done for the wrong reasons this can be the case. It is a question of means and ends. The key here is to emphasise that 'co' requires input both from people who deliver services and people who have been seen as 'recipients' of them. They are likely to play different roles and power will be distributed differently in co-produced services but contribution from both is essential, otherwise services become 'self-organised' which is a different thing entirely. * Co- produced services will lead to a postcode lottery for service users: It is true that services will look different in different areas but that is to be expected as the assets, resources and needs identified by communities in different areas will also look different. There is still the need for a central role to be played to ensure consistency in approach and to be clear that everyone is enabled to play a role in co-production but the assumption that identikit services produce the best outcomes for people is questioned by co-production. * Its just 'participation' by a new name: Co-production is different from 'voice' based interventions as it recognises that it is critical for people to play a role in the activity of delivering services, not simply to contribute ideas to shaping new services that rely on professionals to deliver them.

The album was produced by Andy Richards, except \\"Penny Arcade\\" which was produced by Dan Hartman. Background Following his 1989 UK chart topping debut album Blast, Johnson began writing and recording his second album in 1990. The first single preceding the album was \\"Where Has Love Gone?\\", which was released in November 1990 and reached No. 73 in the UK. The follow-up was \\"Across the Universe\\", which reached No. 99 following its release in March 1991. The entire album had been completed in early 1991, however Johnson's relations with MCA then collapsed when the label, disappointed by the limited success of the two singles, decided to limit the marketing budget for the album. Dreams That Money Can't Buy was given a half-hearted release later in the year and with little promotion it failed to chart. The third and final single, \\"The People Want to Dance\\", was released in September but also failed to chart. Having left the label by the time of the album's release, Johnson discovered he was HIV positive in November 1991, which resulted in him largely withdrawing from music. In a 2014 interview with The Arts Desk, Johnson spoke of the failure of the album and the making of it: Song information In a 2011 fan question interview, Johnson chose \\"Penny Arcade\\" and \\"The Great Love Story\\" as his two favourite tracks from the album. He added that he would have liked to have seen \\"Penny Arcade\\" released as a single, noting \\"there could have been some really good remixes done for that\\". English singer-songwriter and friend Kirsty MacColl appeared on the album track \\"Boyfriend '65\\". The song was reputed to have been written after Johnson applied William Burroughs' fold-in method to the Boyfriend Annual 1965. Johnson recalled in 2011 of working with MacColl: \\"Oh, I had wanted to do the song as a duet with her as far back as 1984, but Island Records and then MCA wouldn't allow it for some reason, so I asked her to do it as a backing vocalist when I finally got round to recording it properly.\\" Critical reception On its release, Steve Stewart of The Press and Journal commented: \\"Ten out of ten for Holly for effort. All the songs were written by him, but it is a shame they all sound the same.\\" Robbert Tilli of Music & Media wrote: \\"The music is still pop, but more dance- orientated than ever.\\" He highlighted \\"The Great Love Story\\" as the album's best track. In a retrospective review, Jon O'Brien of AllMusic stated: \\"Even taking into account the fact that the dated production would have sounded a little fresher back in the early '90s, it's not difficult to see why the label appeared to have such a lack of confidence. With nothing here even approaching a \\"Love Train\\" or \\"Americanos,\\" let alone a \\"Relax\\" or \\"Two Tribes,\\" it's a disappointingly bland affair from an artist whose previous career was anything but.\\" Terry Staunton of Record Collector said in a review of the 2011 re- issue: \\"Dreams That Money Can't Buy lack[s] the joyousness of Blast and proved to be a lacklustre swansong. Both \\"Across the Universe\\" and \\"Where Has Love Gone?\\" come across as half-formed synth dance workouts, their elevation to single status baffling. There's little variation in the overall sound, the drama of Johnson's voice struggling to find comfort in the soulless, mechanical rhythms, only ever making a strong impression on the tropical pop of \\"Boyfriend '65\\", a fun duet with Kirsty MacColl.\\" Track listing Original release All tracks written by Holly Johnson. # \\"Across the Universe\\" ‚Äì 3:55 # \\"When the Party's Over\\" ‚Äì 3:59 # \\"The People Want to Dance\\" ‚Äì 4:20 # \\"I Need Your Love\\" ‚Äì 3:57 # \\"Boyfriend '65\\" ‚Äì 3:08 # \\"Where Has Love Gone?\\" ‚Äì 4:17 # \\"Penny Arcade\\" ‚Äì 4:07 # \\"Do It for Love\\" ‚Äì 3:45 # \\"You're a Hit\\" ‚Äì 3:29 # \\"The Great Love Story\\" ‚Äì 4:58 Dreams That Money Can't Buy (Expanded Edition) (2011) Disc 1 ‚Äì Original Album and Single B-Sides # \\"Across the Universe\\" ‚Äì 3:55 # \\"When the Party's Over\\" ‚Äì 4:01 # \\"The People Want to Dance\\" ‚Äì 4:21 # \\"I Need Your Love\\" ‚Äì 3:57 # \\"Boyfriend '65\\" ‚Äì 3:08 # \\"Where Has Love Gone?\\" ‚Äì 4:18 # \\"Penny Arcade\\" ‚Äì 4:07 # \\"Do It for Love\\" ‚Äì 3:47 # \\"You're a Hit\\" ‚Äì 3:30 # \\"The Great Love Story\\" ‚Äì 4:59 # \\"Perfume (Aromatherapy Mix 7\\" Edit)\\" ‚Äì 4:26 # \\"Funky Paradise\\" ‚Äì 4:15 # \\"The People Want to Dance (Apollo 440 Remix 7\\" Edit)\\" ‚Äì 4:22 Disc 2 ‚Äì Remixes and Rarities # \\"Where Has Love Gone?

The track would be Johnson's last release until 1994. The song was written by Holly Johnson. Background Released as the third and final single from the Dreams That Money Can't Buy album, the single failed to make any national charts. The single received little airplay on radios and sold poorly. Around the time of the album's release, Johnson's relations with MCA cooled over dissatisfaction with promotional budgets for his second solo album. By the time this single was released, Johnson was no longer attached to the record company and was released without any involvement from Johnson. In early 2011, Johnson answered several fan questions and spoke of the single, stating \\"The People Want To Dance\\" didn't have a video mainly because I was no longer signed to MCA when the album and the single were released in 1991. They allocated no marketing budget to the album after the singles \\"Where Has Love Gone\\" and \\"Across The Universe\\" were released at the end of 1990.\\" Release The single was released on 7\\" vinyl, 12\\" vinyl and CD in 1991 across the UK and Germany only. The single was released entirely through MCA Records. For the single release, the album version of the song was not used. Instead the remix \\"The People Want To Dance (Rave Hard Mix)\\" was used as the a-side, with the title referencing the 1986 Frankie Goes to Hollywood single Rage Hard. The remix version was created by Ben Chapman and used rapping from D. Marcus C. whilst Beverly Skeete, Claudia Fontaine and Derek Green provided backing vocals. The 7\\" vinyl of the single featured \\"The People Want To Dance (Rave Hard Mix)\\" as the a-side along with the b-side, another remix of the song, titled \\"The People Want To Dance (Apollo 440 Mix)\\", which was remixed by Electronica/techno band Apollo 440. The 12\\" vinyl replaced the a-side with an extended version of the remix, titled \\"The People Want To Dance (Raving Harder! Mix)\\", whilst the two b-sides were \\"The People Want To Dance (Apollo 440 Mix)\\" and \\"Love Train (Americanos Big Beat Version)\\", a Frankie Knuckles remix of Johnson's 1989 hit single. The remix had previously been released on the 1989 remix album Hollelujah as well as the American only 12\\" remix single \\"Love Train (Previously Unreleased Mixes)\\". The CD single version used \\"The People Want To Dance (Rave Hard! Mix)\\" as the main track, whilst both \\"Love Train (Americanos Big Beat Version)\\" and \\"The People Want To Dance (Raving Harder! Mix)\\" were used as the other two tracks. In the UK only, a promotional 12\\" vinyl was released, featuring the remix \\"The People Want to Dance (The Ben Chapman Mix)\\" along with the b-side \\"The People Want to Dance (Apollo 440 Mix)\\". Promotion The single had no music video or TV performances as a form of promotion as Johnson had no involvement of the release. The single remains Johnson's only post-1989 single not to have a music video, except the promotional 1998 single \\"Hallelujah!\\".

As database and microprocessor architectures change, so must the benchmarks that are employed to measure the combined performance of these critical components. While other industry standard throughput workloads already exist, none was designed specifically to exercise the relationship between in-memory database software and the memory processing subsystem in which it transacts. The Telecommunication Application Transaction Processing (TATP) Benchmark is a new open source workload designed specifically for high- throughout applications, well suited for in-memory database performance analysis and system comparison. The TATP benchmark simulates a typical Home Location Register (HLR) database used by a mobile carrier. The HLR is an application mobile network operators use to store all relevant information about valid subscribers, including the mobile phone number, the services to which they have subscribed, access privileges, and the current location of the subscriber's handset. Every call to and from a mobile phone involves look ups against the HLRs of both parties, making it is a perfect example of a demanding, high-throughput environment where the workloads are pertinent to all applications requiring extreme speed: telecommunications, financial services, gaming, event processing and alerting, reservation systems, software as a service (SaaS), and so on. The benchmark generates a flooding load on a database server. This means that the load is generated up to the maximum throughput point that the server can sustain. The load is generated by issuing pre-defined transactions run against a specified target database. The target database schema is made to resemble a typical HLR database in a mobile phone network. The algorithm of what is known as the TATP Benchmark was originally published in a Master's Thesis.Toni Strandell: \\"Open Source Database Systems: Systems study, Performance and Scalability\\". Master's Thesis, University of Helsinki, Department of Computer Science, May 2003, 54 p, at: http://ethesis.helsinki.fi/julkaisut/mat/tieto/pg/strandell/ The benchmark was modeled after a real test program that was used by a telecom equipment manufacturer to evaluate the applicability of various relational database systems to service control programming in mobile networks.

Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia and the University of South Carolina. He was portrayed by actor Kip Pardue in the 2000 film Remember the Titans which is about his high school‚Äôs number 2 ranked in the nation 1971 State Championship team, on which he was the starting quarterback. Early life Bass was born in Fort Walton Beach, Florida in October 1955, the son of Williamson G. \\"Bill\\" Bass and Betty Jean Bass. Bass' father was an officer in the United States Air Force. Due to his father's military career, Bass and his family moved frequently as he was growing up. The family lived in Smackover, Arkansas, Stillwater, Oklahoma, Huntington Beach, California, and finally Alexandria, Virginia. Most of Bass' education took place in Huntington Beach, where he attended Gill Elementary, Stacey Jr. High, and Marina High School. After moving to Alexandria, Bass finished his last two years of High School at T.C. Williams, graduating with the class of 1972. In 1985, Bass married Susan Carol Walsh in Columbia, South Carolina. They have two daughters and one son. High school '''' During his early years at Huntington Beach, Bass realized he wanted to play football. At Marina High, he started his sophomore year as a defensive back while also playing backup quarterback. After moving to Virginia, Bass became the starting quarterback, as well as adopting the nickname \\"Sunshine\\", at T.C. Williams High School. The nickname was given to him by his teammates due to his blonde hair and sunburn. Bass was a starter on the team during both his junior and senior years, and led T.C. Williams to the Virginia AAA state High School championship his junior year in 1971. Remember the Titans Bass and others have stated that many scenes in the 2000 film Remember the Titans are fictional, and do not portray the real-life Ronald Bass accurately. For example, in the movie, Bass is depicted as a long-haired hippie. He has, however, been quoted in the Greenville News as saying, \\"I was never quite like that ... But that's Hollywood. I'll say for the record my hair was never that long.\\" In the film, Bass, played by Kip Pardue, arrives after camp begins and is introduced to the Titans' coaches by his father, United States Marine Colonel Bass, as they had just arrived in town. In real life, the Bass family had already been in Alexandria before camp started and had practiced with rival quarterback \\"Rev\\" in unofficial workouts held during the summer. \\"Ronnie went down (to the Burg) every day, and he related to the kids there in the ghetto,\\" Boone stated in the film's DVD commentary. \\"This is one of the reasons they called him 'Sunshine.' \\". Commenting on the scene in the movie in which his character kisses Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) on the lips in the locker room, Bass has stated that the incident never happened. Bass has also observed that in the movie, \\"(Denzel Washington) did come across as a disciplinarian, which coach Boone was, he was a perfectionist, which coach Boone tried to be, and he had a temper and was in your face a lot.\\" Boone admits, in his DVD commentary, that he was a disciplinarian, but adds that he has a warm side that doesn't come across in the film. \\"I wanted to make the team,\\" Bass noted. \\"I think that's where most of the kids' minds were. We were just trying to play football.\\" College career Bass went on to play at the University of South Carolina on a football scholarship. He started at quarterback his junior and senior year and lettered all four years. As a sophomore, in the October 26, 1974, game against their rival and 14-point favorite University of North Carolina, Bass ran the ball 39 times for 211 yards and two touchdowns in a 31‚Äì23 upset victory.

The consistency, degree of fluidity, and other mechanical properties are important in understanding how long food can be stored, how stable it will remain, and in determining food texture. The acceptability of food products to the consumer is often determined by food texture, such as how spreadable and creamy a food product is. Food rheology is important in quality control during food manufacture and processing. Food rheology terms have been noted since ancient times. In ancient Egypt, bakers judged the consistency of dough by rolling it in their hands. Overview Peanut butter in the jar There is a large body of literature on food rheology because the study of food rheology entails unique factors beyond an understanding of the basic rheological dynamics of the flow and deformation of matter. Food can be classified according to its rheological state, such as a solid, gel, liquid, emulsion with associated rheological behaviors, and its rheological properties can be measured. These properties will affect the design of food processing plants, as well as shelf life and other important factors, including sensory properties that appeal to consumers. Because foods are structurally complex, often a mixture of fluid and solids with varying properties within a single mass, the study of food rheology is more complicated than study in fields such as the rheology of polymers. However, food rheology is something we experience every day with our perception of food texture (see below) and basic concepts of food rheology well apply to polymers physics, oil flow etc. For this reason, examples of food rheology are didactically useful to explain the dynamics of other materials we are less familiar with. Ketchup is commonly used an example of Bingham fluid and its flow behavior can be compared to that of a polymer melt. Psychorheology Psychorheology is the sensory judgement of rheological properties. It is a term used in the food industry, to describe how a food \\"feels\\" to the mouth. It is not necessarily straightforward to predict how a food will \\"feel\\" based purely on the true rheological properties. The most important factor in food rheology is consumer perception of the product. This perception is affected by how the food looks on the plate as well as how it feels in the mouth, or \\"mouthfeel\\". Mouthfeel is influenced by how food moves or flows once it is in a person's mouth and determines how desirable the food is seen to be.

Because the Reich Air Ministry decided to purchase the competing Junkers Ju 87, only three prototypes of the Ar 81 were completed. Development In 1934, the Reich Air Ministry or RLM (Reichsluftfahrtministerium) initiated two parallel programmes to build new dive bombers for the German air force, to replace the Heinkel He 50. The first, the so-called Sofort or immediate program, aimed to develop an interim dive bomber, and resulted in the production of the Henschel Hs 123. The second, Sturzbomber program, aimed to produce a more definitive aircraft. In January 1935 the formal requirements for this were sent to German aircraft manufacturers.Herbert L√©onard, Stukas! - Les Avions Allemands d'attaque au sol (1933-1945), Editions Heimdal, France 1997. These had been written around the Junkers Ju 87, of which the first prototype was already under construction. Indeed, the Luftwaffe had already given Junkers an order for 118 aircraft.J√∂rg Armin Kranzhoff, Arado-Flugzeuge Vom Doppeldecker zum Strahlflugzeug, Bernard & Graefe Verlag, Germany 2001. Nevertheless, two manufacturers received an order to deliver three prototypes of their competing projects: The Heinkel He 118 and the Arado Ar 81. The Blohm & Voss Ha 137 competed as a private venture.Peter C. Smith, Dive Bomber!, Naval Institute Press, USA, 1982. The Ar 81 was the only one of the competitors to be conceived as a biplane. Reportedly this was on the advice of Ernst Udet. There seems to have been some doubt at Arado about the use of this outdated configuration, for alternative designs were made for a monoplane with an inverted gull wing. However, in the end the Ar 81 was built as an all-metal biplane. It was a pleasant design, which looked rather more streamlined than the first prototype of the Ju 87, and was slightly smaller and lighter. The slender fuselage had a closely cowled Junkers Jumo 210C engine in front, with a large radiator bath below it. The wings were relatively short in span and connected by N-struts outboard. Behind the wings, the crew of two sat in a roomy cockpit with a semi-enclosed canopy, back to back. The rear of the cockpit canopy was open to allow the gunner to freely aim his defensive machine gun. The fixed main landing gear legs were fitted with streamlined covers and spats for the wheels. The tail section was very slender, and the tail of the first prototype, Ar 81V1, consisted of a tailplane with some dihedral that carried two outboard fins and rudders, to improve the field of fire of the tail gunner. However, testing from the end of 1935 onward revealed serious stability problems. The second prototype was given a raised tailplane without dihedral, braced with struts, but this did not cure the issues, and the third prototype had a completely reworked tail, with a boom structure of larger cross-section that carried a tall single tailfin and a large rudder. This prototype also had a Jumo 210Ca engine that drove a two-bladed variable-pitch propeller, instead of the three- bladed fixed-pitch unit fitted to the first two prototypes. The defensive armament of a single fixed MG 17 machine gun, intended to be fitted in the engine cowling, and a MG 15 defensive gun in the rear cockpit, was probably never installed. The same is claimed for the special bomb rack below the fuselage, intended to swing a 250 kg bomb clear of the propeller in a diving attack. However, test pilot Kurt Starck claimed that during the 1936 trials, the Ar 81 was the only aircraft capable of dropping a 500 kg bomb in a vertical dive, which indicates that a bomb rack must have been fitted. In its developed Ar 81V3 form, the Arado design was in several aspects better than the Ju 87 prototypes, including level speed, manoeuvrability, range, and especially rate of climb: It reached 4000 m in 11 minutes, while the Junkers design needed 23 minutes. However, the Ju 87 was a more modern design and its performance could be improved by installing more powerful engines, while the Ar 81 had less development potential. Due to the delay involved in redesigning the tail, the Ar 81V3 made its appearance only in the spring of 1936, when the RLM had already chosen the Ju 87.

He served as bishop of the Diocese of Raleigh, North Carolina from 1945 until his death in 1974. Biography Early life and education Vincent Waters was born in Roanoke, Virginia, to Michael Bernard and Mary Frances (n√©e Crowley) Waters. He attended Belmont Abbey College in North Carolina from 1920 to 1925, and then went to Maryland and studied at St. Charles College in Ellicott City (1925-1926) and St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore (1926-1928). He furthered his studies at the Pontifical North American College in Rome. Ordination and ministry Waters was ordained to the priesthood on December 8, 1931. Following his return to Virginia in 1932, he served as a curate at Holy Cross Church in Lynchburg until 1936, when he was transferred to Sacred Heart Cathedral in Richmond. He was chancellor of the Diocese of Richmond from 1936 to 1943, and director of the Diocesan Mission Fathers from 1943 to 1945. Bishop of Raleigh On March 15, 1945, Waters was appointed the sixth Bishop of Raleigh, North Carolina, by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following May 15 from Bishop Peter Leo Ireton, with Bishops Gerald O'Hara and Emmet M. Walsh serving as co-consecrators. A year before Brown v. Board of Education, Waters ordered the desegregation of all Catholic churches and schools in North Carolina in 1953. He described segregation as a product of \\"darkness,\\" and declared that \\"the time has come for it to end.\\" He also said, \\"I am not unmindful, as a Southerner, of the force of this virus of prejudice among some persons in the South, as well as in the North. I know, however, that there is a cure for this virus, and that is our faith.\\" He attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council between 1962 and 1965. Waters was later accused by some of the diocesan clergy of holding on to idle church property worth millions of dollars while some parishes were in debt. He also denied requests for the creation of a priests' senate, and had his resignation requested by around twenty percent of the clergy. In 1972 he expelled five Sisters of Providence from the diocese for not wearing their religious habit while teaching. Bishop Waters later died from a heart attack at his residence, aged 70.

He has been active in the Chicago music scene since the early 1990s. He has produced many of his own albums, as well as remixes for other artists. Born and raised in Chicago, he was introduced to music at a very early age by his father, a DJ who played mostly soul and disco music at a west side tavern. As a teen, Terry built a following by DJing at neighborhood and high school parties, then went on to play several seminal Chicago clubs and parties. In 1990, as the Chicago house music sound was exploding internationally, Terry produced his first release, \\"Madness\\", which became an underground hit. While continuing to DJ in Chicago and beyond, he honed serious production skills, contributing his talents to remixes for top artists, including Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Mary J. Blige, R. Kelly, Byron Stingily (of Chicago's Ten City), Barbara Tucker and La India.5chicago.com His 1997 track, \\"Harvest for the World\\", (a cover of the Isley Brothers track) peaked at #48 in the UK Singles Chart in July that year.

It is a Buddhist Sanskrit text in the Devanagari script discovered in Nepal. Chandragomin's composition is an ornate epistolary genre Buddhist poetry about a monk who falls in love and breaks his celebacy vow. Chandragomin (Skt. Candragomin) was an Indian Buddhist lay scholar who the Tibetan tradition believes challenged Chandrakirti. According to the Nepalese tradition, Chandragomin's student was Ratnakirti. Chandragomin was a teacher at Nalanda Monastic University during the 7th century.Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche, Illuminating the Path, pg 187-188. Padmasambhava Buddhist Center, 2008. It is unclear when Chandragomin lived, with estimates ranging between 5th to 7th-century CE,≈öi·π£yalekha (MS Add.1161), Cambridge University, Camillo Formigatti and Daniele Cuneo (2016) but his position at Nalanda signifies he lived during the 7th century. In the Buddhist records, Chandragomin is described as the one who debated Candrakƒ´rti (Devanagari: ‡§ö‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡•Ä‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§ø, Tib. Dawa Drakpa) the Arya Tripitaka Master Shramana who was the Khenpo at Nalanda MahƒÅvihƒÅra Monastery. Their debate was said to have continued for many years. Chandragomin held the Chittamatra (consciousness-only or Yogachara school) view, and Chandrakirti gave his interpretation of NƒÅgƒÅrjuna's view, eventually creating a new school of Madhyamaka known as Prasangika. This Nalanda tradition school is known as or rendered in English as the \\"Consequentialist\\" or \\"Dialecticist\\" school. According to Thrangu Rinpoche, Chandragomin was slow in the debate but always had the right answers because each time a question was posed by Chandrakirti, Chandragomin would insist on giving the answer the next day after praying to Avalokiteshvara who would tell him the right answer. Major works * Chadragomin's writings include Shisyalekha or 'Letter to a Disciple' (published by Dharma Publishing as 'Invitation to Enlightenment' ) * 'Twenty Verses on the Bodhisattva Vow'.https://www.amazon.com/Invitation- Enlightenment-Matricheta-Chandragomin-Translation/dp/0898002982 * Translated from the original Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit into Tibetan is Chandragomin's 'Shurangama Mantra Sadhana' (Tibetan canon Tengyur Karchag Phangthangma Toh 3096, Toh 593/2/1).

In Roman constitutional law, rogatio is the term (from Latin rogo, \\"ask, place a question before\\") for a legislative bill placed before an Assembly of the People in ancient Rome. The rogatio procedure underscores the fact that the Roman senate could issue decrees, but was not a legislative or parliamentarian body. Only the People could pass legislation.Fergus Millar, The Crowd in Rome in the Late Republic (University of Michigan Press, 1998), pp. 157‚Äì158 online. A magistrate with the right to summon the assembly could propose a bill (rogatio legis); the proposed laws themselves were leges rogatae. A bill's proposer was its lator; a supporter was an auctor.Millar, The Crowd in Rome p. 26. Discussions in the senate would contribute to the drafting of a bill, which would be published (promulgare rogationem, that is, promulgatio) three weeks or more before it was formally submitted to the assembly. During this period, citizens could discuss the bill and propose changes, or more rarely ask for its withdrawal, at informal sessions (contiones). After the bill had been brought before the assembly for the vote, it could no longer be modified.George Mousourakis, The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law (Ashgate, 2003), p. 182 online. The legislator who introduced the bill asked Velitis iubeatis, Quirites? (\\"Citizens, are you going to approve and order?\\"Or, \\"Citizens, is it your will that you should order it?\\") and the people responded yea or nay without discussion. If a bill was withdrawn after the rogatio but before the vote was taken, it was usually because a tribune threatened to use his veto power against it, or less frequently because it proved unpopular among the plebs.Andrew Lintott, Judicial reform and land reform in the Roman Republic (Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 6‚Äì7 online. Lintott believes Cicero exaggerates the extent to which the plebs could influence withdrawal. If a bill was passed (rogatio lata est), it became a law (lex) after the presiding magistrate made a formal announcement (renuntiatio) of the assembly's decision. In the Early Republic, the senate had to approve the constitutionality of a law before it was enacted; after the passage of the Lex Publilia Philonis in 339 BC, which required that at least one of the two censores be a plebeian, this approval (patrum auctoritas) was required before the bill was put to a vote in the assembly. With controversial popularist measures, however, the senate was sometimes bypassed. If a bill was proposed for the purpose of declaring war, it had to be brought before the Centuriate Assembly.Fergus Millar, Rome, the Greek World, and the East (University of North Carolina Press, 2002), p. 116. A bill that became law was inscribed on copper or marble tablets and kept in the state treasury (aerarium populi romani) under the supervision of the quaestors.Mousourakis, p. 183. In 63 BC, Cicero managed to obstruct a rogatio Servilia by making a speech before the people; this appears to be the only time in the Late Republic when oratory blocked a popular piece of legislation, which in this case had provided for the distribution of land to the poor. Or so Cicero claims; the bill's sponsor, the tribune Servilius Rullus, more likely withdrew it because of the threat of veto from one of his fellow tribunes, and it never reached the comitia.Henrik Mouritsen, Plebs and Politics in the Late Roman Republic (Cambridge University Press, 2001), pp. 54‚Äì55 online. Further discussion of the rogatio Servilia by Erich S. Gruen, \\"The Plebs and the Army,\\" in The Last Generation of the Roman Republic (University of California Press, 1974, reprinted 1995), pp. 386‚Äì398, limited preview online.

Born in Ballymena, County Antrim, he won seven full international caps for Northern Ireland as well as five amateur caps and five inter-league caps for the Irish League. Stewart joined Glentoran from Ballymena as a teenager in 1961, and became part of one of the most successful Glentoran teams in the mid- and late sixties, winning the Gold Cup in 1963, the Irish League championship in 1964 and the Irish Cup in 1965. In 1966‚Äì67 Stewart was part of the team which won the Ulster Cup, Gold Cup, City Cup and League championship. At the end of the season, he won his first cap for Northern Ireland in a 0‚Äì0 draw with Wales. He was part of the famous Detroit Cougars team which was the name given to Glentoran in the United Soccer Association championship in the summer of 1967. In December of the next season, he transferred to Derby County in the English Second Division. After two-and-a-half seasons he returned to Northern Ireland to rejoin Ballymena in August 1970. He was appointed player-manager in 1971 and won the City Cup in his first season in charge: Ballymena's first trophy for eleven years. He earned the Ulster Footballer of the Year title in 1973/74 as Ballymena pushed close for honours, only to lose out to Ards in both the Irish Cup and Blaxnit Cup finals. Over the next few seasons success was limited to the Gold Cup, with a win in 1974 and a final defeat by Coleraine in 1975 preceding Stewart's departure early in 1976. In March 1976, Stewart signed as a player with Distillery, but departed for a lucrative five-month spell in the American Soccer League with New Jersey Americans. He returned to the Irish League early in the 1976‚Äì77 season, taking in brief spells with Bangor and Cliftonville before he accepted a return to Glentoran as player-manager in May 1977. Stewart's role as both experienced tactician and seasoned player aided Glentoran to some early successes. They embarked on a European Cup campaign which would take them past Icelandic side Valur and within a whisker of a famous draw with Juventus. The Gold Cup was won again, but the League title lost to Linfield. In December 1978, Stewart resigned as Glentoran manager to take the over as head coach at New Jersey Americans. He returned to Northern Ireland as manager of Ballyclare Comrades in 1981 and later managed Ballymoney United.Ballymena Times, 30 October 2007 Brother Allen Stewart (Ballymena united, Crusaders)  References   External links  *Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats Category:1942 births Category:Association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Detroit Cougars (soccer) players Category:Northern Ireland international footballers Category:Ulster Footballers of the Year Category:Glentoran F.C. players Category:Glentoran F.C. managers Category:Derby County F.C. players Category:Ballymena United F.C. players Category:Ballymena United F.C. managers Category:Bangor F.C. players Category:Lisburn Distillery F.C. players Category:Cliftonville F.C. players Category:NIFL Premiership players Category:English Football League players Category:New Jersey Americans (ASL) players Category:American Soccer League (1933‚Äì1983) players Category:Expatriate association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:Expatriate sportspeople from Northern Ireland in the United States Category:2018 deaths Category:Ballymoney United F.C. managers Category:Ballyclare Comrades F.C. managers Category:United Soccer Association players Category:Association football wing halves Category:Sportspeople from Ballymena Category:Football managers from Northern Ireland ","title":"Arthur Stewart (footballer)"},{"id":"24391962","text":"Sanjaya Sinh (also known as Sanjay Singh, born 25 September 1951) is an Indian politician and a former member of the Rajya Sabha. He was twice elected to the Legislative Assembly of Uttar Pradesh during the 1980s and held state ministerial posts. In 1990, he became a member of the upper house of the Parliament of India, which is known as the Rajya Sabha, and in 1998 he was elected to the lower house, called the Lok Sabha. His term in the 12th Lok Sabha session lasted until the following year. Subsequently, in 2009, he was successful in obtaining a second term in that house as a member of the 15th Lok Sabha representing the Sultanpur constituency of Uttar Pradesh. He represented the state of Assam in the Rajya Sabha. He resigned from Rajya Sabha and Indian National Congress to join Bharatiya Janata Party on 30 July 2019. Singh has held various ministerial portfolios and committee positions over the years, including as Union Minister for Communications in 1991. Background Sanjay Singh was born on 25 September 1951. His father was Raja Rananjay Singh. He married his first wife Garima Singh in 1973, with whom he has a son and two daughters. He obtained a decree of divorce with Garima in 1995. However the decree was annulled by the Allahabad High Court on appeal and later by the Supreme Court of India. He married Ameeta Singh in April 1995. He also adopted Ameeta's daughter from her previous marriage. A part of his education was at the city's Ranvir Rananjay Post-Graduate College and he gained an MA in Hindi and a PhD from Awadh University. Aside from his involvement in politics, he has listed his professions as being an agriculturalist, pilot and a social worker. He holds the rank of Major (retired) in the Indian Territorial Army and also has a private pilot's license. Political career Singh had lent support to Sanjay Gandhi when that member of the Nehru-Gandhi family had chosen to contest the Amethi constituency in the elections of 1980. The Amethi area has strong links to the Nehru-Gandhi family and at that time the neighbouring constituency of Rae Bareli was held by Sanjay's mother, Indira Gandhi. He subsequently became a friend of Rajiv Gandhi, who succeeded Sanjay as the representative for Amethi. His association with the Gandhi family \\"shot [him] into political limelight\\", according to The Times of India. However, Singh left the Gandhi-led Indian National Congress (INC) party in 1988 and joined Janata Dal, which was led by a relative of his first wife. Despite a general mood favouring Janata Dal, Singh's attempt to oust Rajiv Gandhi in the 1989 Indian general election did not reflect it and he was heavily defeated by the incumbent. He later changed his allegiance to that of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and in the 1998 Lok Sabha elections he won the Amethi constituency seat. After the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, a colleague of Gandhi in the INC, Satish Sharma, had become the Amethi representative but he neglected his constituents and caused them to flock to Singh. Although Singh stood again as the BJP candidate in the elections of 1999, on that occasion he was faced with a challenge from the widow of Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia, who played heavily on her family's contributions to the area. Singh lost. He rejoined the INC in 2003, choosing to announce his move on the birth anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi. He gained a second term as a member of the lower house of the Parliament of India in the elections of 2009. , he has represented the Sultanpur constituency as a member of the INC. The Lok Sabha profile shows that he has held the following positions: * Member, Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly(two terms) 1980‚Äì1989 * Minister of State, Forests, Animal Husbandry and Dairy Development, Sports and Youth Welfare, Government of Uttar Pradesh 1982‚Äì1985 * Minister of Transport, Uttar Pradesh 1985‚Äì1987 * Member of the Rajya Sabha 1990 * Union Minister, Communications, 1990‚Äì1991 * Elected Member of the 12th Lok Sabha, 1998.

He served from 1 September 2015 to 30 July 2019 as a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Chemicals and Fertilizers. He resigned from Rajya Sabha and Indian National Congress to join the Bharatiya Janata Party on 30 July 2019. Community involvements He has noted \\"games and sports\\" as his \\"favourite pastime and recreation\\" and that his special interests are flying, riding, shooting and swimming. , he was President of the Uttar Pradesh Hockey Association and of the Uttar Pradesh Football Sangh, as well as Vice-President of the All India Football Federation. At that time he was also a member of clubs in Lucknow and New Delhi and was serving on the governing body of the Sports Authority of India. Other involvements included the Delhi Development Authority and the Siri Fort Sports Complex in New Delhi. Singh has an interest in the upliftment of disadvantaged rural populations. and he founded the Rajarshi Rananjay Sinh Jan Kalyan Samiti, which operates primarily in the sphere of providing free healthcare. Since 1998, the organisation has also organised mass marriages on an annual basis, which has been described as \\"pioneering work ... arranging mass marriages of girls of poor people with no distinction based on caste, community, religion or class\\". At various times, Singh has served as an officer or president of numerous schools and colleges in Amethi. He has also been chairman of the Pradesik Co- operative Dairy Federation of Uttar Pradesh. Personal life Murder of Syed Modi Syed Modi, a badminton player who had won numerous national and international titles, was shot dead on 28 July 1988 in Lucknow. The murder attracted worldwide attention. There were suggestions that Modi's wife, Ameeta, was involved in a relationship with Singh, who was a close friend of the couple and at whose house they had married. In late August, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) launched a search of Singh's house. The investigation was urged upon the CBI by the government of Uttar Pradesh and in November 1988, Ameeta Modi, Singh and another politician, Akhilesh Kumar Singh, were charged with conspiracy to commit murder. Four others were charged with the murder itself. Subsequently, Modi, Sanjay Singh and Akilesh Singh successfully challenged the charges laid against them, resulting in the charges against Modi and Sanjay Singh being dropped in September 1990 and those against Akilesh Singh following the same course in 1996. The Supreme Court upheld the rulings of the lower courts. Assault on Sanjay Singh The campaign for November 1989 elections was blighted by large scale violence. Sanjay Singh, campaigning for Janata Dal, was shot at, and had to be hospitalized in serious condition. Disputed divorce and disputed remarriage Singh claims to be married to Modi's widow, Ameeta, but his first wife, Garima, has contested the legitimacy of the marriage. Both the Allahabad High Court and the Supreme Court of India have declared the alleged mutual divorce between herself and Singh in 1995 to be null and void. Singh has accepted the court rulings but denies her claim that they were made because he arranged for an imposter to portray her in the divorce case. Despite the rulings, he maintains that Ameeta is his legally wedded wife.Battle Of Amethi, II, Outlook India. Inheritance dispute In 2014, the marital arrangements resulted in a public dispute regarding property inheritance. Singh and his wife, Ameeta, live at Bhupati Bhawan, a 450-year- old former royal palace in Amethi, Uttar Pradesh, that Garima had to leave around the time of the now-voided divorce. In July 2014, Garima returned to claim the right of inheritance for her son and grandson which she felt was endangered because, she claims, Ameeta had been selling the properties as well as transferring them into the charitable trust headed by her.Royal feud: 50-year-old Bhupati Bhawan Palace in Amethi locked in inheritance battle, The Economic Times.The new squabble at Amethi: Domestic troubles of Sanjay Singh enter the fray, Hindustan Times.

Chrnalogar instructs readers on how to determine if a religious group is manipulative or abusive, and describes techniques of mind control. The book was first published in 1997 by publishers Whitaker House and Control Techniques, and republished in 2000 by Zondervan. A Spanish language edition was published in 2006 by Vida. Author Chrnalogar is a former member of a cult. The Post-Tribune called her a \\"leading cult deprogrammer\\", What Magazine referred to her as \\"an exit counselor and an internationally recognized deprogrammer\\", and she was described on CTV Television Network as \\"an expert in Christian cults\\". The Yearbook of Experts described Chrnalogar as \\"an internationally renowned cult deprogrammer\\". She began her work as a cult deprogrammer in 1980. She operates a business, Freedom From Manipulation, and works with individuals in the United States to assist them to leave cults or manipulative religious groups. In 2006 she resided in Tennessee. Chrnalogar was a member of Church Universal and Triumphant, a group she describes as \\"an abusive New Age church\\". She first encountered the organization's leader, Elizabeth Clare Prophet or \\"Guru Ma\\", in 1979. She experienced a personality change, and was deprogrammed by Ted Patrick. Chrnalogar said that \\"I was so fascinated that someone could change my mind in 24 hours that I asked him if I could go on some jobs with him,\\" and after that she became a deprogrammer. Contents Twisted Scriptures has an intended audience of people stuck in manipulative religious organizations. Chrnalogar writes that some churches manipulate text of the Bible to coerce followers. She describes how individuals can be subjected to mind control in order to become obedient to a religious movement. Readers are instructed to be able to determine how to notice if a church is manipulating the Scriptures or using abusive tactics. \\"Discipleship control is worse than having a domineering mother who tells you whom to marry!. You usually will be viewed as 'going against God' if you act in opposition to the advice of your discipler, but seen only as a headstrong child if you go against the wishes of your mother,\\" writes Chrnalogar in the book. Chrnalogar points out that mind control can be practiced without severe tactics, writing: \\"All that's needed is an environment where the information can be controlled, and more importantly, the way people perceive that information.\\" She cites mind control characteristics identified by Robert Jay Lifton, and asserts that only six of his \\"psychological themes\\" are required in order to manipulate followers in a cult. Michelle K. Witowski of the Post-Tribune characterized Twisted Scriptures as \\"a book designed to free cult victims\\". Leslie Malkin reviewed the book for What Magazine, and commented: \\"Through the questioning of authority, putting biblical scriptures back into context and restoration of critical thinking, Chrnalogar also shows readers how to find the path to freedom.\\" References Further reading  External links *Twisted Scriptures, info at Zondervan Category:1997 non-fiction books Category:Christian countercult movement-related books Category:Zondervan books ","title":"Twisted Scriptures"},{"id":"24392005","text":"Murro is a surname.

He held the British super lightweight title twice between 2006 and 2011, and the EBU European Union super lightweight title between 2012 and 2014. Boxing career Early professional career Daws made his professional debut on 16 April 2003, defeating Danny Gwilym at the Ice Arena in Nottingham. Over next few years he compiled a record of twelve consecutive victories with wins over the likes of Ernie Smith, Karl Taylor and Oscar Hall. On 12 May 2006, he defeated Colin Lynes at the York Hall in Bethnal Green to win the Southern Area light welterweight title. The fight also served as an eliminator for the full British title. British champion Daws fought for the British belt on 12 May 2006, in his very next fight. The contest, once again held at the York Hall, saw Daws defeat Northumbrian boxer Nigel Wright via a 12 round points decision. The new champions reign was however to be short lived with the first defence of the title also resulting in a first defeat. Daws lost the belt to Scotsman, Barry Morrison at the Alexandra Palace in Wood Green, this time by split decision with one judge scoring widely in Daws favour with the other two scoring narrowly to Morrison. Road back to contention Following the Morrison defeat, Daws returned to action in May 2007 with a win over Billy Smith and then challenged former opponent Nigel Wright for Wright's English title on 14 November 2007. The contest with Wright again took place at the York Hall and resulted in a draw meaning that Wright retained the belt. He went on to win three more fights before getting another chance to fight for the English title. His chance came on 11 April 2009, and claimed the belt with a win over Peter McDonagh the Southern Area champion.South London Today McDonagh loses on points to Daws The win gave Daws the opportunity to challenge Ajose Olusegun for his old British title, before Olusegun vacated the belt choosing to fight in an eliminator for the WBC light welterweight instead. This meant that Daws opponent in the other corner for the vacant belt would now be old foe Barry Morrison in a contest to take place on 18 September 2009. The fight itself, at the York Hall once more, saw Daws regain the belt he lost to Morrison and gain revenge over the only man to have beaten him with a 10th round stoppage. Two time British Champion The win over Morrison propelled Daws back to the top of the domestic scene as holder of the British light welterweight title. His first defence was against Welshman Jason Cook on 2 February 2010. Cook, a former European lightweight champion, had taken some time away from the sport only to bounce back and reach the semi-final of the Prizefighter light welterweight tournament. Despite being rocked in the first round Daws did enough to retain the title via a draw with all three judges scoring closely.BBC Sport Daws draws with Jason Cook but keeps title Daws next defence was held on 9 July 2010 against English champion Steve Williams, Daws retained for the second time after Williams sustained two cuts on his eye which forced his corner to pull him out.BBC Sport Daws beats Williams to retain title On 19 February 2011, in his third defence of the title, Daws lost the belt to Ashley Theophane at the Wembley Arena. Despite taking control in the first half of the fight, Theophane came on strong in the second half and knocked Daws down twice in the 9th round to run out an eventual winner over 12 rounds.

He released five albums with Calle 13 before announcing his solo career in 2015. Residente released his debut solo album in 2017. He has won four Grammy Awards and 25 Latin Grammy Awards‚Äîmore than any other Latin artist. Residente has also delved into producing documentaries including Sin Mapa (2009) and Residente (2017) and has directed some of his own music videos. Born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Residente developed an interest in art, music, and left-wing politics at an early age. He studied art at the Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah, Georgia, returning to Puerto Rico in 2003 to work on music with his step-brother, Visitante, with whom he formed Calle 13. Early in his career, his sarcastic and self-deprecating lyrical style garnered both praise and controversy. The group recorded five critically and commercially successful albums. His album Residente was inspired by a DNA test the artist took to learn about his background, and was recorded in various countries around the world featuring a wide range of international musical styles. He has since released the singles \\"Sexo\\" in 2018, \\"Bellacoso\\" (featuring Bad Bunny) in 2019, and \\"Ren√©\\" in 2020. He has been recognized for his social contributions and serves as the face of campaigns for UNICEF and Amnesty International. He has consistently defended education in Latin America and the rights of indigenous peoples. In 2009 he criticized the governor of Puerto Rico Luis Fortu√±o for laying off more than 30,000 public employees. In November 2015, Residente received a recognition award in Barcelona at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates forum due to his commitment to social awareness and for promoting peace. Early life and education Ren√© P√©rez Joglar was born in a hospital in Hato Rey, a sector within the San Juan area. His mother, Flor Joglar de Garc√≠a, is a Puerto Rican actress who was part of the theatrical company called Teatro del 60 (Theater of the 60s). In her student years, she belonged to Juventud Independista Universitaria or JIU (Independent Youth of the University). Ren√©'s father, Reinaldo P√©rez Ram√≠rez, is a labor lawyer, musician and writer. He studied in the Escuela Libre de M√∫sica (Free School of Music). When he was 17, together with Louis Garc√≠a, a trombonist and arranger, they founded the band, Latin Tempo. Reinaldo studied Political Science and Law at the University of Puerto Rico with the idea of contributing to the Independence of Puerto Rico. While he was studying Political Science, he became the president of the Juventud Independista Universitaria (JIU). Immediately after he graduated from the School of Law, he founded a law firm dedicated to representing labor unions. In 1978, he traveled to Cuba as a representative of the youth of Puerto Rico and a member of the Partido Socialista Puertorrique√±o or PSP (Puerto Rican Socialist Party). In the 1980s, he traveled to Nicaragua during the Sandinista Revolution to show solidarity with other Puerto Ricans. Ren√© grew up in a working middle-class neighborhood in Trujillo Alto with his brothers and mother. He was surrounded by art, music and sports from early life. He taught himself to play the guitar and took saxophone and drum classes. At 12 years old, he was part of the school band as a drummer. Since he was young, his interest for drawing and music was evident, but baseball was always his passion, a sport that he practiced for many years until he finished high school. When he finished school, he had to make the tough decision regarding which path to take and chose the arts. He was admitted to the Escuela de Artes Pl√°sticas (School of Visual Arts) in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he obtained his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. He earned a scholarship based on his portfolio and transferred to the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD), where he finished his Masters in Fine Arts. While he was studying in Savannah, Ren√© created his alias \\"Residente Calle 13\\" to relive some memories from his childhood and during his free time began to write poems and rap songs. When he finished his Masters, he traveled to Barcelona, Spain, with the dream of working there. After failing to find employment, he decided to take film courses because he also loved this form of art. During the time he lived in Spain, he screened a short film he directed while he was a student in the SCAD called S=emp2 or sexo = energ√≠a x masa x placer2 (Sex = Energy x Mass x Pleasure2). He presented it in Madrid and won second place in a short film festival of independent films. When he returned to Puerto Rico, he worked on a variety of art projects. He created illustrations and 3D animations for architects. He also worked as a music video editor. During this period, he started to write again, this time from the capital, Old San Juan. Ren√© started to feed his writing with the essence of the boricua (Puerto Rican) life and its lingo. He also connected with the La Perla neighborhood since he lived across from it. All this is reflected in his first album later on. Having reached a better understanding of how and what to write about, Ren√© approached his brother, Eduardo Cabra, to help him with the music. Although many major labels did not pay attention to his music, Ren√© continued his search. It was not until one afternoon when Ren√© was without food in his refrigerator that he desperately called his brother, Gabriel, who recommended that he present his music to White Lion Records, an independent music company responsible for the success of Tego Calder√≥n. He wrote the song \\"Tengo Hambre\\" (\\"I'm Hungry\\") during this period. Elias de Le√≥n, owner of White Lion Records, and his A&R; Director, Karly Rosario, were the first visionaries to see Ren√©'s great potential. Career 2004-06: Career beginnings and Calle 13 debut album Residente performing in New York in 2006. Calle 13 was formed when Residente (real name Ren√© P√©rez Joglar) and his stepbrother Visitante (real name Eduardo Jos√© Cabra Mart√≠nez) began creating music together in 2004. Before forming the group, Residente obtained a master's degree in art from the Savannah College of Art and Design while Visitante had studied music at the University of Puerto Rico. Residente returned to Puerto Rico in 2003. The step-brothers hosted their music on a website, and began searching for a record label in order to release their music commercially. After sending demo tapes to White Lion Records, the duo was offered a record deal. Residente chose White Lion due to his admiration for Tego Calder√≥n, another artist on the label. White Lion president El√≠as de Le√≥n explained that his cousin and A&R; director alerted him to the demo and stated, \\"These weird guys brought this demo. You've got to listen to it.\\" Residente was working at his day job as a draftsman for an architectural firm when he received the call that Calle 13 had been signed. The group then recorded \\"Se Vale T√≥-T√≥\\" and released it as a single to the Puerto Rican radio station WVOZ (Mix 107), where it became a radio hit on the island. To promote the group locally, Residente directed and edited the video for \\"Se Vale T√≥-T√≥\\" with the help of his cousin, which was filmed on a relatively small budget of US$14,000. The duo gained recognition for their controversial song \\"Querido FBI\\", which responded to the killing of Filiberto Ojeda R√≠os, a key figure for the Puerto Rican independence movement. Shortly after, the duo collaborated with Julio Voltio on the single \\"Chulin Culin Chunfly\\", which reached number eight on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart, creating more buzz for the group. After the success of \\"Querido F.B.I.\\" and \\"Chulin Culin Chunfly\\", the duo headed to the studio to record its debut album. When creating music for the record, Residente explained, \\"I didn't care about anything. I had no commitments, I was relaxed.\\"13, On Being Loved And Hated In Latin America|work=National Public Radio|last=Garsd|first=Jasmine|date=April 5, 2014|accessdate=May 2, 2018 According to Residente, the lack of critical recognition and fame gave the rapper to express himself freely on the record. When composing songs for the album, Residente began by writing lyrics and Visitante then constructed his beats to complement the lyrical content. In December of the same year, Residente was invited by the Governor of Puerto Rico to join the campaign against Balas al Aire (Bullets In the Air). Residente and his brother, Eduardo Cabra (nicknamed \\"Visitante\\") composed \\"Ley de Gravedad\\" (\\"The Law of Gravity\\"). At the same time, The New York Times invited Americans to visit Puerto Rico to have the opportunity to meet \\"the first intellectual who reached stardom with Reggaeton\\". His first two songs, along with the song \\"Suave\\", made him well known in Latin America. 2007-08: Residente o Visitante and Los de Atr√°s Vienen Conmigo While writing the follow-up to Calle 13, the duo took a trip to South America to explore areas populated by Latin America's indigenous and African-descended minorities. Residente reflected on the journey, stating, \\"We saw horrible things, but also things that were incredibly beautiful. Some of the contrasts are really intense.\\" Residente described the group's second album, Residente o Visitante album as more introspective and autobiographical than its predecessor. He explained that the group did not feel any pressure to compete with the success of Calle 13, and felt that the recording of Residente o Visitante was a smoother process than the first: \\"The main difference for us this time around was that we had more opportunities, more tools and more money. We were also on tour at the same time, unlike the first. I spent my time writing during the travels, while my brother would write the music.\\" The album's lead single, \\"Tango del Pecado\\", was addressed to the parents of Residente's then- girlfriend, former Miss Universe Denise Qui√±ones, who did not approve of the couple's relationship. \\"Tango del Pecado\\" also created controversy due to the repeated chanting of \\"S√∫bele el volumen a la m√∫sica sat√°nica\\" (turn up the satanic music). Residente asserted that he did not add the line to create a reaction, saying, \\"I never do something expecting something. I do things because I like them.\\" Residente o Visitante debuted on the U.S. Billboard Top Latin Albums chart at number one, displacing Jennifer Lopez's Spanish album Como Ama una Mujer, and on the Billboard 200 at number 52, selling about 12,000 copies in its first week. The group followed with Los de Atr√°s Vienen Conmigo on October 21, 2008. Regarding Residente's performance on the album, Jon Pareles of The New York Times referred to the rapper as \\"a visionary\\", and opined that \\"Few hip-hop or urban acts, in any language, match so much ambition to so much fun.\\" The album experimented with genres such as samba, candombe, and electronica. The album won five Latin Grammys at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2009 including \\"Album of the Year\\". The group generated controversy when Residente was hosting the 2009 MTV Latin America Awards and attempted to inform the audience about a strike in Puerto Rico in protest of governor Luis Fortu√±o's cutting of thousands of government jobs, one of which belonged to Residente's mother. During the ceremony, he referred to Fortu√±o as a \\"son of a whore\\", which generated widespread anger towards the group. Reflecting on the incident \\"I was upset, really upset. But I'm a little more strategic now - I want to speak the truth, but I don't want to diminish the merits of what I'm saying.\\" 2009-2015: Entren Los Que Quieran and Multi Viral Latinoam√©rica\\". On May 2, 2009, Calle 13 performed once again at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico Jos√© Miguel Agrelot for the release of their third album Los de Atr√°s Vienen Conmigo. \\"In The Heights\\" playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda was invited to make an appearance after Residente had seen his acceptance speech for Best Original Score at the 62nd Tony Awards. Backstage, Flor Joglar de Gracia, mother of Residente and little sister ILE, revealed to Miranda their connection to Gilberto Concepci√≥n de Gracia, founder of the Puerto Rican Independence Party. Miranda and Residente have since confirmed their family relation through social media. Residente once again became the subject of debate when the duo traveled to Cuba in March 2010, to perform in front of the American embassy in the country. Before the show, a political prisoner had died in a hunger strike in protest of the Cuban government, and Cuban exiles in Miami criticized the group for performing at such a time. Residente defended the performance, noting that it had been inaccurately reported and that \\"we said things that no artist had said from the stage, like 'here the people are in charge, and the government has to obey.'\\" These events had a major impact on Residente's lyrical style and the subjects he planned to discuss on the new album: \\"What's making me more mature is not about my age, it's about what I'm seeing and living. I'm not saying things carelessly anymore. I'm thinking before I say them.\\" With the lyrics on Entren Los Que Quieran, Residente took a more political approach, inspired by events that transpired after the last album. \\"Calma Pueblo\\" discusses various topics including dishonest politicians, lip-synching in live performances, and payola. Residente also references Calle 13's sponsors with the line \\"Adidas doesn't use me, I use Adidas.\\" Residente has described the lyrics of Multi Viral as \\"more existential\\" and went on to say: \\"Suddenly, I've started to be more aware, or worried, about living and dying. I thought, maybe I can do something bigger than politics\\". 2016-present: Solo career Hoping to understand his genetic background, Residente took a DNA test that revealed his roots trace back to 10 different locations around the World, including Armenia, Ghana, China and his homeland Puerto Rico. Such diversity inspired him to produce what would later result in a solo album, a documentary and a book released via Fusion Media Group (Univision Communications) under the same common title Residente. In April 2015, Residente announced that he was in Siberia working on his debut solo album. Residente released his debut solo album titled Residente in 2017. The album received acclaim from the Latin music academy and mainstream critics winning the Latin Grammy for best urban music album and being named Billboard's Best Spanish Language Album of the Year.https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8078442/best-latin- albums-of-2017-critics-picks During an interview with Billboard, Residente criticized modern Spanish urban music citing it as uninspired, simple, ignorant and redundant.http://reggaeton.com/web/rene-de-calle-13-critica- fuertemente-el-trap-en-los-billboard/ Calle 13 Billboard interview This prompted hip-hop and reggaeton artist Tempo to respond lyrically which led to a highly publicized rap battle. Mainstream Latino journalists declared Residente victorious as well as many mainstream audiences and outlets on social media.http://www.mtv.com/news/3020805/residente-tempo-reggaeton-battle- of-the-century/ MTV news report of Calle 13 vs Tempo His song \\"La Catedra\\" is a 12-minute, 1,900 word record diss track, beating the previous Guinness Book of World record-holders, Eminem and MC Harry Shotta.https://www.univision.com/radio/san-antonio-kbbt-fm/get-to-know- the-1-900-word-song-that-could-break-a-guinness-world-record Residente performing at the MUPA Festival in Panama in 2019 On March 11, 2017, the artist's self-titled documentary, Residente, was released. After receiving the results of his DNA test, the documentary follows Residente on a global journey tracing back his ancestors through different continents and countries. Residente travels to various countries and regions including Siberia, Georgia, Moscow, China, Burkina Faso, Ghana and his home country, Puerto Rico. As he travels through different regions, he collaborates with different local musicians playing indigenous instruments, creating his debut self-titled album, Residente. In April 2018, Residente released the single \\"Sexo\\" in collaboration with American producer Dillon Francis. In the song, Residente theorizes that the main motivation behind all human activity is sex. Residente directed the accompanying music video, which was filmed in Colombia. The upbeat song and colorful video were considered to be a stylistic departure from the more serious, introspective work showcased on his solo album, with Billboard explaining that the song \\"talks about sex in a joyful, all inclusive (the lyrics are intentionally gender-neutral), G-rated manner.\\" In July 2019, Residente released the single \\"Bellacoso\\" featuring Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny. Musically, the song was inspired by Daddy Yankee and the lyrical content was inspired by feminist resistance, with the song advocating for consent and denouncing sexual harassment. The music video, filmed in Puerto Rico, was directed by French cinematographer Gregory Ohrel. Residente released a collaboration with Bad Bunny titled \\"Afilando Los Cuchillos\\" (\\"Sharpening the Knives\\"), a political polemic against Puerto Rican governor Ricardo Rossell√≥. He took part in mass protests against this governor, alongside Bad Bunny and Ricky Martin. In February 2020, Residente released the single \\"Ren√©\\". The introspective song discusses depression and the killing of a close friend of the rapper by police. The seven-minute music video, directed by Residente, features the artist standing on a baseball field, reflecting on his childhood and career. He described creating the song and video as therapeutic, explaining \\"It makes me feel like maybe people will know me a little bit more, and knowing that makes me feel better.\\" In May 2020, he released the song and accompanying music video for \\"Antes Que El Mundo Se Acabe\\", which features couples from all around the world kissing, including celebrities such as Bad Bunny and girlfriend Gabriela, Lionel Messi and his wife Antonela, and Ricky Martin and his husband Jwan Yosef.  Luis Fortu√±o comments On October 15, 2009, Calle 13 won the Premios MTV Latinoam√©rica for \\"Best Urban Artist\\". P√©rez hosted the ceremony, and used this exposure to insult Puerto Rican governor Luis Fortu√±o and comment about a civilian general strike that was organized earlier that day, held to protest the firing of more than 25,000 public employees by Fortu√±o's administration. P√©rez generated much controversy after referring to Fortu√±o as an \\"hijo de la gran puta\\". The phrase is commonly translated as \\"son of a bitch\\", although the phrase places emphasis on the mother of the subject being a prostitute, which many found disrespectful to Fortu√±o's mother. Fortu√±o responded by saying \\"This individual disrespected all Puerto Rican women, all Puerto Rican mothers and the people of Puerto Rico in general.\\" Social work, education and recognition Humanitarian efforts * In February 2011, the group had three shows in Luna Park of Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was requested at the entrance that the fans donate powder milk or school materials for people in need. On May 10, 2011, Calle 13 appeared on the well-known Jimmy Kimmel show in the United States. Ren√© took advantage of the opportunity to share a political message, as he usually does. He wore a T-shirt that read, \\"Pa'l carajo la cuota\\" (\\"To hell with the quota\\"), alluding to the controversial quota of $800 that was imposed on the students of the University of Puerto Rico. * After taking the T-shirt off, he revealed two messages written on his body. On the front, there was a message that read, \\"No al gasoducto\\" (\\"No to the pipeline\\"), in reference to the Via Verde project pushed by Luis Fortu√±o, Governor of Puerto Rico (a pro-annexationist), for the use of natural gas that he wanted to build in the northern mountains of the Island for which he had already expropriated several rural homes and that would cause a great deforestation with the potential of causing a catastrophe of great proportions. On his back, the message read \\"Patagonia sin represas\\" (\\"Patagonia without dams\\"), protesting the Chilean megaproject, Hydroays√©n. * In November 2011, Calle 13 joined UNICEF in its campaign against the trade and exploitation of children. As part of this project, they filmed a documentary in collaboration with MTV Exit named, Esclavos invisibles (Invisible Slaves), and donated the track, \\"Preparame la cena\\" (\\"Prepare Me Dinner\\"), from the album Entren los que quieran. * In November 2011, Residente and his band Calle 13 performed in a concert in El Salvador, where the money to buy the tickets was collected in rice and beans, which were later given to the people affected by the major storms that hit the country during two weeks.http://www.laprensagrafica.com/fama/espectaculos/230727-calle-13-en-el- salvador-a-cambio-de-arroz-y-frijoles-para-afectados-por-lluvias.html * On May 25, 2012, they exchanged tickets for food again (beans and rice). This time, it was in Hermosillo, Mexico, where they were able to collect more than 40,000 pounds (20,000 kilos) of food for the poorest community of the region. * On May 26, 2012, they participated in the Wirikuta Fest in Mexico City in support of Frente en defensa de Wirikuta (the Front in defense of Wikiruta). Wirikuta is a sacred desert that extends through more than 345,000 acres (140,000 hectares) in the City of San Juan de Potosi.

He served as Bishop of Richmond from 1945 until his death in 1958. Biography Ireton was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to John and Mary (n√©e Sheridan) Ireton; his father was from County Wexford, Ireland. He studied at St. Charles College in Catonsville and at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore. He was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal James Gibbons on June 20, 1906. He then studied for a year at the Apostolic Mission House in Washington, D.C. Returning to Baltimore, he served as a curate at St. Gregory's Church until 1926, when he became pastor of St. Ann's Church in the same city. He became instrumental in founding the Junior Holy Name Society and the Big Brother Movement. He was named a Domestic Prelate in 1929. On August 3, 1935, Ireton was appointed Coadjutor Bishop and Apostolic Administrator of Richmond, Virginia, and Titular Bishop of Cyme by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration at the Baltimore Cathedral on the following October 23.

Modern typography was a reaction against the perceived decadence of typography and design of the late 19th century. It is mostly associated with the works of Jan Tschichold and Bauhaus typographers Herbert Bayer, L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, El Lissitzky and others.  Design concept  Modern typography reflected a modern, universal method of communication. This design concept assumes passive, almost automatic ‚Äì subconscious visual experience. It counts on rationality of both, graphic designer/producer of the message and the audience that is receiving the message. The act of perception that is involved is simple act of seeing; reader is passive, detached and objective. \\"[Typographic style and layout] do not obstruct the transmission of meaning.\\" McLuhan, M (1968) The Guttenberg Galaxy. University of Toronto Press. p. 258 Jan Tschichold codified the principles of modern typography in his 1928 book, New Typography. He later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in this book as being fascistic, but it remained very influential.  Typeface  The hallmark of early modern typography is the sans-serif typeface. \\"Because of its simplicity, the even weight of its lines, and its nicely balanced proportions, sans serif forms pleasing and easily distinguished word patterns ‚Äî a most important element in legibility and easy reading.\\"  Objective  The Modern typography states as its first objective to develop its visible form out of the functions of the text. For modernist designers it is essential to give pure and direct expression to the contents of whatever is printed: \\"Just as in the works of technology and nature, 'form' must be created out of function. Only then can we achieve typography that expresses the spirit of modern man. The function of printed text is communication, emphasis (word value), and the logical sequence of the contents.\\" \\"The trend in modern typography is definitely toward simplicity and legibility, employing forms that comply with the natural inclination of the human eye to seek harmony and ease.\\"  Model of vision  Modern interpretation of the message assumes objectivity and neutrality. Graphic design, processed through print technology, translates problems and experiences into a visual linear order. There is a single point of view. The designer believes that he/she should control what would be seen. This model of vision rejects interplay between a viewer and image and affirms that our internal makeup does not alter the impressions we receive. The modern designer's objective is to control the viewer's detached visual component so that information is transmitted seamlessly. In attempting to control the eye, modern design dismissed the creativity of viewing. Beatrice Warde wrote a famous article about rules for typography in modern print in 1932. According to her everything about a 'container' is \\"calculated to reveal and not to hide the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain.\\" To make a good choice of typography, for modernist designer is not a question of \\"How should it look?\\" but \\"What must it do?\\" Warde B: \\"The Crystal Goblet\\", (1932). The essay was first given as an address to the Society of Typographic Designers in London. Later published in The Crystal Goblet ‚Äì Sixteen Essays on Typography, pp. 91‚Äì92. World Publishing, 1956. B. Ward pushes to the extreme when she says, \\"type well used is invisible as type.\\" She denies artistic quality to the printed piece because in her opinion that would mean that its mission is the expression of the designer's self, and not fulfillment of its primary function ‚Äì conveying the message. These statements are in line with modernist simplicity of Bauhaus, Constructivism, Futurism and their claim that typography, like architecture, must be functional.

Biography United States Post Office, Flushing, New York Baum was born in Newville, New York (near Utica) and moved to Syracuse as a young man, eventually graduating from Syracuse University in 1909 with an architecture degree. He worked for nationally known firms Boring and Tilton and Stanford White before venturing out with his own residential design firm around 1912. A 1922 visit to Florida led to an important commission from John Nicholas Ringling, the 30-room mansion and estate that the Ringlings dubbed C√† d'Zan, which is now on the grounds of the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art. During the 1920s Florida land boom, Baum designed a half-dozen significant civic buildings and several houses in Sarasota, and at least one residence in Tampa, all in the Mediterranean Revival Style. John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota, Florida In 1926 Baum designed forty two Mediterranean Revival style houses of varying sizes in the City of Temple Terrace, Florida, this is thought to be the largest collection of his work in the Southeast. He also designed Sunset Hill for Mrs. Eugene D. Stocker at Warren, New York in 1923-1924. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. During the Depression, Baum became involved with historic preservation issues, becoming involved with Good Housekeeping Magazine as consulting architect, and as designer of their building exhibit at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair. His later work includes buildings at his alma mater, Syracuse University (notably the focal point of the campus plan, the Hendricks Chapel, designed with John Russell Pope), and the pedestal for V.

From 1990 to 1999, the festival was known as the Yubari International Fantastic Adventure Film Festival. History In 1990, the last coal mine in the Hokkaid≈ç mining town of Y≈´bari having closed, the city leaders were looking for a way to revitalize the local economy. This was the beginning of the Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival. The festival was divided into two main programs, a prestigious international competition for young directors, and an Off Theatre program for mostly Japanese amateur, independent and first-time directors. The first year in 1990 had as a special guest, actor Jon Voight and his daughter, a young starlet named Angelina Jolie. In 1993, Quentin Tarantino was at the festival and wrote part of the screenplay for Pulp Fiction in his hotel room. Some years later, he paid homage to the town in the name of a character in Kill Bill: Volume 1, \\"Gogo Yubari\\". In 1996 the festival also had special guest stars, comedians Steve Martin and Martin Short. In 2004 the festival drew a record audience of 27,000. The festival had always been sponsored financially by the city of Yubari but the town filed for bankruptcy in 2007 and that year's festival had to be cancelled. However, the people of Yubari with the assistance of a number of sponsors were able to group together to revive the festival in 2008. The international competition section of the festival had to be dropped but the Off Theatre program for young Japanese directors was retained with the Grand Prize bringing 2 million yen (about $20,000) to the winner. The new Governor's Award was presented by the Governor of Hokkaid≈ç. In addition to the competition section, the festival continued to screen a number of international films by promising directors. One of the sponsors for the festival is the giant Japanese satellite broadcasting company SKYPerfecTV! which has also broadcast parts of the program. The scaled down 2008 festival drew more than 8800 fans and attendance increased to over 10,500 in 2009.

Since its founding in 1886, the AFL-CIO and its predecessor bodies have been the dominant labor federation (at least in terms of the number of member workers, if not influence) in the United States. As of 2014, the labor federation had approximately 12.7 million members.Form LM-2 Labor Organization Annual Report. AFL-CIO National Headquarters. File Number 000-106. June 30, 2008. Accessed 2009-09-19 As of 2015, the AFL-CIO had 56 member unions. Historical context AFL forms On December 8, 1886, the five-year-old Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions dissolved itself and became the American Federation of Labor (AFL).Dubofsky, Melvyn and Dulles, Foster Rhea.

Rev. and exp. ed. New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., 1966. In its first half-century, a large number of trade and labor unions formed, joined the AFL, and either merged with other unions or ceased to exist. Many unions, particularly those in the construction industry and affiliated building trades,Palladino, Grace. Skilled Hands, Strong Spirits: A Century of Building Trades History. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2005. disaffiliated from the AFL for a variety of reasons. Some rejoined; some did not. Throughout the AFL's history, jurisdictional issues caused a number of disaffiliations.Foner, Philip S. History of the Labor Movement in the United States.

In contrast to its early rival, the Knights of labor, the AFL had adopted a policy of forming and admitting to membership (with a few limited, and notable, exceptions such as the United Mine Workers and Brewery Workers) only craft unions‚Äîunions whose membership was limited to workers with a single, narrow skill-set. But industrialization, with its emphasis on teams rather than individual workers manufacturing a product, disadvantaged craft unions in the drive to organize workers. A notable example was the effort to unionize the steel industry, where the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers' adherence to craft unionism was a factor in the failure of many unionization drives.Brody, David. Steelworkers in America: The Nonunion Era. New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1969. ; Brody, David. \\"The Origins of Modern Steel Unionism: The SWOC Era.\\" In Forging a Union of Steel: Philip Murray, SWOC, and the United Steelworkers. Ithaca, N.Y.: ILR Press, 1987. Some unions, including some large ones such as the Mine Workers, began advocating for a shift toward industrial unionism, where a union would organize all workers (regardless of skills) in a single company, market, or industry.Galenson, Walter. The CIO Challenge to the AFL: A History of the American Labor Movement. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1960. ; Phelan, Craig. William Green: Biography of a Labor Leader.

CIO splits 1936‚Äì1955 The battle between the craft and industrial union philosophies led to a major membership loss for the AFL in 1935. In the first years of the Great Depression, a number of AFL member unions advocated for a relaxation of the strict \\"craft union only\\" membership policy but to no avail.Bernstein, Irving. The Turbulent Years: A History of the American Worker, 1933-1941. Paperback ed. Boston: Houghton-Mifflin Co., 1970. In 1932, Mine Workers president John L. Lewis privately proposed to several like-minded union presidents that those unions which wanted to organize workers on an industrial basis form a group to begin to do just that.Dubofsky, Melvyn and Van Tine, Warren. John L. Lewis: A Biography. Reprint ed. Champaign, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1992. The group met informally for three years, and lost a number of jurisdictional battles over potential or newly organized workers. Eight national unions formally organized themselves into the Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) on November 9, 1935. On September 10, 1936, the AFL suspended all 10 CIO unions (two more had joined in the previous year) and their four million members. In 1938, these unions formed the Congress of Industrial Organizations as a rival labor federation. Over the next 20 years, both the AFL and CIO would lose member unions. The AFL would purge some member unions for advocating industrial unionism (notably the United Auto Workers and the United Rubber Workers) or for supporting political philosophies it felt were antithetical to its purposes. It also reaffiliated some unions which had joined the CIO. The CIO, for its part, expelled a number of unions in 1948 after concluding they had become infiltrated by Communists (at least one additional union disaffiliated rather than be expelled). Both the AFL and CIO would form new unions to compete with those they had expelled, with varying degrees of success. AFL-CIO 1955‚Äì1999 By the early 1950s, however, the disagreement over craft and industrial unionism had largely ceased to exist. In 1955, the AFL and CIO merged to forming a new entity known as the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO).Goldberg, Arthur J. AFL-CIO: Labor United. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1956. Over the next five decades, the AFL-CIO continued to gain and lose member unions. After a series of particularly divisive union raids on one another as well as repeated jurisdictional squabbles, the AFL adopted Article 20 of its constitution, which prevented its member unions from raiding one anotherLevey, \\"Union Raiding Ban Drafted By A.F.L.,\\" New York Times, August 14, 1954.‚Äîa policy retained in the AFL-CIO constitution. Theoretically, violation of Article 20 could lead to expulsion, but corruption soon became much more important than jurisdictional issues. After hearings by the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management led to major revelations regarding the dominance of several AFL-CIO unions by organized crime, new rules were enacted by the AFL-CIO's Executive Council that provided for the removal of vice presidents engaged in corruption as well as the ejection of unions considered corrupt.Loftus, Joseph A. \\"Meany Summons Council to Weigh Beck Suspension.\\" New York Times.

Membership changes continued, albeit at a markedly lower level, throughout the last four decades of the 20th century. On a few occasions, unions in the construction industry disaffiliated and reaffiliated. The most important membership changes, however, occurred in 1968. The United Auto Workers (UAW) disaffiliated from the AFL-CIO on July 1, 1968, after UAW President Walter Reuther and AFL-CIO President George Meany could not come to agreement on a wide range of national public policy issues or on reforms regarding AFL-CIO governance.Lichtenstein, Nelson. The Most Dangerous Man in Detroit: Walter Reuther and the Fate of American Labor. Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1995. A few days after the UAW's disaffiliation, the UAW and the Teamsters formed a new labor federation, the Alliance for Labor Action (ALA).Janson, Donald. \\"U.A.W. and Teamsters Form Alliance.\\" New York Times.

Cape Bathurst is the northernmost point of mainland Northwest Territories and one of the few peninsulas in mainland North America protruding above the 70th parallel north. The first European to see the area was John Richardson, who also named it, in 1826. Some coast areas of Cape Bathurst are being eroded at a rate of a year. Baillie Island is located just off the coast of Cape Bathurst, separated from the peninsula by a shallow strait. A notable nearby formation is Smoking Hills, a group of hills exhibiting continuous burning of oil shale deposits. A rare endemic plant known as hairy rockcress or hairy braya (Braya pilosa, genus Braya of family Brassicaceae) is known to grow in five locations on Cape Bathurst as well as the nearby Baillie Islands. The plant is listed by the Northwest Territories Species at Risk Committee as threatened and by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada as endangered.Hairy Braya NWT Species Status ReportCOSEWIC Assessment and Status Report on the Hairy Braya Braya pilosa in Canada In fiction and popular culture Cape Bathurst features as a key location in Jules Verne's novel The Fur Country. In this novel, Cape Bathurst is not a fixed geographical feature but is instead a large iceberg anchored to the continent. A Hudson's Bay Company expedition is ordered to establish a fort above the 70th parallel north to support fur trapping. The expedition leaders are misled by the appearances of Cape Bathurst into thinking it is a favorable place for settlement. For all intents the cape appears to be very suitable since it has fresh water and is well wooded, with rich soil, vegetation, and abundant wildlife. After building Fort Good Hope they prepare to winter over.

At approximately 49 acres (19.8 hectares) in size, it is the largest island of the Dry Tortugas. Despite being uninhabited, the island receives visitors, such as day visitors and campers. The island only has a few built structures, including the Dry Tortugas Light and a lightkeeper's house that was constructed in the 1920s. The island has drinking water derived using desalination technology and solar power. The Carnegie Marine Biological Laboratory operated on Loggerhead Key from 1904 to 1939. Etymology Loggerhead Key is named after the loggerhead sea turtle, an endangered marine reptile and species of sea turtle with a cosmopolitan distribution throughout the world. Coral reefs The Little Africa coral reef is located at Loggerhead Key. The reef is home to various species of tropical fish, spiny lobster and several juvenile game fish. Coral types include \\"various species of stony and gorgonian coral\\". Flora and fauna The flora of Loggerhead Key includes mangrove, coconut palms, geiger trees, morning glory, sea lavender and cactus. In the 1840s, the island was covered with white buttonwood trees, which were burned or cut down by island inhabitants. Bay cedar existed on the island in the early 1900s. Fauna of Loggerhead Key includes sea turtles, which are monitored by park rangers with the Dry Tortugas National Park to document nesting and hatching rates. The loggerhead sea turtle is also present on the island. In August 2016, a National Park marine biologist stated that 113 loggerhead turtle nests existed on the island at that time. This was the highest recorded nest rate compared previous years. The island also has brown pelicans. Former rhesus macaque habitat In 1972, hundreds of rhesus macaque monkeys were brought from India to Loggerhead Key by Charles River Laboratories. This was done to provide the monkeys a place to breed, to supply the animals for medical research laboratory experiments. Around 1,322 of the monkeys existed on the island between 1987‚Äì1990. Dry Tortugas Light The Dry Tortugas Light on Loggerhead Key, with two surrounding buildings The Dry Tortugas Light is a lighthouse located on Loggerhead Key. It began operations in 1858 and was decommissioned in 2014. Carnegie Marine Biological Laboratory The Carnegie Marine Biological Laboratory, also referred to as the Tortugas Laboratory, was a marine biology laboratory and research facility constructed on the northern end of Loggerhead Key that operated from 1904 to 1939. It was constructed and operated by the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The Carnegie Marine Biological Laboratory performed some of the first research on Western hemisphere mangroves and coral reefs, marine life at the Loggerhead Key coral reefs, other marine life, and also performed underwater color and black-and- white photography there. Due to safety concerns regarding the hurricane season, research only occurred in the late spring and summer months. References External links  Loggerhead Key. National Park Service.

Like his successor Bruno Gesche, he was sacked for his Nazi affiliations, and joined the Sturmabteilung (SA) in 1931. Later that year he transferred to the SS. During World War II, Gildisch was wounded and fell into Soviet captivity during the Battle of Berlin. He was released in August 1946. In May 1953, he was convicted in the murder of Dr. Erich Klausener, head of Katholische Aktion (Catholic Action) group, during the \\"Night of the Long Knives\\" in 1934. He was sentenced to fifteen years in prison and died in 1956. Early Life Kurt Gildisch was born in Potrempschen (East Prussia), the fourth child of Paul Gildisch and his wife Marie (nee Riel). In his childhood Kurt Gildisch attended primary school in the village of Potrempschen (23 km south west of Insterburg). Subsequently he was trained as a school teacher. He undertook the schoolteachers test (Lehrerpr√ºfung) in 1924. As he found no opportunities in the teaching profession, he applied for and joined the Prussian police. In October 1925 Gildisch was transferred to Berlin. He was suspended from the police force in 1930 for involvement in Nazi Party activities. He was later dismissed from the police force on 10 March 1931 because of his ties to the Nazi Party. SS career He joined the SA on 1 April 1931 and then transferred to the SS on 29 September 1931. On 29 February 1932, Adolf Hitler chose eight from a prospective twelve SS men presented by Sepp Dietrich to serve as his personal bodyguard, the SS- Begleitkommando des F√ºhrers. One of the handpicked men was Gildisch. He was viewed with mistrust and dislike by Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler. While nominally under Himmler's control, Gildisch and other close comrades of the F√ºhrer took their orders direct from Hitler, much to Himmler's frustration. Gildisch had a heavy drinking problem, which within months of his assuming command of the SS‚ÄìBegleitkommando from Willy Herzberger, got the better of him. On 15 June 1934, Himmler had Gildisch removed from his post because of his heavy drinking habits, and replaced by Bruno Gesche as the commander of the SS-Begleitkommando. Hitler did not interfere, but this was not the end of Gildisch's problems. Despite the warning and demotion, Gildisch continued to drink heavily and this led to his expulsion from both the SS and the Nazi Party in 1936. Prior to that, he had been a significant participant in the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934. Gildisch had been ordered by Reinhard Heydrich to Dr. Erich Klausener's office to shoot him. Klausener had been a transportation official in the Prussian Ministry and head of the Katholische Aktion (\\"Catholic Action\\") group. After the killing on 30 June, Gildisch was promoted in rank to SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer. World War II After the war in Europe began, Gildisch joined the Waffen-SS. He participated in a leadership course at the SS-Junkerschule Bad T√∂lz and on 20 April 1941, he was appointed Untersturmf√ºhrer der Waffen-SS. From 1942 Gildisch actively fought on the Eastern Front where he \\"distinguished himself\\" in combat. In 1944 Gildisch was attached to the 11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Nordland on the Soviet front. In August 1944 Gildisch was wounded on the Eastern Front. On 2 May 1945 Gildisch was wounded again and taken prisoner by Soviet Red Army troops at the end of the Battle of Berlin. Post-war period He was released after the war in August 1946. Upon his return from captivity Gildisch had his right leg amputated and replaced by a prosthesis. Gildisch was for some time incapable of work and due to his personal far-right politics he could seek only limited work options. Kurt Gildisch finally found work after retraining as a bookbinder in an Evangelical-Lutheran maintained company that employed disabled people. In 1949 Gildisch was arrested. After a case at the Berlin court, he was convicted on 18 May 1953 of the murder of Dr. Erich Klausener during the \\"Night of the Long Knives\\" in 1934. He was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Kurt Gildisch died in 1956 of incurable liver disease in a Wilmersdorfer private hospital after the criminal sentence was suspended due to his poor health and lack of available medical treatment in prison.

Inspired by the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, international figures from the worlds of business and culture attend the event. The first Forum was held at Farmleigh in Dublin's Phoenix Park from 18-20 September 2009, and was given widespread coverage by RT√â. The second forum was held at Dublin Castle in 2011.  Background  The idea for the Forum was conceived by economist David McWilliams who then informed the Irish Government. The hosting of the event caused a political disagreement between Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Miche√°l Martin and T√°naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Mary Coughlan. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment sought successful members of the Irish diaspora, with Taoiseach Brian Cowen personally inviting them to attend the event in April. However, Martin claimed that the \\"global Irish family\\" was his department's responsibility. Martin launched the event on the afternoon of 1 September 2009.  Guests  Guests pay their own expenses. Attendees have come from Argentina, Australia, Britain, China, Europe, the Middle East and New Zealand. Michael O'Leary was notably absent because of his lack of popularity with the Irish Government. In alphabetical order, notable guests with international connections include: * Craig Barrett, former CEO of Intel Corporation * Loretta Brennan-Glucksman, chairperson of The American Ireland Fund * John Collison, Limerick-born entrepreneur * Kip Condron, CEO of AXA Financial * Tom Corcoran, senior adviser with the Carlyle Group * Dermot Desmond, financier, entrepreneur and major shareholder of Celtic F.C.. * Moya Doherty, producer of Riverdance and director of Tyrone Productions * Irial Finan, Coca-Cola * John Fitzpatrick, chief executive of Fitzpatrick Hotel Group * Bob Geldof, political activist and former rock star * Basil Geoghegan, managing director of Deutsche Bank in London * James Hogan, CEO of Etihad Airways * PJ Hough, corporate vice president of Microsoft * Neil Jordan, Academy Award-winning film director * Alan Joyce, CEO of Qantas * Declan Kelly, director of American Ireland Fund * Gerald Lawless, Jumeirah group * Myles Lee, CRH plc * Pearse Lyons, founder and president of Alltech of Nicholasville, Kentucky, USA, which is the name sponsor of Muhammad Ali's charity in Louisville * Bob McCann, former head of Merrill Lynch's brokerage business * Stan McCarthy, Kerry Group * Brendan McDonagh, CEO of HSBC North America * Paul McGuinness, manager of U2 * Denis O'Brien, chairman of Digicel * Liam O'Mahony, chairman of Smurfit Kappa * Gerry Robinson, former chairman of Allied Domecq and former chairperson and CEO of Granada * Dan Rooney, United States Ambassador to Ireland * Anita Sands, managing director of Citigroup in New York City * Peter Sutherland, former Attorney General of Ireland * Denis Swanson, president of the Fox Broadcasting Company * Margaret Sweeney, CEO of Postbank * Willie Walsh, British Airways  2009 Forum   Events  Taoiseach Brian Cowen gave the opening address, talking about the concept of a smart economy. A panel discussion then took place on the topic of \\"the global economy: positioning Ireland for the upturn\\" and this was followed by further panel discussions on \\"Ireland--the innovation island\\", \\"promoting brand Ireland through our global cultural profile\\", \\"Ireland‚Äôs image abroad: what is it now, how can it be improved and what role can new media play\\" and \\"Ireland and its Diaspora: harnessing unique resource\\". Those attending also visited √Åras an Uachtar√°in for a meeting with President of Ireland Mary McAleese and Mary Coughlan presented a meal at Dublin Castle. Guests will also attend the All- Ireland Senior Football Championship Final at Croke Park on 20 September. Miche√°l Martin, whose constituency is Cork South-Central, described it as \\"a piece of opportunistic planning by yours truly in anticipation that Cork would reach the final\\".  Controversies  T√°naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Mary Coughlan was ridiculed in the Irish media after crediting Albert Einstein for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. At the launch on 17 September, she made the comparison \\"like Einstein explaining his theory of evolution\\". The incident prompted comparisons with American politicians such as Dan Quayle and Sarah Palin, with the Evening Herald referring to Coughlan in a derogatory manner as a \\"lovely girl\\" and saying she was \\"Ireland's own version\\" of Palin. The error came in the same week as she referred to her Green Party coalition partners as \\"the vegetables\\" during an Irish language radio interview. In an interview with Bloomberg Television at the Forum, shareholder Denis O'Brien said Independent News & Media might shut down its flagship London newspaper The Independent by the end of 2009, saying it was \\"irrelevant\\" and that nobody wanted to read it. O'Brien also advocated a Yes vote during the second Irish referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon, claiming it was \\"essential for setting Ireland on the path to growth\\". Craig Barrett, former CEO and chairman of Intel Corporation, warned delegates that Ireland was spending \\"far too little\\" on education and that \\"schools are a bigger problem than banking\\". Taoiseach Brian Cowen seemed to agree with Barrett. Bob Geldof said countries of a similar size to Ireland, some impoverished, were spending as much as 6 per cent on research and development but that Ireland spends just 2 per cent. He also said Mary Coughlan had \\"a lovely pair of legs\\" which caused her to blush. On the second day of the forum, Irish Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism Martin Cullen expressed his disagreement with proposed cuts in public sending which were suggested by the McCarthy Report. Neil Jordan said Ireland's culture had not disappointed the country in the same way as institutions such as the banks and the Church had done so. Denis O'Brien said Ireland's culture was the key to success, saying his Digicell group obtained a Samoan licence because the Prime Minister's education had come from Irish priests: \\"We are famous for our writers, our artists, our poets and we are not famous for much else\\". There was a consensus amongst those attending that Ireland's banks needed to be reformed. Miche√°l Martin, in his closing remarks to the Forum, said the contributions of the delegates \\"will be taken forward and action will be taken\\", spoke of his hopes to establish an \\"online portal for a virtual community of people of Irish descent to stay in touch\\" and stated he would also focus on non-traditional countries of the Irish diaspora such as Russia.  Reaction  President Mary McAleese praised the \\"‚Äúinterest in and commitment to\\" of those who attended, saying the event showed that Ireland is \\"considerably more than an island on the edge of Europe, but the centre of a vast networked community\\". Martin Murphy, managing director of Hewlitt-Packard Ireland, saw it as an opportunity to \\"truly begin positioning this small, export-driven country for real and sustained economic renewal and growth\\".

Also known as the Florida Scrub or just as the Cracker cow, these cattle are one of the criollo-type breeds originally brought to the Southern U.S. by the Spanish Conquistadors. The breed is very closely related to the Pineywoods cattle breed, but purebred Crackers have not been crossbred with any English breeds, like the Pineywoods has in the past been crossbred. Other related breeds include the Corriente and Texas Longhorn.  History  The Florida Cracker cattle are very similar to another breed known as Pineywoods, however, they share a key difference in their place of origin. Pineywoods come from the Southern states including Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, while Crackers originate from Florida, hence the name. This breed of cattle was among those sent by Spain during the claiming of the New World. Over time the breed was crossed with other breeds, in order to select for desirable traits; this resulted in true pure breed Florida Cracker cattle becoming a rarity. There were however, a small number of families which maintained the pure bloodline, later (in the early 1990s) this task was taken over by the Pineywoods Cattle Registry and Breeders Association, as well as the Florida Cracker Cattle Association. After 1949 the combination of new laws about free-roaming livestock and the introduction of larger beef breeds led to the rapid decline of the Florida Cracker. Despite the continued work of the Florida state government and a breed association, the breed is still listed as \\"critical\\" by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, and is listed on Slow Food USA's Ark of Taste. In 2018, Florida named it the official state heritage cattle breed. Close-up of Florida Cracker cow in the 1980s  Characteristics Florida Cracker cows are one of the oldest and rarest breeds of cattle in United States. Descended from Spanish stock imported to the continent in the 16th century, Florida Crackers cows are a small, horned breed that quickly adapted to the Florida landscape and have long been prized for their resistance to parasites and other hardy traits. They weigh generally under 900 pounds (400 kg), come in many colors, and both males and females are horned. They can be dappled-grey/blue, dappled-brown, solid brown, solid white, white with black spots, white with brown spots, all black, or in some cases, a pure golden palomino. They tend to be more docile and easier to manage by humans, making them a popular choice for cattle roping competitions and for recreational cow-raising activities, such as 4-H. They have an average milk yield in comparison to other cattle but are mainly used for meat purposes as they produce good, quality meat. These very hardy animals are well adapted to native climates and are very heat tolerant, which allows them to graze on low quality forages found on grasslands and in swamps in the Deep South of the United States. A good longevity allows this breed of cattle to live long, purposeful lives.

This state model is constructed using well-understood mathematical entities such as sets and functions. System operations are specified by defining how they affect the state of the system model.

The unJewish state: the politics of Jewish identity in Israel. p. 194 Kurzweil committed suicide in 1972. Thought Kurzweil saw secular modernity (including secular Zionism) as representing a tragic, fundamental break from the premodern world. Where before the belief in God provided a fundamental absolute of human existence, in the modern world this pillar of human life has disappeared, leaving a \\"void\\" that moderns futilely attempt to fill by exalting the individual ego. This discontinuity is reflected in modern Hebrew literature, which lacks the religious foundation of traditional Jewish literature: ‚ÄúThe secularism of modern Hebrew literature is a given in that it is for the most part the outgrowth of a spiritual world divested of the primordial certainty in a sacral foundation that envelops all the events of life and measures their value.‚ÄùCrowsly, Marcus (2006). Being for Myself Alone: Origins of Jewish Autobiography. Stanford University Press. p. 35. Kurzweil saw a writer's response to the \\"void\\" of modern existence as his most fundamental characteristic. He believed S.Y. Agnon and Uri Zvi Grinberg were the greatest modern Hebrew writers. A confrontational polemicist, Kurzweil famously wrote against Ahad Haam and Gershom Scholem, who he saw as attempting to establish secularism as the foundation of Jewish life.

Workers at a nearby brick foundry arrived on scene and claimed they had found human remains scattered over an area of one hundred yards, presumably a result of the explosion. Almost immediately the area was fenced by soldiers. Photojournalists who had taken photos were kidnapped.

The bodies of the unidentified victims were buried in Derqui Pte Cemetery, where they were exhumed years later for identification. The Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team was able to identify eleven more victims. One of the first was Susana Pedrini of Bronzel, after whom they named a street in the center of Pilar, specifically in the square near the water tank..

The Dominican Republic is one of the few countries of the world which have a complete ban on abortion, without an exception for saving maternal life. Abortion has been constitutionally prohibited since September 18, 2009, when a constitutional amendment declaring the right to life as \\"inviolable from conception until death\\" was approved in Congress by a majority vote of 128 to 34. Up until October 2012, women could come forward for treatment without fear of being arrested. Dr. Milton Cordero has been working since 1980 in the republic's public hospitals, treating women who have abortions: he estimates that there are 90,000 illegal abortions per year. These illegal abortions are self- induced or done by a back-alley practitioner. Since the law was passed, abortion has risen to the third leading cause of maternal death in the country.Dr. 1: Abortion in the Dominican Republic. Accessed 2012-12-13.Abortion more common where it's illegal CBS News. Published 2012-01-19. Accessed 2012-12-13. Researchers \\"found a link between higher abortion rates and regions with more restrictive legislation, such as in Latin America and Africa.\\" Abortion methods in the Dominican Republic A common abortion method is to take over-the-counter pills that cause powerful uterine contractions, leading to the expulsion of the fetus. Drugs used include oxytocins, prostaglandins, or ergot alkaloids.Rastegari E.C., Uretsky S. Encyclopedia of Surgery: Uterine stimulants. Accessed 2012-12-14. Women take the pills without knowing the proper dosage, and an overdose can cause serious hemorrhaging. Poor women suffering from hemorrhages go to inexpensive and low- quality clinics. The uterus may be incompletely cleaned out, leading to infection, or even perforated, causing internal bleeding. If a woman survives such complications, she may have reproductive problems in the future. Researchers have found that 95% - 97% of the abortions are unsafe, meaning done by people lacking needed skills or in places that don't meet minimal medical standards. (See Unsafe abortion.) Women who appear at hospitals for post-abortion treatment can not name their practitioner, who would be arrested if caught. A new program to add incentive for using contraceptives is designed to give students an idea of the workload involved in caring for a newborn baby. Called ‚ÄúBeb√©, Pi√©nsalo Bien‚Äù the program was sponsored by The Dominican Republic‚Äôs First Lady, Margarita Cede√±o de Fern√°ndez. In May 2006 as a pilot program was launched at one school in Santo Domingo. The project lends electronic babies to students for a weekend. The program also urges parents to talk about pregnancy and child-rearing with their children. Law The proposal was adopted as Article 37 of the Dominican Constitution: \\"The right to life is inviolable from the moment of conception and until death.\\" Support The initiative was backed by Roman Catholic activists and introduced by President Leonel Fern√°ndez as Proposal 21.Dominican Today Groups rail the Dominican Catholic Church for abortion ban . Published 2009-04-23. Accessed 2012-12-13. Opposition The Dominican Gynecology and Obstetrics Society warned that the number of maternal deaths will increase considerably, because pregnancies can not be interrupted. The society‚Äôs president, Aldrian Almonte, said the current figure of 160 deaths for each 100,000 live births per year will increase, because doctors would be reluctant to proceed from fear of being charged in cases where they must decide on the interruption of a pregnancy to preserve the mother‚Äôs life. Dr. Altamonte asked, ‚ÄúI would like of the honorable legislators to tell me what are we going to do before the presence of a woman with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, convulsing in any emergency room around the country, what must we do, see her die to protect ourselves from the repercussions that Article 30 stipulates?‚Äù. Protest marches were held by the National Resistance to Constitutional Backwardness and the Women‚Äôs Forum for Constitutional Reform. Feminist Denise Paiewonsky asked Congress to amend the article before adopting it; otherwise it would limit women's options for reproductive health. If not one fertilized egg could be discarded, the amendment would outlaw both in vitro fertilization and forms of contraception such as the intrauterine device (IUD) and the day-after pill. Miguel Ceara Hatton, coordinator of the United Nations Program for Human Development, criticized the approved article and the Catholic Church, which in his view has become a motor for ‚Äúsocial exclusion‚Äù in the country. He said, \\"Dogma is placed ahead of the needs of the population, health, housing, and better living conditions.\\" He pointed out that the new Constitution excludes the women‚Äôs right to life. The initiative was lobbied against by Amnesty International, which argued that the new measure \\"could severely limit the availability of safe abortions, even in cases when a woman is suffering from life-threatening complications or is in need of life-saving treatment incompatible with pregnancy ‚Äì such as that for malaria, cancer or HIV/AIDS.\\" Rosario Lopez, president of the Association of Housewives Committees regretted aloud that the Assembly members approved the article without including the some exceptions to protect women and doctors. She pointed out that the article had been adopted without giving Dominicans time to consider the opinion of a team of professionals on the subject. Objections were also made by feminist organizations, institutions, and others who favour legalizing abortion in cases of incest, rape or danger to a woman‚Äôs life. Further criminalization Up until October 2012, women who had abortions could seek medical care without fear of arrest or interrogation. In October, 2012, the Dominican Republic debated Article 90 of the Penal Code, which prescribes criminal penalties for women who seek an abortion and for those who provide it or help provide it. Amnesty International appealed to Parliament to consider decriminalizing abortion, with the following statement:Amnesty International: Dominican Republic must decriminalize abortion. Published 2012-10-23.

The appeal pointed out that unsafe abortion and fear of prosecution contribute to the high rate of maternal mortality that the World Health Organization reports in the country. Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies approved prison terms for inducing or helping with an abortion. \\"Abortion will also be punished with from 2 to 3 years and includes women who induce or a person who helps. If a doctor, nurse, midwife, surgeon, pharmacist or other professional helps induce an abortion, the penalty would be from 4 to 10 years.\\" Dominican Today. Deputies approve a tougher penal code . Published 2012-10-17. Accessed 2012-12-13. Economics of abortion As there is no legal source for abortions, abortion practitioners ask for as much as they think a woman can pay. Women who are better off can pay more and go to a cleaner clinic with a more experienced operator, and run a smaller risk of injury or death. Women who are poor go to a worse clinic with an inexperienced operator. The doctors make an individual agreement with each woman. They may demand that a woman sign a contract freeing the doctor from all responsibility or liability, before they will go ahead with the operation. However, since both parties are criminals in the eyes of the law, numbers of abortions and details about the trade are hard to confirm.Singh S. and Wulf D. Estimated levels of induced abortion in six Latin American countries International Family Planning Perspectives. 1994. Abstract: \\"In countries where abortion is illegal, a range of approximate levels of induced abortion can be calculated from data on the number of women hospitalized for treatment of abortion complications, after correcting for underreporting and misreporting and adjusting to eliminate spontaneous abortions. An estimated 550,000 women are hospitalized each year as a result of complications from induced abortion in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Peru. About 2.8 million abortions are estimated to occur in these countries annually when women not hospitalized as a result of induced abortion are taken into account. If the situation in the six countries is assumed to be typical of the entire region, then about 800,000 women are probably hospitalized because of complications of induced abortion in Latin America in a given year, and an estimated four million abortions take place. The abortion rate most likely ranges from 23 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-49 in Mexico to 52 per 1,000 in Peru, and the absolute number ranges from 82,000 in the Dominican Republic to 1.4 million in Brazil. From 17% of pregnancies in Mexico to 35% in Chile are estimated to end in induced abortion.\\" (1994 figures) \\"Esperancita\\" In July 2012, the Dominican Republic's harsh anti-abortion laws came under fire when a 16-year- old girl known as \\"Esperancita\\" was suffering from acute leukemia and was being denied treatment for her cancer because her chemotherapy might harm or kill the fetus.Sarah Vrba, Abortion Ban Puts Teen‚Äôs Life in Danger in Dominican Republic Care2.com, Published July 27, 2012Rafael Romo, Dominican Republic abortion ban stops treatment for pregnant teen with cancer CNN, Published July 25, 2012 Doctors reportedly feared that they would be prosecuted or lose their right to practice medicine if they treated her.Freya Petersen, Abortion debate heats up in Dominican Republic as pregnant teenager lies dying of cancer, Global Post, Published July 27, 2012 It took 10 weeks of debate before lawmakers decided that it would not be illegal for Esperancita to receive treatment to save her life.Rafael Romo, Chemotherapy starts for pregnant Dominican teen at center of abortion debate Chemotherapy starts for pregnant Dominican teen at center of abortion debate], CNN, Published July 26, 2012 Dr. Antonio Cabrera reported that Esperancita had died on August 17, 2012, shortly after suffering a miscarriage followed by cardiac arrest.Pregnant teen dies after abortion ban delays her chemo treatment for leukemia Rafael Romo, CNN, Published August 18, 2012 She was 13 weeks pregnant at the time of her miscarriage.

In 2011, a sequel was released, Zombie Apocalypse: Never Die Alone. Gameplay Zombie Apocalypse is a multidirectional shoot 'em up. The player controls one of four characters through 55 levels set in seven different areas. The player must rescue survivors, and kill waves of zombies using a range of weapons and the environment. Use of environmental kills rewards the player with more points for their score. Every five kills awards the player with another score multiplier, which resets to one upon death. Each of the game's modes can be played in single or multiplayer.Horrorcade: ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE There are 12 trophies/achievements available. Playing through the game unlocks new modes.

In addition, concealing or misreporting prohibited activities may, depending on the circumstances, be a crime on the part of the individuals or organizations involved. Partisan organizations By contrast, certain other nonprofit organizations are not considered non-partisan: *501(c)(4) organizations, which are tax-exempt, are operated exclusively for promoting social welfare, or local organizations with membership limited to a particular company, municipality, or neighborhood, and which devote their earnings to charity, education, or recreation.See . By contrast with 501(c)(3) organizations they may lobby for legislation and participate in political campaigns and elections, in which case they are not nonpartisan. *501(c)(6) organizations are trade group, chambers of commerce, and other business organizations. They can be nonpartisan, but they may also engage in lobbying and other partisan political activities within certain limitations, provided that donations to these groups are not tax deductible to the extent the donations are used for political purposes. *527 organizations, which are also tax-exempt, may advocate for political issues but not candidates. *political action committees may campaign on behalf of candidates and are not tax exempt. Investigations into partisan activities The Internal Revenue Service, or \\"IRS\\" (America's federal agency for tax regulation, collection, and enforcement), fields complaints from the public that a nonprofit organization has participated in prohibited political activities. In 2006, the IRS stated that although most of the more than one million 501(c)(3) organizations were compliant, it had conducted 100 investigations in response to complaints from the 2004 election season, of which in 59 out of 82 closed cases it had found \\"some level\\" of prohibited activity. It characterized most as minor one-time violations, and issued the offending organizations written advisory letters. It considered three cases serious enough to propose the revocation of the organization's tax-exempt status. The IRS summarized the violations as follows: * Distributing printed materials encouraging members to vote for a particular candidate (9 violations found out of 24 allegations) * Religious sermons endorsing or opposing a candidate (12 violations out of 19 allegations) * Endorsing or opposing a candidate via web content or links (7 violations out of 15) * Distributing improper voter guides or candidate ratings (4 violations out of 14) * Posting campaign signs on organization's property (9 violations out of 12) * Giving preferential treatment to certain candidates at public functions (9 violations out of 11) * Cash contributions to political campaigns (5 violations out of 7) Allegations of partisanship Despite the relative infrequency of sanctions from the IRS, there have been a number of claims made publicly that nonpartisan organizations had engaged in prohibited partisan activities. Some of these include: *In 2009, in the wake of a scandal that emerged following the release of several \\"hidden camera\\" videotapes, Republican politicians called for an IRS investigation of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, claiming the organization had engaged in improper partisan political activities as well as various forms of fraud. The claims were investigated, and no illegality or fraud was found.CRS report: ACORN didn't break law Politico; December 23, 2009 *Churches have occasionally been accused of campaigning for candidates. In most cases the accusations were made against conservative Christian churches for supporting conservative candidates. In the 2006 election season, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed accusations against several churches in Kansas and Minnesota, and other investigations were opened in California, Missouri and Ohio. *In 2008 some gay rights activists called for the IRS to revoke the tax- exempt status of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) over its involvement in California Proposition 8, the initiative to amend the California Constitution to permit only heterosexual marriages. The Church responded that it was individual members, not the church itself, that had donated money to the pro-Proposition 8 campaign, and that any lobbying it was doing on the subject was permissible because it was not \\"substantial\\" in proportion to the Church's overall finances. Occasionally, the IRS, or the party making accusations of partisanship, is itself accused of acting on the basis of a political agenda. The All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena, California was investigated over an anti-war sermon posing a hypothetical debate between George W. Bush and John Kerry moderated by Jesus Christ. The IRS concluded that the sermon was in violation of the tax code but did not explain its conclusion, and took no action against the church. The church, in turn, accused the IRS of meddling in politics and asked for an apology. Additionally, there are concerns that putting the IRS in the role of classifying certain speech as political or apolitical runs a risk of suppressing protected speech, which would violate the First Amendment constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech. In 2008 the Alliance Defense Fund, a conservative Christian organization, recruited 35 churches to conduct sermons urging their congregation to vote for John McCain in the United States presidential election, as an act of civil disobedience, intending to make a test case over the power of the IRS to prohibit churches from endorsing candidates. In turn, others argue that allowing churches to support candidates would violate another provision of the First Amendment, the Establishment Clause, which is interpreted to prohibit the granting of tax-exempt status to political activities undertaken by religious institutions.

His father Wilfred (1878-1941) was a bassoonist in the Queen's Hall Orchestra and professor at the Royal College of Music. His uncle Edwin (1861-1921), also a fine bassoonist, was a founding member of the London Symphony Orchestra in 1904. His uncle Frank was second trumpet with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Cecil studied with his father, won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. There, in 1933, he performed the Mozart Concerto with Orchestra and shortly after was appointed to the London Symphony Orchestra. It was there he met oboist Natalie Caine whom he married in 1938. During the war, he played with the Royal Air Force Central Band alongside Gareth Morris, Leonard Brain, Dennis Brain, Norman Del Mar, Harry Blech, Fred Grinke, Leonard Hirsch, Jim Merrett and James Whitehead. When demobbed, he joined the New Symphony, then in 1951 was appointed by Walter Legge as principal bassoonist with the Philharmonia Orchestra, playing under such conductors as Guido Cantelli, Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, Herbert von Karajan, Otto Klemperer and Arturo Toscanini. He also in demand for inclusion in chamber groups such as Karl Haas's London Baroque Ensemble and the Dennis Brain Quintet, usually with musicians he admired, such as his wife Natalie, Dennis Brain, Wilfred Parry and, especially, fellow bassoonist Paul Draper. Cecil's instrument, a Buffet-Crampon bassoon which had been presented to his father by the makers, was made to the French 'Buffet' pattern - quite distinct from those of the more modern German 'Heckel' system which he derided as 'mumblephones', but were clearly taking over as instruments of choice. He always made his own reeds. He never held a formal teaching position and only rarely took pupils; his irascible temper was legendary, though he mellowed a little with age and the desire to promote use of antique instruments.

J. Smith's novel series The Vampire Diaries. He is portrayed by Paul Wesley in the television series CW's The Vampire Diaries and The Originals. Stefan Salvatore was turned into a vampire in 1864, at the age of 17, by Katherine Pierce, who also turned his older brother Damon Salvatore. Casting and reception On March 27, 2009, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Paul Wesley had joined the cast of The Vampire Diaries as Stefan. He was the last main cast member whose casting was announced. Wesley has become popular with viewers. Carina MacKenzie of the Los Angeles Times noted that he spent \\"10 years as a successful but under-the-radar TV actor\\" but shortly after the show premiered, he was \\"everywhere\\". MacKenzie wrote: \\"Last summer his face was on more than 30 \\"Vampire Diaries\\" posters at the Century City/Westfield mall alone, not to mention billboards over seemingly every major boulevard in Hollywood\\". In November 2011, Wesley's ex-wife Torrey DeVitto joined the cast of The Vampire Diaries in the recurring role of Dr. Meredith Fell, who is \\"intrigued by\\" Alaric Saltzman (Matt Davis). Development  Characterization  Stefan was described as a \\"beautiful young man\\" who turns out to be a Vampire 171 years old, who develops a \\"strong connection\\" with \\"tragic heroine\\" Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev). Wesley described the young Stefan as \\"naive and willing to ride whatever wave life threw\\" him, because he was \\"easily manipulated\\" and \\"innocent\\" with a \\"beautiful young soul\\". However, Stefan at the age of 160 years has more wisdom in him. Stefan consumes animal blood, refusing to kill humans due to the guilt that he killed his own father. Damon on the other hand, does feed on humans. Relationships Stefan has a love-hate relationship with his brother, Damon Salvatore (Ian Somerhalder). Wesley \\"adores\\" Somerhalder, who he said he has \\"natural chemistry\\" with. Wesley stated: \\"The dynamic of the characters is so interesting because they love each other, but they hate each other [...] There's always this thing in Stefan's head where he hopes that one day Damon can just be as normal and functioning as possible\\". However, he also described their relationship as \\"beautiful\\" in their flashbacks from the past, because they \\"loved each other so much back then\\". Stefan begins a romance with Elena on the show's first episode, without telling her he was a vampire. She was later shocked to find out that he was a vampire, and briefly ended their relationship before getting back together. As the show progressed, Elena began developing feelings for Damon as well. Wesley described Damon and Stefan as having a \\"silent understanding of the fact that they both are in love with the same girl\\", and \\"that was Stefan's girl, and now Damon is suddenly a real factor, he's really in the picture\\". Wesley's favorite episode of The Vampire Diaries is \\"The Turning Point\\" because it was \\"really beautiful\\" for Stefan and Elena as a couple. In the episode, Stefan turns around \\"because he's ashamed of his face\\" with blood rushing through his eyes and his veins popping out. Wesley said \\"he's terrified, and he hates himself for it. He runs from that part of himself, but she turns him around and tells him not to be afraid. She touches his face, and she thinks he's beautiful. It's so intimate, that moment, because she accepts the darkest part of him.\\" Wesley with Nina Dobrev (Elena) and Ian Somerhalder (Damon). When the original vampire Klaus Mikaelson (Joseph Morgan) is feared dead, it is revealed that everyone in his bloodline will die, including Stefan and Damon. In what International Business Times called \\"the moment Vampire Diaries fans have been waiting for\\", Elena had to pick to say goodbye to Stefan or Damon. She ended up choosing Stefan. When Elena became a vampire, her feelings for Damon heightened, and it was later revealed that she had a sired bond to him. Elena and Stefan broke up, and she began a romance with Damon. Stefan became heartbroken, feeling angry and betrayed, and lashed out at Damon and Elena. Wesley urged fans of Stefan and Elena not to lose hope, stating: \\"The fans should definitely maintain some hope. The thing to remember is that Stefan and Elena have this love that is so strong, and it was sort of the core of Season 1 ‚Äî you can‚Äôt entirely disregard that\\". The show's head writer, Julie Plec, said \\"They love each other as deeply as two people can love each other, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that their relationship is infallible\\".  Blood addiction  In 1864, Stefan \\"hadn't yet learned the careful control that rules his life now\\" and was an avid consumer of human blood, which was considered a \\"dark past\\" by Zap2it. Of his blood addiction, Wesley said: \\"It's awesome. It's a drug. He's a drug addict. I get to play a drug addict, which I love. I'm going back to his days of usage, heavy usage. When I'm in my lustful state, it's so much fun. I felt like I got to play a role that I'd never played before. I felt like I was doing something different. I just love it, and I hope it comes out the way that I envisioned.\\" The show's executive producer Kevin Williamson revealed that he was \\"looking forward to Stefan eventually falling off the wagon and drinking human blood again\\" after spending decades of consuming only animal blood. Wesley said \\"everybody has a dark side, especially a vampire, and it'd be unrealistic not to explore that\\". Stefan became addicted to human blood again, but got it under control with the help of Elena, who began letting him feed off her in small amounts to build up discipline. However, in the show's third season, Stefan's addiction returned. His humanity was taken away by Klaus, and the audience met \\"The Ripper\\", his \\"bloodthirsty, ruthless alter- ego who had previously only been legend\\" according to Zap2it, who found \\"this sociopath version of our hero far more compelling than his usual compassionate martyr self\\". Wesley, who enjoyed \\"Ripper Stefan\\" more, said it \\"bums me out\\" when Stefan quit human blood again. He said \\"Good Stefan doesn't feel as natural in terms of what I want to be doing on screen, and what I want to be saying. I feel a little stifled, myself, whenever he's resisting the urge to do vampiresque things.\\" Television series Backstory Stefan Salvatore was born on November 1, 1846 and raised in Mystic Falls, Virginia to Giuseppe Salvatore and Lily Salvatore. Stefan is the younger brother of Damon. When Stefan and Damon were human, they were very close and were best friends in life. Damon always confided and trusted in Stefan and they always defended each other, especially to their father, and was fiercely loyal to him. However, this all seemed to change when Stefan and Damon fell in love with the same girl, Katherine Pierce, who turned out to be a vampire. Stefan fell deeply in love with Katherine before finding out she was a vampire. Katherine, however, compelled Stefan to not be afraid, also to keep her secret and go on as they were. It was also revealed that Katherine compelled Stefan to drink her vampire blood against his will. Damon, on the other hand, drank Katherine's blood willingly, wanting and desiring the immortal life in order to spend an eternity with Katherine. In 1864, Stefan was turned into a vampire after being shot by his father, Giuseppe, along with his brother, Damon with Katherine's blood in his system, before accidentally killing his father during a visit to tell him that he was going to let himself die. Damon, who turned into a vampire as well, promised Stefan an eternity of misery as he was angry that Stefan had forced him to turn and jealous that Katherine had also turned Stefan. A newborn vampire with uncontrollable blood lust, Stefan was unable to resist the temptations of human blood and became severely out of control and addicted (later on known as the Ripper) to the blood, killing many people because of his lack of control and extreme bloodlust. However, Stefan learned to change his ways when he was taught to control it by a vampire named Alexia \\"Lexi\\" Branson, who later on became Stefan's best friend and companion. In 1942, Stefan enlisted in the Army to fight in World War II (4x08 \\"We'll Always Have Bourbon Street\\"). After decades of absence from the town he called home, Stefan returned to Mystic Falls to visit his home and Zach. On May 23, 2009, Stefan heard the Gilbert's car accident at Wickery Bridge. It was then and there that Stefan fatefully encountered Elena Gilbert for the first time. After only being able to save Elena, Stefan noticed that she looked exactly like Katherine. Storyline Season 1-3 Stefan and Elena begin a relationship and he revealed to her that he is a vampire. However, Damon returns to Mystic Falls, too, and also falls in love with Elena. Further on in the series, Damon and Stefan start to bond as brothers again and it becomes apparent that they do love each other. Because of his addiction to human blood, Stefan only drank animal blood in the beginning of the series, which made him weaker than other vampires. In season two, Stefan starts to take small amounts of Elena's blood each day to mitigate its effect on him and to increase his strength. When Katherine returns it is discovered that she had always loved Stefan and not Damon; however, Stefan is in love with Elena and not interested in Katherine. Stefan starts to build a friendship with Caroline Forbes after she is turned into a vampire. After Klaus gives Stefan his blood to save Damon from a werewolf bite, he turns Stefan into a Ripper again. Stefan starts working for him as he agreed to do to save Damon, and hopes it might also protect Elena by making sure Klaus never returns to Mystic Falls, since he believes her to be dead. Klaus later finds out and compels Stefan to kill her, but when he is able to resist the compulsion, Klaus makes him turn his humanity and emotions off. However, he is later able to get his humanity back, which is seen when he saves Klaus's life to protect Damon, but yet he pretends not to care about Elena anymore. He then takes it upon himself to kill Klaus. He steals Klaus's family as retaliation, and uses them as blackmail, when that fails (the witches give Klaus the coffins when he threatens to end the Bennett line), Stefan threatens to drive Elena off Wickery Bridge with vampire blood in her system if Klaus does not get his hybrids out of town, Klaus agrees at the last minute. He and Elena get into a fight. In the season three finale, he kisses Elena. In the end, Elena chooses Stefan over Damon, but when Rebekah causes Matt's truck to drive off Wickery Bridge, she is trapped underwater. Stefan barely gets there in time, but Elena makes him save Matt first and she drowns. It is later revealed Dr. Fell gave Elena vampire blood, meaning she died with vampire blood in her system. Then she became a vampire. Season 4 In the season four premiere, Stefan tries to get Bonnie to save her from becoming a full vampire, however, she along with several other vampires are captured by the Founder's Council. As Elena begins to die and out of desperation to keep Elena alive, Stefan kills a guard and uses his blood to allow Elena to feed and to complete her transition into a vampire. Stefan gives Elena a daylight ring, which was made by Bonnie, in order to protect Elena from the sun. Stefan tries to assure Elena that everything will be okay and that they'll take Elena's newborn vampirism one day at a time. During the second episode of season 4, Stefan tries to help Elena cope with her hunger for human blood. After his \\"bunny diet\\" disagrees with Elena stomach she seeks help from Damon to find an alternative blood source. When blood bags and Damon's own blood fails too, she ends up feeding on Matt under extreme circumstances. Stefan then discovers from Klaus and Rebekah that there is a possible cure for vampirism. Stefan \\"teams\\" up with Klaus in order to find the possible cure, so that Stefan can give Elena the choice of becoming human again. Unfortunately, Klaus needs the vampire hunter Connor to stay alive because he holds the map to the cure in his tattoo, and Stefan must keep him alive at all costs when everyone else wants him dead. When Connor kidnaps Jeremy, April, and Matt, and keeps them hostage at the Grill, Stefan must stop Damon from rashly walking in and killing his chance at curing Elena. After tranquilizing Damon with vervain and taking his daylight ring, Stefan tries to take matters into his own hands and infiltrates the Grille by himself. With Jeremy at gunpoint, Elena comes in and takes Connor by surprise. Stefan manages to get Connor out, but Elena later kills him and is consumed with grief at being a murderer. When Elena begins to hallucinate because of Connor's death, Klaus informs Stefan and Damon that she must be locked away to keep from killing herself, and kidnaps her before they can say no. Later, Stefan works with one of Klaus's hybrids, Chris, to free Elena who stabs him in the neck and runs away. Stefan sends Damon to find her and goes with Bonnie to see if the Professor Shane knows how to end the hallucinations. He informs them that a potential hunter must kill a vampire so he may take the place of that dead hunter, which is virtually impossible. Luckily, Stefan realizes that Jeremy is a potential hunter, and tells him that to save his sister, he must kill a vampire. Jeremy kills the hybrid Chris who originally helped them free Elena, and in turn her hallucinations end, and she is safe, but only barely. Later then, Stefan breaks up with Elena because of her feelings for Damon. Stefan goes to Caroline for support since she loathes Damon, and they become closer. During the Miss Mystic Falls Pageant, Stefan Turns a criminal in the hospital and convinces Jeremy to kill him to make the hunter's mark on his arm grow. Afterward, Jeremy becomes anti-vampire and attempts to kill Elena. Stefan is there and saves her, but has to apologize for making him crazy. Elena tries to tell him that she does not need the cure if it means it hurts Jeremy. That night Elena comes to stay at the Salvatore house, and Stefan leaves to crash at Caroline's. While there, he and Caroline realize that Elena is sired to Damon. When Stefan informs Damon of this, they go to New Orleans to find the witch that broke a sire bond years ago that Damon had. Stefan and Damon find that in order to break the bond, Damon has to convince Elena not to care about him, and leave her, which Damon agrees to do for Stefan. Post Jeremy's death, Damon convinces Elena to switch off her humanity leading to her becoming brutal and ruthless. Stefan and Damon try constantly to make her feel something again. Later after Elena's humanity comes back, she chooses Damon, leaving Stefan heartbroken. Then Stefan tries to dump Silas body in the river only to find that Silas is still alive. Silas then reveals that Stefan is his doppelganger. Silas was the one who created the immortality spell 2000 years ago however, as nature creates a balance for everything, it created a version of Silas that could be killed, a shadow-self which ends up being Stefan. Silas then locks Stefan into a vault and drowns him in the river. This incident tempts Stefan to turn his humanity off in order to escape. Stefan happens to be in the safe for 3 months where he keeps on hallucinating. Season 5 In season 5, Damon and Elena manage to figure out that Silas has taken Stefan's place and that Stefan is in that safe. When they go to rescue him, Stefan is not there. Instead, a very powerful witch (Qyetsiyah) had opened the safe for him and fried his brain due to which he suffers from amnesia. Qyetsiyah (or Tessa) loved Silas but on the day of their marriage, he cheated on her and took the immortality spell for the women he actually loved, Amara, the original doppelg√§nger of Elena. Stefan returns to his old ways but when he saves Elena from Tessa, she wants revenge so he gives Stefan his memories back which gives Stefan Hallucinations of the safe. Caroline tries to help him but when that does not work, Katherine comes back in the picture and manages to cure Stefan but they have a one-night stand, which leads Katherine to believe that Stefan still loves her, however he rejects her. Later on, Katherine takes over Elena's body and breaks up with Damon so that she can get Stefan. After trying to woo him and failing, Stefan realises that Katherine is pretending to be Elena and Elena is with Nadia, Katherine's daughter. They rescue her somehow by killing Katherine and sending her to some sort of hell. Then Stefan volunteers himself to the travellers to give his blood as they needed doppelganger blood. Caroline and Enzo try to find and kill Tom Avery, Stefan's last doppelganger in order to save Stefan and they succeed due to which Stefan and Caroline grow even closer. Near the end of the season, Stefan and Elena keep seeing dreams of the two being together and of them as humans. They work out that the travellers planted those dreams there as it was always meant to be Stefan and Elena not Damon and Elena. Through the fight, Stefan and Elena are kidnapped by the travellers as they need their blood to finish their spell. However, Enzo and Caroline save them by killing Tom Avery, Stefan's doppelg√§nger. In 5x21, Stefan tries to save Caroline's life from Tyler (while a passenger, Julian, is in his body), during which Tyler kills him, sending him to the disintegrating Other Side. In the episode 'Home' he is Resseructed because Liv did a spell due to which he and his other friends can get back but Damon and Bonnie are left there leaving everyone broken. Season 6 In season 6, Stefan moves away from Mystic Falls because of Damon's death and finds a new girlfriend called Ivy. However, Enzo and Caroline, find him and Caroline tells Stefan that he's a coward and the worst friend ever. She starts crying so Enzo goes and kills Ivy. Stefan vows revenge. He comes back to Whitmore, and uses Elena's help to find Enzo leaving him to be killed by a vampire hunter. However, Enzo survives. Ivy returns as a vampire and it is revealed that Enzo had fed her vampire blood against her will before killing her. Damon, then returns to Mystic Falls and meets Stefan first which brings Stefan back to his friends. To make things worse, Enzo tells the other vampire hunter about Ivy and all the other vampires and the vampire hunter kills Ivy but is killed by Damon before the vampire hunter would kill anyone else. Enzo, figures out that Stefan's niece, Sarah is alive and that Damon had thought that he had killed Sarah before she was born but Sarah was born before her mother died however, Stefan kept this from Damon and Enzo uses this against Stefan. Meanwhile, the vampires have another threat, a psycho killer, Kai. Added on top of that, Sheriff Liz Forbes (Caroline's mother) is diagnosed with cancer. Stefan supports Caroline through this in which they bond even more and share a passionate kiss however just then Liz dies. At the funeral, Stefan realises that he has fallen in love with Caroline but before he can confess, Caroline switches off her humanity switch after the funeral. Stefan and Elena try to bring Caroline back but it fails and Caroline vows revenge for them not giving her the year she wanted without any feelings. She kidnaps Stefan and Damon's niece, Sarah Salvatore, and blackmails Stefan to turn off his humanity to save her. At the end of the episode 'The Downward Spiral', he does and joins Caroline. Stefan decides to ruin Caroline's life because she has done the same to him. He wants her to lose control and become a Ripper. He eventually is able to and they sleep together for the first time. When Lily, Stefan and Damon's mother, is rescued from the 1903 prison world and turns out to be a vampire, she manages to turn on Stefan's humanity again. However, it later is revealed that Lily lied to get him back and does not love her sons any more and only wants her travelling companions back. Stefan then pretends to still have his emotions off to get Caroline back and somehow succeeds, but Caroline tries to avoid him as she feels guilty for everything she had done. Stefan then also tries to talk Damon out of being a human again only to be with Elena but Damon decides to take the cure.

For example, in a juried competition where participants compete against each other for a monetary prize, for inclusion in a show or publication, or for representation by a gallery, the work presented is judged by one or more persons, often experts, for such prize, inclusion, or representation.\\"juried\\", Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. 2009See, for example, the Pastel Society of America's description of its Annual Exhibition. See, for example, the description of the Juried Reading competition by The Poetry Center of Chicago. Usage Aaron Copland, Guggenheim Fellow, 1925 The phrase 'juried competition' is usually used to describe creative contests: artistic and literary competitions rather than sports tournaments or academic and scholarship competitions, although such competitions have similarities. Generally, juried competitions are contests that individuals actively enter to compete for prizes, rather than events in which the competitors are passively nominated by others, such as the Academy Awards or the Turner Prize.See the Turner Prize's What is the Turner Prize? page describing its process. The Guggenheim Fellowship is an example of an award which straddles the line between a scholarship contest and a juried art competition.Aaron Copland is an example of a 1925 Guggenheim fellow who won for musical composition. The phrase 'juried competition' is also applied to non-fine-arts contests which yet encompass distinctively creative endeavors: a cook-off is one such contest. Juried competitions also include contests in film and television, as well as new media.For an example of a new media competition, see: Jennifer Lee, The New York Times, November 4, 2008, Art Films From Cellphones and Web Cams. Britain's Got Talent and American Idol are both juried competitions, as is the Disposable Film Festival. Most notable film festivals, such as Cannes, Berlin, Venice, Sundance and Toronto have prizes awarded by a competition jury. History In very early juried competitions in Greece, under Aeschylus and his successors, theatrical contests \\"advanced to a high degree of importance\\" and were \\"placed under the superintendence of\\" (juried by) \\"the magistracy\\".Buckham, Philip Wentworth, Theatre of the Greeks, 1827, Chapter 3, Section 1, Dramatic Contests,, p. 99 and note 3. > \\"... a regular contest had been established before the time when Phrynichus > is first mentioned ....\\" The Greek god Ag√¥n personifies solemn contests.See Theoi Greek Mythology, Agon. During the Middle Ages in 1441, a public poetry competition called the Certame Coronario was held in Florence with the intention of proving that the spoken Italian language was not inferior to Latin.Certame Coronario, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, retrieved September 19, 2009, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. More recently, but before the advent of the Internet, national and international juried competitions were (and still are) advertised in trade publications, with jurists selected from among the artistic or literary elite.Art in America, for example, lists a Call for Artists + Competitions section in the back of each magazine issue, (see _Art in America_ , Art Services section, Annual Guide 2006, No. 7, August 2006, p.378), as does ARTnews (see _ARTnews_ Classifieds, Volume 105 Number 7, Summer 2006, p. 205.)The World Wide Photography Gala Awards website describes its jurors' credentials: Jurors. Before digitized images became widely available, competitions of visual works accepted primarily photographic slides from competitors to represent the work entered because of the cost-prohibitive nature of sending and receiving whole artworks. After judging, only the selected works were sent on for public viewing if the competition included such a venue for the selected works. Written works such as poetry and prose, being less bulky, were entered in competitions via post and received in their original format. Since the advent of the Internet, many competitions for visual works began accepting entries in digital form as well as slide form, while literary competitions began to accept works submitted online as well as by post. The growth of the Internet also saw service firms appear offering organizational tools for juried competitions allowing for such conveniences as online storage and access of digital images.The 2010 Smithsonian Craft Show, for example, makes use of such a service firm for handling submitted work for the competition as detailed in the show application information process. Juried competitions also benefit from the immediacy of the Internet in that competitions listings are aggregated by some sitesSee, for example, the-art- list.com making such listings more widely accessible than when they were enumerated primarily in trade publications. Some juried competitions in art and literature exist entirely online, or both online and in print.See, for instance, Abstract EXPOsure, The Art Interview - 18th International Online Artist Competition, New Scientist's Flash fiction competition, and the PLURAL+ Video Festival.

Diagnosis Oncoceratidae are characterized by generally compressed, cyrtoconic, and breviconic shells with an exogastric curvature such that the ventral profile is convex or more so than dorsal, and in which the siphuncle is generally empty and located ventral of the center. In primitive forms, the siphuncle in early growth stages is composed of tubular segments with almost straight suborthochoanitic septal necks, but becomes cyrtochoanitic with expanded segments in the later growth stages, and is expanded and cyrtochoanitic throughout in advanced forms. In a few advanced forms, the siphuncle is actinosiphonate. (Flower 1950, Sweet 1964) Evolution The Oncoceratidae first appeared early in the Middle Ordovician (Sweet 1964) simultaneously with the Graciloceratidae, Tripteroceratidae, and Valcouroceratidae, derived from the Gracilocertidae.(Flower 1950, 1976) Some Middle Ordovician oncoceratids such as Richardsonoceras and Oonoceras are, however, externally more similar to Bassleroceras than to Graciloceras. Moreover, Richardsonoceras has been reported from the upper Lower Ordovician (Arenigian) of China, bringing its first appearance before the earliest known graciloceratids. Other oncoceratids such as Rhizoceras and Miamoceras show a greater affinity to the Graciloceratidae. The Oncoceratidae through Oncoceras is thought to be the most likely source for the slightly endogastric Ordovician Diestoceratidae (Sweet 1964) and through the Early Silurian Amphycertoceras, for the Acleistoceratidae. The Oncoceratidae also gave rise to the dominantly Devonian Brevicoceratidae and Siluro-devonian Nothoceratidae though Oonoceras and to the largely Devonian Polyelasmoceratidae through either Oonoceras or Oocerina.(Sweet 1964) Subgroups The Oncoceratidae can be subdivided into arbitrary and convenient subgroups based on morphologic similarity, based on illustrations in the Treatise K 1964 (figs 200‚Äì203, pp K285-K288). One comprising elongate slender forms is referred to as the Slender Oncoceratidae. The other, comprising generally short, breviconic forms is referred to as the Breviconic Oncoceratidae . Breviconic Oncoceratidae Breviconic Oncoceratidae comprise genera included in the family Oncoceratidae known from generally short, i.e. breviconic and often exogastrically curved shells. They are considered oncoceratids (nautiloid order Oncocerida) on the basis of having typically empty siphuncles ventral of the center that may be suborthochoanitic and tubular in the early growth stage and cyrtochoanitic with expanded segments in later growth stages or entirely. Connecting rings are thin. Breviconic oncoceratids differ from slender oncoeratids only in the matter of relative length. Inclusion is based on descriptions and illustrations in Sweet 1964 on the Oncerida in the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Park K. Included genera  Breviconic oncoceratid genera include: Oncoceras; compressed, curved brevicones, M-U Ord, N Am., Eu. Beloitoceras; compressed, curved brevicones, like Oncoceras, M-U Ord, N Am., Eu. Metarizoceras; slightly curved, compressed, rapidly expanding brevicons, M Sil. N Am. Neumatoceras; compressed brevicones with maximum height behind posterior end of body chamber, M-U Ord., N Am., Eu. ?Vaupella; depressed, cyrtoconic brevicones with large ventral cytrochoanitic siphuncle, otherwise with characters of the family.

It originated in Yorkshire roughly around the same time as the Large White. Its name comes from the fact that it was between the size of the Large White and the now-extinct Small White. It was fully recognized as a breed in 1884. The breed is known as a pork producer (rather than bacon or lard type pigs), and is best known for its sharply upturned snub nose. It is docile and often kept outdoors in grazing situations. Though its numbers have rebounded somewhat, the breed is listed as endangered by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. Origin The Small White proved a popular cross with both the Cumberland pig (now extinct) and the Large White, another Yorkshire breed. This led to the creation of a new type after an incident at the 1852 Keighley Agricultural Show, when pigs belonging to Joseph Tuley, a weaver, were refused entry to the Large White class, as they were considered too small; they had been bred by crossing Large White sows with Small White boars.The Middle White, British Pig Association, accessed 23-02-10 Tuley's pigs were, however, considered good enough that a new breed was created, the Middle White, which went on to be one of the most popular breeds of pig during the late 19th and early 20th centuries; it retains the distinctive pricked ears and short snout of the Small White.

Mar Ammo was a 3rd-century Manichean disciple of the prophet Mani. According to Manichaen tradition he spread Manichaeism eastward into Sogdiana during the time period when Mani was living. Mar Ammo is well known as the apostle of the east in Manichean literature nevertheless his exact origins are unknown. His Syriac name (from  øAmmƒÅn≈´ƒìl) may denote that he was Aramaic in origin. However, a Parthian origin may also be seen and is mentioned by some scholars,Richard Foltz. Religions of the Silk Road: Overland Trade and Cultural Exchange from Antiquity to the Fifteenth Century. Palgrave Macmillan, 2000. .David A. Scott. Manichaean Views of Buddhism in: History of Religions. Vol. 25, No. 2, Nov. 1985. University of Chicago Press. especially due to his outstanding role in establishing the Parthian language as the official language of the eastern Manichean Church, later to be replaced by Sogdian in the sixth century. Furthermore, Mar Ammo is widely regarded as the composer of the Manichaean Parthian hymn-cycles (Huwƒ´dagmƒÅn and Angad R≈ç≈°nan).Mary Boyce. The Manichaean Hymn Cycles in Parthian. Oxford University Press, 1954.B. A. Litvinsky. Manichaeism in: History of Civilizations of Central Asia: The Crossroads of Civilization. Unesco, 1996. . Missionary work On his way to eastern Iran, Mar Ammo was accompanied by the Parthian prince Ardavan.Samuel N. C. Lieu. Manichaeism in the Later Roman Empire and Medieval China. JCB Mohr, 1992. . According to Manichean tradition, when he reached the river Oxus on the Sogdian frontier the spirit who guarded it denied Mar Ammo entry across it. Mar Ammo fasted and prayed for two days and he either was confronted by Mani or had a vision of him who told him to read a chapter from his book The Treasury of Life which is generally believed to be a component of the Manichaean Canon. When the spirit returned she asked why he was on a journey he responded that he wished to teach fasting and absentation from wine, flesh and woman. The spirit responded that there were similar men in her lands perhaps referring to Buddhists in Sogdiana. However, when Mar Ammo read from one of Mani's books she realized he was a bringer of the \\"true religion\\" and allowed him to pass. The spirit can be identified with the goddess Ardvakhsh who has associations with the river. However fragmentary texts from Turpan tell a slightly different story in which Mani himself encounters the frontier spirit.  Later life and influences  Because of Mar Ammo, Manicheism became established in Sogdiana. He was also closely associated with Mani. Mani also spent his last hours of his life with Mar Ammo whom he called \\"his dearest son\\". Following the death of Mani in 276 CE, at the command of the Sassanid King Bahram I, Sogdiana became home to a large Manichean Community. This was dually because of the work of Mar Ammo and the eastward migrations of Manicheans due to their persecution in Persia. Although Manicheism was a fairly unified religious phenomenon, three hundred years after the death of Mar Ammo there was a schism between the Manichaean church in Babylonia and the Sogdian Manichaeans. The Sogdian Manichaeans known as the Denawars (Middle Persian Dƒìnawar) viewed Mar Ammo as the founder of their sect and called themselves the \\"Pure Ones\\". However, another head of the Manichaean community, Shad Ohrmazd, is mentioned as the actual founder of the Denawari SchoolH. J. Klimkeit. Manichaeism and Nestorian Christianity in: History of Civilizations of Central Asia, Vol. IV, Part 2. Motilal Banarsidass, 2003. . (Dƒ´nƒÅvarƒ´ya). The rift between the eastern and western Manicheans was not caused by any doctrinal matters. The capital of the sect by the 8th century was centered in Kocho, on the northern Silk road. At the time it was at least active from Samarkand to Chang'an. The schism between the eastern and western churches was worked out and ended by the eighth century. Manichaeism following its introduction into Sogdiana would be spread in part by Sogdians eastward into the Tarim basin and China. Manichaeism would last at least for another six hundred years, fading away after the fourteenth century.

A large, white pig, it is named for its large ears which hang over its face. The breed was originally developed as an amalgamation of several local lop-eared breeds in England, and came to be known as the British Lop in the 1960s. History The earliest records of the breed are from the border of Cornwall and Devon, particularly the area around Tavistock.Dohner The Encyclopedia of Historic and Endangered Livestock and Poultry Breeds, 2001, p.186 It is possibly related to similar breeds found around the north-western fringes of Europe, namely the Welsh, with which it was for a period in the 1920s in a combined breed registry, and the Landrace pig breeds of Scandinavia. It may also be related to the Normande pigs of France. The breed's first herdbook was published in 1921, subsequent to the popularity of classes at the Devon County Show in that year.[Our Society http://www.britishloppig.org.uk/our-society] British Lop Pig Society, 31-01-17 By the late 1930s large numbers of purebred Lops were registered, predominantly in the south-west. During the years after the Second World War, the British Government recommended that production be standardised on three breeds (the Large White, Welsh and Landrace) which led to a decline in the numbers of other breeds of pig. During the 1960s and 70s only around 11 breeders kept the British Lop going. Characteristics The British Lop is a large, white-skinned pig with lop ears. It is heavy-set, and much deeper in the body than the similar Welsh or Landrace pigs. The breed was developed to be able to support itself primarily on grazing, and is still often raised outdoors. Unlike most surviving British pig breeds, the British Lop appears to have had little or no input from the imported Asian pigs used in much 19th century breeding. The breed has a good ability to put on lean weight and is particularly noted for a gentle temperament. Current status The breed is currently higher in numbers than during the 60s and 70s, but is still listed as endangered by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust.

By September 1918, there were 70,000 Japanese, 5,002 American, 1,400 Italian, 829 British and 107 French troops in and around the city The Legione Redenta (\\"Redeemed Legion\\") was an Italian military formation that participated in the Siberian intervention during the Russian Civil War. It was formed from 2500 prisoners of war who had been captured by the Russians from the Austro-Hungarian Army. The Legion fought against Bolshevik forces in Siberia and Manchuria, and was instrumental in protecting the Trans-Siberian Railway necessary for the Allied support to the White forces. History With the Russian withdrawal from the war in 1918, German and Austro-Hungarian prisoners were allowed to return home as a result of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Many of the Austro-Hungarian prisoners were of various nationalities reflecting the multi-ethnic composition of the empire. A number of these prisoners were of Italian ethnicity, primarily from Trentino, Istria and Dalmatia (Italian nationalists considered these areas part of the Italia irredenta). The Italian government decided to form units from these prisoners (many of them said they were Italian irredentists). They were allowed to fight for Italy and swore an oath to the King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. They were placed in a special new military unit called \\"Legione Redenta\\": this name was related to the word \\"redenta\\" (Italian for \\"redeemed\\") as a reference to the fact that the soldiers were \\"redeemed\\" from Austrian control and now were Italian legionaries. Colonel Cosma Manera As a result, the \\"Legione Redenta\\" was created in the summer of 1918 in China and attached to the \\"Corpo di Spedizione Italiano in Estremo Oriente\\" (Italian Expedition in the Far East). Initially they were stationed in the Italian Concession in Tientsin.Headquarters building of Italy in Tientsin They were trained in Tientsin by Major Cosma Manera (it), an official of the Italian Carabinieri who chose the name \\"Redenta\\" for the unit. The Italian legionaries played a small but important role during parts of Siberian Intervention, fighting alongside the Czechoslovak Legion.First World War - Willmott, H.P.; Dorling Kindersley, 2003, Page 251 The main areas of operations were Irkutsk, Harbin and Vladivostok.A History of Russia, 7th Edition, Nicholas V. Riasanovsky & Mark D. Steinberg, Oxford University Press, 2005 The Legione Redenta fought until November 1919 when as part of the general Allied withdrawal from Russia, it returned to Italy, where it was welcomed with military honors. Irregular Brigata Savoia The Italian legionaries were divided in 2 groups, one with black collar patches the other with red collar patches. Those with the red collar patches were recruited initially by Andrea Compatangelo in an irregular Brigata Savoia and after heavy fighting, occupied the important railway hub of Krasnoyarsk for nearly two months before reaching Tientsin in summer 1918. They fought alongside the Czechoslovak Legion and by using special armoured trains, reached the Italian concession in Tiensin, where they were officially made part of the Corpo di Spedizione Italiano.

It is also the second-oldest religious building in Deschutes County. The church was built in the Gothic Revival style with Queen Anne architectural detailing. It was the home of Protestant congregations from 1912 until 1979. Today, the building is privately owned and used as a special events venue. The First Presbyterian Church of Redmond was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.  History  The first Presbyterian congregation in Redmond was organized in 1906, one year after the city was founded. The church was established by Reverend Jesse C. George under the authority and guidance of an existing Presbytery in Pendleton, Oregon. The Pendleton Presbytery had sent Reverend George to Central Oregon in 1905 to minister to the Tumalo community fifteen miles southwest of Redmond. Shortly after arriving, a number of Redmond residents asked him to conduct Presbyterian services in their community as well. Over the next few years, George established the Redmond congregation with the help of Reverend J. W. Mitchell of the Sisters Presbyterian Church and Reverend Levi Johnson, an itinerant pastor who eventually founded eleven churches in Eastern Oregon communities.\\"First Presbyterian Church of Redmond\\", Deschutes County Landmarks, Deschutes County, Bend, Oregon, January 17, 2001.\\"First Presbyterian Church of Redmond\\", National Register of Historic Places Inventory -- Registration Form, National Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Washington, D.C., July 6, 2001.\\"History\\" , The Historic Redmond Church, www.historicredmondchurch.com, Redmond, Oregon, September 13, 2009. The new Presbyterian congregation held services in a number of locations around the city. In 1910, the congregation bought three adjacent lots along 7th Street in downtown Redmond for a permanent church building. A ground-breaking ceremony was held on July 31, 1911. The building was completed the following spring and dedicated on June 30, 1912. Shortly after the church's dedication, Redmond's local newspaper reported that the church had cost $5,000 to build and had seating capacity for 250 parishioners. The church continued to grow along with the city of Redmond. In 1929, the First Methodist Church of Redmond had lost its minister and was struggling financially so by mutual consent, the First Methodist congregation was merged into the First Presbyterian Church. The combined congregation sold the First Methodist Church property, retaining the First Presbyterian Church and its minister. With permission from the Pendleton Presbytery, the church was officially renamed the Redmond Community Presbyterian Church on October 1, 1929. A major renovation of the church was begun in 1943 and completed in the spring of 1944. The changes included reorienting the sanctuary. The original design had the congregation seated in a semicircle facing east. In the new design, the pews were set in parallel rows along the length of the building facing north. A classroom area was open up and incorporated into the sanctuary to provide space for the altar, pulpit, and choir seating at the north end of the room. The church's new sanctuary was dedicated on June 18, 1944. A large non-historic education and fellowship hall was built next to the original church in 1948. The church and adjacent fellowship hall were used by the Presbyterian congregation until 1979, when the church was relocated to a new facility on N.W. 19th Street. The buildings were then sold to a private investor, but the historic church structure remained vacant until 1992. The original 1912 building was resold at that time, and the new owners opened the Redmond School of Dance in the historic building. The dance school closed in 2003 and the building was once again sold to investors. In 2004, the building was purchased for use as a special events venue. Today, the building houses a private business known as The Historic Redmond Church. It rents space for weddings, concerts, lectures, art exhibits, workshops, and community meetings.Hake, Mary A., \\"The Historic Redmond Church Is Available for Service\\" , High Desert Sun, Redmond, Oregon, March 24, 2007. The First Presbyterian Church of Redmond is the oldest church building in the city and the second- oldest religious structure in Deschutes County. Because of the building's Gothic Revival architecture and its importance to the history of Central Oregon, the First Presbyterian Church of Redmond was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 3, 2001.\\"First Presbyterian Church of Redmond\\", National Register of Historic Places, www.nationalregisterofhistoricalplaces.com, September 13, 2009.  Structure  The Historic Redmond Church, 2009The First Presbyterian Church is located on a 100-by-100-foot city lot on the corner of 7th Street and Cascade Avenue within the original Redmond townsite. The building is sited on the western side of the lot with the entrance facing Cascade Avenue. The entry steps begin at the public sidewalk along Cascade Avenue. On the 7th Street frontage, there is a four-foot landscaped lawn between the structure and the sidewalk. The east side of the lot is used for parking. The church was built in the Gothic Revival style with Queen Anne architectural detailing. It is a rectangular one-story building with a structural footprint measuring 72 feet by 40 feet. There is a two-story steeple on the southwest corner of the building above the main entrance. At the top of the steeple is a belfry that houses the church-s original bell, which was cast by the American Bell and Foundry Company of Northville, Michigan. At the peak of the steeple is a tall, ornate finial with decorative globes, fans, and scrollwork. All of the church windows are Gothic arch style. The main sanctuary window is made up of four Gothic arch windows that support a rose window with ornate tracery. The entire window group is set into a large Gothic arch frame. On the east side of the church is a large bay window. In the original church design, this bay window feature was the focal point of the interior sanctuary space.  Interior  The ceiling in the church sanctuary is 19 feet high. The sanctuary walls are lath and plaster with a wooden wainscoting to a height of three-and-a-half feet. The sanctuary pews were originally arranged in a semicircle facing a large bay window on the east side of the building. In 1944, the sanctuary was reoriented along the length of the building with the pews facing an expanded altar and choir area at the north end of the room. Today, the sanctuary space is open and can be arranged as required for specific events. There are two rooms in the northwest corner of the building. Both are approximately 12 feet by 12 feet. The rooms have 13-foot ceilings and the same lath and plaster walls and wainscoting as the sanctuary. The rooms have hanging glass-globe lights that are original to the building.

He was born in Saltvik, √Öland. Wirtanen rose to parliament from the Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP) list, but in 1946 he defected to the Finnish People's Democratic League (SKDL). Wirtanen was also active in the Socialist Unity Party (SYP) and served as its chairman from 1948 to 1955. In 1955 he led the SYP out of the SKDL. Wirtanen was fired twice (1941 and 1947) from the publication Arbetarbladet and once (1953) from the magazine Ny Tid. During the Continuation War, he was among the signatories of the \\"Petition of the Thirty-Three\\", which members of the peace opposition presented to President Risto Ryti. Wirtanen was a close friend of the author Tove Jansson and a model for the Snufkin character, whose green hat is borrowed from Wirtanen.

The battle took place at Tubac in the present day southern Arizona. The actual dates of this engagement have been lost to time. Background Apache warriors, over 200 strong, attacked Tubac sometime in early August 1861 and initiated a siege on one side of the presidio. Mexican bandits occupied the other side but stayed out of the major fighting. The towns people fought the Apaches for three days until sending a dispatch rider to Tucson, requesting reinforcements. A force of twenty-five militiamen, carrying a Confederate Flag and commanded by a Granville Henderson Oury, arrived at the town and fought off the final assault. The Apaches withdrew out of close range but continued to lay siege by stopping the ability of the militia to escape. Eventually, food and ammunition became short and the garrison, women and children chose to flee to avoid being completely massacred by the overwhelming Apache army. The Arizonans escaped successfully after another skirmish on the last night, leaving Tubac to be burned by the native army and plundered by the Mexican bandits. The Americans headed back to Tucson, to the north, having completed their objective of rescuing the besieged Tubacans. Aftermath The Tubacans, with their town virtually gone, left Tucson at about August 15, 1861. Their destination was the Rio Grande, east of Mesilla. Before completing their journey, the Arizonans would be attacked again by Apaches, this engagement is known as the Battle of Cookes Canyon. The battle in Cookes Canyon resulted in the Battle of the Florida Mountains. Charles D. Poston was one of the men who left Tubac as result of the siege, Poston, a Republican, supported the creation of an Arizona Territory separate from New Mexico Territory, which he discussed with President Abraham Lincoln after leaving Tubac. After the Civil War Tubac was briefly home to a command of United States troops but no population existed. The town was abandoned into the 1880s. By 1908, Tubac was being rebuilt but still had a very small population of less than 200. As of today, 149 years later, only about 1,000 people reside in the town. The casualties of the engagement are unknown. An early map of Tubac and surroundings.

Construction started in 1902 of his Beaux-Arts design. He was one of five people convicted of graft in 1910 after a state investigation of cost overruns in association with construction and furnishing the capitol. Early life and education Joseph Miller Huston was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1866. When he was seventeen, Joseph joined the firm of Frank Furness and Sons, where he worked during his college years. He graduated from Princeton University in 1892, re-joining Furness' firm full-time. Career In 1895, Huston founded his own firm, and began designing buildings in Philadelphia, such as the Witherspoon Building, (1895). In 1898-99, Huston toured Europe and Asia, along with his older brother, Samuel, experiencing historic styles which greatly influenced his later designs. 255x255px Pennsylvania State Capitol . In 1901, at the age of 36, Joseph Huston won the design competition for the commission for the new Pennsylvania State Capitol over eight other competitors. His design was overwhelmingly heralded as a success. At its dedication on October 4, 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt described the building as, \\" ... the handsomest State Capitol I ever saw!\\" The total cost of the project was nearly triple what the legislature had appropriated, in part because of inflated costs for construction and furnishings due to the state's purchasing mechanism. Huston, and four other officials were convicted of graft in 1910 and sentenced to up to two years in prison for their parts in the overruns. Although he appealed, Huston lost his case and went to prison in 1911. Oaks Cloister Huston's home, known as Oaks Cloister (c.1904) is located in the Germantown section of Philadelphia and has been described as one of the finest residences in the city. The Huston family sold the property in 1955 and it fell into disrepair over time and ultimately was abandoned. This venerable landmark was saved from demolition in 2002 by Dr. Russell Harris and Mr. John Casavecchia, who spent the following decade restoring the mansion to its original glory. In 1911, Huston designed the Searles Memorial Methodist Church, now located in the Old Pottstown Historic District.

This technology, which exploits the electrical property known as negative differential resistance and is called thin capacitively-coupled thyristor, Description of the technology is used to create memory cells capable of very high packing densities. Due to this, the memory is highly scalable, and already has a storage density that is several times higher than found in conventional six-transistor SRAM memory. It was expected that the next generation of T-RAM memory will have the same density as DRAM. This technology exploits the electrical property known as negative differential resistor and is characterized by the innovative way in which its memory cells are built, combining DRAM efficiency in terms of space with that of SRAM in terms of speed. Very similar to the current 6T-SRAM, or SRAM memories with 6 cell transistors, is substantially different because the SRAM latch CMOS, consisting of 4 of the 6 transistors of each cell, is replaced by a bipolar latch PNP -NPN of a single Thyristor. The result is to significantly reduce the area occupied by each cell, thus obtaining a highly scalable memory that has already reached storage density several times higher than the current SRAM. The Thyristor-RAM provides the best density / performance ratio available between the various integrated memories, matching the performance of an SRAM memory, but allowing 2-3 times greater storage density and lower power consumption.

The series follows the titular Junk Raiders, a team of professionals who attempt to renovate a designated space over a short period of time, and with a relatively low budget. Because of the extremely limited budgets, many of the materials needed must be found by freecycling: finding something unwanted for free and reusing it. For the production of the series, the team had commissioned a \\"junk hot-line\\", urging Torontonians to donate any garbage that they could use. In addition, as looking through other peoples' trash is illegal in Toronto, the show also has a special exemption that allows the team to do just that. Seasons The first season of Junk Raiders aired in 2009 and followed a seven-member team as they attempted to renovate an old steel factory in downtown Toronto and turn it into a high-end loft in one month with only a C$5500 budget. In the second season, of 2011, the team was expanded to eight members, and the task was to renovate a site in Toronto's Don Valley (on Bayview Avenue), converting it to a two-story \\"clubhouse\\" in one month with only a C$5000 budget, as part of the Evergreen Brick Works project. The third season, from 2012, had eight professionals attempting to renovate an old sports bar into a modern restaurant in one month with only a C$5000 budget. Team members *Siamak Ashrafinia appears in the third season only. He is an Iranian-born master craftsman, who now plies his craft in Canada as a sign maker. He has many other talents, including the ability to fix almost anything.

He is resourceful, energetic, and incredibly crafty. He's the kind of guy who has never found himself needing anything that he couldn't just build himself. Online he's known as \\"The Cheap Bastard,\\" starring in a ridiculously popular series of how-to videos for how to live life frugally. Chuck lives on the Kahnawake Mohawk Reservation just outside Montreal. For this season, he is also the operator of the official Junk Raiders Twitter account, @JunkRaiders. *Andy Berry appears in the second season only as the team's designer. He has designed residences, commercial spaces, and film sets. His ideals match that of the show, as his specialty is sourcing materials from junkyards and making them look pristine. *Anthony D'Arcy appears in the first season only. He is a real estate agent by day and freecycler by night. He is into freecycling largely because of his desire to avoid paying for anything.

In 1922, China breaks away from Japan and fights a brief war that culminates in the Chinese annexation of the Japanese possessions of Korea, Formosa, and Manchuria. Over the next half century, China's population steadily grows, and eventually migration overwhelms European colonies in Asia. The United States and the other Western powers launch a biological warfare campaign against China, resulting in the total destruction of China's population, the few survivors of the plague being killed out of hand by European and American troops, and China then being colonized by the Western powers. This opens the way to a joyous epoch of \\"splendid mechanical, intellectual, and art output\\". In the 1980s, war clouds once more gather between Germany and France, and the story ends with the nations of the world solemnly pledging not to use the same techniques that they had used against China.

He served as bishop of the Diocese of Savannah (1935‚Äì59), Apostolic Nuncio to Ireland (1951-54), and Apostolic Delegate to Great Britain (1954‚Äì63). Biography Early life and education Gerald O'Hara was born in the Green Ridge section of Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Patrick James and Margaret (n√©e Carney) O'Hara. His father was a dentist. He attended Our Mother of Sorrows School and St. Joseph's College High School, both in Philadelphia. From 1911 to 1918, he studied at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Overbrook. He then furthered his studies in Rome at the Pontifical Roman Seminary, from where he obtained a Doctor of Divinity degree in 1921. Ordination and ministry O'Hara was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Basilio Pompili on April 3, 1920. He earned a doctorate in canon and civil law from the Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare in 1924. He spent several years studying abroad, traveling through Europe and the Middle East. Following his return to Pennsylvania in 1926, O'Hara became private secretary to Cardinal Dennis Joseph Dougherty, the Archbishop of Philadelphia. He also served as a judge on the archdiocesan matrimonial court. Auxiliary Bishop of Philadelphia On April 26, 1929, O'Hara was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and Titular Bishop of Heliopolis in Phoenicia by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following May 21 from Cardinal Dougherty, with Bishops John Bernard MacGinley and Thomas Charles O'Reilly serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of Ss. Peter and Paul. In addition to his episcopal duties, he served as pastor of the Church of the Nativity B.V.M., Port Richmond and vicar general of the archdiocese. He was also president of the American Catholic Historical Association from 1934 to 1936. Bishop of Savannah On November 26, 1935, O'Hara was appointed the ninth Bishop of Savannah, Georgia, succeeding the retiring Bishop Michael Joseph Keyes. During his tenure, he erected the Cathedral of Christ the King in Atlanta, which was dedicated by Cardinal Dougherty in January 1939. The cathedral was built on the former site of Ku Klux Klan gatherings, and O'Hara even invited Imperial Wizard Hiram Wesley Evans to the dedication. He once stormed at the office of a Savannah newspaper after the paper claimed that Saint Patrick once granted women the privilege to woo during Leap Year. Known as a liberal who was a leader in church efforts to improve race relations, he launched a seven-point social and racial program in the 1930s, calling for aid to African American children and heightened awareness of rural issues. Apostolic Nunciature to Romania In addition to his role as diocesan bishop, O'Hara was named regent of the Apostolic Nunciature to Romania, in Bucharest, on February 19, 1947. His vicar general and chancellor assumed the active administration of the diocese. During his time there, he became an outspoken opponent of the Communist regime. However, in 1950, the Romanian government accused him of espionage and expelled them from the country. Specifically, he was charged with supplying military, political, and economic information to Western legations; he denied the accusations, calling them \\"lies from first to last.\\" Returning to the United States, he accused the Romanians of terrorism, insisting, \\"Our interest was solely the welfare of 3,000,000 Catholic people in Romania.\\" On July 12, 1950, O'Hara was given the personal title of Archbishop by Pope Pius XII. Shortly afterwards, he was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Ireland on November 27, 1951. In 1953 Paul Blanshard, author of American Freedom and Catholic Power, unsuccessfully petitioned the U.S. Department of State to revoke O'Hara's citizenship because Blanshard believed that, as an American-born bishop with an American diocese working in Ireland, he was violating the McCarran Act by serving as an agent of a foreign power. Apostolic Delegate to Great Britain On June 8, 1954, O'Hara was named Apostolic Delegate to Great Britain. As Apostolic Delegate, his jurisdiction also included Malta, Gibraltar, and Bermuda. Drained by his dual duties as papal diplomat and diocesan bishop, he resigned as Bishop of Savannah on November 12, 1959; he was named Titular Archbishop of Pessinus by Pope John XXIII on the same date. In 1960 he became the first papal representative to visit the Houses of Parliament in more than 400 years. Death O'Hara later died from a heart attack at his residence in Wimbledon section of London, aged 68. His Requiem Mass was celebrated by Archbishop John Carmel Heenan at Westminster Cathedral. His body was then flown back to Philadelphia, where he is buried in the crypt of the Cathedral of SS Peter and Paul.

Max forgot to set his alarm and overslept. So he did his morning routine fast. He rushed into the shower, which made his sister angry. He gulped his breakfast. On his way to school, Max encountered many delays, which caused him to arrive at school just one minute before school started. At school he found his classmates and everyone else frozen. His teacher, Mrs Mulvahill, was staring at him. He left his class and saw another frozen boy named Sheldon. He left school and saw everybody outside frozen, even his family. He met his adult friend, Tortoise Man. Tortoise Man and his wife were frozen while playing a game of Scrabble. After sometime everyone thawed out and they talked about the world being frozen. A reporter named Warren Blatt came and accused Tortoise Man of using his Tortoise Ray to freeze the world. The president called to tell Max that a thief had stolen four of the world's greatest treasures‚Äîthe Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci in the Louvre museum in Paris; the Hope Diamond at New York's Museum of Natural History, on loan from the Smithsonian; the Crown Jewels from the Tower of London; and a billion dollars in gold bullion at Fort Knox in Kentucky. Max went to his house to see how his family was. They weren't frozen anymore. Max returned to his school, and his teacher told him that he missed out on the excitement‚Äîthe whole world had been frozen. Max explained why he was late and had to go into detention. After detention, Max saw the news on Newspapers and TV. One report said Tortoise Man's ray slowed things down. The president called Max again, telling him to watch the videos from the burglarized locations. Max saw that the thief was dressed up like Maximum Boy, so his dad hired a lawyer for Max. But the lawyer his dad hired was a patent lawyer, not a defense attorney. Too bad because Max went to jail and a hero named Noodleman in his superhero team called him to say Max was expelled from the league of superheroes. Max was very unhappy to hear this news. Max went for help to Tortoise Man, but Tortoise Man was depressed. Tortoise Man took Max to his old friend, Ethelred, and his servant, Wolfgang. Max finally discovered that Ethelred was the thief, but then Ethelred died. The president and Noodleman came to apologize to Max for wrongly accusing him of stealing the four treasures.

Such ideals are described more geometrically in terms of finite simplicial complexes. The Stanley‚ÄìReisner ring construction is a basic tool within algebraic combinatorics and combinatorial commutative algebra.Miller & Sturmfels (2005) p.19 Its properties were investigated by Richard Stanley, Melvin Hochster, and Gerald Reisner in the early 1970s.  Definition and properties  Given an abstract simplicial complex Œî on the vertex set {x1,...,xn} and a field k, the corresponding Stanley‚ÄìReisner ring, or face ring, denoted k[Œî], is obtained from the polynomial ring k[x1,...,xn] by quotienting out the ideal IŒî generated by the square-free monomials corresponding to the non-faces of Œî: : I_\\\\Delta=(x_{i_1}\\\\ldots x_{i_r}: \\\\\\\\{i_1,\\\\ldots,i_r\\\\\\\\} otin\\\\Delta), \\\\quad k[\\\\Delta]=k[x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n]/I_\\\\Delta. The ideal IŒî is called the Stanley‚ÄìReisner ideal or the face ideal of Œî.Miller & Sturmfels (2005) pp.3‚Äì5  Properties  * The Stanley‚ÄìReisner ring k[Œî] is multigraded by Zn, where the degree of the variable xi is the ith standard basis vector ei of Zn. * As a vector space over k, the Stanley‚ÄìReisner ring of Œî admits a direct sum decomposition :: k[\\\\Delta] = \\\\bigoplus_{\\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\Delta}k[\\\\Delta]_\\\\sigma, : whose summands k[Œî]œÉ have a basis of the monomials (not necessarily square- free) supported on the faces œÉ of Œî. * The Krull dimension of k[Œî] is one larger than the dimension of the simplicial complex Œî. * The multigraded, or fine, Hilbert series of k[Œî] is given by the formula :: H(k[\\\\Delta]; x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) = \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\Delta}\\\\prod_{i\\\\in\\\\sigma}\\\\frac{x_i}{1-x_i}. * The ordinary, or coarse, Hilbert series of k[Œî] is obtained from its multigraded Hilbert series by setting the degree of every variable xi equal to 1: :: H(k[\\\\Delta]; t,\\\\ldots,t) = \\\\frac{1}{(1-t)^n}\\\\sum_{i=0}^d f_{i-1} t^i(1-t)^{n-i}, : where d = dim(Œî) + 1 is the Krull dimension of k[Œî] and fi is the number of i-faces of Œî. If it is written in the form :: H(k[\\\\Delta]; t,\\\\ldots,t) = \\\\frac{h_0 + h_1 t + \\\\cdots + h_d t^d}{(1-t)^d} :then the coefficients (h0, ..., hd) of the numerator form the h-vector of the simplicial complex Œî.  Examples  It is common to assume that every vertex {xi} is a simplex in Œî. Thus none of the variables belongs to the Stanley‚ÄìReisner ideal IŒî. * Œî is a simplex {x1,...,xn}. Then IŒî is the zero ideal and :: k[\\\\Delta]=k[x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n] :is the polynomial algebra in n variables over k. * The simplicial complex Œî consists of n isolated vertices {x1}, ..., {xn}. Then :: I_\\\\Delta=\\\\\\\\{x_i x_j: 1\\\\leq i < j \\\\leq n\\\\\\\\} :and the Stanley‚ÄìReisner ring is the following truncation of the polynomial ring in n variables over k: :: k[\\\\Delta] = k\\\\oplus\\\\bigoplus_{1\\\\leq i\\\\leq n} x_i k[x_i]. * Generalizing the previous two examples, let Œî be the d-skeleton of the simplex {x1,...,xn}, thus it consists of all (d + 1)-element subsets of {x1,...,xn}. Then the Stanley‚ÄìReisner ring is following truncation of the polynomial ring in n variables over k: :: k[\\\\Delta] = k\\\\oplus\\\\bigoplus_{0\\\\leq r\\\\leq d} \\\\bigoplus_{i_0<\\\\ldots * Suppose that the abstract simplicial complex Œî is a simplicial join of abstract simplicial complexes Œî‚Ä≤ on x1,...,xm and Œî‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ on xm+1,...,xn. Then the Stanley‚ÄìReisner ring of Œî is the tensor product over k of the Stanley‚ÄìReisner rings of Œî‚Ä≤ and Œî‚Ä≤‚Ä≤: :: k[\\\\Delta]\\\\simeq k[\\\\Delta']\\\\otimes_k k[\\\\Delta].  Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay condition and the upper bound conjecture  The face ring k[Œî] is a multigraded algebra over k all of whose components with respect to the fine grading have dimension at most 1. Consequently, its homology can be studied by combinatorial and geometric methods. An abstract simplicial complex Œî is called Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay over k if its face ring is a Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay ring.Miller & Sturmfels (2005) p.101 In his 1974 thesis, Gerald Reisner gave a complete characterization of such complexes. This was soon followed up by more precise homological results about face rings due to Melvin Hochster. Then Richard Stanley found a way to prove the Upper Bound Conjecture for simplicial spheres, which was open at the time, using the face ring construction and Reisner's criterion of Cohen‚ÄìMacaulayness. Stanley's idea of translating difficult conjectures in algebraic combinatorics into statements from commutative algebra and proving them by means of homological techniques was the origin of the rapidly developing field of combinatorial commutative algebra.  Reisner's criterion  A simplicial complex Œî is Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay over k if and only if for all simplices œÉ ‚àà Œî, all reduced simplicial homology groups of the link of œÉ in Œî with coefficients in k are zero, except the top dimensional one: : \\\\tilde{H}_{i}(\\\\operatorname{link}_\\\\Delta(\\\\sigma); k)=0\\\\quad \\\\text{for all} \\\\quad i<\\\\dim \\\\operatorname{link}_\\\\Delta(\\\\sigma). A result due to Munkres then shows that the Cohen‚ÄìMacaulayness of Œî over k is a topological property: it depends only on the homeomorphism class of the simplicial complex Œî. Namely, let |Œîbe the geometric realization of Œî. Then the vanishing of the simplicial homology groups in Reisner's criterion is equivalent to the following statement about the reduced and relative singular homology groups of |Œî|: : \\\\text{For all } p\\\\in|\\\\Delta|\\\\text{ and for all } i<\\\\dim |\\\\Delta= d-1, \\\\quad \\\\tilde{H}_i(\\\\operatorname |\\\\Delta|; k) = H_i(\\\\operatorname |\\\\Delta|, \\\\operatorname |\\\\Delta- p; k) = 0. In particular, if the complex Œî is a simplicial sphere, that is, |Œîis homeomorphic to a sphere, then it is Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay over any field. This is a key step in Stanley's proof of the Upper Bound Conjecture. By contrast, there are examples of simplicial complexes whose Cohen-Macaulayness depends on the characteristic of the field k.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The bridge is of Burr arch design, built by George W. Holmes in 1887. Name The bridge was named for a local official, Judge Poland, and was a controversial issue in 1888: : \\"Judge Poland has caused the Town of Cambridge to be inflicted with a bridge and a road at an expense of from $6,000-$10,000 which as shown will be of no material benefit to anyone but himself.

It was one of several small battles that occurred in Confederate Arizona near the border with Union held New Mexico Territory, this one being the largest. Background This battle occurred about thirty five miles south of Fort Craig, at the village of San Ygnacio de la Alamosa, familiarly known as Alamosa, near the confluence of Alamosa Creek with the Rio Grande. Alamosa was wrongly identified in Union Army reports as Canada Alamosa, the name later given to what is now present-day Monticello, New Mexico). Bethel Coopwood, the Confederate commander, correctly identified it as Alamosa in his report of September 29, 1861. Robert Nicholson Scott, Henry Martyn Lazelle, George Breckenridge Davis, Leslie J.

Wilson, Las Cruces, New Mexico, August 1985 Lieutenant Colonel John R. Baylor, who had led the 2nd Texas Mounted Rifles into New Mexico Territory one month earlier, defeated the Union garrison at the First Battle of Mesilla, proclaimed the area to be Confederate Arizona, and appointed himself its governor, sent patrols up the Rio Grande to keep watch on the Union posts at Fort Craig and Fort Stanton near the 34th parallel, the proposed northern border of the new territory. The Union Army, specifically the 3d Cavalry Regiment at Fort Craig, had launched a reconnaissance mission to guard against the approach of Confederate forces up the Rio Grande. The unit sent was a recently formed unit of New Mexican militia called Mink's Independent Cavalry Company. Captain John H. Minks company stopped at the village of San Ygnacio de la Alamosa (or La Alamosa), on the south side Arroyo Alamosa. There Mink ordered his men to build a camp next to the village. The camp consisted of a corral and breastworks, to subdue any possible and sudden Confederate counterattack. Battle A portrait of Captain Bethel Coopwood Before the corral and breastworks were finished on September 24, at about 5:00 pm, the Union force of around 100 and under Captain Minks, received information that mounted rebels had been seen in a southern direction from the camp. A six man cavalry troop with a Mexican scout was dispatched who returned saying the sighted men were Union deserters who evaded capture. Later that night, Union troops at the Canada Alamosa camp reported another sighting of armed men. Some said the unknown men in the dark fired into the town but this has never been confirmed. In response, Captain Minks put his troops on high alert. At this same time a few horses escaped the corral, about ten men were ordered to bring them back but some thirty ended up in the chase before Minks could prevent it, most of the thirty men deserted into the desert, crossing the Rio Grande to the east bank and headed for Paraje where another independent company of New Mexican cavalry guarded the approach along the Jornada del Muerto. A terrible Native American yell was heard, which had the Union troops thinking they were under attack by Apache. Then came the sound of cavalry and the shout \\"Here's their camp; give them hell!\\" At that moment the Union force knew they were not being attacked by Apaches but by twelve to fifteen Confederate troops, commanded by Captain Bethel Coopwood, from Mesilla. The firing commenced, the rebel cavalry first attacked the Union Army's main line. After this attack was repulsed, the rebels fell back to the town. The dozen Confederate cavalrymen had attempted to rout the Union army with the cover of nightfall but failed due to the lack of firepower. Shooting stopped for a short while, this made the Captain and his men think the rebels had retreated or were playing a ruse to lure Minks' men into a more effective range. So Captain Minks and a number of his men slowly advanced into town on foot, leaving his main body at camp. Not seeing anything, the force withdrew to find that even more Union troops had deserted. Lieutenant Sanches, of the Union, was ordered to bring the deserters back, then Minks attacked. The attack was made to drive the rebels out of town or to set fire to the perimeter houses which provided cover for the Confederates. The United States cavalry advanced, with wood and matches. Unfortunately for the Union, the Confederate force was larger than Minks had anticipated, 112 strong, they had also taken the houses Minks intended to burn. The advance was stopped by volleys of musket fire and after ten minutes the Union force had retreated back near camp at which they started from. By this time the Confederates had taken a hill next to the road which led to Fort Craig. Fighting continued for a long while, at almost daybreak. Captain John Minks had found his men reduced to the number ten. The ten and the Captain fought off the Confederates at long range for a few hours more while trying to communicate with the main force in camp, once again, the main body had deserted or withdrew thinking Minks and his assault party had been massacred. The Captain realized this and decided to fight as long as possible in order to prevent the pursuit and capture of his retreating main body. Looking through his spy-glass, Minks witnessed about sixty mounted rebels, ready to attack. Minks surrendered between 7:00 and 8:00 am, in order to prevent further casualties to his remaining ten men. The retreating main body made its way back to their fort and then followed up their defeat with another patrol farther south of Canada Alamosa. Minks reported that only one of the remaining ten men was wounded. Confederate reports say four other men were killed and six wounded. The ten men and Captain Minks were taken to Mesilla as prisoners, twelve other troops, deserters or not, were also captured by the rebel cavalry. At least three Confederates were wounded, none were reported killed. The rebels also captured a good size amount of supplies and a few horses and wagons.  Aftermath  The next day on September 26, 1861, after the battle of Canada Alamosa was over, the Union cavalry patrol under Captain Robert M. Morris, skirmished with Confederates involved in the Alamosa engagement in the Skirmish near Fort Thorn, New Mexico Territory. This skirmish occurred thirty miles southeast of the town at the north end of Mesilla Valley and 15 miles north of Fort Thorn. Union Colonel Edward Canby, in his report of the engagement, said ten Confederates were killed and over thirty wounded in a fight that lasted one hour and forty-two minutes long. The rebel commander Coopwood in his report to Lt. Col. Baylor reported two of the men were killed and seven others wounded. Captain Minks confirmed this with his report of the two skirmishes, written in captivity and allowed to be sent to his superiors. Union casualties were reported to be six wounded, this was one of the several other small battles in the region. Two days before the engagement at Canada Alamosa, on 23 September 1861, Coopwood's Confederate troops captured nine men from the New Mexico Volunteers, after a brief skirmish due north of Fort Craig. The force was questioned and the Confederates learned that 350 men garrisoned the fort with no artillery.

History Plymouth Rocks, 1910 In the United States, chickens were raised primarily on family farms or in some cases, in poultry colonies, such as Judge Emery's Poultry ColonyDavid Leighton, \\"Street Smarts: Tucson neighborhood originally was chicken colony,\\" Arizona Daily Star, Dec. 7, 2015 until about 1960. Originally, the primary value in poultry keeping was eggs, and meat was considered a byproduct of egg production.U.S. Department of Agriculture ‚Äì National Agricultural Statistics Service: Trends in U.S. Agriculture ‚Äì Broiler Industry A United States Department of the Interior census in 1840 found American farmers had a total combined poultry flock valued at approximately $12 million ($ million in today's dollars).. Following the Treaty of Wanghia between the US and China in 1844, oriental poultry breeds were imported to New England, and Rhode Island became the nation's first major poultry center. Cross-breeding between English and Asian birds created new breeds still common today, like the Barred Plymouth Rock. Chickens remained primarily to provide eggs, mostly to the farmer (subsistence agriculture), with commercialization still largely unexplored. Farm flocks tended to be small because the hens largely fed themselves through foraging, with some supplementation of grain, scraps, and waste products from other farm ventures. Such feedstuffs were in limited supply, especially in the winter, and this tended to regulate the size of the farm flocks. Soon after poultry keeping gained the attention of agricultural researchers (around 1896), improvements in nutrition and management made poultry keeping more profitable and businesslike. Poultry shows spread interest and understanding, with 88% of all farmers having chickens by 1910.. Barred Plymouth Rock hen, No. 31S. laid 237 eggs in first year at the Maine Agricultural Experiment Station (1903) Eggs were sold into urban markets, where residents did not have chickens to provide eggs for themselves.. Except in hot weather, eggs can be shipped and stored without refrigeration for some time before going bad; this was important in the days before widespread refrigeration. However, poultry meat supply was less than the demand, and poultry was expensive. Prior to about 1910, chicken was served primarily on special occasions or Sunday dinner. Poultry was shipped live or killed, plucked, and packed on ice (but not eviscerated). The \\"whole, ready-to-cook broiler\\" was not popular until the 1950s, when end-to-end refrigeration and sanitary practices gave consumers more confidence. Before this, poultry were often cleaned by the neighborhood butcher, though cleaning poultry at home was a commonplace kitchen skill. Two kinds of poultry were generally offered: broilers or \\"spring chickens,\\" young male chickens, a byproduct of the egg industry, which were sold when still young and tender (generally under 3 pounds live weight); and \\"fowls\\" or \\"stewing hens,\\" also a byproduct of the egg industry, which were old hens past their prime for laying.\\"The Dollar Hen\\", Milo Hastings, Arcadia Press, 1909; reprint Norton Creek Press, 2003, Robert Plamondon, Ed., pp. 145‚Äì150. This is no longer practiced; modern meat chickens are a different breed. Egg-type chicken carcasses no longer appear in stores. The major milestone in 20th century poultry production was the discovery of Vitamin D (named in 1922),\\"Poultry Nutrition\\", Ray Ewing, Ray Ewing Press, Third Edition, 1947, page 754. which made it possible to keep chickens in confinement year-round. Before this, chickens did not thrive during the winter due to lack of sunlight, and egg production, incubation, and meat production in the off- season were all very difficult, making poultry a seasonal and expensive proposition. Year-round production lowered costs, especially for broilers. Artificial daylight supplementation also started being used. At the same time, egg production was increased by scientific breeding. After a few false starts, such as the Maine Experiment Station's failure at improving egg production,\\"The Dollar Hen\\", Milo Hastings, Arcadia Press, 1909; reprint Norton Creek Press, 2003, Robert Plamondon, Ed., pp. 225‚Äì229. success was shown by Professor James Dryden at the Oregon Experiment Station.Dryden, James. Poultry Breeding and Management. Orange Judd Press, 1916. Improvements in production and quality were accompanied by lower labor requirements. In the 1930s through the early 1950s, 1,500 hens was considered to be a full-time job for a farm family. In the late 1950s, egg prices had fallen so dramatically that farmers typically tripled the number of hens they kept, putting three hens into what had been a single-bird cage or converting their floor- confinement houses from a single deck of roosts to triple-decker roosts. Not long after this, prices fell still further and large numbers of egg farmers left the business. This marked the beginning of the transition from family farms to larger, vertically integrated operations. This fall in profitability was accompanied by a general fall in prices to the consumer, allowing poultry and eggs to lose their status as luxury foods. The vertical integration of the egg and poultry industries was a late development, occurring after all the major technological changes had been in place for years (including the development of modern broiler rearing techniques, the adoption of the Cornish Cross broiler, the use of laying cages, etc.). By the late 1950s, poultry production had changed dramatically. Large farms and packing plants could grow birds by the tens of thousands, radically impacting labor practices alongside farming techniques.Stuesse, Angela and Laura Helton. \\"Low-Wage Legacies, Race, and the Golden Chicken in Mississippi: Where Contemporary Immigration Meets African American Labor History\\" , December 31, 2013, Southern Spaces. Chickens could be sent to slaughterhouses for butchering and processing into prepackaged commercial products to be frozen or shipped fresh to markets or wholesalers. Meat-type chickens currently grow to market weight in six to seven weeks whereas only fifty years ago it took three times as long.Havenstein, G.B., P.R. Ferket, and M.A. Qureshi, 2003a. Growth, livability, and feed conversion of 1957 versus 2001 broilers when fed representative 1957 and 2001 broiler diets. Poult. Sci. 82:1500‚Äì1508 This is due to genetic selection and nutritional modifications and not the use of growth hormones, which are illegal for use in poultry in the US and many other countries. Once a meat consumed only occasionally, the common availability and lower cost has made chicken a common meat product within developed nations. Growing concerns over the cholesterol content of red meat in the 1980s and 1990s further resulted in increased consumption of chicken. Current status Today, eggs are produced on large egg ranches on which environmental parameters are controlled. Chickens are exposed to artificial light cycles to stimulate egg production year-round. In addition, it is a common practice to induce molting through manipulation of light and the amount of food they receive in order to further increase egg size and production. On average, a chicken lays one egg a day for a number of days (a \\"clutch\\"), then does not lay for one or more days, then lays another clutch. Originally, the hen presumably laid one clutch, became broody, and incubated the eggs. Selective breeding over the centuries has produced hens that lay more eggs than they can hatch. Some of this progress was ancient, but most occurred after 1900. In 1900, average egg production was 83 eggs per hen per year. In 2000, it was well over 300. In the United States, laying hens are butchered after their second egg laying season. In Europe, they are generally butchered after a single season. The laying period begins when the hen is about 18‚Äì20 weeks old (depending on breed and season). Males of the egg-type breeds have little commercial value at any age, and all those not used for breeding (roughly fifty percent of all egg-type chickens) are killed soon after hatching. Such \\"day-old chicks\\" are sometimes sold as food for captive and falconers birds of prey.Raptor food Vet Ark, retrieved on 2008-08-02 The old hens also have little commercial value. Thus, the main sources of poultry meat a hundred years ago (spring chickens and stewing hens) have both been entirely supplanted by meat-type broiler chickens. Traditionally, chicken production was distributed across the entire agricultural sector. In the 20th century, it gradually moved closer to major cities to take advantage of lower shipping costs. This had the undesirable side effect of turning the chicken manure from a valuable fertilizer that could be used profitably on local farms to an unwanted byproduct. This trend may be reversing itself due to higher disposal costs on the one hand and higher fertilizer prices on the other, making farm regions attractive once more.\\"Poultry Litter for Fertilizer.\\" Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation. From the farmer's point of view, eggs used to be practically the same as currency, with general stores buying eggs for a stated price per dozen. Egg production peaks in the early spring, when farm expenses are high and income is low. On many farms, the flock was the most important source of income, though this was often not appreciated by the farmers, since the money arrived in many small payments. Eggs were a farm operation where even small children could make a valuable contribution.Milo Hastings, The Dollar Hen, Arcadia Press, 1909 (reissued by Norton Creek Press, 2003), chapter 12. . In 2015, the national flock suffered due to the spread of bird flu, affecting birds in fourteen states, leading to layoffs. A May 2015 report by the Associated Press reported that 10% of egg laying chickens were dead or dying due to bird flu. Beginning in June 2015, rationing of eggs had begun, leading to increased egg prices. Production statistics Eggs Between 2007 and 2010 a total of about 90 billion eggs were produced per year. Individual states Meat In 2008, 9.08 billion chickens were slaughtered in the United States according to United States Department of Agriculture data.Poultry Slaughter Annual Summary ‚Äì USDA Recommended culling practices The American Veterinary Medical Association recommends cervical dislocation and asphyxiation by carbon dioxide as the best options, but has recently amended their guidelines to include maceration, putting non-anesthetized chicks through a grinder.https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Documents/euthanasia.pdf The 2005‚Äì2006 American Veterinary Medical Association Executive Board held its final meeting July 13 in Honolulu, prior to the 2006 session of the House of Delegates and the AVMA Annual Convention. It proposed a policy change, which was recommended by the Animal Welfare Committee on disposal of unwanted chicks, poults, and pipped eggs. The new policy states, in part, \\"Unwanted chicks, poults, and pipped eggs should be killed by an acceptable humane method, such as use of a commercially designed macerator that results in instantaneous death. Smothering unwanted chicks or poults in bags or containers is not acceptable. Pips, unwanted chicks, or poults should be killed prior to disposal. A pipped egg, or pip, is one where the chick or poult has not been successful in escaping the egg shell during the hatching process.\\"Executive Board meets pressing needs ‚Äì September 15, 2006  Negative effects on poultry workers  In 2010, Human Rights Watch described slaughterhouse line work in the United States as a human rights crime. In a report by Oxfam America, slaughterhouse workers were observed not being allowed breaks, were often required to wear diapers, and were paid below minimum wage. Slaughterhouses in the United States commonly illegally employ and exploit underage workers and illegal immigrants. American slaughterhouse workers are three times more likely to suffer serious injury than the average American worker. The Guardian reports that on average there are two amputations a week involving slaughterhouse workers in the United States. On average, one employee of Tyson Foods, the largest meat producer in America, is injured and amputates a finger or limb per month. The act of slaughtering animals, or of raising or transporting animals for slaughter, may engender psychological stress or trauma in the people involved. A 2016 study in Organization indicates, \\"Regression analyses of data from 10,605 Danish workers across 44 occupations suggest that slaughterhouse workers consistently experience lower physical and psychological well-being along with increased incidences of negative coping behavior.\\" In her thesis submitted to and approved by University of Colorado, Anna Dorovskikh states that slaughterhouse workers are \\"at risk of Perpetration-Inducted Traumatic Stress, which is a form of posttraumatic stress disorder and results from situations where the concerning subject suffering from PTSD was a causal participant in creating the traumatic situation.\\" A 2009 study by criminologist Amy Fitzgerald indicates, \\"slaughterhouse employment increases total arrest rates, arrests for violent crimes, arrests for rape, and arrests for other sex offenses in comparison with other industries.\\" Safety issues Poultry production is regulated by the FDA, UL and OSHA. Due to the potential safety hazards of broken glass and chemicals like mercury and phosphors in consumable products, all lights within poultry production facilities must be safety coated.http://www.encapsulite.com/compliance.html The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service performs frequent checks on production facilities to ensure poultry is safe, wholesome and correctly labelled.http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety- education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/production-and- inspection/poultry-processing-questions-and-answers Chlorinated chicken In the United States it is common practice for chicken carcasses to be washed with antimicrobial rinses in order to remove harmful bacteria. These rinses, containing chlorine dioxide solution, acidified sodium chlorite, trisodium phosphate or peroxyacids, are often referred to as Pathogen Reduction Treatments. The process is said to reduce the prevalence of salmonella from 14% to 2%. Since 1997, the European Union has refused to permit the import of chicken treated in this way, claiming that it compensates for poor hygiene behaviour elsewhere in the supply chain and disincentivises the poultry industry to put in place proper hygiene practices. American negotiators say this is just protectionism. It is claimed by opponents of Brexit that this shows how British food safety standards would drop. UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox was said to have suggested that this might be part of a bilateral free trade agreement and was subsequently challenged to eat a chlorine-washed chicken live on camera. Steve Baker, formerly a Minister at the Department for Exiting the European Union, insisted in October 2018 that chlorine-washed chicken was just \\"clean chicken\\". Environmental issues The Illinois River, which flows between Arkansas and Oklahoma, has had a high level of pollution due to water runoff contaminated with chicken manure. The incineration of poultry wastes has been shown to have dangerous levels of a number of airborne pollutants, including heavy metals, aresenic, and halogens such as chlorine.

It provides training, counseling, and assistance to individuals who are involved with such groups. The organization also runs a retreat center called the Meadow Haven Retreat and Recovery Center. Organization Research institute New England Institute of Religious Research was co-founded by George Mather, coauthor of Dictionary of Cults, Sects, Religions and the Occult, along with Robert Pardon. The organization was founded with the intention to provide \\"training in ministering to those caught up in such destructive groups\\". The New England Institute of Religious Research studies cult-like organizations. Pardon is a former pastor. In 1993, Mather served as the organization's co-director, and in 2005 as its director. Pardon's article on determining when Bible study can degrade into a destructive cult was cited in the book When Prayer Fails. Pardon served as director of the organization in 1999. In 2000, Pardon served as the court- appointed guardian for 13 children of a religious sect in Attleboro, Massachusetts. The Institute worked with former members of the Attleboro sect, and in order to gain insight into the group, Pardon studied the sect's diaries. The group was led by Roland Robidoux. Attleboro District Court Judge Kenneth Nasif appointed Pardon to serve as guardian ad litem for the children that were previously removed from the group. The investigation into the Massachusetts group gained national media coverage. Pardon and the Institute has extensively studied the new religious movement, Twelve Tribes. In his capacity as director of the New England Institute of Religious Research, Pardon presented at a conference of the International Cultic Studies Association in 2001, and again in 2003, and 2004. The Institute is referenced as a resource for information on religious groups, in books including The Cult Next Door, Reflected Truth, Twisted Scriptures, and When Prayer Fails. Treatment center In 1999, the New England Institute of Religious Research purchased a nursing home in Lakeville, Massachusetts, intended to serve as a treatment center for up to 25 former members of cults. Pardon told The Boston Globe that residents will be given three months to reacclimate themselves to society and their families after leaving controversial groups. Other than this facility, as of 1999 the only other two such locations of treatment centers for individuals leaving cults include Wellspring in Ohio, and Odenwald Residence in Leibenstadt, Germany ‚Äì both of which maintain treatment programs of two-weeks in duration. The center opened on May 25, 2002, at a luncheon benefit celebrating the tenth anniversary of the New England Institute of Religious Research. The treatment center, called Meadow Haven, utilizes a three-pronged approach to recovery. First, individuals are assisted in identifying their religious problems and setting goals for recovery. Next, the treatment center helps them understand the dangers of being a member in a cult, and learn methods to put their life back together. Then, the final phase includes improving one's self-esteem, developing ways to reenter the community, and building a focus towards the future. Full recovery can take up to six months, though according to Pardon after a month at the treatment center individuals begin to feel better. As of 2005, Pardon served as the director of Meadow Haven. Commentary The Chicago Sun-Times described the Institute as \\"a clearinghouse for cult information in Massachusetts\\". The Buffalo News cited the Institute for research on a controversial group known as \\"the Community\\", noting it performed \\"an in-depth study\\" of the group. The Boston Herald also cited the Institute's research, on a controversial sect in Attleboro, Massachusetts. The Associated Press described the institute as \\"an anti-cult organization\\". The Morning Call quoted a director of the Institute, George Mather, as instructing community residents that Satanists perform rituals during Halloween to summon demons. Mather said that parents should not dress up as witches or devils for Halloween, as that would promote a wrong value system. Andrew Walsh of Trinity College in the journal Religion in the News criticized the Institute's representation of Bob and Judy Pardon citing statements from the Institute that they hold \\"advanced degrees in their field\\" which he wrote were actually standard M.Div and M.Ed. degrees respectively. Walsh criticized the Institute's labeling of groups as cults including Unitarian Universalists, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Bah√° º√≠, Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, and the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches.

Established in 1998, it is active in the development of electric vehicle motors and related power systems. After spinning-off from Hydro-Qu√©bec's research center to commercialize their electric powertrain technologies, TM4 encountered some success in the 2000s, participating in many short-lived OEM demonstration programs. Commercially, things began to take-off in the 2010s, especially after they diversified their product ranges to serve the commercial vehicle (bus and truck) market. As of 2018, thousands of electric and hybrid vehicles were equipped with TM4 systems. To help TM4 become a global player in the supply of electric drivetrain components, Hydro-Qu√©bec, who had been its sole shareholder for most of TM4's existence, announced that it planned to set up a joint-venture with a world-scale auto parts manufacturer to facilitate the mass production and marketing of its product. In line with this strategy, it announced in June 2018 that Dana Corporation would take over as majority shareholder of the company, while it would keep a minority stake. In 2019, Hydro-Qu√©bec announces that the company has invested $85 million to maintain its 45% interest in TM4, now called Dana TM4, and that now includes the following strategic relationships: * The exclusive property of Chinese company Dana Electric Motor Co. Ltd, formerly called Prestolite E-Propulsion Systems (PEPS), in which Dana TM4 previously held a 50% interest. Dana Electric Motor Co. manufactures and markets electric powertrain systems, particularly for buses and trucks. This transaction will enable Dana TM4 to optimize its operations and ensure the development of its activities in China, the fastest- growing market in terms of transportation electrification. * The integration of the activities of electric motor company SME, an Italian company which has developed a range of electric motors and controls for a wide range of off- highway electric vehicle applications, including material handling, agriculture, construction, and automated-guided vehicles. SME low-voltage systems are a perfect complement to the Dana TM4 high-voltage product line. This investment puts Dana TM4 in a position to offer electric powertrain systems for all types of land vehicles, including light vehicles (cars and pickups), commercial vehicles (buses and trucks), and off-highway vehicles (construction, mining, and lift trucks). Background A TM4 M–§TIVE motor  Technology development  On August 19, 1994, the Premier of Quebec, Daniel Johnson, had announced a C$100 million project to develop an electric car for the year 2000. On August 30, 1994, Hydro-Qu√©bec had presented their first prototype based on a Dodge Intrepid. The economy in fuel consumption was evaluated between 80 and 85%. The project was cancelled in 1995 and many have seen the abandonment of this project as a repetition of the history of the CF-105. In 1998, Hydro-Qu√©bec worked on a prototype with a joint venture between Dassault Group and Soci√©t√© de V√©hicules Electriques, the first prototypes based on a Renault Kangoo were built in 2006. Hydro-Qu√©bec has been criticized for not having taken advantage of some of its innovations. An electric wheel motor concept that struck a chord with Quebecers, first prototyped in 1994 by Pierre Couture, an engineer and physicist working at Institut de recherche d'Hydro-Qu√©bec (IREQ), is one of these. The heir to the Couture wheel motor is now marketed by TM4, a subsidiary that has made deals with France's Dassault and Heuliez to develop an electric car, the Cleanova, of which prototypes were built in 2006. Hydro-Qu√©bec announced in early 2009 at the Montreal International Auto Show that its engine had been chosen by Tata Motors to equip a demonstration version of its Indica model, which will be road tested in Norway. IREQ's researchers are also working on developing new battery technologies for electric cars. Current research is focusing on technologies to increase range, improve performance in cold weather and reduce charging time. Pilot programs and expansion of product range Tata Indica EV equipped with a TM4 MOTIVE motor The first commercialization of the systems started in 2004 with the interest of Cleanova and Peugeot. Citro√´n had presented their new diesel hybrid Citro√´n C-M√©tisse equipped with the TM4 motor at the Paris auto show in 2006. In 2009, 110 units were delivered to the Milj√∏ and Tata Motors demonstration project in Norway. In 2011, Tata Motors expect to sell up to 5000 of their Indica Vista EV in Europe, and to be able to face this demand, TM4 has upgraded its production facilities in Boucherville to be able to produce up to 10,000 units of their MOTIVE powertrain systems per year if needed. Over the years TM4 has diversified its product range based on the needs of two segments of the transportation industry. Its MOTIVE systems are compact and power dense in order to be integrated into light-duty on and off-road vehicle platforms while the SUMO motors are high torque, direct drive system optimized for buses and commercial vehicles. The Soci√©t√© de transport de Montr√©al (STM) announced that it would replace the aging fleet of buses with a new family of buses powered by TM4 engine. All buses that run on the network of the STM in 2026 should run on electricity. The current fleet of 1,600 buses need 50 million liters of diesel each year. The plan would eliminate the need of diesel and eventually reduce the greenhouse gas. Los Angeles-based Thor Trucks use a TM4 for their battery- electric truck. Mass production and joint-venture in China China being one of the biggest market for electric buses, TM4 announced in 2012 the creation of a 50/50 joint venture in China. In partnership with Prestolite Electric Beijing Limited (PEBL), TM4 created Prestolite E-Propulsion Systems (PEPS). Under this agreement, PEPS will produce the technologies developed by TM4 under license and will market them to the commercial vehicle and bus industry (the TM4 SUMO systems). In 2014, TM4 and PEPS announced the beginning of high volume production in the Beijing plant as well as its first large scale commercial orders, from major Chinese bus manufacturers such as Foton Motor. In May 2017, it was announced that PEPS had produced and sold more than 5000 electric bus powertrains for the Chinese market. Later that month, the first Novabus LFSe buses using TM4 powertrains have started operating in Montreal in 2017. TM4 is also supplying Quebec-based Lion Bus with drivetrain systems, as well as many other truck and bus manufacturers and integrators in North America and Europe. On June 22, 2018, Dana Incorporated and Hydro-Quebec jointly announced that TM4 would turned into a 55 / 45 joint-venture. Both parties believe that by partnering and complementing their respective strengths, TM4 will be able to reach its full potential. In July 2019, Hydro- Qu√©bec announces that the company has invested $85 million to secure the growth of TM4, now called Dana TM4, and to ensure its leadership position in the electric powertrain sector. This investment includes the exclusive property of Chinese company Dana Electric Motor Co. Ltd, formerly called Prestolite E-Propulsion Systems (PEPS), by Dana TM4, in which it previously held a 50% interest.

Plot A bunch of thieves kidnap a boy in a red hoodie from his mother's arms. This is followed by an action-packed car chase full of breaking boxes, defacing cars, and slim getaways. The chase ends when the kidnappers are saved by an oncoming train, which cuts off the police from their trail. They find this a perfect opportunity to dump the kid and make their getaway. The boy is returned to his family but the kidnappers' gang beat them up for their failure. Following a castration threat, the kidnapper/thief goes home to rape his girlfriend. Following this, he robs a cigarette dispenser and stabs the beat cop who catches him. This leads to a detective to start asking questions. The following day, while the thief is picking up his aforementioned girlfriend from her office, he notices the young brown-haired daughter of his girlfriend's boss, and decides to kidnap her. After a love-making session with his girlfriend in her apartment, the kidnapper leaves to find his friend and convinces him to join his plan. We are shown how tough a cop the detective is through a cut scene. The protagonist (kidnapper) and his gang start stalking the girl while she's playing tennis with her father and his friends. Using his girlfriend's stolen red car, the thieves go buy guns from an old confidant (\\"Papa\\") of theirs. The guns are worth 100 thousand lira each and, if they kill someone, their confidant keeps their deposit. Not wanting to pay their confidant the deposit, they murder Papa and his staff, and make their escape. They then catch up with their target while she is discussing her future with the boy she wants to marry in his car in the middle of a forest. Her boyfriend shows his reluctance to marry her unless she refuses her inheritance on the basis of principle. The girl refuses and starts making out with her boyfriend against his will. The kidnappers then attack and kidnap her and murder her boyfriend. However, the girl then escapes into the forest until she reaches a bungalow where she is taken in, and the family agree to protect her. The bad guys break in nevertheless, murder an old man, humiliate the rest, and run off with the girl, who they stash in an abandoned ship yard. After returning his girlfriend's car to her, he murders her by drowning and disposes of her car. During all this, the inspector gets a lead when three bad guys make a ransom call and ask for \\"No Police interference\\". While posting a ransom letter that they had forced the girl to write, one of the thieves realizes the cops have discovered the murder of the daughter of his girlfriend's boss. The cops conclude all the murders and thefts were by the same gang. Deducing the kidnappers knew the girlfriend, the cops decide to visit her apartment. The protagonist notices this and follows them back to his own apartment and sees them discover his connection to the whole mess. Scared, he calls his acquaintance, the guy who had beat him up, and asks for a deal. He then goes to the police and acts innocent to throw off suspicion from himself. When he and the detective visit the acquaintance, he covers for his \\"friend\\", and then threatens the kidnapper with castration again. After the cops start closing in on him, the protagonist goes insane and murders the hostage (the girl), a shoot-out ensues, and only the protagonist survives. He runs off to hide, but the detective finds him the next day and shoots him in the head.

After an unpleasant meeting with the actor, Lenzi found him to be \\"unreliable from both a human and professional point of view.\\" Lenzi would not do the film if Porel was cast and he told the producer \\"It's him or me.\\" The producer suggested Tomas Milian, who had appeared in numerous spaghetti westerns. Lenzi admits that his first meeting with Milian was difficult; Milian had heard that he was an \\"impulsive, hot-headed director.\\" Despite the stories Milian felt Lenzi was the right person for the job. This would begin what Lenzi has called a love‚Äìhate relationship between the two that would continue for six more films. American actor Richard Conte was originally cast as Commissario Walter Grandi, but Conte dropped out of the production and Henry Silva was cast in his place. Lenzi states that he worked hard to have Silva fit the role of a tough cop because Silva was more tailored to play villainous roles.Like a Beast...Almost Documentary, 2005.

Monument near the Maison des Esclaves on Gor√©e Island Saint-Louis in 1780 Various European powers, such as Portugal, the Netherlands, and England then competed for trade in the area of Senegal from the 15th century onward. The Portuguese first established a post on the island of Gor√©e in 1444, from where they organized a slave trade.International Dictionary of Historic Places: Middle East and Africa by Trudy Ring p.303 The island was captured by the Dutch in 1588, where they established defensive forts and developed trade further. In 1659, France established the trading post of Saint-Louis, Senegal. The European powers continued contending for the island of Gor√©e, until in 1677, France led by Jean II d'Estr√©es during the Franco-Dutch War (1672‚Äì1678) ended up in possession of the island, which it would keep for the next 300 years. In 1758 the French settlement was captured by a British expedition as part of the Seven Years' War, but was later returned to France in 1783, following French victory in the American Revolutionary War. The states of the Wolof and Sereer, neighbouring the two colonial outposts, were particularly involved with the slave trade, having strong military organizations geared to supplying slaves to the Europeans.Encyclopedia of African history Kevin Shillington p.541 According to historians such as Professor Fran√ßois G. Richard and Professor Martin A. Klein, the Serer states such as Sine and Saloum were not heavily involved in the slave trade. Fran√ßois G. Richard posits that: In his 1968 publication: Islam and Imperialism in Senegal: Sine- Saloum, 1947-1914, Professor Martin A. Klein notes that, although slavery had existed in Wolof and Serer culture, as well that of their neighbors, the institution of slavery did not exist among the Serer Noon, Serer N'Di√©ghem, and the Jola people, \\"who had egalitarian social structures and simple political institutions.\\"Klein, Martin A., Islam and Imperialism in Senegal: Sine-Saloum, 1847-1914, Leland Stanford Junior University (Edinburgh University Press) (1968), p. 165, Klein also notes that: \\"In times of peace, the Kingdom of Siin more readily supplied grain, cattle and other basic necessities to the French.\\" According to Professor Mamadou Diouf and Profssor Mara Leichtman (2009), the Serer Saafi were also purely egalitarian and rejected all forms of centralised government, the caste system, Islam and slavery.Diouf, Mamadou; and Leichtman, Mara; New Perspectives on Islam in Senegal: Conversion, Migration, Wealth, Power, and Femininity, Springer (2009), p 93, (Retrieved 11 July 2019) Conflicts erupted with the Muslims to the north, as when Marabout Nasr al Din attacked Mauritania and the Wolof across the border in 1673, but he was defeated through an alliance between local forces and the French. 19th-century territorial conquests The Senegal River area, 1853 During the Napoleonic Wars, Great Britain captured Gor√©e in 1803 and Saint-Louis in 1809, and proclaimed the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, to which the French had to agree upon recovering the two posts. The 19th century thus saw a decline in the slave trade, and the rise of commodity production instead. The trade of acacia gum, used for dyes for high- quality textiles and for medicine production, became paramount. Peanut cultivation also proved to be a valuable resource for the area.Klein, M. (2007). France's African Colonies. In T. Benjamin (Ed.) Encyclopedia of Western Colonialism since 1450, (Vol. 2). (pp. 490) Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA. Moorish tribes meet to trade gum arabic at Bakel on the Senegal river, 1890 In the Franco-Trarzan War of 1825, the French started to assert control of the mouth of the Senegal river against the rival state of Trarza. In the 1850s, the French under the governor Louis Faidherbe, began to expand their foothold onto the Senegalese mainland, at the expense of the native kingdoms. From 1854, Faidherbe started to establish a series of inland forts up the Senegal River. In 1855, he conquered the Kingdom of Waalo defeating Queen Ndat√© Yalla Mbodj (the reigning Lingeer of Waalo at the time) and her husband Marosso Tass√© Diop (commander of her armyAdand√©, Alexis; and Arinze, Emmanuel; The place of Women in the Museum of Saint-Louis, [in] \\"Museums & urban culture in West Africa\\", Published on behalf of the West African Museums Programme in association with the International African Institute [by] James Currey (2002), pp. 145-146, ). A counter-attack by the Toucouleur in 1857 led to the Siege of Medina Fort in which the Toucouleur failed. In 1859, the Serers of Sine, led by their king - Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof launched an attack against the French and their ally forces, resulting in the Battle of Logand√®me. Although defeated at Logand√®me in Fatick, and one of his principalities (Fatick) burned to the ground under the orders of Faidherb, Kumba Ndoffene spent the next few years of his life destroying French infrastructure and their economic base in Senegal, as well as defending his country from another threat - Islamic jihad by the Muslim marabouts of Senegambia.Diouf, Cheikh, \\"Fiscalit√© et Domination Coloniale: l'exemple du Sine: 1859-1940\\", Universit√© Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar (2005)Klein, Martin A., Islam and Imperialism in Senegal Sine-Saloum, 1847‚Äì1914, p. 46.

West Africa circa 1875 By 1860, the forts built between M√©dine and St. Louis allowed Faidherbe to launch missions against the Trarza Moors in Waalo (north of the Senegal river), who had previously collected taxes on goods coming to Saint-Louis from the interior. Faidherbe also started the westernization of the area by developing banks, civil administration, and also established an accord with Senegal‚Äôs religion, Islam.Klein, M. (2007). France's African Colonies. In T. Benjamin (Ed.)Encyclopedia of Western Colonialism since 1450, (Vol. 2). (pp. 493) Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA. In 1902, Dakar became the capital of French West Africa. Expansion continued under Governor Louis Bri√®re de l'Isle from 1876 to 1881. Through diplomatic and military efforts, Briere reinforced French control on the Senegal river, the \\"Peanut Basin\\" and the Guinea Coast in favour of the development of millet, peanut and cotton trade.Slavery and colonial rule in French West Africa Martin A. Klein p. 59 He also developed railroad projects that would facilitate further expansion as far as French Sudan (modern Mali). From 1880, France endeavoured to build a railway system, centered around the Saint-Louis‚ÄìDakar line that involved taking military control of the surrounding areas, leading to the military occupation of mainland Senegal. The construction of the Dakar-Niger Railway also began at the end of the 19th century under the direction of the French officer Gallieni. However, there was much opposition of the railroads being built from the natives. This was especially true with Muslim leader Lat Jor and his following. The first Governor General of Senegal was named in 1895, overseeing most of the territorial conquests of Western Africa, and in 1904, the territories were formally named French West Africa (AOF: \\"Afrique Occidentale Fran√ßaise\\"), of which Senegal was a part and Dakar its capital.

The staining is most often blue, but could also be grey or black. Because the grouping is based solely on symptomatics, it is not a monophyletic grouping.  Included species  Depending on the author, the group can include between 100‚Äì250 species of Ascomycetes and Deuteromycetes. They are usually divided into three different groups: # Ascomycetes fungi from the genera Ceratocystis, Ophiostoma, Ceratocystiopsis, Grosmannia. These are usually transmitted between trees by bark beetles of the subfamily Scolytinae. # Several black yeasts including Hormonema dematioides, Aureobasidium pullulans, Rhinocladiella atrovirens, and Phialophora species. # Several dark molds such as Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides. Importance of the symbiotic relationship between blue stain fungi and bark beetles. Symbiotic association between bark beetles and species of blue stain fungi is a well- known and studied phenomenon in the forestry pathology. Some bark beetle species like Mountain Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) feed on phloem layer just underneath the bark of a lodgepole pines when they are developing from larval to adult stage. Mountain Pine Beetle carry the spores of at least 2 known blue stain fungi species, Ophiostoma clavigerum and Ophiostoma montium. These spores are carried on the exoskeleton of the beetles from one tree to another and aid the insects in overcoming defence mechanisms of different pine species. After the beetles initiate their attack and bore through the bark spores are released. These spores immediately start to multiply and block important conductive vessels within the tree tissues. The tree loses its ability to produce resin and to defend itself. Trade and pulp production problems associated with blue stain fungi Developing spores of the blue stain fungi are a concern in packaging materials used for shipping from Canada to Australia. Potential of introducing invasive species of fungi. According to Pulp and Paper Research Institute of Canada the wood infected with the blue stain fungus have a high proportion of fines that are not suitable for pulp production.  Economic importance  Spalting in beech The major economic damage caused by the blue stain fungi is aesthetic because of the usually undesirable discoloration of wood. Some of the fungi have also been shown to have detrimental effects on the strength properties of infected wood. Conversely, in some cases the staining is desirable in fine wood crafting applications where it is called spalting.

The tragedy was immortalised by the poet William McGonagall. The two steam boats Nellie and Maud formed the Kessock Ferry before, during and until just after the First World War. They were named after relatives of Lord Burton of Dochfour, whose family owned the Kessock Estate and the ferry.

Built by James Lamont & Co of Port Glasgow, she was launched on 7 February 1951 and was capable of carrying eight cars, with a small indoor passenger cabin. She was retained as relief vessel in 1967 and went on to do salvage and rig support work, eventually being scrapped at Invergordon. The Inbhir Nis, a four-vehicle vessel, was added in the 1950s. The Rosehaugh was purchased in 1967, a much larger ferry boat, with ramps on all four corners.

It is one of the many areas in Western Romania with a significant Hungarian population, and it is a stronghold of old Transylvanian Hungarian folk traditions.  Geography  »öara CƒÉlatei is a rural region situated just west of Cluj-Napoca in the western part of Cluj County and in the southern part of SƒÉlaj County. Its historical center is the small town of Huedin. The region has an ethnically mixed population: Romanians, Hungarians and Roma. Its Jewish population suffered heavily during the Second World War. In 2011 the census results of Romania show that the Hungarians are 20,000 people strong and form a minority of 30 percent of the total population.  Name  The region takes its name from the CƒÉlata people. The name formerly referred to a much larger territory; according to Lajos Kelemen's study on the history and historical monuments of the »öara CƒÉlatei region, during the Middle Ages the area reached from the BarcƒÉu River to the Cri≈üul Repede River. The region as it is known today lies mainly west of Cluj-Napoca, although there are also some villages to the north and east as well which follow Kalotaszeg customs. Huedin Reformed Church Traditional Hungarian costumes from Izvoru Cri≈üului  »öara CƒÉlatei in popular culture  The region was featured in the film Kalotaszegi Madonna (\\"Madonna from »öara CƒÉlatei\\", 1943), made in Northern Transylvania, when it was a part Kingdom of Hungary (1920‚Äì1946) between 1940-1944. The plot revolves around the region and the city of Cluj-Napoca, but some of the scenes were shot in the region as well.  The Hungarian Community  Hungarians, mostly minority in the region, are nevertheless in high number, and majority in some villages. The dominant religion in this ethnic group is Calvinism, with the exception of the village Leghia () which is Catholic, and Huedin () also has a smaller Catholic church. The churches are typically of white color, surrounded by wall, they have a tetragonal bell tower with a wooden pointed dome. The worship is attended segregated by gender and age. Female traditional clothes can be distinguished by being very highly colorful and decorated, with corollas full of pearls. Such items can be found in the Ethnographic Museums in Budapest and in Cluj-Napoca, but the locals still preserve, produce and wear these clothes on special occasions. Since they live near Cluj-Napoca, they largely take part in the Hungarian Cultural Days of Cluj as organizers or folklore performers.

The film was directed by Marshall Neilan, and is based on the novel of the same name, written by James Ashmore Creelman, who also wrote the screenplay. It was Rudy Vallee's first feature film, and also starred Sally Blane, Marie Dressler, and Charles Sellon. The film premi√®red in New York City on November 26, 1929, and was released wide on December 1. A DVD version was released on March 29, 2005. The Vagabond Lover is an early example of a vehicle created for a popular music star, in a style echoed by later films such as Jailhouse Rock with Elvis Presley and A Hard Day's Night with The Beatles. Plot Rudy Bronson is a senior in a small college in the Midwest. While in school, he completes a correspondence course in the saxophone, given by the nationally known Ted Grant. Bronson and his friends form a band, but have difficulty finding work. Believing that Grant will help them land professional jobs, the band heads to the Long Island, New York home of Grant. Once there, they pester Grant for an interview, to the point where Grant leaves his home, along with his manager, to stay in New York City, until Bronson gives up and goes home. After Grant has left, his next door neighbor, Mrs. Whitehall, grows suspicious of the unknown young men hanging around his house. Thinking they might be burglars, she calls the police. Whitehall and her niece, Jean, go over to Grant's house to confront Bronson. Thinking quickly, one of Bronson's friends introduce him as Ted Grant, who Whitehall, despite being neighbors, has never met. The police are still suspicious, but when Bronson and his band plays for them, they believe he is Grant. In fact, Whitehall is so impressed, and slightly embarrassed over having called the police, that she hires Bronson's band to play at a charity concert. As they are waiting for the day of the concert to arrive, Bronson and Jean become romantically involved, and the band becomes relatively successful. However, on the night before the charity event, Jean discovers that Bronson has been impersonating Grant, and while she doesn't go public with her discovery, she is understandably quite upset with Bronson's subterfuge. However, another socialite does report Bronson to the police, but before he can be arrested, Grant returns and claims credit for discovering Bronson and his band. The band becomes a great success, and Bronson is reconciled with Jean.

Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times, gave it an overall positive review, noting that film, \\"... relies on fun, tuneful songs and appealing music.\\" He applauded Rudy Vallee's and Marie Dressler's performances, although he did have some negative points regarding the dialogue and was ambivalent regarding some of the acting. A review published in Motion Picture Magazine was less than positive. \\"Once and for all, this movie should refute the theory apparently held by picture producers that a celebrity in any line is good movie material,\\" the reviewer summed up. The reviewer did, however, praise Marie Dressler's performance and wrote in conclusion, \\"If you like sentimental songs that rhyme 'Moonbeams' with 'June-dreams,' you'll love the ones in 'The Vagabond Lover.'\\"The song the reviewer is referring to is \\"Then I'll Be Reminded of You,\\" which contains the lyrics \\"I'll gather some June-dreams / I'll search for some moonbeams.\\" \\"It's true that the crooning lad of the radio has not quite mastered all of the celluloid technique, but you forget that when he sings,\\" wrote Delight Evans in her review for Screenland. She concluded, \\"Marie Dressler romps away with a personal hit in hilarious comedy scenes. But it's Rudy's show, and when he sings you can let the rest of the world go by.\\" The picture was given Screenland's Seal of Approval. \\"[Rudy Vall√©e] gives his admirers what they long for‚Äîa succession of songs to the accompaniment of a jazz band which makes their hearts melt and fills their beings with a glow of 'romance,'\\" Alexander Bakshy wrote for The Nation. Vall√©e himself was not a fan of the film. In a 1980 TV interview, he mused, \\"They're still fumigating the theaters where it was shown. Almost ruined me. In fact, I think it's only shown in penitentiaries and comfort stations.\\" Author Scott Eyman agreed with Vallee. \\"Neilan's The Vagabond Lover features the adenoidal singing and ungodly dance- band music of Ruby Vallee, who displays the preoccupied concern of a man trying to pass a kidney stone; his acting ability was of the sort usually found only in sixth-grade plays. Vallee makes Crosby look like Cagney and plays the kind of music that Spike Jones mercilessly parodied. It's the film of a director at a total loss; actors stumble over their lines but plow gamely ahead, and Neilan keeps the footage in the film. It might not all be Neilan's fault; the original negative of the film was burned in a studio fire, and the film survives today as reconstructed with outtakes.\\"Eyman, Scott. The Sound of Silence: Hollywood and the Talkie Revolution. Simon and Schuster, New York: 1997. Production Vallee was angry after viewing the film's trailer, which contained the slogan, \\"Men Hate Him‚ÄîWomen Love Him.\\" However, it was too late into production to change.

He was admitted M.A. at Oxford on 9 July 1575, and was incorporated in that degree at Cambridge in 1579. In 1571 he occurs as minister of Battle, Sussex. He was appointed headmaster of Tonbridge School, Kent, by the Skinners' Company of London, a position he held from 1578 to 1588.Septimus Rivington, The history of Tonbridge school from its foundation in 1553 to the present date (1869), p. 75. It is supposed that Sir Robert Heath was one of his pupils. He was a celebrated and powerful preacher, and obtained the vicarage of Tonbridge. He was one of the select groups of Puritans (with Laurence Chaderton, George Gifford, Laurence Humphrey, John Knewstub, Thomas Sampson, and Henry Smith) who preached at Paul's Cross.Richard L. Greaves, Society and Religion in Elizabethan England (1981), p. 84. His style was very plain, in common with Bartimaeus Andrewes, Chaderton, Gifford, Stephen Egerton, William Fulke, William Perkins, and Hugh Roberts.Ronald B. Jenkins, Henry Smith: England's silver-tongued preacher (1983), p. 51. He had strong Sabbatarian views,http://www.wcg.org/lit/law/sabbath/sun-sab1.htm was one of the Puritan critics of the theatre,http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3437/is_2_39/ai_n28733641/ and took particular exception to semi-nude dancing. He also felt schooling paid too much attention to classical authors.Rowe, M. W. (2004) Philosophy and Literature: a book of essays; p. 104. At one period he was in great poverty. The records of the corporation of Gravesend show that on 30 August 1594 he received a contribution of forty shillings out of the stock of the chamber of that town, requested by Sir Robert Sidney. He had ceased to be master of Tonbridge School by 1597, when his textbook Progymnasma Scholasticum was published. In the dedication of that work to Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex he acknowledges his kindness in relieving his poverty and protecting him from antagonists. It is believed that he retained the vicarage of Tonbridge till his death. He was buried there on 27 July 1610. Jonathan Stockwood of St. John's College, Cambridge (B. A. 1606, M. A. 1609), may have been his son.

The Plugless Power EVSE wirelessly delivers electrical power to the on-board EV battery charger using electromagnetic induction without a physical connection (cable) to the vehicle. An EV equipped with a Plugless Vehicle Adapter can be charged by parking it over an inductive Plugless Parking Pad. The active step of plugging a cord into the vehicle is eliminated. History and development In 2009, Evatran began development of Plugless Power, an inductive charging system for charging Electric Vehicles without plugging in. Field trials were begun in March 2010. The first system was sold to Google in 2011 for employee use at the Mountain View campus. Evatran began selling the Plugless L2 Wireless charging system to the public in 2014. In simple terms, inductive charging works by separating the two halves of an electric transformer with an air gap ‚Äì one half, the Plugless Power Vehicle Adapter, is installed on the vehicle and the other half, the Plugless Power Parking Pad, is installed on the floor of a garage or in a parking lot. When a car with an Adapter drives over a Pad, the two pieces are brought into close proximity, , then current from the electrical grid flows through the coils in the Power Pad to create magnetic fields and these fields induce current flow in the Vehicle Adapter's coils to charge the battery. Idaho National Laboratory (INL) testing in 2013 found the system had a power delivery efficiency between 84%-90%, compared to 95%-99% for corded charging systems, depending on the alignment of the Adapter and Pad, the separation gap, and the rate of power transfer in use (kW). In 2014, Popular Science included the Plugless L2 charging system as Best of What's New 2014. Former Chrysler CEO, Tom LaSorda, joined Evatran as a strategic adviser in October 2014. LaSorda joined the management board at Daimler in 2004, then served as CEO and president of Chrysler from 2004 to 2007. As of October 2016, the Plugless L2 was being sold for use with the Nissan LEAF, Chevrolet Volt, Cadillac ELR and Tesla Model S. Until June 2020, support for BMW i3 had been added, while the original plans were much more ambitious: targeting 80% of EVs by 2017. Manufacturer Founded in 2009, Evatran was formed as a clean technology subsidiary of MTC Transformers, an award-winning American manufacturer of high-quality, precision-engineered transformers and rewind services based in Wytheville, Virginia.

Regorafenib shows anti- angiogenic activity due to its dual targeted VEGFR2-TIE2 tyrosine kinase inhibition. Since 2009 it was studied as a potential treatment option in multiple tumor types. By 2015 it had two US approvals for advanced cancers. Approvals and indications Metastatic colorectal cancer Regorafenib demonstrated to increase the overall survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and has been approved by the US FDA on September 27, 2012. After a manufacturer's appeal Regorafenib was restored to the list of treatments funded by the English Cancer Drugs Fund. Advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours On February 25, 2013 the US FDA expanded the approved use to treat patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors that cannot be surgically removed and no longer respond to other FDA- approved treatments for this disease. In a clinical study with 199 patients regorafenib treated patients had a delay in tumor growth (progression-free survival) that was, on average, 3.9 months longer than patients who were given placebo. Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma On November 29, 2018 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) approved use of regorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were previously treated with sorafenib. Clinical trials MetastaticCRC: After the CORRECT trial, two phase 3 trials (CONSIGN, CONCUR) showed benefits compared to placebo. Regorafenib dosing was 150 or 160 mg/d for first 3 weeks of each 4 week cycle.CONSIGN, CONCUR Confirm Efficacy of Regorafenib in mCRC. 2015 Adverse effects Regorafenib is being approved with a Boxed Warning alerting patients and health care professionals that severe and fatal liver toxicity occurred in patients treated with regorafenib during clinical studies. Serious side effects, which occurred in less than one percent of patients, were liver damage, severe bleeding, blistering and peeling of skin, very high blood pressures requiring emergency treatment, heart attacks and perforations (holes) in the intestines. The most common side effects reported in patients treated with regorafenib include weakness or fatigue, loss of appetite, hand-foot syndrome (also called palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia), diarrhoea, mouth sores (mucositis), weight loss, infection, high blood pressure, and changes in voice volume or quality (dysphonia). Other actions Regorafenib and at least one of its analogs, sorafenib, are potent inhibitors of Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). sEH metabolizes, and in general thereby inactivates, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EDPs), epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EEQs), and other epoxy polyunsaturated fatty acids that are made by various cytochrome P450 epoxygenases. EETs, EDPs, and EEQs have various effects in animals including vasodilation, anti-hypertensive, and anti-blood-clotting actions. However, EDPs, unlike EETs, inhibit the vascularization, growth, and metastasis of human cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. It is suggested that the inhibition of sEH and consequential increase in EDP levels contributes to the anti-cancer activity of regorafenib and related analogs, a possibility supported by studies showing that 1) DHA acted synergistically with regorafenib to increase EDP levels in and inhibit the growth of several human renal cancer cell lines in vitro and 2) dietary DHA likewise acted synergistically with regorafenib to inhibit the invasiveness and growth of a human renal cancer cell line while increasing its EPA levels in mice. These preclinical studies suggest that dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA, may be useful in enhancing the anti-cancer actions of regorafenib in humans.

The bridge is oriented east-west across the Brewster River, and rests on abutments of stone and concrete. It is a single-span Burr arch truss design, with a length of , a total width of , and a roadway width of (one lane). It is covered by a metal gabled roof, which projects beyond the truss ends. The trusses consists of vertical posts with diagonal bracing, flanked on each side by a rounded arch made of single timbers bolted together. The exterior is clad in vertical board siding, which extends around to the insides of the portals. Each of the long side walls has two rectangular window cutouts. The deck is made of wooden planking. with The bridge is one of three in the town of Cambridge, and is one of nine documented surviving Burr arch bridges in the state. Originally near a grist mill, its use declined in the 20th century, and by the time of its listing on the National Register in 1974, it was in somewhat deteriorated condition. In 2001, an engineering study determined that rehabilitation of the bridge was necessary to improve the load rating.

Also called audio marketing, on-hold messaging is a specialist area of marketing and branding. It seeks to represent the personality of a business in the medium of audio.  Background  An AT&T; study found that more than 70% of business phone calls in the United States are placed on hold for an average of 45 to 60 seconds each. Meanwhile, a USA Today study found executives spend 15 minutes a day or 68 hours a year on hold. A CNN survey found that 70% of callers in the United States who are holding the line in silence hang up within 60 seconds. A study by North American Telecom found that callers hearing music on hold will stay on the line 30 seconds longer than callers experiencing silence, and callers hearing commercials on hold will stay on the line for up to 3 minutes longer. In November 2011 an omnibus survey of more than 2,000 UK consumers highlighted several key figures related to modern business communications and specifically to on hold messaging.ArticleArticle Conducted by ICM on behalf of audio branding specialist PHMG (company), the survey found: 70% of consumers are put on hold for more than 50% of their calls; 68% of consumers are put on hold for longer than one minute; 73% of consumers want to hear something other than beeps or silence while on hold; 72% of personal calls to businesses are made at home on a landline; 60% of consumers are in front of a computer while on hold.  Recent trends  Particularly in the United Kingdom, there has been an increasing move among businesses towards the use of regional accents and dialect in their on-hold marketing. Research conducted by audio branding specialist PHMG (company) among UK businesses discovered a 27% rise in the use of accents between January 2012 and January 2013.Article Rather than selecting a generic or neutral voice style, companies may instead choose to deploy the regional accent which best represents their brand. This may be an accent specific to their location or simply one which best reflects their perceived values. In particular, research found the Scottish accent is perceived as trustworthy and reassuring while the Yorkshire accent, used by brands such as O2 (United Kingdom) in television and radio advertising, is seen as wise and honest.Article A 2014 study among 1,000 UK consumers, conducted by PHMG (company), aimed to determine perceptions of business call handling standards. It found just 23% of British people are happy with the way their calls to business are handled, with satisfaction levels being particularly low among the older generations - just 12% of 55- to 64-year-olds claimed to be satisfied. Despite this, it also found 45% of UK consumers are happy to hold longer than a minute during calls to businesses and only 6% are not willing to wait at all. Identical research conducted in the USA among 2,234 consumers also found less than a third of Americans are satisfied with the way businesses handle their calls. Similar to the UK, older generations are less satisfied, with only 28% of 45- to 64-year-olds claiming to be happy with how their calls are handled, compared to 37% of 18- to 34-year-olds. There is little variation between regions, although people in the South and the Northeast were found to be most satisfied (33%), followed by the Midwest (32%) and the West (31%).

The book debuted at number six on the New York Times Best Seller list and advocates the abolition of the United States Federal Reserve System \\"because it is immoral, unconstitutional, impractical, promotes bad economics, and undermines liberty.\\" The book argues that the booms, bubbles and busts of the business cycle are caused by the Federal Reserve's actions. Summary Paul argues that \\"in the post-meltdown world, it is irresponsible, ineffective, and ultimately useless to have a serious economic debate without considering and challenging the role of the Federal Reserve.\\" In End the Fed, Paul argues that the Federal Reserve was created to bail out banks when they got into trouble. He says that this is bad for competition in banking, as it strengthens the big banks. Paul argues that the Fed is both corrupt and unconstitutional. He states that the Federal Reserve System is inflating currency today at nearly a Weimar or Zimbabwe level, which Paul asserts is a practice that threatens to put the United States into an inflationary depression where the US dollar, which is the reserve currency of the world, would suffer severe devaluation. A major theme throughout the work also revolves around the idea of inflation as a hidden tax making warfare much easier to wage. Because people will reject the notion of increasing direct taxes, inflation is then used to help service the overwhelming debts incurred through warfare to happen. In turn the purchasing power of the masses is diminished, yet most people are unaware. Under Ron Paul's theory, this diminution has the biggest impact on low income individuals since it is a regressive tax. Paul argues that the CPI presently does not include food and energy, yet these are the items on which the majority of poor peoples' income is spent. He further maintains that most people are not aware that the Fed was created by the Morgans and Rockefellers at a private club off the coast of GeorgiaJekyll Island#Planning of the Federal Reserve System‚Äîis actually working against their own personal interests. Instead of protecting the people, Paul contends that the Fed now serves as a cartel where \\"the name of the game is bailout\\"‚Äîor otherwise known as privatized profits but socialized losses. Paul also draws on what he argues are historical links between the creation of central banks and war, explaining how inflation and devaluations have been used as war financing tools in the past by many governments from monarchies to democracies. Reception Surveys of economists show overwhelming opposition to abolishing the Federal Reserve or undermining its independence. According to Princeton University economist Alan S. Blinder, \\"mountains of empirical evidence support the proposition that greater central bank independence produces not only less inflation but superior macroeconomic performance, e.g., lower and less volatile inflation with no more volatility in output.\\" In the book. Paul argues that \\"the government and its banking cartel have together stolen $0.95 of every dollar as they have pursued a relentlessly inflationary policy.\\" David Andolfatto of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis said the statement was \\"just plain false\\" and \\"stupid\\" while noting that legitimate arguments can be made against the Federal Reserve. University of Oregon economist Mark Thoma described it as an \\"absurd\\" statement which data does not support. Charles Scaliger of the John Birch Society-affiliated The New American called the book a \\"must read.\\" After an interview with Ron Paul about the book, Jon Stewart of The Daily Show called it \\"thought provoking\\" and \\"clearly from the heart\\".\\"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.\\" Comedy Central. Broadcast: September 29, 2009. Advocates for ending the Federal Reserve have called for a return to the gold standard. However, economists overwhelmingly oppose a return to the gold standard, with a consensus arguing that the gold standard would contribute to economic volatility.

On 1 January 1973 Gar√üen lost its independence and was incorporated into the borough of Celle. The village is separated into an old and a new area by the B 191 federal road which runs from Celle to Eschede and Uelzen. Whilst the new area consists mainly of new houses, in the old part there are several farms and old buildings.  Politics  The head of the parish council (Ortsb√ºrgermeister) is Dr. Michael Bischoff (CDU).  Culture and points of interest  St Mark's Church dating to the middle of the 14th century The centrepiece of the old village is St Mark's Church (Markuskirche), which was built in the middle of the 14th century. Next to the church is the primary school and the special needs school. In addition there is a kindergarten in Gar√üen and a large hypermarket as well as several small craft shops. Gar√üen is also known for its sports club, the Sportverein SV Gar√üen Celle, which under the short name of SVG Celle had an unbroken run since 1998 in the Women's 2nd Handball Division (North) in Germany and, in 2009, was promoted to the 1st Division.

Like many of the early designs approved by the EFT, the Design 1013 did not originate with the EFT itself but was based on an existing cargo ship design, in this case one developed by the Skinner & Eddy Corporation of Seattle, Washington. The Design 1013 ships had a deadweight tonnage of 8,800 and gross register tonnage of 5,600. They had a length of 423 feet 9 inches, beam of 54 feet, draft of 24 feet 2 inches and hold depth of 29 feet 9 inches. Some were powered by Curtis geared steam turbines and others by vertical triple expansion reciprocating steam engines, in either case yielding a service speed of between 11 and 12 knots. Some of the vessels were oil-fired and others coal-fired. They were produced by a variety of shipyards on the west coast of the U.S. including Skinner & Eddy and J. F. Duthie & Co. of Seattle, Los Angeles Shipbuilding & Drydock of Los Angeles, California, and the Northwest Steel Company and Columbia River Shipbuilding Company of Portland, Oregon. Most of them were given names starting with the word West (or in some cases, Western), indicating their west coast origins.McKellar.General Cargo Ships Built in Pacific Coast Shipyards , shipbuildinghistory.com. A total of 111 of the type were completed‚Äî106 for the EFT and an additional five completed later for private contractors. All of them entered service between 1918 and 1920, with the majority probably being completed in 1919. About 37 of the completed ships were acquired by the U.S. Navy either during or shortly after the war for service as auxiliaries, but most of these were quickly decommissioned in 1919 after only a few months' service. Lend-Lease As per the Lend-Lease Agreement, several ships were purchased by the USSR in 1942‚Äì1945, as the USSR needed ships for its merchant fleet during World War II and in the first years after the war. In total, the Soviet Union purchased 25 ships of design 1013. All purchased ships of that design were counted as Belorussia-class cargo ships by the Soviet Union and sometimes referred to as West-class cargo ships due to their manufacture on the West Coast of the US.

In the aftermath of the German invasion of Poland he was the Government Delegate for Poland for the Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany. He was arrested by the Germans in July 1941 and killed in 1942. Biography Adolf Bni≈Ñski was born on 21 August 1884 in Kosowo. He studied agriculture at the Jagiellonian University, as well as at the German universities in Munich and Halle. He inherited significant agricultural lands, and he was a notable agricultural activist in Greater Poland. In 1918 he became a functionary of the reborn Polish state, first as a commissar for the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ region in 1918, then from 1919 to 1920 as a starost of the ≈öroda County and from 1923 to 1928 he was the voivode of Pozna≈Ñ. In the political arena, Bni≈Ñski supported conservative and pro-monarchy views. In the Polish presidential election, 1926, he was the presidential candidate of the Popular National Union (ZwiƒÖzek Ludowo-Narodowy), but he lost to Ignacy Mo≈õcicki.Eva Plach, The clash of moral nations: cultural politics in Pi≈Çsudski's Poland, 1926-1935, Ohio University Press, 2006, , Print, p.167 In 1935, despite his opposition to the sanacja regime, he joined the senate of Poland, and was a senator until 1938. After the German invasion of Poland he joined the Polish Underground State. In July 1940 he was chosen to be the Government Delegate for Poland for the Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany although he did not receive the official nomination from general W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski until December 3. Bni≈Ñski was arrested by then Germans in July 1941, for refusing to express support for a joint Polish-German anti-Soviet declaration. He was imprisoned in Pozna≈Ñ and tortured and executed on the night of 7 to 8 July 1942. The exact circumstances of the disposal of his body are unknown; according to Zbigniew Mieczkowski he could have even been fed to wild animals (lions).

Bromley with the objective of calculating activity coefficients for aqueous electrolyte solutions whose concentrations are above the range of validity of the Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel equation. This equation, together with Specific ion interaction theory (SIT) and Pitzer equationsChapter 3. Pitzer, K.S. Ion interaction approach: theory and data correlation, pp75-153. is important for the understanding of the behaviour of ions dissolved in natural waters such as rivers, lakes and sea-water. Description Guggenheim had proposed an extension of the Debye-H√ºckel equation which is the basis of SIT theory. The equation can be written, in its simplest form for a 1:1 electrolyte, MX, as :\\\\log \\\\gamma_{\\\\pm} = \\\\frac{-A_\\\\gamma I^{1/2}}{1+I^{1/2} }+\\\\beta b. \\\\gamma_{\\\\pm} is the mean molal activity coefficient. The first term on the right-hand side is the Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel term, with a constant, A, and the ionic strength I. Œ≤ is an interaction coefficient and b the molality of the electrolyte. As the concentration decreases so the second term becomes less important until, at very low concentrations,the Debye-H√ºckel equation gives a satisfactory account of the activity coefficient. Leroy A. Bromley observed that experimental values of \\\\frac {1}{z_+ z_-}\\\\log \\\\gamma_{\\\\pm} were often approximately proportional to ionic strength. Accordingly, he developed the equation, for a salt of general formula M^{z_+}_p X^{z_-}_q :\\\\log \\\\gamma_{\\\\pm}= \\\\frac{-A_\\\\gamma|z_+z_-|I^{1/2}}{1 + \\\\rho I^{1/2}}+\\\\frac{(0.06+0.6B|z_+z_-|)I}{\\\\left( 1+\\\\frac{1.5}{|z_+z_-|}I \\\\right)^2} +BI At 25 ¬∞C AŒ≥ is equal to 0.511 and œÅ is equal to one. Bromley tabulated values of the interaction coefficient B. He noted that the equation gave satisfactory agreement with experimental data up to ionic strength of 6 molal, though with decreasing precision when extrapolating to very high ionic strength. As with other equations, it is not satisfactory when there is ion association as, for example, with divalent metal sulfates. Bromley also found that B could be expressed in terms of single-ion quantities as :B = B_+ + B_- + \\\\delta_+ \\\\delta_- where the + subscript refers to a cation and the minus subscript refers to an anion. Bromley's equation can easily be transformed for the calculation of osmotic coefficients, and Bromley also proposed extensions to multicomponent solutions and for the effect of temperature change. A modified version of the Bromley equation has been used extensively by Madariaga and co-workers. In a comparison of Bromley, SIT and Pitzer models, little difference was found in the quality of fit. The Bromley equation is essentially an empirical equation. The B parameters are relatively easy to determine. However, SIT theory, as extended by Scatchard. and Ciavatta is much more widely used. By contrast the Pitzer equation is based on rigorous thermodynamics. The determination Pitzer parameters is more laborious. Whilst the Bromley and SIT approaches are based on pair-wise interactions between oppositely charged ions, the Pitzer approach also allows for interactions between three ions. These equations are important for the understanding of the behaviour of ions in natural waters such as rivers, lakes and sea-water. For some complex electrolytes, Ge et al.X. Ge, M. Zhang, M. Guo, X.

Biography  A native of Kingston upon Thames England, Pocock learned the craft of boat-building as an apprentice to his father, Aaron Frederick Pocock, a boat-builder for Eton College.Brown, pp. 42-43. A champion sculler himself, Pocock (along with his brother, Dick) used prize money earned from racing to emigrate from England to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in 1911, in search of better employment prospects.Newell, Gordon (1987).

It was entered into the 1996 Cannes Film Festival.Andrew L Urban, \\"De Heer, Rolf : Colouring the Room\\", Urban Cinefile accessed 11 November 2012 Plot The Quiet Room centers on an unnamed little girl and how she deals with her parents' crumbling marriage. The film focuses entirely on her point of view and although she is silent for most of the film, we constantly hear her thoughts, sometimes in a stream of consciousness barrage of voice-over. The little girl has chosen to become mute as a way to protest her parents' constant fighting. Her parents, more concerned with their own issues, believe their daughter is just going through a phase. The film shows how even very young children can be extremely cognizant of problems that are going on in their own homes even when their parents try hard to shield them from everything. The girl learns other ways to communicate with her parents. Through her drawings, she expresses her desire of owning a dog and how she believes they will be happier as a family if they lived in the country instead of in their tiny apartment in the city. During flashbacks, we see when her parents were happy and still in love. The girl, perhaps intentionally as a way to cope, confuses tenses (thinking \\"I'm little now...\\" instead of \\"when I was little...\\"). But even then, she catches glimpses of her parents' dysfunctional relationship, such as when her father spits in her mother's face after she yells at him. Her parents don't notice she is in the room but the memory leaves a long-lasting impression on her. In the present, her anxiety manifests itself through waking nightmares where she imagines wild animals escaping from the zoo and coming to get her. At the end of the film, she hides herself in her parents' wardrobe to escape their bickering. After a while, she falls asleep in an uncomfortable position. When she wakes up, she is too stiff to move. Unable to escape on her own, the little girl finally breaks down and calls out for help and her parents, who had thought she ran away, rush to her aid. The girl gives her parents one last drawing. In it, she successfully conveys her feelings of being overwhelmed by her parents' constant fighting and how she feels less motivated to speak the more she hears them argue. As she hands it to them, she says, \\"This is how I feel. That's how you make me feel.\\" Finally hearing their daughter for the first time and realizing the effect their behaviour has on hers, her parents announce that they're going to move to the country. When they also promise her a dog, she becomes so ecstatic that she starts singing incessantly and dancing around her room.

The party was led by Pouvanaa a Oopa. Political profile Pouvanaa had been elected to the French National Assembly in 1949. After that victory, the 'Pouvanaa Committee' (formed by his Pouvanaa's supporters for the election campaign) and a group of ex-servicemen founded the RDPT on November 17, 1949. At the time of its foundation, the party proposed various political and social reforms in favour of the Maohi community, such as calling for land reform, expanded access to education and employments in the public sector, strengthened social security. The party sought to increase the powers of the Territorial Assembly, achieving greater autonomy from metropolitan France.Denoon, Donald. The Cambridge History of the Pacific Islanders.

Pouvanaa a Oopa: victime de la raison d'√©tat : les documents parlent. Tahiti: Editions de Tahiti, 2003. p. 20 RDPT published a bulletin called Te Aratai The RDPT rapidly became widely popular amongst the Maohis. In particular it attracted support from poor rural populations. Pouvanaa retained his seat in the French National Assembly in the 1951 and 1953 elections. RDPT leaders Dr. Florisson and Jean-Baptise C√©ran-Jerusal√©my became French Senator and French Union assemblyman, respectively. In the 1951 election, Pouvanaa had won with 70% of the votes in French Oceania.Kernahan, Mel. White Savages in the South Seas. London: Verso, 1995. p. 20 The party won the January 18, 1953 Territorial Assembly election, winning 18 out of 25 seats. Notably, Pouvanaa did not get elected from the Papeete seat he contested. Gradually RDPT was radicalised. It began calling for Tahitian take-over of French- and Chinese- owned businesses, substituting French officials with Tahitians, return of Tahitian lands to Tahitians and substituting the French tricolour with flag used during the reign of Queen Pomare.Aldrich, Robert/Connell, John. France's Overseas Frontier: D√©partements Et Territoires D'outre-mer. Cambridge University Press, 1992. p. 219 Political confrontations However, running the regional government became increasingly difficult for the party. The RDPT sought to build a national economy through the introduction of an income tax scheme, to prepare the islands for independence. The French government had become increasingly bothered by the influence of RDPT, and the local Governor conspire against the RDPT government. Protests against the RDPT government were mobilized by the urban opposition, the Chinese community and in particular the French business community. Moreover rivalry between Pouvanaa and C√©ran had reached a critical point at the time of the 1958 referendum, and C√©ran was expelled. C√©ran's followers founded a rival party, RDPT- Aratai.Finney, Ben R. Tahiti: Polynesians Peasants and Proletariats. New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 2007. pp. 23-24 Pouvanaa jailed Pouvanaa campaigned for independence in the 1958 referendum. After the referendum, Pouvanaa was arrested. He was accused of plotting a revolutionary uprising, by setting the capital Papeete on fire. He was subsequently sentenced to eight years in jail, and another 15 years of banishment from French Polynesia. Pouvanaa's supporters consistently claimed that he had been framed.Kernahan, Mel. White Savages in the South Seas. London: Verso, 1995. p. 25 In 1960 Pouvanaa a Oopa's son, Marcel Oopa, was elected to the French National Assembly as a RDPT candidate.

Territorial Assembly elections were held the same year. With 14 out of 30 seats, RDPT retained its position as the largest party in the Assembly albeit their number of seats had decreased. After the election RDPT formed a coalition government.Denoon, Donald. The Cambridge History of the Pacific Islanders. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, 2004. p. 342 Nuclear test and ban Once it became publicly known that France intended to conduct tests of Nuclear bombs in French Polynesia, the RDPT was radicalised. Not only the party oppose the testing programme, it also revived its campaign for Polynesian autonomy. In 1963, President Charles de Gaulle issued a ban on the party, invoking a law that enabled outlawing political organizations that threatened French 'national integrity'. The decision was motivated by a message from Pouvanaa to RDPT from jail, which had called on the party on advocate full independence. In 1965 elected representatives of RDPT formed a new party (with Teariki at its helm), Here Ai'a.

Of Moira, What's on TV said she is a \\"farmer's wife and looking good on it, Moira Barton is a very down-to-earth woman - and that just adds to her appeal!\\" Robb said the idea of a modern-day farming family drew her to the role of Moira. She explained the family being a freshness to the Butler's Farm, saying \\"The Barton‚Äôs are very lively and young-spirited and that really appealed to me. There are families out there that do work together and aren‚Äôt dysfunctional so the chance to represent one of those groups really drew me to the role.\\" Robb said her character is independent, fun-loving and strong. She loves her family and is very protective of them. Moira keeps them going and coordinates their lives. During an interview with Inside Soap Robb said she would probably not make a good farmer's wife, unlike Moira. Robb said she is strong and loves animals, but could not send them to slaughter. Moira finds employment as a barmaid at The Woolpack and Robb said she was looking forward to getting behind the bar and pulling a few pints. The Yorkshire Post said her most volatile relationship will be with The Woolpack's chef Marlon Dingle (Mark Charnock). Robb told the paper, \\"Moira generally gets on with everybody. However, you'll see her and Marlon develop a love-hate relationship, which will be interesting.\\" Robb later thought Moira would warm to Marlon, in between their battles. Marriage to John Barton In her fictional backstory, Moira married John Barton in 1990. They were childhood sweethearts. Robb said it was love at first sight for both Moira and John and they have a \\"great chemistry\\" together. The actress added \\"Moira really finds him attractive, fancies him a lot and loves him deeply. They have a lot of affection for each other.\\" Thornton said John and Moira had a lot of fun in their youth and there have often been hints about their party lifestyle. When Marlon falls in love with Moira, she tells him she has not looked at another man during her twenty years of marriage to John. Robb thought Moira told Marlon that because she did not want to hurt him or cheat on John. Moira manages to maintain a good work and family balance because she has John's support. Together they make a strong team and do not take themselves seriously. John encourages Moira to have her independence, but to share her experiences with the family. Thornton told Kris Green of Digital Spy that John and Moira are enough for each other. John knows Moira is the boss of the house and he respects that. He added that while no one knows much about the Bartons' backstory, they do know John and Moira have a solid marriage. John kisses Eve Jenson (Suzanne Shaw) and Thornton said it is because he is flattered by her interest in him. Robb explained John is Moira's soulmate and even though she knows he looks at other woman, she did not think he would ever act upon it. Robb added \\"Moira sensed it before it happened, which made it worse!\\" When asked what kind of man it would take for Moira to cheat on John, Robb opined the man would have similar values to John and she thought Marlon would be a safe bet as he is loyal and trustworthy. Thornton said he is worried the writers are going to split John and Moira up and Robb said if the characters were to split, they would find it hard to live without each other. Affair with Cain Dingle In October 2011, Moira begins an affair with Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley). Cain has been interested in Moira for a while as he knows how much she loathes him. Moira decides to purchase a Land Rover from Cain and agrees to pay him the money in weekly instalments. Moira asks Cain to keep the arrangement from John, as their marriage is under a lot of strain and is quite fragile at that moment. Hordley told Laura Morgan of All About Soap that Cain sees the deal as his chance to have a bit of fun with Moira. He explained \\"Cain enjoys causing friction between her and John - he just doesn't care about offending anyone. Cain keeps toying with Moira, and he knows that she secretly wants him...\\" When asked if Cain and Moira could be heading towards a full-blown affair, Hordley said he did not think so as Cain is still in love with Charity Tate (Emma Atkins). The actor added Cain is just playing with Moira like a cat plays with a mouse. On 23 October, Nada Farhoud of The People reported the attraction between Moira and Cain was going to \\"explode into Emmerdale's steamiest ever fling.\\" The affair starts after Cain tells John about his and Moira's arrangement. Moira goes to the garage to tell Cain off and they have a huge fight. Suddenly Moira kisses Cain and they have sex. Of the scene, Robb said \\"The director asked me to wear a crossover dress so my breasts look very voluptuous, perfect for a seduction scene. We ripped each other's tops off, he cleared everything off his fridge, picked me up and my legs were wrapped around him. We looked at each other and then went into a clinch.\\" The actress told Kate White of Inside Soap that her character does not like Cain, but that is part of the attraction for her. She cannot explain why she has a thing for him, but she cannot help herself. Moira is left feeling dirty and guilty after the encounter. However, she cannot help giving into temptation again and Robb revealed Moira does not want to go back to Cain and she tries to fight it when she does. Robb opined the relationship is quite abusive but Cain brings out a different side to Moira. Farhoud said Moira and Cain end up having sex in a barn and on a bed. The writer said the scenes are \\"so hot\\" the soap's film crew became embarrassed during filming. Of why her character puts her marriage in jeopardy, Robb explained \\"She still loves John, but she feels isolated and neglected because he's stopped including her in the finances of the new business. He's changed the dynamic of their relationship.\\" Robb also said the way Cain treats Moira makes her realise what she has with John. Cain later decides to tell John what has been going on between him and Moira and Robb said it is not going to be a good Christmas for the family. On 17 November 2011, it was announced a major storyline would see Cain attacked by a mystery person and left for dead. Moira was named as one of six official suspects, along with John. Digital Spy conducted a poll on their website asking viewers to select which suspect they thought had carried out the attack. Moira received 16.3% of the vote, placing her fourth behind John, Amy Wyatt (Chelsea Halfpenny) and Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell). Following John's death, Moira and Cain begin a relationship, which culminates in their marriage. Moira proposes to Cain, who accepts following some initial doubts about her motives. Robb said that the couple's marriage \\"will be far from dull - those two aren't even dull when they're happy.\\" She also said the wedding ceremony would be simple and not traditional, as that is what Moira had with John. In the lead up to the wedding, Moira's brother-in-law James Barton (Bill Ward) threatens to reveal that Adam is actually his biological son, having carried out a secret DNA test. Alex Moss Moira began a brief fling with her 21-year-old farmhand, Alex Moss (Kurtis Stacey), in July 2012. When Moira becomes aware of her feelings for Alex, she initially urges him to get back together with his ex-girlfriend, Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins). Moss thought that Moira was just trying to block her attraction to Alex out. One night when Alex and Moira are having a drink together, he kisses her and she responds. However, Moira then pulls away and laughs, leaving Alex embarrassed. Moira and Alex later begin an affair and Robb believed that her character saw the situation as \\"a bit of fun\\", while Stacey thought that Alex's feelings are serious. The actress said that Alex brought out Moira's \\"sexy side\\" and was not entirely unsuitable as a long-term love interest. Robb commented \\"He's always been familiar to her, he's been on the farm, he knows Adam, he knew John. So he sort of fits in and that's a comfort to her.\\" Alex later gets back together with Victoria, while Moira decides whether to tell Adam about their fling. Victoria's brother, Andy (Kelvin Fletcher), catches Moira kissing Alex and forces Alex to choose between her and his sister. When Alex breaks up with Victoria, she believes that he must be seeing someone else and Moira admits that it is her. She tries to tell Victoria that she was unaware that Alex was seeing them both, while Andy tries to persuade her not to tell Adam. However, Victoria gets revenge on Moira and Alex by announcing their affair in The Woolpack. Storylines Moira and her family move to Emmerdale to take over the running of Butler's Farm. Moira defends her husband, John, when he faces prison for locking Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller) in a barn. She also becomes concerned when her youngest child (then called Hannah) shows an interest in Andy Sugden, who is recovering from a breakdown. When Moira spots Hannah running away from Andy's caravan in tears, she jumps to conclusions that he took advantage of Hannah and fires him. She later apologises to Andy. Moira begins working as a barmaid in The Woolpack and she frequently clashes with the chef, Marlon Dingle. She later learns that Marlon has feelings for her and she lets him down gently. Moira becomes good friends with Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen), but their friendship is tested when Hannah reveals that she has been bullied by Victoria Sugden and her friend, Kayleigh Gibbs (Lily Jane Stead). Eve Jenson starts working at the farm and begins flirting with John. Moira notices and warns Eve off when she believes she is getting too familiar with John. Cain Dingle later tells Moira that he saw John and Eve kissing and she confronts John. He explains that what Cain said was true, but the kiss did not mean anything. Moira asks him to leave, but they eventually reconcile. Holly develops an addiction to drugs, which puts a strain on the whole family. She runs away and later steals from the house. Moira and John try keeping Holly locked up in her room to make her go cold turkey. However, Moira cannot bear to see her suffer and she buys some heroin for her daughter. She is then caught and cautioned by the police. Moira finds out that her son, Adam, is having an affair with Ella Hart (Corrinne Wicks) and she demands that he ends it. Moira warns Ella to back off, but Ella's husband, Declan Macey (Jason Merrells), then finds out about the affair. Moira makes Adam tell John about the affair. John becomes angry because it could affect a deal he has with Declan about the farm. John and Moira's relationship becomes strained once more, especially when Cain reveals that Moira is paying him in instalments for a Land Rover. Angered by this, Moira goes to the garage to confront Cain. Despite the two arguing, they end up having sex which leads to them beginning an affair. Moira confides in Diane about the affair, but does not initially say who she is seeing. Cain tells John about the affair and when he throws Moira out, she goes to stay with her mother. On her return, Moira moves in with Marlon and tries to help out her family. John allows her to come to the farm to help with the finances for the business. Adam, Hannah and Holly eventually forgive her and try to help her reconcile with John. However, Moira is devastated when John starts flirting with Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter). Moira tells John that she will agree to a divorce if that is what he wants, but John tells her it is not. Moira and John reconcile and their children book a night at a hotel for them. While driving, John loses control of the car as he hits some black ice and the car falls down a hill. Moira manages to free herself from the car with help from John and Declan. However, Moira cannot free John and the vehicle falls over a cliff. John is rescued and rushed to hospital, where he undergoes surgery. Shortly after Moira tells John that she loves him, he dies. Moira is devastated by John's death and the children try to help her around the farm. Hannah struggles with her studies, while Holly blames Moira for John's death. After turning to drugs again, Holly begins seeing a counsellor and is later offered a job in London. Hannah announces that she is bored of village life and wants to go with her. Moira initially refuses to let her go, but later relents. Alex comes to stay at the farm, after his house floods. Moira and Alex begin an affair and try to conceal it from Adam. After confronting Alex, Victoria learns that he was seeing Moira and reveals the affair to the rest of the village. Moira and Cain begin a relationship. Moira's former brother-in-law, James (Bill Ward) and his three sons, Ross (Michael Parr), Pete (Anthony Quinlan) and Finn (Joe Gill), move to the village. It emerges that Moira and James had a brief affair many years previously and James admits that he still has feelings for Moira. Moira feels uncomfortable around James, but they work together to win a deal with a supermarket. James agrees to go back to his farm after apologising to Cain for making a pass at Moira. Moira proposes to Cain and he accepts. James does a DNA test and learns that Adam is his son, not John's. He threatens to reveal the truth, but decides not to. Adam tells Moira that he has worked out that she and James had an affair. Moira almost tells him that James is his father, but changes her mind. Cain and Moira marry in front of their friends and family on the farm. Moira is stunned when Pete, her marital nephew, kisses her. After Cain finds out about the kiss, he threatens Pete. Pete later gets himself arrested. When Cain's car is stolen, Cain and Moira chase after the mystery driver, who turns out to be Holly. After Holly relapses into drug use, Moira confronts her drug dealer but falls onto a used needle causing her to believe she has contracted HIV. With Moira's help Holly becomes clean, however Cain is disgusted when he finds out Holly caused her to become contracted with HIV after he finds Moira's antiretroviral drugs. Cain leaves Moira and later shares a kiss with Charity at The Woolpack. When Moira finds out about Cain's kiss with Charity, she tires of Cain's actions and files for divorce. Moira is later relieved when she finds out that she is HIV negative, following tests at the clinic. However, relief turns to tragedy as Holly dies suddenly after overdosing. In October 2017, when Moira is out in the barn, Emma Barton confronts her about James and starts a fire. Moira becomes trapped in the fire and goes into labour. Moira tells Emma that the baby is Pete's and Emma rescues her from the burning barn. Emma delivers Moira's baby and then is found by Adam and Victoria. Moira is rushed into hospital and Emma steals her baby. Moira wakes up and goes to the farm and finds the gun but is called to say that her baby has been returned by Emma. Moira later finds out that nephew Finn Barton was shot by Emma. By the time Finn was pronounced dead, Moira confronted Emma on a viaduct and urged her to come back in a bid to tell Pete and Ross the truth. This appears to be successful until Emma begins to lash out and taunt Moira about Holly, resulting in Moira slapping Emma and subsequently pushing her to her death when she says Moira is to blame for Holly's death. A DNA test later reveals that Cain is the baby's father. Moira names the child Isaac. She initially struggles to cope with caring for him, even attempting to have Adam and Victoria adopt him, but she adjusts. The police suspect Adam was Emma's murderer and arrest him, but he goes on the run with assistance from Cain and Aaron. He leaves a message for Moira saying goodbye as he leaves the country. Ross and Pete learn that Moira was the one who murdered Emma but agree to keep her secret, feeling that enough damage has been done. Moira and Cain get back together in early 2018. He catches an intruder in the house one day and apprehends him. Moira recognises him as her child previously known as Hannah. Matty had undergone gender transition in the time after he had left the village with Holly and has been living as a man. Moira is hurt and confused to learn about Matty's transition and further dismayed to learn that he only returned to find his birth certificate to have his details legally changed and was not intending to see her at all. She has trouble accepting Matty's gender identity, frequently referring to him as \\"Hannah\\" or \\"her\\". However, she convinces him to stay after he is mugged at the train station and hospitalised. Though concerned for him, she realises that he knows who he is and slowly comes to accept his identity. Moira has an affair with farmhand Nate Robinson (Jurell Carter). After Cain learns of the affair, he takes Moira and Nate out on a boat to confront them, where it emerges that Nate is his son. Cain moves out, taking their sons with him and starts divorce proceedings. Moira begins drinking to excess due to loneliness and she is hit by a car driven by Nate's mother Cara Robinson (Carryl Thomas). She temporarily leaves the village to recover. Months later, Moira goes into partnership with Rhona Goskirk (Zoe Henry) and she is targeted by DI Mark Malone (Mark Womack), after finding about his affair with Harriet Finch (Katherine Dow Blyton). She is struck by a car driven by Jamie Tate (Alexander Lincoln), who drives away from the scene. While she is recovering, she learns that Rhona has also gone into partnership with Nate. Other appearances Moira appears in the 2011 spin-off DVD Paddy and Marlon's Big Night In. The DVD centers around the characters of Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt) and Marlon Dingle who have a \\"not-so-quiet night in the country, and a morning after anybody would want to forget.\\" The script was written by Paul Roundell and directed by Emmerdale assistant producer Tony Hammond. Filming took place over September and October and the DVD was released on 14 November 2011. Reception For her portrayal of Moira, Robb was nominated for Best Newcomer at the 2010 Inside Soap Awards.

She added \\"And we say, go for it! Why not have some fun after all she's been through? It's time for Mrs Barton to let her hair down ‚Äì and if a hot young man wants to help her do it, then why not?!\\" References External links * Character profile at the Official UK Emmerdale website * Character profile at What's on TV * Character profile at the Internet Movie Database Category:Emmerdale characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2009 Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional chefs Category:Fictional farmers Category:Fictional Scottish people Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional alcohol abusers ","title":"Moira Barton"},{"id":"24396299","text":"Welsh Sir John Prise (also Prys, Price, in Welsh Syr Si√¥n ap Rhys) (1501/2‚Äì1555) was a Welsh public notary, who acted as a royal agent and visitor of the monasteries. He was also a scholar, associated with the first Welsh printed publication Yn y lhyvyr hwnn. He was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Breconshire in 1547; Hereford October 1553; Ludlow April 1553; and Ludgershall November 1554. Life He was son of Rhys ab Gwilym by Gwenllian, daughter of Howel Madoc. He was educated at All Souls College, Oxford, and became a notary public and receiver of the king. From a statement of Rowland Lee, it appears that Prise had been some time in the service of the Earl of Arundel as constable of Cloon Castle in Ireland, and that for his employment he was promoted to be one of Thomas Cromwell's agents. In May 1532, when the Earls of Westmorland and Cumberland and Sir Thomas Clifford searched Cuthbert Tunstall's house at Bishop Auckland, Price looked into the manuscripts, and made a report to Cromwell. In 1533 he was employed under Cromwell. In 1534 he was registrar of Salisbury Cathedral. In April 1535 he took part in the proceedings against the Carthusians as to the royal supremacy. He officiated in the same way at the trial of John Fisher and Thomas More. He took part in the major visitation of the monasteries of 1535, alongside Sir Thomas Legh. When the Pilgrimage of Grace was quelled, he assisted in trying the rebels. For his services he received in 1537‚Äì38 a joint lease of Carmarthen rectory, and a lease of Brecon Priory and rectory. He also bought the priory of St. Guthlac, Hereford. In a petition of 1538 he asked for the manor of West Dereham. He took part in public affairs, for example in the union of England and Wales, drafting or suggesting the petition on which the statutes were framed. He was Sheriff of Breconshire in 1541, and lived chiefly at Brecon Priory. He was knighted on 22 February 1547, served as knight of the shire for Breconshire in 1547, and made one of the council for the Welsh marches in 1551. He and his son Richard were patrons of Hugh Evans, and are said to have introduced him to Shakespeare; Richard gave Evans the living of Merthyr Cynog, Brecon, in 1572. Evans died in 1581, and made Richard Price the overseer of his will. He married Joan, daughter of John Williams of Southwark, and had a family of five sons and two daughters. Works Prise was encouraged as a scholar by William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke, and became a collector of manuscripts. He wrote: * Historiae Britannicae Defensio, composed about 1553, published by his son Richard in 1573, and dedicated to Lord Burghley; in part a protest against Polydore Vergil. It defended the traditional historical accounts of Brutus of Troy and King Arthur in early British history.Peter J.

She is the current Chair of the Council Committee on Business, Economic Development and Tourism. Prior to being elected to the City Council, she served as a Representative to the State House of Representatives for four terms. On October 28, 2019, Pine announced her candidacy for Mayor of Honolulu. Early life and education Pine grew up on the North Shore of Oahu. Her father is a professor of Philosophy at the University of Hawai‚Äôi and Honolulu Community College. Her mother is Filipina retired nurse, born and raised on O‚Äôahu. Her maternal grandparents were a Filipina immigrant and a Maui-born Filipino plantation worker. Her paternal grandparents are Irish, English and Scottish. She is directly related to Ferdinand Marcos. Her grandfather served in the United States Coast Guard as a chef during the Attack on Pearl Harbor. Pine has worked with American Veterans ‚Äì Hawai‚Äôi, a non-profit transitional home for former homeless veterans, located in the Ewa District, Hawaii. Pine played shortstop on the Manoa All Star Little League Team, disguising herself as a boy in order to qualify. She attended Waialua and Moanalua High Schools and was a member of the Hawai‚Äôi Olympic Development Soccer Team. Selected as O‚Äôahu Interscholastic Association West All-Star MVP player, she also ran cross-country and track, placing second in the OIA in various competitions. Pine graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 2000 with a degree in English. She was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority. Career Pine served as the Director of the Hawaii House of Representatives Minority Research Office (2002‚Äì2004). She was the chief of staff for Representative David Pendleton from 1997 to 2001. Pine was elected to the State House of Representatives in 2004 to represent district 43, defeating an incumbent with about 60% of the vote. District 43 then covered the Ewa Beach, Iroquois Point, and Pu‚Äôuloa areas. She served in the state house from 2004 to 2012 and was the first Republican to be elected to this seat since Hawai‚Äôi's statehood. In 2007, Pine was named one of the nation's 100 most influential half-Filipino women by the Filipina Women's Network. From 2010 to 2012 she served as the House Minority floor leader. One of Pine's 2012 priorities for the legislative session was to keep the community informed regarding the closure of the Hawaii Medical Center West facility in Ewa Beach in December 2011. In 2012, she created the Hire Leeward Job and Career Fair. Originally it was a five-year initiative to help the 1,000 people that lost their jobs from the HMC West and East locations. They expected 600‚Äì800 attendees, and 3,000 showed. The events brought thousands of jobs to West O'ahu residents each year. In August 2019, they completed the 7th Annual Hire Leeward Job and Career Fair. Honolulu City Council In 2012, Pine was elected to the Honolulu City Council, representing District 1, which includes the areas of ‚ÄôEwa, ‚ÄôEwa Beach, Kapolei, Honokai Hale, Ko Olina, Nanakuli, Ma‚Äôili, Wai‚Äôanae, Makaha, Keaau and Makua. She beat incumbent Tom Berg by more than 25 percentage points. In 2016, she won her re-election campaign with a landslide to serve her second, 4-year term. During her time at the Honolulu City Council, she fought for the improvement of parks throughout District 1 and allocated millions of dollars in Capital Improvement Project funds to improve infrastructure, roads, parks and public facilities throughout the Leeward Coast. In 2017, Councilmember Pine spearheaded efforts in getting Kapolei/‚ÄôEwa designated as a \\"Blue Zone Project\\" area. The project creates community awareness through events and opportunities for Leeward residents to learn about healthy lifestyle choices in order to reduce the high rate of health risks impacting the district. As Chair of the Zoning and Housing Committee on the City Council, she worked with developers, nonprofits and lawmakers to change long-standing practices that made if difficult to build more affordable housing. This resulted in several affordable housing projects on O‚Äôahu that provide units at all income levels on O‚Äôahu, which currently experiences a housing crisis. She also worked to pass legislation that protects residential zoned areas to reduce the impact of illegal construction and uses. Pine resigned from the Republican Party on November 9, 2016, stating that many of the national party's new priorities had diverted from her long- held philosophical beliefs about inclusivity and progress. Leeward O‚Äôahu The Leeward O‚Äôahu district of Ewa Beach, Kapolei, Honokai Hale, Ko Olina, Nanakuli, Ma‚Äôili, Wai‚Äôanea, Makaha, Keaau and Makua, previously experienced millions of dollars in neglected infrastructure improvements. Since Pine became a state House member in 2004, the Leeward Coast obtained over $1 billion in infrastructure improvements. Her efforts have resulted in the crackdown of illegal dumping, improvements to parks, and enhanced safety in the Leeward district. In 2012, she created the Hire Leeward Job and Career Fair. Originally a five-year initiative to help the 1,000 people impacted by the closure of the Hawai‚Äôi Medical Center East in Liliha and the Hawai‚Äôi Medical Center West in Ewa, the job fair drew 3,000 attendees. As of 2020, the annual Hire Leeward Job and Career Fair continues to place thousands of West O‚Äôahu residents in Leeward jobs. Safety initiatives To improve the safety of both tourists and residents on public beaches, Pine introduced Bill 39 in 2019, which became Ordinance 19-26, that extends lifeguard hours for the island of Oahu from sunup to sundown, in response to drownings that occurred in the hours before and after lifeguards were on duty. She originally introduced Res. 16-43 to extend lifeguard hours in March 2016, and then introduced a bill to make this law in 2019. The resolution authorized a four- day work week with ten-hour shifts for lifeguards based upon a successful pilot program for lifeguards at Haunama Bay. Environmental issues Pine promoted several pieces of legislation to protect the environment, including a 2017 bill banning the use of Styrofoam food containers. In 2019, Pine joined the Honolulu City Council to pass Bill 40, which became Ordinance 19-30, thought at the time to be the most comprehensive phase-out of plastics in the nation. Citing case studies that flexible schedules improved workplace performance, reduced sick time and worker's compensation claims and reduced energy use to mitigate carbon emissions, on January 15, 2020, Pine introduced Resolution 20-8. This Resolution asked the City to adopt a four-day, ten-hour work week for city workers. As Chair of the Business, Economic Development and Tourism Committee, Pine created several pieces of legislation called the \\"Keep Hawai‚Äòi Hawai‚Äòi\\" Package. In 2019, Pine introduced Bill 34 to require the visitor industry to provide annual reports on the progress of sustainability efforts to the City. She introduced Bill 51, \\"Keep Hawai‚Äôi Hawai‚Äôi ‚Äì A Promise to Our Keiki,\\" which became Ordinance 20-002 in 2020 and asks tourists and locals to sign a pledge to respect the environment, wildlife and culture of O‚Äòahu. Bill 3 (2020) introduced a Keep Hawai‚Äòi Hawai‚Äòi Pass to allow tourists and locals to purchase a pass to several city attractions and Bill 68 (2019) would create a fund for the proceeds to supplement impacts to City emergency services, infrastructure, parks and beaches from tourism. She also introduced resolutions to ask the state legislature to require that educational videos be shown to airline and cruise passengers regarding environmental and cultural issues and encouraged the state legislature to consider visitor impact fees. Inclusionary housing and homelessness In 2019, Pine supported legislation to limit short-term vacation rentals that negatively impacted many residential neighborhoods and constrained the rental housing market by taking units offline. The hospitality industry also blamed vacation rentals for suppressed growth in tourism-related dollars. The bill became Ordinance 18 (2019). Pine, who chaired the Committee on Zoning and Housing, created legislation (Bill 7 2019) that changed zoning requirements to allow owners of small lots to develop affordable rental housing, which became Ordinance 19-8 (2019). In response to critical shortages in housing, in 2019, Pine introduced legislation to amend land use regulations for low-rise apartment dwellings and enable low-cost housing construction, and Bill 29 to incentivize development of affordable housing. Bill 58 (2017)/Ordinance 18-10, redrafted in part by Pine, established incentives for developing affordable housing that extends affordability from 10 years to 30 years, depending on the number of units. She supported legislation to end \\"monster homes\\" (Ordinance 18-6) on O‚Äôahu which were blamed by many groups for violating safety codes, functioning as illegal rentals and filling residential streets with illegal parking. New regulations require parking spaces based on the size of the home, minimum yard setbacks and limits to the number of wet bars and bathrooms. In June 2019, Pine appropriated and the City Council approved $23 million for Pine's plan to address homelessness in each of the nine council districts. Funds can also be used for facilities including rest stops, shelters, outreach centers and affordable housing in Waianae; provides $2 million for homeless service zones with a hygiene facility; and creates a center where health and human services can be administered. Sweeping change Pine entered the 2020 mayoral race calling for sweeping changes to end corruption in government in the wake of the Katherine (former Honolulu City deputy prosecutor) and Louis Kealoha (former Honolulu police chief) scandal, the Federal investigation of HART, and the Save Sherwood Forest protests in Waimanalo. Pine has said publicly that she considers herself \\"as an outsider to Honolulu politicians.\\" She has publicly challenged the policies of Mayor Kirk Caldwell and the project delays and mismanagement of the City's Honolulu Rail Transit (HART). Originally estimated to cost taxpayers $5.3 billion, it is now estimated to total $9‚Äì13 billion, and has become the subject of an FTA investigation. In 2017, Pine opposed lifting the rail tax cap. Pine opposed Bill 66, a Caldwell-supported bill to raise fares on public transportation, including TheBus and TheHandiVan. Pine opposed the construction of a 17-acre, $32 million sports complex in Waimanalo at Sherwood Forest. Hundreds of Native Hawaiians opposed the complex and 28 were arrested for blocking access to Waimanalo Bay Beach Park. The protesters cited concerns about archaeological and cultural significance, overdevelopment and traffic. Pine publicly opposed construction of thirteen 260-foot wind turbines in the Palehua Agricultural lands by EE Ewa LLC's (Eurus Energy), in a power purchase by Hawaiian Electric. She joined the local neighborhood boards, who opposed the building on sacred Hawaiian lands. In addition, the turbines could impact homeowners' views. Council Member Pine also challenged the Police Commission in September, 2019, voting with the city council against a $100 million payout for criminal attorneys representing convicted former police chief Louis Kealoha. She has publicly stated that she feels that it's \\"ridiculous\\" and that the city should not be financially responsible for the willful criminal acts of city employees, opposing the use of taxpayer funds for out-of-state lawyers to defend employees of the rail project, the police department or the prosecutor's office who may have participated in illegal acts while on city time. She also spoke against the Police Commission's decision to grant a $250,000 severance payout to Louis Kealoha. Parks Pine brought millions of dollars to the Leeward Coast to improve infrastructure, enhance security and clean up public parks for her constituents. She has sought to fund improvements and enhancements for public parks and recreation. Pine introduced several measures in support of public parks and public safety throughout O‚Äôahu. Pine's Resolution 19-333 would enable the city to increase the number of park rangers and expand the program island-wide in order to promote public safety and environmental protection. Pine supports alternative funding through private sponsorship for the historic Honolulu Zoo, which, due to lack of funding, lost its accreditation in 2016. In addition, in 2015, she introduced Bill 78, CD1, FD1 to acknowledge sponsorship of city assets with name recognition to enhance public-private partnership possibilities. (Ordinance 15-42, 2015). In 2018, Pine accused Mayor Caldwell of playing favorites with park monies, spending the bulk of funds allocated for park improvements at popular tourist site, Ala Moana Park, while Leeward Coast parks suffered from potholed parking lots, homeless encampments, trash and safety improvements that were not addressed. Citing inequitable distribution of city resources, Pine introduced Resolution 19-091, to require and audit of the Department of Parks and Recreation to determine whether all Oahu Parks were receiving fair treatment. After years of citing criminal activity and homeless encampments at One‚Äôula Beach Park in Ewa Beach, nightly closure hours were finally instituted in January 2020, and a master plan for improvements was implemented. Women In 2016, Pine called for a performance audit to examine how the Prosecutor's office and the Honolulu Police Department handle domestic violence, enforce temporary restraining orders and process cases through the courts. Resolution 16-001 produced a report showing that cases of domestic violence increased 600% from 2013-2016 and that only 14% of those cases ever reached court. In 2020, Pine authored Bill 10, to ensure gender-equity and fair allocation of permits for the use of park facilities for sports after female surfers complained that they had not been able to obtain a permit for North Shore, Oahu female surf contests during pristine surf seasons for ten years. Additional city legislation Pine supported Res. 18-73, a resolution to facilitate the development of a race track or raceway in Honolulu with the use of private investment and funding. In 2016, Pine and a fellow councilmember introduced Bill 24 to strengthen the enforcement of restrictions on illegal dumping of bulky items. The new law allowed inspectors to fine the individual perpetrators who illegally dump bulky items, not just the nearby residents and managers. In response to complaints of frequently closed and overwhelmed Leeward refuse centers, she introduced Resolution 19-101 to require that the City Department of Environmental Services conduct an evaluation of Leeward sites and provide recommendations on how to improve services. In the report, the Department identified staffing shortages and lack of capacity as challenges. Cyber crime Pine was a victim of cybercrime in 2011 and worked to help strengthen the state's cybercrime laws by introducing four groundbreaking bills to curb the growing cyber crime trend in Hawaii. The bills were the result of the cyber crime informational briefing co-chaired by Pine. On July 10, 2012, all four bills Pine introduced to curb Hawaii's growing cyber crime trend became law. Under these laws, prosecutors and law enforcement increase ability to investigate, obtain evidence, and bring cyber criminals to justice with new or stiffer penalties: * (HB 1777) Measure allowing out-of-state records to be subpoenaed in criminal cases. Authorizes judges in Hawaii's State court system to require that certain records located or held by entities outside Hawaii be released to the prosecution or defense in a criminal case. Prosecutors will now be able to obtain evidence that is often in the hands of mainland corporations, such as cell phone records. The Honolulu Prosecutor's Office advocated for the bill, testifying that it was the most important action Hawaii could take to aid in the prosecution of cybercriminals. * (HB 1788) a measure to strengthen Hawaii's existing computer fraud and unauthorized computer access laws. A cybercrime omnibus bill that strengthens existing computer crime laws by making computer fraud laws mirror Hawaii's identify theft laws; the result is that accessing a computer with the intent to commit theft becomes a more serious offense. The law also imposes harsher penalties by reclassifying the severity of computer fraud and unauthorized computer access offenses. Notably, the bill creates the new offense of Computer Fraud in the Third Degree, a class C felony; this particular crime would involve knowingly accessing a computer, computer system, or computer network with intent to commit theft in the third or fourth degree. * (HB 2295) a measure to prohibit adults from soliciting minors to electronically transmit nude images of a minor(s). HB 2295 expands the existing offense of Use of a Computer in the Commission of a Separate Crime to include situations where a perpetrator knowingly uses a computer to pursue, conduct surveillance on, contact, harass, annoy, or alarm the victim or intended victim of the crimes of Harassment under HRS 711-1106 or Harassment by Stalking under HRS 711‚Äë1106.5. This law recognizes that using a computer to commit such crimes is an aggravating factor that justifies an additional penalty. * (SB 2222) addresses \\"sexting\\". The bill would create two new offenses in HRS chapter 712 that would: Prohibit an adult from intentionally or knowingly soliciting a minor to electronically transmit a nude image (photo or video) of a minor to any person (misdemeanor); prohibit a minor from knowingly electronically transmitting a nude image of him/herself or any other minor to any person, or intentionally or knowingly soliciting another minor to do so (petty misdemeanor); and prohibit a person of any age from knowingly possessing a nude image transmitted by a minor (but a person charged with this crime would have an affirmative defense that he/she made reasonable efforts to destroy the nude image (petty misdemeanor)). 2020 Honolulu mayoral election On October 28, 2019, Pine announced her candidacy for Mayor of Honolulu. Affiliations Her affiliations include membership in the parish of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Catholic Church, where she serves as a lector and a member of the Filipino Catholic Club. She is a former member of the Ewa Beach Lions Club, former AYSO Soccer coach, and former chairperson of the Ewa Beach Weed and Seed Neighborhood Restoration Project. Personal life Pine is a practicing Catholic. She is married to LCDR Brian Ryglowski, USN. Pine gave birth to their daughter in March 2015, and was the first sitting council member to have a baby while in office. She lives in Ewa Beach with her family, including two dogs and two cats.

The Corran landing at Ardgour Description Operated by Highland Council, the Corran Ferry is one of few remaining mainland vehicle ferries in Scotland. The route crosses Loch Linnhe from Nether Lochaber to Ardgour, at the Corran Narrows, south of Fort William. It was noted for the unusual sign \\"This is not the Ballachulish Ferry\\", placed there to avoid confusion with the nearby ferry at Ballachulish which crossed Loch Leven until being replaced by the Ballachulish Bridge in early 1976. The route lies on one of the ancient drove routes from the Hebrides to the cattle markets in Central Scotland. Today, the ferry is a crucial link between the main A82 road (serving Inverness, Fort William, and Glasgow) with the otherwise extremely remote Morvern and Ardnamurchan peninsulas. Use of the ferry saves over an hour from the land route between Ardgour and Corran (which would involve use of the A861 and the A830). Services are fairly frequent, with ferries operating every 20 to 30 minutes seven days a week. Travel on foot is free, but bringing a passenger vehicle costs ¬£8.50 From the Ardgour side, there are roadway connections to Lochaline, to the southwest, and to Kilchoan, to the west; both of these locations are linked by Caledonian MacBrayne ferries to points on the Isle of Mull, respectively Fishnish and Tobermory. Close to the Ardgour side are Corran Lighthouse and the Ardgour Inn. Ferries There has been a ferry at the site for centuries. The North Argyll, a turntable ferry, was on the route in the 1930s. Her deck rotated to allow one car to drive easily onto the slipway. The , launched in 1976 in Ardrossan, spent her early years operating between Kylesku and Kylestrome in the far north west of Scotland. She was displaced when the Kylesku Bridge opened in 1984. She continues as the backup ferry on the route. The Rosehaugh was displaced from the Kessock Ferry in 1982 by the opening of the Kessock Bridge. She was retired in 2001 after 32 years in service on various routes across the Highlands. The Corran replaced the Rosehaugh in late 2001. She was built in Hull for ¬£2.9 million and brought additional capacity to the crossing.

The artist's signature is minutely incised into the black background of the stone, just above the central figures in the frieze-like procession. Various 18th-century sources reported that Louis XIV of France had been prepared to offer the equivalent of ¬£4000 in the previous century.Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, Taste and the Antique: the lure of classical sculpture, 1500-1900 1981:49, note 51 (the gem's subject given the traditional title the 'Wedding of Cupid and Psyche'). An early 16th-century drawing of the subject by the architect and antiquarian Pirro Ligorio was seen among the papers of Rascas de Bagarris recorded by Jacob Spon.Spon, Recherches curieuses d'antiquit√©s, (Lyon, 1683:87), noted in Oleg Neverov, \\"Gems in the Collection of Rubens\\", The Burlington Magazine 121 No. 916 (July 1979:424-432) p. 428 and note 48; Rubens sent a cast of the Tryphon gem among casts of his others to Claude Peiresc.

J.Boardman with D. Scarisbrick, C. Wagner and E. Zwierlein-Diehl The Marlborough Gems (Oxford University Press 2009), p.34 It became so familiar that the caricaturist James Gillray engraved a parody of it in 1797, lampooning the long-delayed marriage of Lord Derby to the actress Elizabeth Farren, who is travestied as a tall, lanky veiled figure, who is offered a countess's coronet instead of the winnowing fan of pomegranates, with the plump cherubic Lord Derby at her side. By 1870 the Marlborough collection cataloguer observed, \\"the design has been reproduced in all sorts and materials of art, perhaps oftener than any other similar subject.\\" The 7th Duke of Marlborough sold the gem, catalogued as \\"The Marriage of Cupid and Psyche\\", together with the other Marlborough Gems, at Christie Manson & Wood, London, in 1875. The collection, sold in a single lot that brought ¬£35,000, went to David Bromilow of Bitteswell Hall, Leicestershire, who maintained the collection intact; when his daughter subsequently sold the Marlborough gem with the rest of the Bromilow Marlborough hardstones by Christie's, 26‚Äì29 July 1899, the cameo was sold for ¬£2000.For the latest publication on the subject see now J.Boardman with D.Scarisbrick, C.Wagner and E.Zwierlein-Diehl The Marlborough Gems (OUP 2009), no.1; \\"Marlborough gems sold, The New York Times, 30 June 1899 Now the collection is very widely dispersed, with large numbers in American museums.

Early life and career Hartwich was the son of Emil Hermann Hartwich, the building surveyor and railway engineer of the Danziger government. Hartwich's early years were characterized by considerable moving about among different parts of Germany. Having attended elementary school in Danzig, in 1853 he was sent to the Humanistische Gymnasium in Berlin, and from 1856 to the Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium in Cologne. In 1862 he took up study of jurisprudence at the University of Heidelberg,Toepke, Gustav [publisher] Die Matrikel der Universit√§t Heidelberg (6. Teil): Von 1846 - 1870, Seite 444 -- http://digi.ub.uni- heidelberg.de/diglit/matrikel1846/0452 where he became a member of the ancient student fraternity, the Corps Rhenania.K√∂sener Corpslisten 1930, 70, 130 He completed his education at the University of Berlin and in 1868 entered the Prussian Judiciary. In 1870 he married Hero Jung (1845-1906), daughter of the liberal politician Georg Gottlob Jung and his wife Pauline Stein, and a first cousin of Mathilde Wesendonck. In 1874 he became an assistant judge (Hilfsrichter) in the District Court of D√ºsseldorf and in 1879 a Justice of the Peace (Amtsrichter). In addition to his judicial work, Hartwich exerted himself in promoting the physical education of the young, published several writings on the subject and took part in founding the Association for Promotion of Personal Hygiene (Zentralvereins f√ºr K√∂rperpflege in Volk und Schule). Affair with Elisabeth von Ardenne and death In the summer of 1881 Hartwich, who was suffering from the throes of his unhappy marriage, became acquainted with young Elisabeth von Ardenne, who was ten years his junior. She had recently arrived in D√ºsseldorf together with her husband Armand Leon von Ardenne, due to Armand's ascent within the country‚Äôs political hierarchy. Emil Hartwich and Elisabeth von Ardenne soon turned out to have many things in common, such as their love for theatre plays. The correspondence between them did not even cease when Ardenne returned to Berlin on 1 October 1884, with Elisabeth and the couple‚Äôs two young children following him. Hartwich continued to pay erratic visits to Elisabeth and her husband even after the couple‚Äôs departure. While he was sojourning in Berlin during the summer of 1886, he and Elisabeth both resolved to divorce their respective spouses and to marry each other. Ardenne, however, saw his secretly harboured suspicions confirmed when he located the hiding place of the letters which his wife and Hartwich had been exchanging over the course of several years. Thereupon he filed for divorce and challenged his rival to a duel, an event upon which massive media coverage had been centred before it took place on 27 November 1886. Hartwich sustained severe injuries and died four days after the duel on 1 December 1886. Although Armand von Ardenne was initially sentenced to two years‚Äô imprisonment, his prison term was reduced to merely eighteen days not long afterwards. The affair formed the historical background for the well- known novel \\"Effi Briest\\" by Theodor Fontane. Though Fontane changed the names and many of the concrete details, the affair was well-known enough for the background to be clear. Elisabeth von Ardenne long survived her lover, living until 1952. The Hartwichstrasse (Hartwich Street) in D√ºsseldorf-Oberkassel is named after Emil Hartwich. Writings * Woran wir leiden.

Brooks and illustrated by Kurt Wiese. Freddy's attempts to catch the gang extorting money from Centerboro's city folk are hindered by a headless horseman. The dragon created as a circus attraction becomes a tool in fighting crime. The Bean animals settle accounts with the gang and with a long-standing foe. Plot summary Back from a trip, Freddy is surprised that many in Centerboro want him arrested. Considerable property damage has been done by a gang including a pig looking like Freddy. Investigating, Freddy shows that damage done in one case could not have been done by him. He is still under suspicion, and is called for an unpleasant police questioning. He instructs the A.B.I. (Animal Bureau of Investigation) to search the countryside, and immediately discovers a bull who has been damaging farms and crops. Freddy's perfume- filled water pistols turn the bull Percy into a smelly laughing stock. He is subdued and they capture him. The search for the gang continues. Most of Centerboro thinks Freddy is responsible for the crimes, but not the ‚Äúsolid‚Äù citizens. Since Freddy is the president of his animal bank, the town's human banker vouches for him: :\\"'You think that because he is a banker, he is incapable of committing a crime?'... :'Sir,' said Mr. Weezer, 'when a banker commits a crime, it is a big crime, a first-class crime, a crime on a scale with his standing in the community.'\\" (p. 62) The Bean cow sisters discover that Percy is the father who abandoned them as calves; the bull is unmoved. He refuses to discuss his gang. Freddy had been asked for a suggestion to help a circus. Now Uncle Ben the inventor suggests creating a fire-breathing dragon. The gang begins demands for money. Freddy and Jinx the cat lie in ambush at the money drop site, but are terrified by the appearance along a dark road of a headless horseman. Once they have recovered, Freddy learns from the A.B.I. that many of the gang were seen in that area, including a scruffy pig. Freddy has Samuel Jackson the mole burrow under Percy, to pretend to be his conscience. The mole convinces Percy to behave well, and to reveal the gang's hideout. Percy reforms his manners so successfully that he becomes popular. Freddy avoids arrest on a technicality. The spiders Mr. and Mrs. Webb are sent to explore the gang's hideout. They discover a huge, complicated cave system, with many animals and people. Once Uncle Ben's dragon is ready the animals stake out the cave. The dragon upsets the headless horseman's activities, but the police are not convinced by the evidence. Scorning the cave map created by the spiders, they send in their own troops. Although Freddy is in disguise to avoid arrest, he and Jinx intercept a new member coming to join the gang. Breaking into his hotel room, they steal the snake doing robberies. The snake is released far away, and the discouraged owner leaves town. Some police troopers exploring the cave are missing. The police decide to use the spider's map and the animal's help. The gang is partly captured. The circus is held, and Samuel Jackson's fake medium makes the animal's enemy Mrs. Underdunk look foolish. The animals storm the cave and, with the help of Uncle Ben's atomic station wagon, also trap the headless horseman. The extortion money proves to be in the house of Mr. Anderson ‚Äî another longstanding enemy. As the series closes, he is finally sent to the penitentiary.

Note: This includes and Accompanying 14 photographs It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places both as a contributing property to the Canandaigua Historic District in 1984 and individually in 1988, as part of a Multiple Property Submission of over 200 post offices all over the state. Its construction was authorized in the first decade of the 20th century under the Tarsney Act of 1893, which authorized the federal government to hire private architects to design buildings for its use. Local philanthropist Mary Clark Thompson, widow of banker Frederick Ferris Thompson, donated the land and paid for Boston-based Allen & Collens to design the new building. It is one of only three post offices in the state built under the act, and the only one outside of New York City. In 1938 it was expanded with an additional story under the auspices of Louis Simon, Supervising Architect of the Treasury Department. At the time of its construction it was also used as a federal courthouse. Three years after it was listed on the Register, the Postal Service moved out for larger quarters. The neighboring YMCA bought the post office building several years later. It has annexed it to its own building and built an extension to the west, but kept the post office building intact. Building The former post office building is located in the center of Canandaigua, on the west side of North Main between Atwater Place and Greig Terrace, on the corner with the former. To the south is Atwater Park. Canandaigua's city hall, also a contributing property to the historic district, is opposite the park on the south, across West Street. Beyond it are the railroad tracks, actively used by CSX Transportation for freight service, that traverse the city. On the north is the building now occupied by the local YMCA, separate from the post office building at the time of construction but now annexed to it. Across North Main, a four-line road with a narrow planted median strip at this point, is the Ontario County courthouse, also a contributing property. Behind the post office is a parking lot, beyond which the railroad tracks curve, following the contour of the terrain, which gently slopes southward toward the north end of Canandaigua Lake. The building itself is a three-story granite structure on a raised basement with a rear addition. A driveway is set on the south side between the building and a sympathetic stone retaining wall. In the front is a flagpole and a short walk, with a line of large shrubs setting off the driveway on the south. Its east (front) facade has a projecting central portico. Four round fluted Doric columns flanked by in antis Doric piers supporting a Doric entablature in which \\"United States Post Office And Courthouse\\" is engraved in the architrave. It is the center of a frieze with metopes ornamented with round panels. Above it is a dentilled cornice topped by an attic. At the top of the entire portico is an anthemion set between the engraved words \\"A.D. MCMXI\\" and capped with volutes on the end. A small brick section rises up from the center of the flat roof. Climbing up to the portico is a full-width set of six stone steps. On either side are pedestals with pedimented pylons supporting cast iron anthemia-shaped lamps with glass globes. They are set with a cast iron caduceus. On either side is a single bay with a two-over-two double-hung sash window topped by a two-light transom in a recessed surround on the first story, where a water table forms their sills, and a smaller two-over-two with no surround on the upper story. The attic has two similar windows flanking the anthemion. Behind the portico colonnade is the main entrance, set within a battened, crosetted enframement with \\"Canadaigua\\" carved into the top. Above the modern entrance doors is a transom with a classically inspired grille. It is illuminated by a large metal lamp that hangs by a chain from the ceiling. On either side are two double casement windows topped by a three-pane transom with a similar grille. Above them are spandrels carved with a Greek key pattern separating the two stories. The second story has simpler two-over-two double-hung sash similar to those outside the portico. On the south facade, the only other original one remaining exposed, the fenestration retains many of the same treatments, but with deeper recessing. A secondary entrance near the east corner has two paneled wooden doors with a crosetted upper light and blind transom. To its west, two barred windows open into the basement as the driveway rises toward the former loading dock at the end of the block. The water table continues, supported by brackets at the base of the two largest first-story windows, set with narrow four-light casement in the same surrounds as their counterparts on the east. A single narrow casement window is to the west, followed by a dropped single-pane transomed casement window. The second story on the south side has one-over-one double-hung sash with no surrounds, likewise set deeper than the east windows. Above it the cornice continues as well. In the rear the former loading dock entrance, now barred off, is on a small extension. A brown brick extension with some architecturally sympathetic elements continues further west; it was built by the YMCA after the Postal Service discontinued use of the building and is not part of the NRHP listing. The entrance doors open into a wooden vestibule with Doric pilasters. Five more, this time of white marble, divide the main lobby beyond it into five bays. The walls are of the same stone, with light and dark green marble used for the baseboards and sills; it has a terrazzo floor, also with marble trim. The screenline, between the pilasters, has oak frames and classical grilles. At the top of the pilasters is a plaster Doric entablature and crossbeams with a Greek key design similar to that seen on the east facade. A stairway and elevator lead upstairs. To the west of the lobby is a large work area. At the west of the building, in the loading-dock addition, is the former courtroom. It, too, has Doric pilasters, crosetted windows with grilles and stylized fretwork on its metal vents. History Canandaigua was established as a European-American settlement in the last years of the 18th century, as a base for the settlement of the rest of Western New York. As it was roughly on the same corridor and transportation routes of the many other communities that had been established between Utica and Buffalo, it was established as the county seat as soon as Ontario County was created. Mail delivery began in 1794. Canandaigua continued to grow and railroads made the city a stop as soon as tracks could be built there. In 1860 the federal government negotiated a lease with the county that allowed it to operate a post office in perpetuity in a corner of the county courthouse. By the later decades of the 19th century its location at the north end of Canandaigua Lake made the city a popular destination for summer residents. In 1886 two arrived who would leave a major mark on the city, including the current post office building. New York City banker Frederick Ferris Thompson and his wife, Mary Clark Thompson, a native of Canandaigua whose father had served as governor, built Sonnenberg Gardens, also listed on the Register and designated a state historic site, as their summer home. They commissioned Boston architect Francis B. Allen to design the house. The Thompsons became very committed to Canandaigua, funding the planting of trees along its streets and founding the hospital building later used as county offices. In 1906, with the post office outgrowing its space in the courthouse, Congress authorized a post office building for the city, although no site was available. Four years later Mary Thompson, now widowed, bought the current site and donated it to the federal government. Normally, at that time, post office buildings, like all other federal government buildings, had been designed by the Office of the Supervising Architect at the Treasury Department. But the Tarsney Act of 1893 allowed a limited number of commissions, such as the 1900 Ellis Island Immigrant Inspection Center, to be awarded to private architects. Mary Thompson paid for Allen's new firm of Allen & Collens, best known for the Union Theological Seminary building on Manhattan's Upper West Side, to design the new Canandaigua post office. It was one of only three post offices in the state designed privately under the Act, and the only one outside of New York City. alt=A hand-tinted postcard showing a Victorian-looking white building with many doors and windows and a pointed red roof The post office moved into temporary offices at the YMCA while it awaited the construction of its new home. First the Atwater Block, the existing 1850 building on the site that had served mainly as lawyers' offices and, briefly, the first office of the Ontario County Historical Society, was demolished. Construction began on the new post office in 1910; it was completed and opened two years later. Allen produced a building less restrained than his other ventures into the Classical Revival mode, which often used simple engaged pilasters on their front facades rather than the full colonnaded portico he employed in Canandaigua. Behind the portico, the window design is meant to reflect the Erechtheum on the Acropolis in Athens. While the building is quite monumental for a small city in upstate New York, its front entrance and lobby are more modestly scaled than that monumentality would suggest. alt=An illustration showing the building with only two stories and slightly different exterior decoration At the time of its completion the building was two stories tall, with a parapet on the edge of its flat roof. In 1938, under the direction of Louis Simon, Supervising Architect of the Treasury, the building was expanded to allow sessions of the United States District Court for the Western District of New York to be held in the city, as authorized by the law that had created the district in 1900. A third story was built on the roof inside the parapet, and a small two-bay extension was added to the west (rear) elevation. Inside, a staircase was extended and elevator added to reach the new floor. Over the years, the post office would fulfill other federal government functions as well besides occasional court sessions. Local draft boards met here during all the major wars and military conflicts the U.S. was involved in during the 20th century. In 1991 the Postal Service, having outgrown the building again, moved to a new facility on the eastern edge of the city, off routes 5 and 20. The building then sat vacant for three years. In 1994 the YMCA, where the post office had briefly been quartered during the building's construction eight decades earlier, bought the building for an expansion. In the process it added the rear extension and joined its building next door to the post office.

It follows the fall of the Kandyan Kingdom into the hands of the British Empire. It ended over 2300 years of Sinhalese monarchy rule on the island. The British rule on the island lasted until 1948 when the country gained independence. Overview Periodization of Sri Lanka history: Background Portuguese presence The first Europeans to visit Ceylon in modern times were the Portuguese: Louren√ßo de Almeida arrived in 1505, finding the island divided into seven warring kingdoms and unable to fend off intruders. The Portuguese founded a fort at the port city of Colombo in 1517 and gradually extended their control over the coastal areas. In 1592 the Sinhalese moved their capital to the inland city of Kandy, a location more secure against attack from invaders. Intermittent warfare continued through the 16th century. Many lowland the Ceylonese were forced to convert to Christianity while the coastal Moors were religiously persecuted and forced to retreat to the Central highlands while some of them desired to leave the country. The Buddhist majority disliked Portuguese occupation and its influences and welcomed any power who might rescue them and defeat the Portuguese. In 1602, therefore, when the Dutch captain Joris van Spilbergen landed, the king of Kandy appealed to him for help. Dutch presence It was in 1669 that the Dutch attacked in earnest but ended with an agreement (which was disrespected by both parties), and not until 1656 that Colombo fell. By 1660 the Dutch controlled the whole island except the kingdom of Kandy. The Dutch (who were Protestants) persecuted the Catholics (the left-over Portuguese settlers) but left the Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims alone. However, they taxed the people far more heavily than the Portuguese had done. A mixed Dutch-Sri Lankan people known as Burgher peoples are the legacy of Dutch rule. In 1669, the British sea captain Robert Knox landed by chance on Ceylon and was captured by the king of Kandy. He escaped 19 years later and wrote an account of his stay. This helped to bring the island to the attention of the British. British rule Late 19th century German map of Ceylon. During the Napoleonic Wars, Great Britain, fearing that French control of the Netherlands might deliver Ceylon to the French, occupied the coastal areas of the island with little difficulty in 1796. In 1802 by the Treaty of Amiens the Dutch part of the island was ceded to Britain, and became a crown colony. In 1803 the British invaded the Kingdom of Kandy in the 1st Kandyan War, but were bloodily repulsed. In 1815 Kandy was occupied in the 2nd Kandyan War, ending Ceylonese independence. Following the bloody suppression of the Uva Rebellion, the Kandyan peasantry were stripped of their lands by the Crown Lands (Encroachments) Ordinance No. 12 of 1840 (sometimes called the Crown Lands Ordinance or the Waste Lands Ordinance), a modern enclosure movement and reduced to penury. The British found that the uplands of Sri Lanka were very suited to coffee, tea and rubber cultivation, and by the mid 19th century Ceylon tea had become a staple of the British market, bringing great wealth to a small class of white tea planters. To work the estates, the planters imported large numbers of Tamil workers as indentured labourers from south India, who soon made up 10% of the island's population. These workers had to work in slave-like conditions and to live in line rooms, not very different from cattle sheds. The British colonialists favoured the semi-European Burghers, certain high-caste Sinhalese and the Tamils who were mainly concentrated to the north of the country, exacerbating divisions and enmities which have survived ever since. Nevertheless, the British also introduced democratic elements to Sri Lanka for the first time in its history. The Burghers were given some degree of self-government as early as 1833. It was not until 1909 that constitutional development began with a partly elected assembly, and not until 1920 that elected members outnumbered official appointees. Universal suffrage was introduced in 1931, over the protests of the Sinhalese, Tamil and Burgher elite who objected to the common people being allowed to vote. Independence movement The Ceylon National Congress (CNC) was founded to agitate for greater autonomy. The party soon split along ethnic and caste lines. Prof. K. M. de Silva, the famous Peradeniya historian has pointed out that the refusal of the Ceylon Tamils to accept minority status to be one of the main causes which broke up the CNC.K. M. de Silva, University of Ceylon History of Ceylon, p. 225 The CNC did not seek independence or \\"Swaraj\\". What may be called the independence movement broke into two streams, viz., the \\"constitutionalists\\", who sought independence by gradual modification of the status of Ceylon, and the more radical groups associated with the Colombo Youth League, Labour movement of Goonasinghe, and the Jaffna Youth Congress. These organizations were the first to raise the cry of Swaraj, or outright independence, following the Indian example, when Jawaharlal Nehru, Sarojini Naidu and other Indian leaders visited Ceylon in 1926.Dr. Jane Russell, Communal Politics under the Donoughmore constitution. Tsiisara Prakasakyo, Dehivala, 1982 The efforts of the constitutionalists led to the arrival of the Donoughmore Commission reforms (1931) and the Soulbury Commission recommendations, which essentially upheld the 1944 draft constitution of the Board of ministers headed by D. S. Senanayake. The Marxist Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), which grew out of the Youth Leagues in 1935, made the demand for outright independence a cornerstone of their policy. Its deputies in the State Council, N.M. Perera and Philip Gunawardena, were aided in this struggle by Colvin R. De Silva, Leslie Goonewardene, Vivienne Goonewardene, Edmund Samarkody and K. Natesa Iyer. They also demanded the replacement of English as the official language by Sinhala and Tamil. The Marxist groups were a tiny minority and yet their movement was viewed with grave suspicion by the British administration. The heroic (but ineffective) attempts to rouse the public against the British Raj in revolt would have led to certain bloodshed and a delay in independence. British state papers released in the 1950s show that the Marxist movement had a very negative impact on the policy makers at the Colonial office. The Soulbury Commission was the most important result of the agitation for constitutional reform in the 1930s. The Tamil leadership had by then fallen into the hands of G. G. Ponnambalam who had rejected the \\"Ceylonese identity\\".Hansard, 1935 Ponnamblam had declared himself a \\"proud Dravidian\\", and attempted to establish an independent identity for the Tamils. Ponnamblam was a politician who attacked the Sinhalese, and their historical chronicle known as the Mahavamsa. One such inflamed attack in Navalapitiya led to the first Sinhala- Tamil riot in 1939.Hindu Organ, November 1, 1939 Ponnambalam opposed universal franchise, supported the caste system, and claimed that the protection of Tamil rights requires the Tamils (45% of the population in 1931) having an equal number of seats in parliament to that of the Sinhalese (about 72% of the population). This \\"50-50\\" or \\"balanced representation\\" policy became the hall mark of Tamil politics of the time. Ponnambalam also accused the British of having established colonization in \\"traditional Tamil areas\\", and having favoured the Buddhists by the buddhist temporalities act. The Soulbury Commission rejected these submissions by Ponnambalam, and even noted their unacceptable communal character. Sinhalese writers pointed out the large immigration of Tamils to the southern urban centers, especially after the opening of the Jaffna-Colombo railway. Meanwhile, Senanayake, Baron Jayatilleke, Oliver Gunatilleke and others lobbied the Soulbury Commission without confronting them officially. The unofficial submissions contained what was to later become the draft constitution of 1944. The close collaboration of the D. S. Senanayake government with the war-time British administration led to the support of Lord Louis Mountbatten. His dispatches and a telegram to the Colonial office supporting Independence for Ceylon have been cited by historians as having helped the Senanayake government to secure the independence of Sri Lanka. The shrewd cooperation with the British as well as diverting the needs of the war market to Ceylonese markets as a supply point, managed by Oliver Goonatilleke, also led to a very favourable fiscal situation for the newly independent government. Second World War During World War II, Sri Lanka was a front-line British base against the Japanese. Opposition to the war in Sri Lanka was orchestrated by Marxist organizations. The leaders of the LSSP pro-independence agitation were arrested by the Colonial authorities. On 5 April 1942, the Japanese Navy bombed Colombo, which led to the flight of Indian merchants, dominant in the Colombo commercial sector. This flight removed a major political problem facing the Senanayake government. Marxist leaders also escaped, to India, where they participated in the independence struggle there. The movement in Ceylon was minuscule, limited to the English educated intelligentsia and trade unions, mainly in the urban centres. These groups were led by Robert Gunawardena, Philip's brother. In stark contrast to this \\"heroic\\" but ineffective approach to the war, the Senanayake government took advantage of the war to further its rapport with the commanding elite. Ceylon became crucial to the British Empire in the war, with Lord Louis Mountbatten using Colombo as his headquarters for the Eastern Theater. Oliver Goonatilleka successfully exploited the markets for the country's rubber and other agricultural products to replenish the treasury. Nonetheless, Sinhalese continued to agitate for independence and Sinhalese sovereignty, using the opportunities offered by the war to establish a special relationship with Britain. Meanwhile, the Marxists, identifying the war as an imperialist sideshow and desiring a proletarian revolution, chose a path of agitation disproportionate to their negligible combat strength, and diametrically opposed to the \\"constitutionalist\\" approach of Senanayake and other Ethnic Sinhalese leaders. A small garrison on the Cocos Islands, manned by Ceylonese, attempted to expel the British. It has been claimed that the LSSP had some hand in the action, though this is far from clear. Three of the participants were the only British Subject Peoples to be shot for \\"mutiny\\" during World War II. Sri Lankans in Singapore and Malaysia formed the 'Lanka Regiment' of the Indian National Army. The constitutionalists, led by D. S. Senanayake, succeeded in winning independence. The Soulbury constitution was essentially what Senanayake's board of ministers had drafted in 1944. The promise of Dominion status, and independence itself, had been given by the Colonial office. Post-war The Sinhalese leader Don Stephen Senanayake left the CNC on the issue of independence, disagreeing with the revised aim of 'the achieving of freedom', although his real reasons were more subtle. He subsequently formed the United National Party (UNP) in 1946, when a new constitution was agreed on, based on the behind-the-curtain lobbying of the Soulbury Commission. At the elections of 1947, the UNP won a minority of the seats in Parliament, but cobbled together a coalition with the Sinhala Maha Sabha of Solomon Bandaranaike and the Tamil Congress of G.G. Ponnambalam. The successful inclusions of the Tamil-communalist leader Ponnambalam, and his Sinhala counterpart Bandaranaike were a remarkable political balancing act by Senanayake. However, the vacuum in Tamil Nationalist politics created by Ponnamblam's transition to a moderate opened the field for the Tamil Arasu Kachchi, a Tamil sovereignist party (rendered into English as the \\"Federal\\" party) led by S. J. V. Chelvanaykam, the lawyer son of a Christian minister.

The village lies around 2 kilometres east of Lena on riksvei 33. The village is named after the Kraby farms. Kraby became a stopping point with the opening of the Skreiabanen in 1902, and the village name Kraby came into use. Next to the station, a post office (2855 KRABY), was opened. In addition, some traders opened in Kraby. In 1916, a local festival, Festiviteten, opened, now known as Teten. After the Second World War, further building took place in Kraby. As well as the highway and Hoff stone church, there was also the Fostadjordet residential area. Directly south of Kraby, at Krabyskauen, √òstre Toten municipality built an industrial area in the 1980s. The station building at Kraby was designed by the architect Paul Armin Due. It was staffed from the start, but has not been operational since 1964. This was due to the drop in passenger numbers from Skreiabanen. In 1975, the station closed, at the same time as the Post Office. After a period of closure, the station building was restored, and in 2002 won the Fortidsminneforeningen's protection prize.

History BCNPMR had its inception in the early 1990s when the Broadhead Group sought to construct a community for retirees in northern Ambergris Caye. An environmental impact assessment by the Belize Center for Environmental Studies found the Bacalar Chico region to have an unusually high biodiversity for a barrier island. In 1995, the Natural Resources Management Plan and the Protection Project first developed a comprehensive management plan for the various vegetative assemblages within Belize. This plan specifically recommended the extreme northern portion of the island for inclusion based on the merits of its salt marsh ecosystem. At this time, fishermen in San Pedro and the mainland village of Sarteneja were growing concerned over the accelerating depletion of marine resources on Ambergris Caye. Community support for the creation of a reserve in Bacalar Chico was largely influenced by the Hol Chan Marine Reserve‚Äôs success in generating revenue from entrance fees and sustaining tour guiding operations. In 1995, the San Pedro NGO Greenreef Environmental Institute developed a management plan for the area, and a year later Bacalar Chico was officially recognized as a national park and marine reserve. The park remained protected in name only for the next three years. The Coastal Zone Management Authority and Institute (CZMAI) began paying salaries and operational expenses for marine protected areas designated under the World Heritage criteria in 1999. Funding from the CZMAI expired in 2004, when the financial and managerial responsibility for BCNPMR was transferred to the Government of Belize, which now furnishes US$100,000 a year for operational expenses and the salaries of the park's four rangers. An additional 10% of the park's budget is provided through small grants from organizations including the Nature Conservancy and the MesoAmerican Barrier Reef Systems Project. Governance BCNPMR comprises two distinct legal areas with their own set of laws. The national park is managed under the National Park Systems Act, with the ministerial responsibility held by the Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Industry. This section encompasses of land, of which 20% are privately owned lands. The strip of privately held land within BCNPMR is administered through the Ministry of Housing. One parcel given to the location of the current ranger headquarters. The remainder of the private holdings in the park consists of several parcels that comprise the majority of the park's windward shoreline. The marine reserve, which is of ocean and lagoon, is managed under the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Despite the two types of protected area within Bacalar Chico, the Fisheries Ministry is the de facto manager of the whole park as it furnishes the park's staff and budget. As with most parks in Belize, Bacalar Chico is co-managed by an NGO. A Memorandum of Understanding gives co-management responsibilities to the Green Reef Environmental Institute. Green Reef is legally responsible for education efforts involving the park, and is in part responsible for research and surveys carried out within the park, for legal lobbying, and for the procurement of grants. An advisory committee consisting of representatives from the government, environmental organizations, local businesses, and fishing and guiding cooperatives periodically meets for review and consultation on decisions regarding BCNPMR. Wildlife and habitat The park exhibits a high degree of diversity of habitats, encompassing swamps, grasslands, and various tropical forest assemblages including a medium semi-deciduous forest and a rare littoral, or beach, forest, which elsewhere in Belize has diminished due to coastal development. BCNPMR's marine habitats include extensive tracts of mangrove and sea grass beds, patch and barrier reef, and the largest lagoon on the island of Ambergris caye, Laguna de Cantena. The reef lies within the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, the world's second longest barrier reef after the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. It stretches from the middle of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, down the entire coast of Belize, and terminates in Honduras. Rocky Point, within Bacalar Chico, is the only location in Belize where the barrier reef meets the shore. The point is ‚Äòrocky‚Äô because a fossilized Pleistocene reef lies exposed at the surface. Within the park, all six species of cats native to Belize have been recorded, including the jaguar and puma. The forests are also home to a population of the endangered White- lipped Peccary. The mangroves and sea grass beds are home to manatees and crocodiles. Near Rocky Point lies the largest nesting beach for loggerhead and green sea turtles in Belize, and one of the largest for hawksbill turtles. Conservation The corals are still recovering from the collapse of the keystone grazer of algae, the long-spined sea urchin, which occurred in the 1980s and 90s and resulted in widespread coral die-offs across the Caribbean. The corals themselves are subject to black and white band diseases, damage from hurricanes, and bleaching and reduced calcification brought on by increased sea surface temperatures and ocean acidification associated with global warming. The reefs of Belize were subjected to the catastrophic global bleaching event of 1998. Persisting high sea surface temperatures that year, coupled with the devastation of Hurricane Mitch, resulted in a 50% loss of living corals in some locations along the barrier reef. As of January 1999, less than 1% of elkhorn, staghorn, and lettuce corals remained alive within the Basil Jones area (within Bacalar Chico), while 90% of boulder star coral was afflicted with black-band disease immediately after the bleaching event. In fact, the threat posed by climate change was one of the primary reasons the UNESCO World Heritage committee awarded its designation to the seven marine protected areas in Belize. In addition, BCNPMR is among the five marine protected areas in Belize that can be classified as overfished.

Early life Maureen Charlton was born Mary Farrell on 14 September 1930 in Dublin. She was one of three daughters of Edward and Bridget Farrell (or O'Farrell). She grew up in Mount Merrion, attending Loreto College, St Stephen's Green. Along with her younger sister Nuala, she studied arts in University College Dublin (UCD) where they were both active members of the Dramatic Society. Under the name Mair√≠n O'Farrell, she starred as Pegeen Mike in The Playboy of the Western World as part of an inter-varsity drama festival in Cambridge and Oxford in 1950. Career Collaborating with her sister Nuala, Charlton wrote an adaptation of Synge's Playboy as a ballad opera called The heart's a wonder. It was performed in UCD's Aula Maxima in November 1957, after they had graduated. In August 1958, it was performed professionally at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin. The orchestral arrangements was by Gerard Victory, costumes and sets were by Miche√°l Mac Liamm√≥ir, with Milo O'Shea and Joe Lynch starring in the production. It proved a popular production despite some purists' objections. CI√â put on a special train from Waterford, and there were plans for a long-playing record. The play was taken to the Westminster Theatre, London after a four-week run, and later was performed in New York in early 1959. Mary O'Malley put on the play a number of times at various venues in 1959, 1962 and 1971. BBC televised scenes from the show in September 1958, and in 1971 it was aired on RT√â as part of the Synge centenary. It was revived several times, including in the Abbey Theatre in 1978, and was popular with amateur dramatic societies. On 18 April 1963 she married Hugh Charlton (1930‚Äì2012) in the church of San Clemente, Rome. He was an art dealer and property developer, and owner of Apollo Gallery on Dawson Street, Dublin. Through his work they knew many of prominent artists of the time. They had two sons, Julian and Edward. Her sister Nuala married the journalist John Mulcahy. With Nuala as the musical director, Charlton wrote a musical compilation about 18th century Dublin theatre, Smock Alley. It was produced in 1967 and 1969 and received good reviews. She went on to write a number of plays including Go where glory waits thee about the life of Thomas Moore, which was later adapted into a film and aired on RT√â, Servants and masters which was performed first in 1971 at the Tailors' Hall, Dublin, Denis O'Shaughnessy goes to Maynooth based on a story by William Carleton, and The people against Mary Sheridan for television. Her 1987 one-person show about Peg Woffington was not well received. Charlton continued to write short stories and poetry, but none were as successful as her earlier work. Her volume of poetry, Lyrics from 'Nora Barnacle' was published in 1990. The poems about the life of Nora Barnacle, were originally part of a libretto by Charlton which was performed in the Dublin Theatre Festival of 1980 in the Eblana Theatre. Despite some success, critics David Nowlan and Michael Sheridan wrote scathing reviews. Charlton remembered these, and at the festival press conference in the Shelbourne Hotel on 2 October 1980 she accused them of being male chauvinists and bullies and doused them with yellow liquid which was later revealed to be beer. She worked with her sister and brother-in-law as an assistant editor of The Hibernia Magazine from 1964 to 1966. She founded and edited six issues of Martello from 1982 to 1990. In 1990 she published a collection of poetry, Selected fables of La Fontaine and in 1997 a volume of prose and poetry with Warren O'Connell, Duet for two Dubs. She was a regular contributor to the Sunday miscellany on RT√â Radio, briefly worked as the Evening Press theatre critic, and sat on the board of various cultural institutions. She was a member of the Irish Byron Society, hosting its annual midsummer garden party at her home in Blackrock, Newtown House. Charlton founded the Bell Tower Trust with some colleagues. The Trust aimed to save St Catherine's Church on Thomas Street. They raised funds to renovate the church which was later an arts centre. She was an active member of Royal Dublin Society, the Cercle Stendhal de Grenoble, the Friends of Lord Edward Fitzgerald Society, and the Irish Georgian Society. Charlton died on 10 August 2007 in Blackrock Clinic, County Dublin.

Gjems-Onstad joined the Norwegian resistance movement after Nazi Germany invaded Norway in 1940. He was arrested in Sweden for his involvement with Norwegian resistance activity in the country in 1941, and was sent to the United Kingdom where he joined the Norwegian Independent Company 1 (Kompani Linge) and received British military training. He was deployed to Norway in 1943 as part of Lark, assigned with establishing radio connection with London. He led Lark in Tr√∏ndelag between 1943 and 1945, which constituted the leadership of Milorg in the region. His other activities included to assist with weapons smuggling, prepare the sinking of the German battleship Tirpitz and plotting to assassinate Nazi collaborator Ivar Grande. He also founded the Durham organisation for conducting psychological warfare towards the end of the war, and he took part in blowing up railway tracks. Gjems-Onstad's efforts during the Second World War led him to become one of Norway's highest decorated war heroes. He joined the Norwegian Home Guard after the war, where he served as a captain. He completed education in law, and also worked as a judge and lawyer. He ultimately reached the rank of colonel in the military, as military lawyer of a branch of the Royal Norwegian Air Force. For some years he was CEO of a project that planned to develop the Vaterland neighbourhood in Oslo. Gjems- Onstad also had a career in sports, representing the sports club SK Rye in cycling and racewalking. He later worked as a sports official as board member and chairman of various national sports bodies. A former member of the Conservative Party and the libertarian organisation Libertas, Gjems-Onstad joined Anders Lange's Party when it was founded in 1973 and became the party's deputy leader. He was elected a Member of Parliament in the 1973 parliamentary election, and became the party's parliamentary leader following Anders Lange's death in 1974. Many of his views and proposals caused controversy, and he got in conflict with the new leadership of the party, which was eventually headed by Carl I. Hagen. Gjems-Onstad was expelled from the party in 1976, and finished his term as an independent. He also became known for criticising the Norwegian government's policy in Africa, and for defending the governments of countries such as Rhodesia and South Africa. In the 1980s he worked as a defender for several anti-immigration activists, and from the late 1980s he became involved in anti-immigration politics himself. He stood in election for the Stop Immigration party in 1989 and for the Fatherland Party in 1991, and he was later involved in the militant organisation Folkebevegelsen mot innvandring (\\"Peoples movement against immigration\\") and later Stop Islamisation of Norway. He was briefly active locally in the Conservative Party and the Pensioners' Party in the late 2000s. Early life Erik-√òrn Gjems-Onstad was born in Kristiania (modern-day Oslo) to jurist and civil servant Olaf Gjems-Onstad (1882‚Äì1945) and architect √Ögot Urbye (1886‚Äì1959). He worked at sea as a cabin boy in 1937, and went to port in both Africa and Asia. He finished his secondary education in 1940. Gjems-Onstad was active in the boy scouts before the invasion, and he was because of his experience there asked to instruct in map and compass for a volunteer military training program in late 1939. He thereafter became scout leader as the former leader went to fight in the Winter War. Due to the war in Europe, the scout exercises became increasingly serious, and the scout movement arguably had a big part in the early organisation of the Norwegian resistance.Gjems-Onstad, 1991, p. 16. In the winter of 1939/40, Gjems-Onstad commenced training in orienteering and signaling during the night. The weekend before the invasion, he and a friend prepared \\"for war\\" by training and sleeping in a tent in the snow in the forest Vestmarka, which was seen as unusual to do at the time. Second World War Early activities German soldiers marching through Oslo on 9 April 1940. The boy on the bike to the left has traditionally been regarded to be Gunnar S√∏nsteby, but Gjems-Onstad later claimed he had evidence that it was actually him. On 9 April 1940, Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Norway as a part of the Second World War. Gjems-Onstad became aware of the German presence when he and his family saw German planes flying right over their home. They did not get any notification of what was happening, and only music was played on the radio.Gjems-Onstad, 1991, p. 13. Gjems-Onstad took his bike and cycled to his school, the Oslo Cathedral School, only to find it closed and in a chaotic state. He thereafter went to the city centre and Karl Johans gate, where he witnessed the Germans marching through.Gjems-Onstad, 1991, p. 14. The next (or possibly the same) day, a German Junkers plane crashed near him and his friend when they were on their way from Lysaker to get a closer view of the captured Fornebu Airport. He briefly found himself in the situation of attempting to rescue the Germans trapped inside the plane, but the heat was unbearable and the two were told by the Germans to run away and get in safety just moments before the plane exploded. The proclamation by Norwegian Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold on 10 April (that rejected the German claim to appoint Vidkun Quisling as Norwegian Prime Minister), was according to Gjems- Onstad received with great disappointment by him and his friends. He thought it contained nothing but verbiage, with no remarks about mobilisation, defence, fighting or war. He thereafter wanted to join the resistance, but on his way met a man who told him that he would be rejected if he had not been through recruit training, and he thus returned home. After a few days, he and a friend nevertheless set out for Northern Norway. They came as far north as Nord-Tr√∏ndelag, where they however gave up and returned home.Gjems-Onstad, 1991, pp. 15‚Äì16. Gjems-Onstad started studying at the University of Oslo in late 1940, and he got in touch with students who wanted to organise a resistance movement. One time, he and other youth who sympathised with the resistance disrupted a public meeting held by the fascist party Nasjonal Samling (NS). They deliberately clapped their hands so relentlessly (they considered that they could not get punished for \\"cheering\\") that the speakers could not speak, and thereafter started leaving the room. Many were however blocked from leaving, and Gjems-Onstad and a few others were arrested and fined due to their role in the event. In September he participated in a clash between students and a group of Hird members (the NS's paramilitary organisation) outside the university. A young boy came by during the initial stand-off, asking Gjems-Onstad what was happening. Gjems-Onstad responded that the others were traitors, and Hird members thus captured him and beat him up. Later, due to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in December, Gjems-Onstad took part in digging mass graves for slaughtered cows in Dikemark and in Nes√∏ya.Gjems-Onstad, 1991, pp. 17‚Äì18. Erik Gjems-Onstad in the early 1940s. In late 1940, an engineer had created some military inventions which Gjems- Onstad's group wanted to bring to the Allied forces. It was decided that one of them was to travel to the UK, while Gjems-Onstad was to travel to Stockholm. Gjems-Onstad was joined by three others, and they decided to let themselves be arrested in √ñstmark in Sweden. They were transported to Stockholm, but the Norwegian legation was not interested in the inventions. Gjems-Onstad was later tipped to contact the British military attach√©. He got in contact with Major Malcolm Munthe, who in turn was interested in the inventions. Gjems-Onstad was arrested by Swedish police in Stockholm on 25 March 1941, as parts of Munthe's organisation had been exposed. Gjems-Onstad was imprisoned at the Stockholm police station for 13 days, and then for 59 days in the Stockholm Remand Prison.Gjems-Onstad, 1991, p. 19. On 23 May 1941 the government decided that he was to be expelled and banned from entering Sweden (the ban was repealed after the war). He was originally scheduled to be deported to Canada via Moscow and China, but the plans were halted due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union. He was instead sent to the Norwegian refugee camp in √ñreryd. He was ordered by the British to escape from √ñreryd in October 1941 and travel to Norway. He was captured by the Swedish Home Guard close to the Norwegian border, but was sent by plane to the UK by Swedish authorities in December. In the resistance After arriving in the UK, Gjems-Onstad joined the Norwegian Independent Company 1 (Kompani Linge) and took British military education. The British decided in 1943 to deploy him to Tr√∏ndelag in Norway together with Odd S√∏rli, Johnny Pevik and Nils Uhlin Hansen.Christensen, 2011, p. 133.Jensen, Ratvik & Ulstein, 1995, p. 66. The deployment was necessary as Evald Hansen and Herluf Nygaard had been captured and tortured in December 1942 (Nygaard later escaped, Hansen died at Falstad).Christensen, 2011, p. 132. S√∏rli and Gjems-Onstad were set to maintain Lark, establish radio connection with London and get intelligence about the German battleship Tirpitz, at the time located in the Trondheimsfjord. When he was training at Glen More Lodge near Aviemore, Gjems- Onstad was ordered to go to London, where he was supplied with a 20 kg radio transmitter and other equipment. Together with S√∏rli he travelled to Inverness by train, and to Shetland by plane, under stormy weather conditions.Gjems- Onstad, 1990, pp. 25‚Äì28. They initially set out with the fishing boat Harald II from Scalloway in late February, but due to unusually stormy weather they were driven back to Shetland three times after three unsuccessful attempts to reach √Ölesund; the last attempt destroyed their equipment as the boat was bursted open.Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 30‚Äì34. They had their equipment replaced, and set out for Kristiansund in March instead on a bigger boat. With easier, yet still poor weather, the voyage took two days. When they reached land they noticed that they had reached Kya Lighthouse, much farther to the north of their original destination, but they decided to make landfall anyway.Gjems- Onstad, 1990, pp. 34‚Äì35. From there they travelled with fake identification via Namsos to Trondheim, where they reunited with fellow Lark members Johnny Pevik and Nils Uhlin Hansen, the other group sent from London.Jensen, Ratvik & Ulstein, 1995, pp. 66‚Äì68.Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 36‚Äì39. Gjems-Onstad thereafter assisted Pevik and Hansen with transporting five tons of weapons from an uninhabited island near Lyngv√¶r to Trondheim. Lark received missions from London (sometimes via Stockholm), and constituted the leadership of Milorg in Tr√∏ndelag where they in practice were the same entity.Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 117. Gjems-Onstad started his operations in Trondheim by establishing radio connection with London and operating the radio transmitter,Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 43‚Äì44. and he soon became one of the most important persons in the leadership of Milorg.Alming, 1995, p. 94. His saboteur activity included to prepare the sinking of Tirpitz, but the plans were never realised as the ship had left the Trondheimsfjord in early 1943.Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 48‚Äì49. S√∏rli commanded Gjems-Omstad to a spontaneous assassination of Nazi collaborator Ivar Grande after spotting him incidentally, but Gjems-Onstad aborted after noticing a division of Russian POWs, fearing for what in turn might happen to them if he went through with the assassination.Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 55. Some days later he again plotted to assassinate Grande together with S√∏rli and Ingebrigt Gausland. They delivered a box booby trapped with an egg hand grenade to his home, but Grande foiled the attempt with advice Norwegian Gestapo agent Henry Rinnan (who was present at the time) had received on not to open such boxes.Christensen, 2011, pp. 139‚Äì140.Gjems- Onstad, 1990, pp. 55‚Äì57. Following the attempted assassination, he was ordered to not get himself involved in any further such attempts, as it was considered too risky for him.Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 98. Gjems-Onstad took over as leader of the group from S√∏rli in October 1943,Gjems-Onstad, 1995, p. 174. and it was decided to pull him out of Norway and close the radio station following news that Pevik had been arrested.Jensen, Ratvik & Ulstein, 1995, p. 71. He left Trondheim for Stockholm later that month, and received training in psychological warfare.Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 58‚Äì59. When S√∏rli came to Stockholm in January 1944 he took over for Gjems-Onstad, while Gjems-Onstad was to take over the leadership of Lark as well as to reorganise Milorg.Gjems- Onstad, 1990, p. 59. Gjems-Onstad also founded the propaganda organisation Durham when he came back to Trondheim in March 1944. Lark and Durham were to be kept completely separate, with Gjems-Onstad as their only mutual connection. Durham's mission was to influence the moral of the enemy, mainly through distributing brochures (an estimated 115,000 copies in total) and posters (an estimated 257,000), while also to cause irritation by minor sabotage. The brochures were chiefly distributed in the enemy's quarters, and the posters were put up throughout Trondheim.Gjems-Onstad, 1995, p. 175. Members of the group also tore down Nazi posters, sabotaged German vehicles, threw stink bombs into restaurants and cinemas, and applied itching powder‚Äînotably in condoms for sale to German soldiers. Sabotage on a bigger scale had to be authorised from London, and was largely discouraged as it would risk unnecessary German reprisals.Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 137. Gjems- Onstad reported back in Stockholm at the end of June.Jensen, Ratvik & Ulstein, 1995, pp. 72‚Äì78.Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 64. Eager to bring supplies to Trondheim, he and S√∏rli soon decided to transport propaganda material, handguns and explosives to the Norwegian border. After finding a lost resistance member in the mountains, Gjems-Onstad joined a course in Alby near Stockholm where he worked as instructor in \\"silent killing\\" for a month.Gjems- Onstad, 1990, p. 73. He went for a short mission to Trondheim in July in order to insert Egil L√∏kse as Lark's new radio operator there.Jensen, Ratvik & Ulstein, 1995, p. 78. By his next time in Trondheim, the Gestapo had gained knowledge of Gjems-Onstad's activities, and did their outermost to capture him. Gjems-Onstad went back to Trondheim at the end of October. He was to establish a new radio station, and investigate if Milorg and Lark could be rebuilt, as the organisation had been severely damaged by multiple arrests and murders.Jensen, Ratvik & Ulstein, 1995, pp. 78‚Äì80. Durham was however largely intact. The mission went into a new phase, as the Norwegian resistance started organising defence against potential destructions during the now largely inevitable German withdrawal. A continuation of the scorched earth policy practiced in Northern Norway was particularly feared. Gjems-Onstad and Lark were not to lead the defence, but rather to organise it and train new recruits.Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 74‚Äì80, 135. In November he authorised the creation of the illegal newspaper For Friheten by his own initiative, the first in Trondheim in years.Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 94. He also operated the paper DFP, or Deutsche Freiheitspartei, a form of black propaganda distributed to German soldiers and officers. He became increasingly frustrated with the damages caused by Rinnan and his gang of Nazi collaborators, and he vocally advocated their assassination.Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 98‚Äì100, 178. He reported back to Stockholm in November, and as he saw it, little remained of Milorg in Tr√∏ndelag after this. He however noted the importance of Durham, which he considered to have grown very powerful.Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 102‚Äì103. In early 1945 Gjems-Onstad took part in blowing up railway tracks on the stretches around St√∏ren Station, but the group had a limited supply of explosives, and the practical effects of the bombings could thus not cause as much effect as wanted. They could for instance not go through with blowing up the railway bridge near Hovin, which they sought as their main target.Gjems- Onstad, 1995, p. 176.Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 142‚Äì151. He was transferred back to Stockholm in March 1945,Jensen, Ratvik & Ulstein, 1995, p. 80. and Durham was dissolved.Alming, 1995, p. 98. He reacted with shock that London had decided that it was too dangerous for him to return to Trondheim.Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 165‚Äì166. He was uneasy about being set on the sideline, and headed a mission of four men from Stockholm to Namsvatnet at the end of the month to receive British sabotage supplies. They established a base of operations, as well as radio connection to the UK by the station Quail. The mission returned to Stockholm in early April, and Gjems-Onstad was transferred to a mission in Northern Norway. He was in Troms at the time of the German capitulation.Gjems- Onstad, 1990, p. 176. Decorations, comments War Cross, Norway's highest decoration, for his efforts in the war. In 1944 Gjems-Onstad was promoted to second lieutenant (fenrik). He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1941, and decorated with the Haakon VII 70th Anniversary Medal in 1942, the St. Olav's Medal With Oak Branch in 1944, the Defence Medal, War Medal 1939‚Äì1945, 1939‚Äì45 Star and the Norwegian Defence Medal in 1945 and the Norwegian War Cross with Sword in 1947. As such he was one of Norway's highest decorated war heroes. In 1947 he played himself in the documentary film Det grodde fram about the Norwegian resistance movement in Trondheim. Gjems-Onstad became critical of the \\"retracted regional leadership\\" of the Home Front (hjemmefronten) which he became aware of in late 1944. According to him, he and his fellow resistance members had not even heard of their existence. He sent a wire to London requesting that they should take over what remained of Milorg, rather than remaining passive during the occupation only to step forward as leaders of Milorg when the war was over. He became more critical when he became aware that they had started entering the administration in London and Stockholm, according to him without the necessary experience from practical fieldwork. He was shocked at the recklessness of one of them who arrived at one of their bases in Trondheim, concluding that they \\"obviously had no idea about how strong the infiltration really was in Trondheim, nor how we worked.\\" The regional leadership that stepped forward after the war was according to Gjems-Onstad not identical with the actual leadership of Lark and Milorg during the war.Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 117‚Äì119. Historians have noted that it was \\"very surprising\\" that Erling Gjone stepped forward as the leader of the Home Front in Tr√∏ndelag after the German capitulation. He had entered the administration in Stockholm in February 1945, but he had not been contacted whatsoever by Lark. The decision of putting Gjems-Onstad on the sideline in March 1945 led him to become increasingly critical of the leadership in London, which had gradually become more Norwegian than British, and subsequently decayed into what Gjems-Onstad considered to be a lack of professionality. He also questioned Norway's military abilities in a possible future war in Norway, based on post-war developments.Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 169. According to Gjems-Onstad, what influenced him and his contemporaries to join the resistance was a national feeling that‚Äîspeaking some 60 years after war‚Äîhe then considered that was \\"almost gone.\\" Gjems-Onstad deliberated his post-war views on the war in a 2008 ten-minute television special. As he saw it, the Norwegian Labour Party government before the war stood \\"entirely on the side of the Soviet Union.\\" He pointed to the Soviet Union as the greatest murderer of the war, and considered that nobody had \\"opened their eyes\\" to the fact that the Soviet Union was the only country that won territorial gains following the war. While he maintained that the coup headed by Vidkun Quisling was both bad and illegal, he considered that Quisling should be judged softer in light of the situation at the time. He pointed to the government fleeing the country, and what he considered the \\"pitiful\\" reaction of Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold. He also noted that while some of the figures in the Quisling regime had acted out far too harshly, some others had tried to maintain Norway's interests against the occupiers; the alternative of letting the Germans run the country completely unopposed under Josef Terboven could in his mind have ended up far worse. Gjems-Onstad said he believed that the treason by Quisling should be compared with the lack of preparations for war by Nygaardsvold and the Labour Party government. Gjems-Onstad also complained that he for unexplained reasons had been kept away from public arrangements related to the Second World War. He said he had not been invited to a single such event. He was also in possession of a large archive of wartime material from the resistance movement in Tr√∏ndelag, but said he had not been approached with interest by any public institution. Professional career Gjems-Onstad joined the Norwegian Home Guard after the war. From 1947 to 1959 he held the rank of captain there. He was mobilisation manager as military lawyer colonel at Strike Command Southern Norway (Luftkommando S√∏r-Norge), one of the Air Commands of the Royal Norwegian Air Force, from 1970 to 1980. He also completed his education in law, graduating with a cand.jur. degree in 1948. He worked as a judge in southern Buskerud from 1948 to 1949, and in 1949 he opened a law firm in Oslo. From 1957 he had access to work with Supreme Court cases. He was also a consultant or secretary for Norsk Gartnerforening, Bruktbilhandlerforeningen/Autoriserte Bruktbilhandleres handelsforbund and for the local branch of the Norwegian Bar Association. He was a board member of the local Bar Association chapter from 1960 to 1964 and of Max Manus AS, the eponymous company belonging to former resistance member Max Manus, from 1965 to 1969. Gjems-Onstad had served with Manus in the Norwegian Home Guard after the war, and had met his later wife Tikken Manus for the first time in 1943 when she worked as a military attach√© in Stockholm. The three remained lifetime close friends ever since they met during the war. In 1961 Gjems- Onstad left his lawyer's firm to work as a consultant in Den norske Creditbank. He became a central figure in the DnC's plans to develop the Vaterland neighbourhood in Oslo.Mauseth, 1991, p. 31. AS Vaterland was created soon after the DnC had been granted construction rights in 1965, and was a project designated for planning to develop the Vaterland neighbourhood into a business and office centre. Gjems-Onstad was a board member of AS Vaterland from 1966 to 1972, and was its CEO from 1970. He soon got the nickname the \\"Vaterland King\\" (Vaterlandskongen), after a local 1930s house owner. After a while, the plans for the development was dropped, as neither the bank nor the municipality saw it to be in their interests to realise the plans.Mauseth, 1991, p. 32. Gjems-Onstad was removed from his position with a golden parachute of in 1972 and lost his faith in the project. From 1972 to 1977 he operated a lawyer's firm in Oslo again, and from 1977 he moved his office to Hvalstad and worked as a defender in Asker and B√¶rum District Court. He retired as a defender in 1990, but remained a lawyer until 2001. During the 1980s he defended several anti-immigration activists, including Vivi Krogh, Jan √òdeg√•rd and Arne Myrdal. He also stated that he by 1994 had helped draft the wills of several anonymous persons who wanted to designate their fortunes, ranging from to , to persons and organisations working against immigration. Sports official Gjems-Onstad had an active career in sports. He represented the club SK Rye which he joined on 1 August 1936, and was made an honorary member of the club in 1986. He became the Norwegian junior champion in cycling in 1939. He was also an active race walker, with two sixth places in the Norwegian championships achieved between 1967 and 1969. He chaired the Norwegian Cycling Federation from 1959 to 1965 and the Norwegian Walking Association from 1967 to 1973. He was a member of the Norwegian Olympic Committee from 1959 to 1973 and a deputy board member of the Norwegian Confederation of Sports from 1965 to 1967. He was an official for Norway at the Summer Olympics in 1960 and 1972, and in 1993 he sat on the committee that organized the 1993 UCI Road World Championships. In 1967 he initiated Styrkepr√∏ven, a yearly cyclosportive from Trondheim to Oslo. He completed the race himself more than fifteen times; the last times with the starting number \\"1\\". Politics Member of Parliament From 1960 to 1964 Gjems-Onstad was a member of the school board in Oslo, representing the Conservative Party. He was also a member of the libertarian organisation Libertas, but had left it by 1971 as he considered that it had become \\"too tame.\\"Mauseth, 1991, p. 30. When Anders Lange's Party (ALP) was founded in 1973 he joined the party and became deputy leader under Anders Lange. He had been present at the founding meeting at Saga kino, and was offered a place in the party's central leadership by Anders Lange after they one day incidentally met outside Gjems- Onstad's lawyer's office. From then on he was the most central person in the party after Lange himself. Besides his leading positions in business and sports, Gjems-Onstad had for years expressed his political views in newspapers and journals, which broadly coincided with Lange's views. By offering him positions in the party, Lange particularly thought that Gjems-Onstad could help develop the party politically and organisationally.Iversen, 1998, pp. 28‚Äì29. In the 1973 parliamentary election he won a seat in the Norwegian Parliament from Akershus, and became a member of the Standing Committee on Finance and the Election Committee. During his term he set a new record for number of times speaking to the assembly--325 times in one year. At the start of his parliamentary term he made some proposals that were opposed by the entire parliament, including his own party. He proposed in November 1973 to introduce gun and shooting training as an optional course for students in high school, and to separate church and state (with its financial implications). The proposals were criticised in a press statement by Anders Lange and the party's two other MPs.Rygnestad & Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 217‚Äì219. Turmoil later also erupted in the Akershus and B√¶rum chapters of the party, and calls were made for expelling Gjems-Onstad due to his proposals in parliament; this wing however left the party in 1975 after being in clear minority. Gjems-Onstad and Lange nonetheless stood together in their conflict with Carl I. Hagen and Kristofer Alm√•s, who sought to strengthen the party's deliberately loose organisation.Iversen, 1998, pp. 52‚Äì53, 56‚Äì57. After Lange's death in 1974, Gjems-Onstad became leader of the party's parliamentary group. While Hagen and Alm√•s had broken out and formed the Reform Party earlier the same year, Gjems- Onstad welcomed Hagen back to the party in 1975 for \\"constructive cooperation\\". He thereafter changed to support the work led by Hagen and Arve L√∏nnum of strengthening the party organisation.Iversen, 1998, pp. 63‚Äì64. Gjems-Onstad's cooperation with Hagen was however not to last.Iversen, 1998, pp. 66‚Äì67. In early 1976 Gjems-Onstad voiced his discontent with the ever- ongoing conflicts within the party, and he had by mid-year not decided whether or not he wanted to run for re-election. He eventually felt squeezed out of the party, and wanted no part in the intriguing he considered Hagen to represent.Rygnestad & Kvanmo, 1993, p. 270. He was replaced as parliamentary leader of the party at the start of October. After he in turn recommended voters to rather vote for the Conservative Party in an interview with Aftenposten, he was finally expelled from the party by a unanimously approved motion put forward by Carl I. Hagen later the same month.Iversen, 1998, p. 67. Gjems-Onstad finished his term as an independent. Positions in parliament Before the 1973 election Gjems-Onstad advocated a restrictive immigration policy in an interview with Morgenbladet.Rygnestad & Kvanmo, 1993, p. 184. After being elected to parliament, he was the sole member of the Finance Committee to oppose agreements of raising fuel taxes in 1973. He proposed steep budget cuts in 1974, notably in press support and in the Office of the Prime Minister. He proposed to abolish the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and Administration, as well as 22 laws the same year. Gjems-Onstad also wanted to abolish conscription. In 1975 he criticised parliament for violating the Norwegian Constitution by regularly holding session with less than half of the representatives present. Prime Minister Trygve Bratteli in turn claimed that Gjems-Onstad \\"undermined democracy\\" because he was present and spoke in parliament too much. Gjems- Onstad was among the signatories of a petition in 1974 that called on the Norwegian government to secure Israel's existence. He wanted to terminate the Norwegian government's support of liberation movements in Portuguese Guinea the same year. He proposed to end all public foreign aid, and instead grant tax deduction to private donations. He also proposed to prioritise Norwegian interests in Antarctica higher, and to align Norway's ambassador to Thailand with South Vietnam. He advocated expelling the five Soviet KGB spies who had been exposed in Norway in 1975, but gained no support from the government. He was criticised by the Norwegian Foreign Minister the same year for claiming that Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere used Norwegian taxes for \\"national socialist\\" experiments of forcibly moving populations. Gjems-Onstad and Africa Gjems-Onstad travelled extensively in Africa. He toured Angola for a week in 1973, and was in Guinea-Bissau in 1974. He later claimed that blacks and whites had lived peacefully together in these countries when he had visited them before their decolonisation‚Äîafter which he considered the conditions to be grim‚Äîand that the standard of living among blacks had been higher there than in many other places in Africa. He came to regard it as a life's mission to work for Africa, and believed that the Norwegian government's policy in Africa contributed to destroy the continent through supporting \\"wars of liberation\\" and failed foreign aid. He maintained that his prime concern was to warn against the entrenchment of socialism and communism in Africa. He also travelled extensively throughout South Africa, and said that conditions for blacks were better there than in other African countries. He was introduced to a South African official visiting Norway in 1974 by Anders Lange,Rygnestad & Kvanmo, 1993, p. 169. and visited the country himself in 1975 after being invited by the South African Department of Information. He met with figures including Connie Mulder, and following Lange's death he considered himself as the continuation of Lange's legacy with regards to the country.Rygnestad & Kvanmo, 1993, p. 174. He supported the South African policy since the 1970s of gradually dismantling the apartheid system, which included the granting of independence to tribal homelands. He was in the country in April 1976 for a conference that was to prepare the establishment of Transkei. He later considered the homelands to be true democratic states governed by the rule of law, which he considered that many other African states were not. Gjems-Onstad strongly opposed the African National Congress and the Norwegian government's support of the group, as he believed their agenda would lead to civil war and a government led by revolutionary socialists‚Äîas had happened in other African countries. He later pointed to the development in former Rhodesia, Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe. He arranged several study trips to South Africa, and was part of a group of eight Norwegians who toured the country in 1987 and issued an \\"apology\\" to the South African government for the Norwegian government's policy towards the country. He went to Rhodesia in April 1979 as the sole Norwegian observer of the general election,Lunde, 1995, pp. 126‚Äì127. after he had been invited by the Rhodesian Department of Information. He admitted at the same time that he for years had corresponded with the Rhodesian government about how he considered various institutions and individuals in Norway, particularly in the news media. The relationship was initiated after Gjems-Onstad had written a letter of sympathy to Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith some years ahead. When in Salisbury, he met with Smith, Foreign Minister P. K. van der Byl and Head of the Military Peter Walls. Eager to participate with the government army during the Rhodesian Bush War, he was authorised by Walls to patrol with Rhodesian Security Forces around a garrison near Lake Kariba for two days.Lunde, 1995, pp. 127, 134‚Äì135. While he earlier had written he did not think democracy and human rights was optimal in the country‚Äîhe considered Botswana to be one of the better countries‚Äîhe considered rule of law to be better than in countries the Norwegian government had supported financially, such as Idi Amin's Uganda. Later political activity Carl I. Hagen wrote in his book √Ürlighet varer lengst in 1984 that he would put his office on the line in order to prevent Gjems-Onstad from making a \\"comeback\\" to the Progress Party (ALP's successor), despite his alleged requests. Gjems-Onstad criticised Hagen strongly for his complicity in the establishment of a Labour Party government in 1986, and was a member of the Conservative Party by 1988. He supported prospects of a Conservative Party government led by Jan P. Syse, but criticised the Norwegian political system for being a \\"caricature\\" of democracy, instead considering it a particracy. Gjems-Onstad had according to his own statement in 1987 not seen any reason for getting himself involved in the public debate about immigration until then. The reaction followed a comment by Conservative Party student politician Knut Albert Solem, in which he \\"presupposed\\" that anti-immigration sentiment was based on feelings of \\"foreign-hate\\", something which Gjems- Onstad disputed. Gjems-Onstad contested the 1989 parliamentary election for the Stop Immigration party in Akershus, and chaired its regional chapter from 1988 to 1990. He was expelled from the party together with Hege S√∏fteland and Torfinn Hellandsvik due to their vocal criticism of the leadership of the party's leader Jack Erik Kjuus. In 1991 Gjems-Onstad ran unsuccessfully in the local election for the Fatherland Party, and he was later active in Folkebevegelsen mot innvandring. He was also present at the meeting at Godlia kino in 1995. Gjems-Onstad expressed his outrage at the Lund Report in 1996 after it was revealed that he had been under surveillance by the Norwegian Police Security Service (POT), considering it defamatory and demanding an apology. Gjems-Onstad came to believe that the recent mass immigration to Norway was a greater threat than the Nazi invasion of Norway, although he made clear he had nothing against \\"normal immigration\\" and individuals, nor about Norwegians finding spouses in other countries. What he stated he was concerned about was increasing ethnic tensions and Norwegians being outnumbered in Norway in the course of the 21st century, and he stated that what worried him the very most was the growth of Islam. Gjems-Onstad praised Progress Party MPs Vidar Kleppe and √òystein Hedstr√∏m at their election campaign rally in 1999, and participated in the non-partisan demonstration against Muslim prayer calling in 2000. He was involved in the Conservative Party in Asker from 2005 to 2007, but joined the Pensioners' Party in 2007 as their top ballot candidate for the municipal election. As Gjems-Onstad called for a halt of immigration to Asker, he was instantly denounced by his own party. He also maintained that \\"Norway is the fatherland of the Norwegians, and Norwegians are a nation within the white race,\\" and during a television debate with fellow lawyer and politician Abid Raja said that he could not call himself a Norwegian, only a Pakistani-Norwegian‚Äîthey both nevertheless affirmed that they had great respect for each other. Gjems-Onstad was expelled from the Pensioners' Party before the election, but removal from the ballot is legally impossible. As the election was held the Pensioners' Party did not win any seats, and the local party leadership expressed their delight. Gjems-Onstad was also a member of Stop Islamisation of Norway, and participated in a demonstration alongside the organisation's leader Arne Tumyr in 2009. Gjems- Onstad made news in 2008 when he had talks with the disturbed man who fired a gun towards a refugee centre. He was also involved in a heritage distribution controversy. In her will, millionaire Clara Westin declared that be given to anti-immigration activists, and that the distribution be decided by a board consisting of four people. Egil Karlsen backed out and gave up his vote to Gjems-Onstad, and the other three were Gjems-Onstad, Norvald Aasen of Folkebevegelsen mot innvandring and Bjarne Pettersen. It surfaced that suggestions by board members included the mother of child murder convict Ole Nicolai Kvisler. While the background for involving Kvisler was his anti- immigration views, the pressing issue was the matter of his court ruling. Having followed the case closely as a former lawyer, Gjems-Onstad had disputed the court ruling as he believed there was not evidence to conclude that Kvisler had any more than possibly a subsidiary role in the murder; he thus explained the suggestion with providing funds for reopening his case. Gjems- Onstad maintained that it was only the other convict, Joe Erling Jahr, who had committed the murder. Pettersen had in addition wanted to distribute money to people from his circle around Vigrid (a group Gjems-Onstad loathed), such as Tore Tvedt and √òyvind Heian, but was squeezed out of the board after this was opposed by Gjems-Onstad and Aasen. The left-wing anti-racist organization SOS Rasisme petitioned the Norwegian state to confiscate Gjems-Onstad's war decorations, but to no avail. After all disputes were resolved, it was not made public who actually received any money. Personal life Gjems-Onstad was married in 1949 to Borgny Pedersen (9 November 1921 ‚Äì 2 July 2003). They divorced in 1973. He was married for the second time to Inger Opseth (born 2 October 1937) in 1974. Gjems-Onstad met Inger when he worked for the Vaterland-project, where she worked as an interior architect. Gjems-Onstad had three children, including his son, jurist Ole Gjems-Onstad. He lived in Hvalstad, Asker, where he owned a nine decare small farm. The property included three equal parts of garden, forest and arable land. He often cut lumber from the forest to build his own furniture. At various times, he had rabbits, sheep, cows, calves, piglets and a fish pond of brown trout at his property. According to himself, he kept the livestock largely in protest against tax authorities, while also as a hobby. Erik Gjems-Onstad died in November 2011 after short illness at the B√¶rum Hospital. He left behind his wife, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Writings Gjems- Onstad has authored several books. He wrote about the psychological warfare of the Norwegian resistance movement in DURHAM: hemmelige operasjoner i Tr√∏ndelag mot tysk okkkupasjonsmakt 1943-45, released in 1981. Durham was the codeword for the operations which to a large extent consisted of distributing flyers, brochures and posters with the purpose of demoralising the Germans. This was also the topic in Psykologisk krigf√∏ring i Norge under Annen Verdenskrig 1940-45, published in 1994. In 1990 he wrote about the resistance group Lark in LARK: Milorg i Tr√∏ndelag 1940-1945. He released the book Krigskorset og St. Olavsmedaljen med ekegren in 1995, which gives an overview of all the holders of Norway's highest wartime decorations. The reasons given for awarding the War Cross (Norway's highest decoration) was in the book also made public for the first time. In 1984 he published the books Dagbok fra Tanzania: U-hjelp uten mening, a travel diary from Tanzania discussing what he considered to be failed foreign aid, and a travel diary from Israel, Dagbok fra Israel: Reiser og tanker. He wrote about alternative Norwegian policies towards South Africa in the 1985 book Syd-Afrika i dag: Boikott eller samarbeid.

Overview Periodization of Sri Lanka history: Dominion (1948‚Äì1972) Dominion status followed on 4 February 1948 with military treaties with Britain, as the upper ranks of the armed forces were initially British, and British air and sea bases remaining intact. This was later raised to independence itself and Senanayake became the first Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. In 1949, with the concurrence of the leaders of the Ceylon Tamils, the UNP government disenfranchised the Indian Tamil plantation workers. Dr. Jane Russell, Communal Politics under the Donoughmore constitution. Tsiisara Prakasakyo, Dehivala, 1982 Hoole, M.R.R. (1988) Chapter1: Missed Opportunities and the Loss of Democracy. Volume 1 in Broken Palmyra. Uthr.org. Retrieved on 25 August 2014. This was the price that Senanayake had to pay to obtain the support of the Kandyan Sinhalese, who felt threatened by the demographics of the tea estates where the inclusion of the \\"Indian Tamils\\" would have meant electoral defeat for the Kandyan leaders. Senanayke died in 1952 after falling from a horse and was succeeded by his son Dudley Senanayake, the then minister of Agriculture. In 1953 he resigned following a massive Hartal (\\"general strike\\") by the Left parties against the UNP. He was followed by John Kotelawala, a senior politician and an uncle of Dudley Senanayke. Kotelawala did not have the enormous personal prestige or the adroit political acumen of D. S. Senanayake. He brought to the fore the issue of national languages that D. S. Senanayake had adroitly kept on the back burner, antagonising the Tamils and the Sinhalese by stating conflicting policies with regard to the status of Sinhala and Tamil as official languages. He also antagonized the Buddhist lobby by attacking politically active Buddhist Monks who were Bandaranaike's supporters. In 1956, the Senate was abolished and Sinhala was established as the official language, with Tamil as a second language. Appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London were abolished and plantations were nationalised to fulfil the election pledges of the Marxist program and to \\"prevent the ongoing dis-investment by the owning companies\\". In 1956, the Sinhala Only Act came into being. This established Sinhala as the first and preferred language in commerce and education. The Act took effect immediately. As a consequence vast numbers of people mostly Burghers left the country to live abroad as they rightfully felt discriminated against. In 1958, the first major riots between Sinhalese and Tamils flared up in Colombo as a direct result of the government's language policy. ;1971 Uprising The leftist Sinhalese Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna drew worldwide attention when it launched an insurrection against the Bandaranayake government in April 1971. Although the insurgents were young, poorly armed, and inadequately trained, they succeeded in seizing and holding major areas in Southern and Central provinces before they were defeated by the security forces. Their attempt to seize power created a major crisis for the government and forced a fundamental reassessment of the nation's security needs. The movement was started in the late 1960s by Rohana Wijeweera, the son of a businessman from the seaport of Tangalla, Hambantota District. An excellent student, Wijeweera had been forced to give up his studies for financial reasons. Through friends of his father, a member of the Ceylon Communist Party, Wijeweera successfully applied for a scholarship in the Soviet Union, and in 1960 at the age of seventeen, he went to Moscow to study medicine at Patrice Lumumba University. While in Moscow, he studied Marxist ideology but, because of his openly expressed sympathies for Maoist revolutionary theory, he was denied a visa to return to the Soviet Union after a brief trip home in 1964. Over the next several years, he participated in the pro-Beijing branch of the Ceylon Communist Party, but he was increasingly at odds with party leaders and impatient with its lack of revolutionary purpose. His success in working with youth groups and his popularity as a public speaker led him to organize his own movement in 1967. Initially identified simply as the New Left, this group drew on students and unemployed youths from rural areas, most of them in the sixteen-to-twenty- five-age-group. Many of these new recruits were members of minority so called 'lower' castes (Karava and Durava) who felt that their economic interests had been neglected by the nation's leftist coalitions. The standard program of indoctrination, the so-called Five Lectures, included discussions of Indian imperialism, the growing economic crisis, the failure of the island's communist and socialist parties, and the need for a sudden, violent seizure of power. Between 1967 and 1970, the group expanded rapidly, gaining control of the student socialist movement at a number of major university campuses and winning recruits and sympathizers within the armed forces. Some of these latter supporters actually provided sketches of police stations, airports, and military facilities that were important to the initial success of the revolt. In order to draw the newer members more tightly into the organization and to prepare them for a coming confrontation, Wijeweera opened \\"education camps\\" in several remote areas along the south and southwestern coasts. These camps provided training in Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and in basic military skills. While developing secret cells and regional commands, Wijeweera's group also began to take a more public role during the elections of 1970. His cadres campaigned openly for the United Front of Sirimavo R. D. Bandaranaike, but at the same time they distributed posters and pamphlets promising violent rebellion if Bandaranaike did not address the interests of the proletariat. In a manifesto issued during this period, the group used the name Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna for the first time. Because of the subversive tone of these publications, the United National Party government had Wijeweera detained during the elections, but the victorious Bandaranaike ordered his release in July 1970. In the politically tolerant atmosphere of the next few months, as the new government attempted to win over a wide variety of unorthodox leftist groups, the JVP intensified both the public campaign and the private preparations for a revolt. Although their group was relatively small, the members hoped to immobilize the government by selective kidnapping and sudden, simultaneous strikes against the security forces throughout the island. Some of the necessary weapons had been bought with funds supplied by the members. For the most part, however, they relied on raids against police stations and army camps to secure weapons, and they manufactured their own bombs. The discovery of several JVP bomb factories gave the government its first evidence that the group's public threats were to be taken seriously. In March 1971, after an accidental explosion in one of these factories, the police found fifty-eight bombs in a hut in Nelundeniya, Kegalla District. Shortly afterward, Wijeweera was arrested and sent to Jaffna Prison, where he remained throughout the revolt. In response to his arrest and the growing pressure of police investigations, other JVP leaders decided to act immediately, and they agreed to begin the uprising at 11:00 P.M. on 5 April. The planning for the countrywide insurrection was hasty and poorly coordinated; some of the district leaders were not informed until the morning of the uprising. After one premature attack, security forces throughout the island were put on alert and a number of JVP leaders went into hiding without bothering to inform their subordinates of the changed circumstances. In spite of this confusion, rebel groups armed with shotguns, bombs, and Molotov cocktails launched simultaneous attacks against seventy- four police stations around the island and cut power to major urban areas. The attacks were most successful in the south. By 10 April, the rebels had taken control of Matara District and the city of Ambalangoda in Galle District and came close to capturing the remaining areas of Southern Province. The new government was ill-prepared for the crisis that confronted it. Although there had been some warning that an attack was imminent, Bandaranaike was caught off guard by the scale of the uprising and was forced to call on India to provide basic security functions. Indian frigates patrolled the coast and Indian troops guarded Bandaranaike International Airport at Katunayaka while Indian Air Force helicopters assisted the counteroffensive. Sri Lanka's all-volunteer army had no combat experience since World War II and no training in counterinsurgency warfare. Although the police were able to defend some areas unassisted, in many places the government deployed personnel from all three services in a ground force capacity. Royal Ceylon Air Force helicopters delivered relief supplies to beleaguered police stations while combined service patrols drove the insurgents out of urban areas and into the countryside. After two weeks of fighting, the government regained control of all but a few remote areas. In both human and political terms, the cost of the victory was high: an estimated 10,000 insurgents- -many of them in their teens‚Äîdied in the conflict, and the army was widely perceived to have used excessive force. In order to win over an alienated population and to prevent a prolonged conflict, Bandaranaike offered amnesties in May and June 1971, and only the top leaders were actually imprisoned. Wijeweera, who was already in detention at the time of the uprising, was given a twenty-year sentence and the JVP was proscribed. Under the six years of emergency rule that followed the uprising, the JVP remained dormant. After the victory of the United National Party in the 1977 elections, however, the new government attempted to broaden its mandate with a period of political tolerance. Wijeweera was freed, the ban was lifted, and the JVP entered the arena of legal political competition. As a candidate in the 1982 presidential elections, Wijeweera finished fourth, with more than 250,000 votes (as compared with Jayewardene's 3.2 million). During this period, and especially as the Tamil conflict to the north became more intense, there was a marked shift in the ideology and goals of the JVP. Initially Marxist in orientation, and claiming to represent the oppressed of both the Tamil and Sinhalese communities, the group emerged increasingly as a Sinhalese nationalist organization opposing any compromise with the Tamil insurgency. This new orientation became explicit in the anti-Tamil riots of July 1983. Because of its role in inciting violence, the JVP was once again banned and its leadership went underground. The group's activities intensified in the second half of 1987 in the wake of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord. The prospect of Tamil autonomy in the north together with the presence of Indian troops stirred up a wave of Sinhalese nationalism and a sudden growth of antigovernment violence. During 1987 a new group emerged that was an offshoot of the JVP‚Äîthe Patriotic Liberation Organization (Deshapremi Janatha Viyaparaya‚ÄîDJV). The DJV claimed responsibility for the August 1987 assassination attempts against the president and prime minister. In addition, the group launched a campaign of intimidation against the ruling party, killing more than seventy members of Parliament between July and November. Along with the group's renewed violence came a renewed fear of infiltration of the armed forces. Following the successful raid of the Pallekelle army camp in May 1987, the government conducted an investigation that resulted in the discharge of thirty-seven soldiers suspected of having links with the JVP. In order to prevent a repetition of the 1971 uprising, the government considered lifting the ban on the JVP in early 1988 and permitting the group to participate again in the political arena. With Wijeweera still underground, however, the JVP had no clear leadership at the time, and it was uncertain whether it had the cohesion to mount any coordinated offensive, either military or political, against the government. Republic (1972‚Äì2009) Under Bandaranaike the country became a republic, the Free Sovereign and Independent Republic of Sri Lanka,K. M. de Silva, History of Sri Lanka, Penguin 1995, ch. 37 the Senate was abolished and Sinhala was established as the official language (with Tamil as a second language). Full independence came as the last remaining constitutional ties with the United Kingdom were broken (e.g., the right of appeal to the United Kingdom's Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ceased, thus establishing the Supreme Court as the country's ultimate court of appeal). Colonial plantations were nationalised to fulfil the election pledges of the Marxist program and to \\"prevent the ongoing dis- investment by the owning companies\\". The Socialist republic of Sri Lanka is established on 22 May 1972. By 1977, the voters were tired of Bandaranaike's socialist policies and elections returned the UNP to power under Junius Jayewardene, on a manifesto pledging a market economy and \\"a free ration of 8 seers (kilograms) of cereals\\". The SLFP and the left-wing parties were virtually wiped out in Parliament, although they garnered 40% of the popular vote, leaving the Tamil United Liberation Front led by Appapillai Amirthalingam as the official opposition. This created a dangerous ethnic division in Sri Lankan politics. After coming to power, Jayewardene directed the rewriting of the constitution. The document that was produced, the new Constitution of 1978, drastically altered the nature of governance in Sri Lanka. It replaced the previous Westminster style, parliamentary government with a new presidential system modeled after France, with a powerful chief executive. The president was to be elected by direct suffrage for a six-year term and was empowered to appoint, with parliamentary approval, the prime minister and to preside over cabinet meetings. Jayewardene became the first president under the new Constitution and assumed direct control of the government machinery and party. The new regime ushered in an era that did not augur well for the SLFP. Jayewardene's UNP government accused former prime minister Bandaranaike of abusing her power while in office from 1970 to 1977. In October 1980, Bandaranaike's privilege to engage in politics was removed for a period of seven years, and the SLFP was forced to seek a new leader. After a long and divisive battle, the party chose her son, Anura. Anura Bandaranaike was soon thrust into the role of the keeper of his father's legacy, but he inherited a political party torn apart by factionalism and reduced to a minimal role in the Parliament. The 1978 Constitution included substantial concessions to Tamil sensitivities. Although TULF did not participate in framing the Constitution, it continued to sit in Parliament in the hope of negotiating a settlement to the Tamil problem. TULF also agreed to Jayewardene's proposal of an all-party conference to resolve the island's ethnic problems. Jayewardene's UNP offered other concessions in a bid to secure peace. Sinhala remained the official language and the language of administration throughout Sri Lanka, but Tamil was given a new \\"national language\\" status. Tamil was to be used in a number of administrative and educational circumstances. Jayewardene also eliminated a major Tamil grievance by abrogating the \\"standardization\\" policy of the United Front government, which had made university admission criteria for Tamils more difficult. In addition, he offered many top-level positions, including that of minister of justice, to Tamil civil servants. While TULF, in conjunction with the UNP, pressed for the all-party conference, the Tamil Tigers escalated their terrorist attacks, which provoked Sinhalese backlash against Tamils and generally precluded any successful accommodation. In reaction to the assassination of a Jaffna police inspector, the Jayewardene government declared an emergency and dispatched troops, who were given an unrealistic six months to eradicate the terrorist threat. The government passed the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act in 1979. The act was enacted as a temporary measure, but it later became permanent legislation. The International Commission of Jurists, Amnesty International, and other human rights organizations condemned the act as being incompatible with democratic traditions. Despite the act, the number of terrorist acts increased. Guerrillas began to hit targets of high symbolic value such as post offices and police outposts, provoking government counterattacks. As an increasing number of civilians were caught in the fighting, Tamil support widened for the \\"boys\\", as the guerrillas began to be called. Other large, well-armed groups began to compete with LTTE. The better-known included the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam, Tamil Eelam Liberation Army, and the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization. Each of these groups had forces measured in the hundreds if not thousands. The government claimed that many of the terrorists were operating from training camps in India's Tamil Nadu State. The Indian government repeatedly denied this claim. With the level of violence mounting, the possibility of negotiation became increasingly distant. An attempt was made at economic independence, with a five-year plan to achieve industrial development. However, this was stymied by a shortage of foreign exchange, a very expensive welfare program, and the oil crisis of 1974. These, combined with an unprecedented drought severely affected the harvest of rice, the staple food of the people. Strides were made in the fields of heavy industry, automotive parts and electronics. The strongly centralized economy, functioning via a set of state corporations, grew very sluggishly. In 1971 a group variously labelled Maoist or Guevarist, the People's Liberation Front (JVP) launched a rebellion. It was led by Rohana Wijeweera, a marxist who had his education at the Lumumba University in the Soviet Union. This movement was not connected with the traditional Sri Lankan Marxist parties which were then in power. Most of the \\"insurgents\\" were unemployed literate youth who were the product of the post-independence population explosion. Although the JVP rebellion was brutally suppressed, the JVP found a place in Sri Lankan politics as a voice of leftist Sinhalese nationalism, along with the right- wing movement in the UNP associated with Cyril Matthew. Militant Tamil Chauvinist movements, e.g., the Pulippadai (tiger army), had been launched in Trincomalee in 1965. The Jaffna university was \\"ethnically cleansed\\" of non- Tamils in 1976, and the city itself began to be subject to similar \\"ethnic cleansing\\", eliminating Muslim and Sinhala residents. The extreme-Tamil groups rejected and physically eliminated the main Colombo-Tamil leadership of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF). Tamil public servants or members of parliament working with the government were harassed. The mayor of Jaffna was assassinated in 1975. The militants claimed their independence, their rights, and their \\"traditional homeland\\",K.M. de Silva, Conflict and Violence in South Asia, p.384 ICES, 2004 and formed armed separatist groups such as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ('Tamil Tigers'), demanding an independent Tamil state called Eelam. Much of this had the implicit and material support of politicians in India.R. Gunaratna, International Regional Security Implications of the Sri Lankan Tamil Insurgency, 1997M. R. Singer, Asian Survey 32, part II, p 168 1991 New constitution By 1977 the voters were tired of Bandaranaike's socialist policies and elections returned the UNP to power under Junius Jayewardene on a manifesto pledging a market economy and \\"a free ration of 8 seers (kilograms) of cereals\\". The SLFP and the left-wing parties were virtually wiped out in Parliament (although they garnered 40% of the popular vote), leaving the Tamil United Liberation Front, led by Appapillai Amirthalingam, as the official opposition. This created a dangerous ethnic cleavage in Sri Lankan politics. Bandaranaike had her civic rights removed by an act of Parliament. In 1978 Jayewardene introduced a new constitution making Sri Lanka a presidential 'Democratic Socialist' republic, with himself as executive President . In 1980 he crushed a general strike by the trade-union movement, jailing its leaders. When the UNP member for the parliamentary constituency of Kalawana was removed on an election petition by his Communist opponent, Jayawardene allowed him to continue sitting in the house . In 1977, Colombo abandoned state controlled economic policies and its import substitution trade policy for market-oriented policies and export- oriented trade. This included the opening of free-trade zones with a heavy emphasis on exports of garments from these zones. Elections to District Councils in 1981 were marred by the open theft of ballot boxes in Jaffna. The Jaffna Library, the repository of thousands of valuable documents was burned down by thugs alleged to be linked with the government. President Jayawardene had the constitution amended (one of 13 amendments during his 10 years in office) to allow presidential elections to be held early, in 1982. The main opposition candidate, Hector Kobbekaduwa was garlanded with onions by the farmers of the Jaffna peninsular, impoverished by the policy of unrestricted imports. The Presidential election, held amidst widespread acts of electoral malpractice (Hector Kobbekaduwa arrived at the polling station only to find his vote had already been cast) resulted in Jayawardene's re-election. He followed this with an infamous plebiscite on postponing parliamentary elections for six years. Associates of Kobbekaduwa, such as TB Ilangaratne and Vijaya Kumaratunga, were jailed as 'Naxalites', a political creed unheard of in Sri Lanka, before or since. The Commissioner of Elections, in his report on the referendum, reported that it was flawed. In 1983 following a demonstration against the US establishment of a military base in Diego Garcia, former MP Vivienne Goonewardena was physically assaulted at a police station. Her fundamental rights application in this matter was upheld by the Supreme Court in an act of judicial independence . Following this, thugs stoned the houses of the Supreme Court judges who had made the ruling and the police officer who had been convicted had his fine paid by the government and received a promotion. Civil war (1983 to 2009) In July 1983 communal riots took place due to the ambush and killing of 13 Sri Lankan Army soldiers by the Tamil Tigers. Using the voters list which contained the exact addresses of Tamils, the Tamil community faced a backlash from Sinhalese rioters including the destruction of shops, homes and savage beatings. However, quite a few Sinhalese kept Tamil neighbours in their homes to protect them from the rioters. During these riots the government did nothing to control the mob. Conservative government estimates put the death toll at 400 , while the real death toll is believed to be around 3000 . Also around 18,000 Tamil homes and 5,000 homes were destroyed, with 150,000 leaving the country resulting in a Tamil Diaspora in Canada, UK, Australia and other western countries. Jayewardene held office until 1989, ruling as a virtual dictator under emergency powers. In 1987, following an army offensive in the Vadamarachchi peninsular, India started getting deeply involved in the ethnic conflict. A convoy sent by India was stopped in Sri Lankan waters by the Sri Lankan Navy and the Indian Air Force retaliated with an air drop of supplies onto the Jaffna peninsula. While the UNP organised street protests against India, Jayawardene declared that he would defend the country's independence to the last bullet. However, the air drop also caused Jayawardene to reconsider his position and he then accepted the offer of Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of a Peace Accord. Rajiv Gandhi's offer to send troops into Sri Lanka was deeply unpopular with the Sinhalese and, although initially popular with the Tamils, led to an outbreak of hostilities between the Tamil Tigers and the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) ‚Äì Eelam War II. In 1989 Jayewardene was succeeded by his own choice as President, Ranasinghe Premadasa, who asked for the Indian troops to be withdrawn ‚Äì which was later done by Indian Prime Minister V.P. Singh. Premadasa was assassinated by a Tamil Tiger suicide bomber in 1993. Rajiv Gandhi had already met a similar fate (assassinated by a Tamil Tiger ) in 1991. Premadasa was succeeded by Dingiri Banda Wijetunga, with Ranil Wickremasinghe as Prime Minister. In August 1994 the People's Alliance under Bandaranaike's daughter Chandrika Kumaratunga won legislative elections on a platform of concessions to the Tamils and a 'balanced economy'. Kumaratunga became Prime Minister and in November she was elected President, appointing her 78-year-old (but still active) mother Prime Minister. A ceasefire ensued, which broke down by the Tamil tigers after several months ‚Äì the beginning of Eelam War III. Under the Bandaranaikes the war dragged on, with the military unable to defeat the separatists and the government opposed to negotiations. By 2000 an estimated 65,000 people had been killed in the conflict. At Presidential elections in 1999, former Prime Minister Wickremesinghe of the UNP contested on a platform of no concessions to the Tamils, but was defeated by Kumaratunga. A 180-degree turn in UNP policy occurred and in December 2001 the UNP returned to office on a policy of a negotiated settlement with the Tigers, with Wickremasinghe as Prime Minister. A cease fire began, the first long cessation of hostilities since the beginning of the conflict. But the 1978 constitution left the Prime Minister with little power against a hostile President. In March 2004 she dismissed Wickremesinghe and called fresh elections, which returned the SLFP to office under Mahinda Rajapakse. By 2005 there had been no further progress towards either a military or political solution. The assassination of Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar in August 2005, by the LTTE (although they denied responsibility), further hardened attitudes. His successor was Anura Bandaranaike, the President's brother and putative political heir. Twenty years of civil conflict had done immense damage to Sri Lankan society and the economy, which has fallen behind other Asian economies, although it remains the second most prosperous nation in South Asia. In elections held on 17 November 2005 Mahinda Rajapakse was elected President after defeating Ranil Wickremasinghe by a mere 180,000 votes. He appointed Ratnasiri Wickremanayake Prime Minister and Mangala Samaraweera Foreign Minister. Negotiations with the LTTE stalled and low-intensity conflict began. The violence dipped off after talks in February, but escalated in April and the conflict continued until the military defeat of the LTTE in May 2009. ;Defeat of the LTTE The Sri Lankan government declared total victory on Monday, 18 May 2009. On 19 May 2009, the Sri Lankan military effectively concluded its 26-year operation against the LTTE. Its military forces recaptured all remaining LTTE controlled territories in the Northern Province, including notably Killinochchi (2 January), the Elephant Pass (9 January) and ultimately the entire district of Mullaitivu. The 58 Division of the Sri Lankan Army led by Brig. Shavendra Silva, 59 Division led by Brig. Prasanna de Silva and the 53 Division commanded by Gen. Kamal Gunaratne, after having boxed in the remaining LTTE cadres into a small area of territory near Nandhikkadal lagoon, linked up and eliminated the remaining cadres. This final battle claimed the lives of several top LTTE leaders and Velupillai Prabhakaran who was reported to have attempted to flee. On the morning of the 19th, soldiers of the 4th Vijayabahu infantry regiment led by Lt. Col Rohitha Aluvihare claimed to have found the body of Prabhakaran, and so militarily ending a separatist war that had defined Sri Lanka's history for three decades. On 22 May 2009, Sri Lankan Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa confirmed that 6,261 personnel of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces had lost their lives and 29,551 were wounded during Eelam War IV since July 2006. Brig. Udaya Nanayakkara added that approximately 22,000 LTTE cadres had died during this time. Later the LTTE admitted Prabhakaran's death and accepted defeat. During this final phase of the conflict many non- governmental organizations expressed serious concerns about the ultra- aggressive government and LTTE tactics. Many claims have been made of the gross negligence of human rights at the internment camps for refugees. During the conflict, makeshift hospitals and refugee areas were shelled and destroyed although it was not entirely clear who was responsible for the shelling.Civilians 'die in Lanka shelling'- http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7845311.stm UN officials and Media representatives from other countries were sent to undertake investigations into the conflict. The Times newspaper of the UK accused the government of a massacre on the coastline of a refugee camp caught between the fire.The hidden massacre: Sri Lanka‚Äôs final offensive against Tamil Tigers ‚Äì http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6383449.ece This raised the estimate of deaths to 20, 000, many times that of the official figures released by the government. Furthermore, it was uncovered that the Sri Lankan Government was receiving arms and munitions as well as several fighter planes from the Chinese government in exchange for a Chinese naval base to be built on the Sri Lankan coast. This is a move by Beijing to cement a stronger position in the geopolitical struggle for power over the energy trade routes along the Indian Ocean.Sri Lanka's crucial role in Indian Ocean power struggle ‚Äì http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6401262.ece Post- conflict (2009‚Äìpresent) Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa Sri Lankan government declaration of total victory on 16 May 2009 marked the end of the 26-year-long civil war. President Mahinda Rajapaksa, while attending the G11 summit in Jordan, addressed the summit stating \\"my government, with the total commitment of our armed forces, has in an unprecedented humanitarian operation finally defeated the LTTE militarily\\". However the fighting continued for a couple of days thereafter. On the same day, Sri Lankan troops killed 70 rebels attempting to escape by boat, as the last LTTE strongpoints crumbled. The whereabouts of LTTE leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran and other major rebel leaders were not certain at the time. On 17 May 2009, Selvarasa Pathmanathan, the LTTE chief of international relations, admit the organization's defeat stating \\"This battle has reached its bitter end ... We have decided to silence our guns. Our only regrets are for the lives lost and that we could not hold out for longer\\". On May 18, 2009 Velupillai Prabhakaran was erroneously claimed to be killed by the Sri Lankan armed forces. It was claimed that on the morning of that day, he was killed by gunfire, while trying to escape the conflict zone in an ambulance with his closest aides. State television announced that the military had surrounded Prabhakaran in a tiny patch of jungle in the north-east. The Daily Telegraph wrote that, according to Sri Lankan TV, Prabhakaran was \\"... killed in a rocket-propelled grenade attack as he tried to escape the war zone in an Ambulance. Colonel Soosai, the leader of his \\"Sea Tigers\\" navy, and Pottu Amman, his intelligence chief were also killed in the attack.\\" 19 May 2009 saw President Mahinda Rajapaksa giving a victory speech to the Parliament and declared that Sri Lanka is liberated from terrorism. Around 9:30 a.m., the same day, troops attached to Task Force VIII of Sri Lanka Army, reported to its commander, Colonel G.V. Ravipriya that a body similar to Velupillai Prabhakaran has been found among the mangroves in Nandikadal lagoon. Commander of the Army Sarath Fonseka Sarath Fonseka officially announced Prabhakaran's death on the State television ITN. Later, his body was shown on Swarnavahini for the first time, while the identity was confirmed by Karuna Amman, his former confidant. DNA tests against his son, who had been killed earlier by the Sri Lanka Military, also confirmed the death. Prabakaran's identity was However, contradicting the government claims, Selvarasa Pathmanathan on the same day claimed that \\"Our beloved leader is alive and safe.\\" But finally on the 24 May 2009, he admitted the death of Prabhakaran, retracting the previous statement. The Sri Lankan military effectively concluded its 26-year operation against the LTTE, its military forces recaptured all remaining LTTE controlled territories in the Northern Province. On 22 May 2009, Sri Lankan Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa confirmed that 6,261 personnel of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces had lost their lives and 29,551 were wounded during the Eelam War IV since July 2006. Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara added that approximately 22,000 LTTE fighters had died during this time. The war caused the death of 80 000-100 000 civilians. There are allegations that war crimes were committed by the Sri Lankan military and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers) during the Sri Lankan Civil War, particularly during the final months of the Eelam War IV phase in 2009. The alleged war crimes include attacks on civilians and civilian buildings by both sides; executions of combatants and prisoners by both sides; enforced disappearances by the Sri Lankan military and paramilitary groups backed by them; acute shortages of food, medicine, and clean water for civilians trapped in the war zone; and child recruitment by the Tamil Tigers. The Sri Lankan civil war cost the lives of an estimated 80,000‚Äì100,000 people. This included more than 23,327 Sri Lankan soldiers and policemen, 1,155 Indian soldiers and 27,639 Tamil fighters. The numbers were confirmed by Secretary of Defence Ministry Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in an interview with state television on 22 May 2009. 23,790 Sri Lankan military personnel were killed since 1981 (it was not specified if police or other non-armed forces personnel were included in this particular figure). From the August 2006 recapture of the Mavil Aru reservoir until the formal declaration of the cessation of hostilities (on May 18), 6261 Sri Lankan soldiers were killed and 29,551 were wounded. The Sri Lankan military estimates that up to 22,000 LTTE militants were killed in the last three years of the conflict. While Gotabhaya Rajapaksa confirmed that 6,261 personnel of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces had lost their lives and 29,551 were wounded during the Eelam War IV since July 2006. Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara added that approximately 22,000 LTTE fighters had died during this time. Following the LTTE's defeat, Tamil National Alliance, the largest political party in Sri Lanka dropped its demand for a separate state, in favour of a federal solution. Sri Lanka, emerging after a 26-year war, has become one of the fastest growing economies of the world. Presidential elections were completed in January 2010. Mahinda Rajapaksa won the elections with 59% of the votes, defeating General Sarath Fonseka who was the united opposition candidate. Fonseka was subsequently arrested and convicted by court martial. Under Mahinda Rajapaksa large infrastructure projects and Mega projects such as the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port were carried out. Large hydro power projects as well as coal powered power plants like the Sampur and Norocholai Power Stations and Sustainable power stations such as the Hambantota Solar Power Station were also built to supply the rising need for power in the country. By 2010 Sri Lanka's poverty rate was 8.9% while it was 15.2% in 2006. Sri Lanka also made it into the \\"high\\" category of the Human Development Index during this time. However, the government came under fierce criticism for corruption and Sri Lanka ranked 79 from among 174 countries in the Transparency International corruption index. Several International bodies including UNROW Human Rights Impact Litigation Clinic, Human Rights Watch and Permanent People's Tribunal have raised allegations on the Sri Lankan Government for genocide against Tamils. In December 10, 2013, Permanent People's Tribunal unanimously ruled Sri Lanka guilty of the crime of genocide against the Tamil people. National government In 2014 November Mahinda Rajapksa called for early elections as signs of declining public support started to appear. Taking the chance the General Secretary of the ruling Sri Lanka Freedom Party and Health minister Maithripala Sirisena defected and said he would contest President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the upcoming presidential election. He was backed by the former president Chandrika Kumaratunga, UNP and its leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, Jathika Hela Urumaya as well as Sarath Fonseka. In his speech he promised to end Thuggery, embezzlement, crime, drug mafia, nepotism and corruption. The largest Muslim party of Sri Lanka also left the government and joined Maithripala In 2015 Sri Lankan presidential election in January Maithripala won the election with 51.28% of the votes and took oath as president. He removed politically appointed officials such as the Chief of Justice Mohan Peiris and launched a major anti-corruption campaign In January 2015 presidential elections Mahinda Rajapaksa was defeated by the common candidate Maithripala Sirisena and Rajapaksa's attempted return was thwarted in the parliamentary election the same year by Ranil Wickremesinghe This resulted in a unity government between the UNP and SLFP During Sri Lanka's 68th national independence day celebrations on 4 February 2016, the Tamil version of the national anthem \\"Sri Lanka Matha\\" was sung for the first time since 1949 at an official government event, the independence day celebrations. Lifting of the unofficial ban on the Tamil version had been approved by President Maithripala Sirisena (who had said he would unite the nation after the nearly 26-year civil war that ended in 2009) and by others in the government. This step was viewed as part of the plan for reconciliation. Other steps are also being taken to mend ethnic divisions between the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minority, according to a November 2016 article in National Geographic. \\"Sri Lanka Matha\\" was also sung in the majority Sinhalese. Some groups, and Sri Lanka's former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, were opposed to the government officially allowing the Tamil version to be sung. On 21 April 2019, Easter Sunday, deadly bombings occurred at three churches and five hotels in several cities including Colombo. Later smaller explosions occurred at a housing complex and a motel, killing mainly police who had been investigating the situation and raiding suspect locations. At least 259 people were killed, including 45 foreign nationals, and over 500 were injured in the bombings. The church bombings were carried out during Easter mass in Negombo, Batticaloa and Colombo; the hotels bombed included the Shangri-La, Cinnamon Grand and Kingsbury hotels in Colombo. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, but the main group responsible for the bombings is National Thowheeth Jama'ath, a Sri Lankan terrorist organisation.

Founded in 2003 as Kabul International Academy (KIA), the International School of Kabul provided a college-prep level U.S. (English speaking) curriculum to the children of expatriate families within the international development community and to repatriated and resident Afghans. A gift from the U.S. government in the form of a USAID grant in 2005 provided the necessary fiscal support to successfully expand the school, which was then re-chartered under the name ISK. The school closed in 2015. Historical Information In 2008, ISK became the first accredited K-12 school in Afghanistan under a full five-year accreditation issued by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (MSA). Also in 2008, ISK received a twenty-year registration under the leadership of the former Minister of Education, Hanif Atmar, at a special signing ceremony conducted at the Ministry of Education. Former First Lady Laura Bush and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice both took a special interest in ISK during past visits to Kabul and met with administrative representatives of the school. ISK was founded as Kabul International Academy under Peace Bridge International by Mr. David Michael. In 2005 the U.S. based parent organization, Oasis International Schools received an operational grant from USAID and the name of the school was changed. Past Leadership * Dr. Byron Greene (Executive Director 2005-2009) * Mr. John F. Brown (Executive Director, 2009-2012) * Mr. Robert Newman (Executive Director, 2013-2014) * Mr. Jay Silvas (Executive Director, 2015) Special Programs In addition to academics, ISK offered athletics and a full performing arts program to include music, drama, and dance. ISK served as the host site and parent organization for the Kabul Dance Studio. ISK has also represented Afghanistan with the Model United Nations (MUN) program for the past four years at Georgetown University in Qatar. Major Accomplishments * During its twelve years of operation, ISK contributed to the educational development of more than 3700 Afghan Students and celebrated the secondary graduation of 127 High School Students. * ISK graduates experienced an overall college placement success of 85.8%. * A cumulative total of 3.4 million classroom contact hours were provided by certified teachers. * More than 370 expatriate faculty and staff members contributed to the success and operation of ISK. Historic Activities In 2009 ISK participated in a collaborative international writing program with Diamond Valley College near Kinglake, Australia. As a result of this project twenty-nine ISK students were published in a book titled, \\"1000 Pencils: From Kinglake to Kabul.\\" This project was the result of a combined efforts of Australian-based authors David J Williams and Neil Grant. The book has been released in a 2nd edition under the title, \\"From Kinglake to Kabul\\" and is available through commercial sources. Also in 2010, ISK hosted actress and Grammy Award-winning singer Natalie Cole along with director/actress Sonia Nassery Cole for the Afghan release of the film, \\"The Black Tulip.\\" In 2011 ISK was officially recognized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the official School for all diplomatic children in Afghanistan. International students studying at ISK may enhance their ability for collegiate placement by securing a U.S. regionally accredited International AP Diploma. In 2013 ISK became the first organization to officially secure a \\"Guinness World Record\\" in Afghanistan for the Worlds Longest Paper Doll Chain. In January 2015, ISK was officially closed as a direct result of security threats against the school. Reliable threats were received as retribution for the 2014 Peshawar school massacre. The parent organization, Oasis International Schools, may be contacted for all official inquiries of a technical nature.

Some HP-41C instructions are coded in memory using multiple bytes. Some of these sequence of bytes correspond to instructions the calculator is able to execute, but these cannot be entered in the program memory using conventional program entry methods (i.e. using the calculator as described in the user's manual.) Synthetic programming uses a bug in the calculator firmware to enter those byte sequences as a sequence of other instructions, then partially skipping halfway through the first instruction, so that the calculator believes the end of the first instruction is actually the beginning of a new one. It is not clear if the creators behind the HP-41 were aware of all these \\"black holes\\". HP did not officially support these techniques, but probably was intrigued by the strange operations and in some cases allowed enthusiasts to practice in their offices and helped to improve it among a whole sense of curiosity.

The castle is located in the eastern part of the province of Gelderland, near the village of Doornenburg. It is one of the biggest and most well-preserved castles in the Netherlands. It consists of the main castle and a front castle which are connected via a small wooden bridge. The castle was originally a fortified manor built in the 9th century. At this stage, it was known as the Villa Dorenburc. It wasn't until the 13th century that it was converted into a proper castle. Gradually, through the centuries, the castle was expanded further into its current form. The front castle was built in the 15th century. It contains sleeping quarters, a chapel and a farm, the latter being quite a unique feature for a Dutch castle. Castle Doornenburg was occupied until the 19th century. After that it fell into disrepair and became a ruin. In 1936 the Stichting tot Behoud van den Doornenburg (literally: Foundation for Preservation of the Doornenburg) was created and the castle was restored between 1937 and 1941. Unfortunately, by the end of the Second World War it was almost completely destroyed. The Germans were thought to have blown it up, but it had actually been hit by a British bombardment in March 1945. The castle was completely rebuilt between 1947 and 1968. In 1968 this castle, amongst others, was used as a set for the television series Floris.

He combined Puritan views, including the need for capital punishment for adultery,Richard L. Greaves, Society and Religion in Elizabethan England (1981), p. 234. with a positive outlook on alchemy and experimental science. Life He seems to have been educated at Cambridge, possibly at Pembroke Hall, under Edmund Grindal. On 22 October 1566 he was presented to the rectory of St. Antholin, Budge Row, London, and in 1575 he became rector of Hasketon, near Woodbridge, Suffolk. He appears to have held the rectory of St. Antholin until 12 October 1592, when Nicholas Felton was appointed his successor. He secured patronage in high quarters, among those to whom his books were dedicated being Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, Charles Blount, Earl of Devonshire, Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, Archbishop Grindal, Sir Edward Coke and Sir John Puckering. He died at Hasketon in April 1620, being buried there on the 29th. Tymme married, at Hasketon, on 17 July 1615, Mary Hendy, who died in 1657, leaving one son, Thomas Tymme. William Tymme, possibly a brother of Thomas, printed many books between 1601 and 1615. Works In 1570 he published his first work, a translation from the Latin of John Brentius, entitled Newes from Niniue to Englande (London). It was followed in 1574 by the translation of Pierre de La Place supposed history of the civil wars in France, entitled 'The Three Partes of Commentaries containing the whole and perfect Discourse of the Civill Warres of France under the Raignes of Henry the Second, Frances the Second, and of Charles the Ninth' (London, 4to); prefixed is a long copy of verses in Tymme's praise by Edward Grant.

Ivan Kozarac (February 8, 1885 ‚Äì November 16, 1910) was a Croatian novelist, poet and writer of short stories. Biography Ivan Kozarac was born in Vinkovci, Croatia (then Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Austria-Hungary). He came from a peasant family that sent him to school, but he managed to finish only two classes. As a thirteen-year-old boy wanting to avoid the family poverty, he was employed as a clerical trainee in a district in Vinkovci. From 1900 until 1906, he worked as a law clerk in the office of Levin aristocracy. In 1903, Ivan suffered from tuberculosis, but he is not relieved from his military duty. In 1907, he went to the army (first in Petrovaradin, then in Karlovac). In 1909, he returned to his hometown, but in the fall of the year he went to Zagreb where he was employed as a fund manager and director of the Croatian Writers Society. In the summer of 1910, the writer and doctor Milivoj De≈æman referred him to treatment in Brestovac. However, Ivan returned home uncured and eventually died in Vinkovci at the age of 25. Works Ivan Kozarac was an active writer for only four years. In his lifetime only a single book was published; a compilation of short stories, Slavonian Blood in 1906, and his other books were released only after his death (thanks in part to the efforts of Dragutin Tadijanoviƒá). His cardinal work is the novel ƒêuka Begoviƒá, first published in 1911. The novel describes many Slavonian traditions in an almost documentary style. It has since been made into a theatrical play and a movie by Branko Schmidt. Kozarac failed to attract a particular attention to himself in his lifetime. He was a narrator of the life of typical villages of ≈†okadija during a time when the Military Frontier was freshly reintegrated into Slavonia. He wrote much about the corruption of women and fashion and took a critical stance towards the Church, the wealthy life of some priests, and the false love towards God. His love for his native Slavonia emerges from each of his works. Legacy Today a local prize for literary achievement is named after him Josip Kozarac (his uncle and also a writer).

History In 1985, a group of British optometrists and dispensing opticians each took two weeks out of their businesses to establish clinics in Tanzania, where they tested the eyes of local people and dispensed second-hand spectacles collected in UK. After the project gained publicity via the media and resultant public support, they formalised their efforts by registering the charity Vision Aid Overseas in 1987. Founded on the delivery of direct service to patient, since registering as a charity, VAO has operated direct service clinics in 23 countries and tested the eyes of over 600,000 patients, helping over 350,000 people to see with a pair of spectacles. In the 1997 New Years Honours list, founder Brian Ellis was awarded the MBE. Operations VAO today focuses it operations around three core services: *Optical Training: Establish International Vision Centres where high quality spectacles can be manufactured and sold at an affordable price following a thorough eye examination *Optical Workshop Development: Train local healthcare workers in practical eye testing and vision health skills that equips them to work as primary eyecare workers in their local communities *Direct Service Deliver: Utilize the expertise of UK optical professionals who develop outreach services in areas away from existing facilities and who undertake teaching programmes across the developing world VAO presently runs sustainable projects in five target countries: Ethiopia, Malawi, Sierra Leone, Uganda, and Zambia. Support VAO Honorary Vice Presidents include competing newsreaders Fiona Bruce of the BBC, and Sir Trevor MacDonald of ITV News. In February 2005 Bruce did the voice over for VAO's Lifeline Appeal, and in 2007 launched VAO's Annual Review. The charity has formalised its relationship with the UK eye care industry, and is often the chosen charity supported by many dispensing opticians, and professionals via the Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers, who collect old spectacles from customers for recycling via VAO. The charity gained publicity in 2005 after the death of Countdown game show host Richard Whiteley. After his death, his longtime partner Kathryn Apanowicz donated three pairs of Whiteley's spectacles to VAO, who sent them with a team of optical professionals to Ethiopia, where they were fitted to three locals with the same prescription. The BBC followed this story on their Inside Out programme, which was broadcast on 19 September 2007.

Helmuth Ellgaard was born in the then German Haderslev/Hadersleben (now in Nordslesvig, Denmark). In 1928, the family left Haderslev, which became Danish after the Schleswig Plebiscites, for Kiel. Soon, Ellgaard caught an interest in drawing and painting. He was educated at the Art academy in Kiel in 1934, while simultaneously working as a news illustrator for the Kieler Neuste Nachrichten newspaper. He also learned to sketch, and his specialty became fast sketches with charcoal. Ellgaard's coverage of the 1963 Wunder von Lengede mining rescue In 1938 he was newly wed and moved to Berlin. After the outbreak of the second world war he became a war correspondent, and as a lieutenant in the Luftwaffe he participated in many raids as a journalist, including the Battle of Britain in 1940. His works were published in the renowned weekly magazine Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung. During the war this two sons were born; Peter (1940) and Holger (1943). The war had destroyed the large publishing houses in Berlin, and new newspapers and magazines were started in Hamburg and Munich among other places. The Ellgaard family therefore moved to Munich, where Helmuth Ellgaard participated in starting the illustrated magazine Revue, which was one of the many new weekly magazines in post-war West Germany. Ellgaard worked as an employee of the editorial staff as an image editor and news illustrator. In almost every issue there were illustrations by him, from 1953 also in color. His role models were the American Norman Rockwell and the Dane Kurt Ard. In 1956 he chose to become independent, and moved with the family to Hamburg. There he illustrated books and worked for advertising agencies. However, his important work during the period 1954 to 1961 was the illustration of a large number of film posters, of which the poster from 1959 for the anti-war film \\"The Bridge\\" (Die Br√ºcke) is considered to be his most notable work. He died of a heart attack in 1980, 67 years old. In 2003, his two sons Peter and Holger Ellgaard donated a large part of his works to the Haus der Geschichte in Bonn.

Subjects of her paintings were still lifes, interiors and especially landscapes. She painted at Saint-Jean-de-Monts in Vend√©e beside Auguste Lep√®re, at Fontainebleau, Vend√¥me, Chartres, then in Paris, where she and her husband, Paul Tuffrau, a man of letters, have successively inhabited, in Gironde in the little village of Plassac, and above all in Brittany, which immediately won her heart, particularly at Le Pouldu (1924‚Äì1939), and in the region of the Pointe du Raz and the baie des Tr√©pass√©s (1937‚Äì1947). She realized oil paintings, but more and more was attracted by watercolour, more spontaneous for her. Nourished by the classicism of the Chardin of the still lifes, her painting evoke the impressionists by its luminosity, and in some works the Fauves by the technique of flat tints, and the play of colours.

They then seized the settlements of Vigo, Redondela and Pontevedra after some resistance, which they occupied for ten days destroying or capturing a vast haul of military stores before withdrawing.Francis pp 31-33 Background The Spanish involvement in the Jacobite rising of 1719 had seen Spanish troops land in Scotland where they were defeated at the Battle of Glen Shiel. A British force was prepared in retaliation with a strike against Spain. The expedition was under the overall command of Lord Cobham with the naval forces commanded by Vice Admiral James Mighels which included four ships - the 70-gun ship of the line , and three frigates - (42 guns), (36 guns) and (24 guns). There were a number of transports and bomb vessels holding 6,000 troops commanded by Major- General John Wade. The expedition was also intended to demonstrate to the Spanish that Allied forces could strike along their vulnerable coastline with ease, and was co-ordinated with a French offensive on eastern Spain, in the hope that this would force Spain to the peace table.Simms p. 141. Expedition Vigo Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham ‚Äì the British commander On 21 September the British expedition left Falmouth, and arrived at Vigo eight days later. The fleet at once entered the harbour and landed troops on a beach about three miles from the town led by the grenadiers. On 1 October, the army occupied a strong position under the walls of the San Sebasti√°n fort opposite Fort Castro situated on an eminence commanding the town and harbour. In the evening Brigadier Philip Honeywood with 800 soldiers launched an assault on San Sebasti√°n and took the Spanish defenders by surprise; they spiked their guns and withdrew to the citadel. A bomb ketch was brought up two days later; but little damage was done due to the range, so forty mortars were brought ashore from the fleet. On the 3rd and 4th several siege cannons were landed from the fleet were added to the artillery of San Sebasti√°n. On 10 October a heavy bombardment opened up the citadel ‚Äì the Spanish finding themselves outnumbered and no hope of relief decided to surrender. The full garrison composed of seven companies of the Regiment of Spain, and four of the Regiment of Valencia, commanded by Don Fadrique Gonz√°lez de Soto. Some 469 officers and men marched out and another 300 were killed or wounded in the assault and bombardment. British loss was six killed and another twenty wounded. A large quantity of guns, small arms, and ammunition were found and the stores were captured or destroyed.Black p. 117 Also intelligence from prisoners stated that this was for an invasion of England. Sixty large pieces of cannon were spiked and rendered useless in the town and in the citadel forty three artillery pieces of which fifteen were brass and two large mortars were also given the same fate. In addition seven ships were seized in the harbour, of which three were fitted out for privateers. The troops also found stores of wine and many quenched their thirst; there was some drunken disorder for three days. Cobham ordered the rest of the wine to be placed in the fleet for shipment to add to the booty. Redondela and Pontevedra On 10 October Cobham ordered Major General George Wade to embark with 1,000 soldiers and marines on board four transports to proceed to the bay of Pontevedra. Meanwhile, with Vigo secure, 2,000 troops were left to hold the place while Cobham also ordered an advance further inland. A small force came across the town of Redondela but was found undefended, with its old fort in ruins; the British burned and pillaged its stores as well. A landing was effected at Pontevedra on 14 October and the British overcame any Spanish resistance. They were able to advance through the town via the upper end of the harbour. Fort Marin which defended the town was the next obstacle and in assault was easily captured by a force of 100 Grenadiers led by John Ligonier. Resistance collapsed and Pontevedra was in British hands by the end of the day. 86 guns of various calibres were spiked, and the arsenal was burned. General Wade was able to levy a contribution of ¬£40,000 from Santiago de Compostela after threatening to advance on the place. Realising they had achieved complete success, the British commanders decided there was little point in holding the area, and enough damage had been done to impede further Spanish attempts against the British Isles. Aftermath On 24 October Cobham re embarked the army and two days later the fleet sailed for England. On 11 November, Vice-Admiral Mighells put into Falmouth with most of the transports. The booty was huge ‚Äì the total number brought home was one hundred and ninety iron and thirty brass heavy guns, with ten thousand fire arms, two thousand barrels of powder, and other stores. The expedition had been prompt and successful: it had fully attained its objective. By sickness, desertion, and combat it had lost no more than three hundred men. This caused some shock to the Spanish authorities as they realized how vulnerable they were to Allied amphibious descents, with the potential to open up a new front away from the French frontier.

E. Noffke (1878‚Äì1964) was an architect in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, best known for his residential works. His houses, some of the grandest in the city of the time, are designed in a large variety of styles, most in an eclectic style, often with Mediterranean influences. Most of his extant houses are in the Glebe neighbourhood, specifically the Clemow Development. The other major location for his residential buildings includes Sandy Hill with many others in smaller neighbourhoods around the city of Ottawa. Noffke also designed several high-profile Ottawa institutional buildings, including the Central Post Office, Blackburn Building, Hope Building and several embassies. Most of Noffke's projects are located in the greater Ottawa area, however, he has made contributions to communities all across the country. Noffke's initials stand for Werner Ernst, but his full first name is rarely used. Biography Werner Ernst Noffke was born in 1878 in the German region of Stolp, which later became part of Poland. Werner was born to steelworker Franz J. Noffke and Henrietta Shillings, in 1883, the family immigrated to Canada. He grew up in Ottawa and attended German school at St. Paul Lutheran Church located on Wilbrod Street. To further his education, he later studied applied arts at the Ottawa School of Art. During his school career, Noffke won the Ontario School of Art mechanical and architecture medals in 1894 and 1895 respectively. In contingency with his education in arts, Noffke worked at a brickyard to save enough money to earn himself an apprenticeship at the age of 14 with a local Ottawa architect, Adam Harvey. Sadly, he could not take part in any academic architectural training as there were no programs available in Canada during his early years of education. In 1896, Noffke began working in the office of Moses Chamberlain Edey as a draftsman, Edey introduced him to many of his future clients. this opportunity boosted his popularity in the Ottawa area. Before starting his career in architecture, he was an instructor at Ottawa's first Technical School, teaching architectural drawing, in 1899. Noffke, J.J. Cadville Residence, 1907 Noffke opened his own firm in 1901. During his career he experimented with many different types of architecture, he built homes, Lutheran churches, commercial buildings, schools and many government projects. Several of his structures are distinctively a Noffke build due to his love for the Spanish Colonial- Revival style, and the deep red brick of the Georgian- Revival. He was additionally known to create projects in Romanesque, Gothic Revival, Art-Deco and many other styles, his architectural palate was never limited. In the early development of his career Noffke took part in many large milestones, he served on the Governor Generals Food Guard for 14 years in 1901 to 1912 inclusively. At the GGFG Noffke was given the titles of major and armed guard of honour in 1914. He operated as the president of the Ontario Association of Architects (OAA) between 1910-1911 just a year after the association was founded. He additionally took part in the Architects Club of Ottawa and the Liberal Club. As his career evolved, he expanded his region of interest and contributed design ideas to many buildings across Ontario and all of Canada. In 1923 Noffke moved down to the United States and started up a small practice in Los Angeles, here he only worked for half a year, however, he was fortunate enough to meet Frank Lloyd Wright at his office in Taliesin before moving back to Canada in 1924. Most of Noffke‚Äôs projects were constructed in Ottawa including small towns in the greater Ottawa area, although some were erected in larger cities such as London and Toronto, and some of his schools appeared in provinces such as Saskatchewan and territories like the Yukon. During many of these projects, Noffke worked with several local Ottawa architects on a variety of different building projects but never made an official partnership with anyone until 1954. Noffke partners with fellow Lutheran, Earle Ingram, for the latter part of his career and in 1961 the partnership concluded when W.E. Noffke retired from the practice. In response, Earle Ingram moved into his mentor's old office at 46 Elgin Street and opened his own practice under the name Earle Ingram and Associates. After retiring from the business Noffke enjoyed his remaining three years in his self-designed home on Harmer Ave. where he passes away in 1964 at the age of 86. Today many of his remarkable buildings have been marked as heritage sites, which preserves his contribution to Canada for future generations to enjoy. In the workplace Noffke was depicted as a very authoritarian individual and a perfectionist, he was often very involved in checking the quality of the construction and the work of the trades on his buildings. Nevertheless, he was very rewarding to the employees who took care in their assignments and did their jobs well. In his personal life, Noffke married Ida Jordan in 1904, at the age of 27, and together they had one son by the name of W. Edgar Noffke who grew up to become an interior designer and contrubuted to a few projects of his fathers. As the Noffke family matured they lived in multiple homes designed by Noffke himself and even a family cottage that he designed on a lake north of Buckingham. Noffke owned the lake that he built his family cottage on, and he filled it with rainbow trout. He chose to name the lake, Lake Eda, after the nickname that everyone referred to his wife as. Although he was a hardworking and well-established architect in the city, he always had time for his family and time to take part in hobbies such as hunting and fishing, which drove him to join the Laurentian, Ottawa Hunt and Golf Club. Styles Spanish Colonial Revival Noffke was drawn to this style of architecture and used it very frequently on some of the residential buildings he was commissioned to build. Early in his career, Noffke took a trip to California where he learned to fall in love with this Mediterranean style. Noffke was drawn to the charm and romance associated with the style, the revival is known for its stark stucco exterior walls and warm red or orange tiled roofing. Upon his return, Noffke implemented Spanish Colonial aspects such as the Spanish colonettes, tall chimneys and small semi-enclosed porches to his projects. He adopted these characteristics to his residences for L.W. Crannell and F.X. Plaunt while he worked on the Clemow development in the current day Glebe. Noffke, St. Theresa's Catholic Church, 1944 Neoclassical Many different buildings of Noffke's from his churches, his residential to his commercial included Neoclassical references. Often a cornice would be added or references to columns would be included in his build. Some apartment designs make references to a tympanum over the entrance using their front plaque or a large glass window. His most noticeably Neoclassical build would be the Bank of Ottawa. It has now been changed and taken over by Scotiabank but when Noffke first designed the building it was built with a temple-front fa√ßade with engaged iconic columns and a large pediment. Another early build that had classical motifs was the Charles Ogilvy's Building with a cornice around the roof and Greek key-motif spandrel panels as an ornament around the structure. As his career continued the structures with classical motifs were more modern in design but still contained basic forms from the classical vocabulary such as all of his buildings designed for the Department of Mines & Resources Complex. Gothic Revival Gothic style has always been most popular in church designs. Noffke is one of many to adopt this style to his religious projects. Typically, Noffke adopts the buttressing on the sides of the nave, he includes large stain glass windows in lancet and pointed arch styles. Noffke has designed many of these Gothic revival churches all over Ontario. You can find one of his Lutheran Churches in Toronto at Trinity Evangelical Church and St. John's Lutheran Church in Pembroke. Noffke used Gothic influences in many of these church designs up until 1950 when he replaced the influence with a more contemporary point of view. Noffke has also incorporated some of these gothic elements in some of his residential structures such as the F.W.C Mohr Residence which emphasizes light in the same respect as the typical gothic structure. Georgian Revival Georgian Revival a very popular style of Canadian homes in the 19th century, the style was most commonly used in the residential builds of the new nation. As Noffke grew up in this era, the Georgian style was sure to appear in his own architecture. Just like the century before, Noffke used the Georgian Revival style in his residential architecture. Some of the most prominent projects he used the style on are the Goldberg Residence, the H. Plant Residence and his third family home on Harmer Ave. In his Georgian homes, he uses the typical deep red brick on the exterior of the residence, classical features and symmetrical fa√ßades. Noffke, J. Ambrose O'Brien's Residence, 1928 Tudor Revival The revival of the Tudor style was very popular in the 20th century during the time Noffke was producing designs, the style imitates architectural details used in rural English cottages. Common features in the Tudor style used by Noffke included vertical wood framing backed by stucco walls in contrast to earth tones throughout the rest of the structures. Noffke used the Tudor Revival style on several residential projects such as J. Ambrose O‚ÄôBrien's Residence. But also, on the Chapel of Hulse Bros. Funeral Home. Many families in the Centertown neighbourhood were Anglophones, therefore introducing this building style to one of the facilities was to evoke a sense of home away from home. Using the Tudor style in the Ottawa area was Noffke's way of connecting with the neighbourhood and making immigrants feel welcome and familiar in this new and developing country. Art Deco Art Deco is known to be a style of bold geometric shapes and decorative features that mimic more exotic styles. It can be considered a more modern style as it has often been used for many building structures that were new to the 20th century, such as skyscrapers. Even before Art Deco was of style it was said that Noffke design for the Entrance and Ticket Office of the CCEA in 1914 share some of these decorative ideas. Noffke returns to these aspects when Art Deco becomes more popular in the architectural world. He uses these geometric shapes in the structure and ornamentation as well as references to the Egyptian ziggurats. This style appears in many of his most popular structures in the downtown Ottawa core including the Medical Arts Building and the Central Post Office. He also adopts the style to some of his residential designs including the Mohr Residence now used as an Embassy. Modernism Shift/International Style When Noffke swapped out the Gothic influence in his church projects he replaced it with a more contemporary approach. This included the international style, he made this most evident in his work on Our Saviour Lutheran Church, where he uses the same geometric massing as the popular style of the century. The church also has a patterned screen instead of stained-glass windows to make the building cheaper and more modern. Crane Ltd. Warehouse is an example of an industrial project that Noffke worked on in a more contemporary style with its large glass walls and sever geometric shape. Noffke became interested in the modern movement when he went on his trip to California while visiting he interacted with a number of buildings by Irving Gill and borrowed his horizontal massing and clean lines for his design on the C.W. Bangs Residence. Associations Northwood Northwood was the firm individual to partner with Noffke after the development of Noffke's own firm in 1901. Northwood joined Noffke the following year for a brief period of time. Together the two worked on the Fat Stock Building (1905) and the Bank of Ottawa (1906) in the city of Ottawa. In 1905 Northwood took off to Winnipeg where he worked alongside Noffke and one other individual, in this arrangement they managed clients in both cities with Noffke staying back in Ottawa and the other two working in Winnipeg together, this collaboration lasted only a year before Northwood was quick to move on to new opportunities. Northwood joined partnership with a few other individuals in Winnipeg for the next 10 or so years. In 1915 Northwood enlisted in WW1 efforts and was sent overseas. During his time in battle, he was captured as a prisoner of war by the Germans for three years. Following this horrific incident, he was released and returned home where he continued to practice architecture back in Winnipeg. Noffke, Immaculata High School, 1929 Morin and Sylvester Noffke worked solo for a few years between his partnership with Northwood, in 1922 he was joined by Morin and Sylvester. [8] Together the three partners worked on building projects such as the Ottawa General Hospital (1927) and Immaculata High School (1929) along with many others. Just 10 years following the start of the partnership Morin was dropped from the firm. Due to a lack of business, Morin was let go and started his own firm after changing his name to Moran, he worked closely with Fred Taylor for a few years before deciding to work on his own. Sylvester Before the initial partnership with Noffke, Morin and Sylvester. Sylvester worked under Noffke between the years of 1909-1914 as a junior draftsman. This time spent with the architect allowed him to score the opportunity to work in a partnership when he finished his training and became a full-time architect himself. After Morin was let go from the partnership Noffke and Sylvester continued to work together until 1935, at this time Sylvester decided to go off on his own and make a name for himself individually. Ingram Just like many other partners before him, Ingram worked as a draughtsman in the office of Noffke. Succeeding this experience, he officially partnered with Noffke in 1954, during this term they collaborated on projects such as the reconstruction of the Embassy of the USSR (1956-57) and the renovation of the former Mortimer Building (1957). Noffke retired from the practice in 1961, leaving Ingram to head a mainstream Practice, under the name of Earle Ingram and Associates, that produced well- designed schools, churches, healthcare facilities, and municipal buildings in a contemporary style. His churches were considerably more traditional and cautious, with distinct avoidance of parabolic swoops or dramatic silhouettes characteristic to many churches of that time.https://www.prty.ca/history Ingram and Pye Ingram practices on his own for 3 years until 1964. Brian Pye joined Earle Ingram to form Ingram and Pye Architects, the firm designed different churches, office buildings, and schools. They are most recognized for their work on Renfrew Presbyterian Church (1965) and Carleton County Jail (1969) they worked together until the retirement of Ingram in 1973. Pye continued the Practice alone until 1977. Noffke, Blackburn Building, 1913 Pye and Richards Idwal Richards joined the partnership to create Pye and Richards Architects in the year 1977. The firm designed many different buildings types throughout Ottawa and its greater area. The firm provides many architectural services including pre-design programming, space planning, building design, project management, and interior design. Pye and Richards just like their predecessors work with clients for public and private spaces, and institutions, in addition, they work with the federal, and provincial governments. Pye continued to practice with Richards until 1994 when he chose to retire. The firm continued under this name until 2019 when it was merged with its most recent partner. Pye and Richards - Temprano and Young Architects In 2019 the Pye and Richards were joined with Temprano & Young when Eliseo Temprano created the partnership. The firm today operated under the name Pye & Richards - Temprano & Young (PR-TY), continuing the legacy of the 120-year-old lineage. Currently, PR-TY has a very large scope of projects from commercial to residential with some of their most major ongoing projects in the religious sector and with the school board. One of the goals of the current firm is to bring more awareness to the long history of the firm and how its predecessor firms shaped the Ottawa community and other locations around Ontario.

He was born into a prominent family in the colony of New Sweden. Early life Sven Svensson was born in 1636 in Sweden to Sven Gunnarsson, a forefather of the colony of New Sweden. His father was sent by the Swedish government to help form the Swedish colony. The family left in 1639 from G√∂teborg on board the Kalmar Nyckel, eventually arriving at Swedes' Landing in present-day Delaware. Later life Sven Svensson would become a Justice in the Upland Court. The Upland Court was dissolved by William Penn in 1683 under the Charter of Pennsylvania. He subsequently served a term as a representative in the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly. In the spring of 1683, Svensson and his brothers agreed to provide the northern part of Wicaco (modern Southwark in Philadelphia) to William Penn, who was planning the city of Philadelphia. They were left with 230 acres apiece. The site of Gloria Dei (Old Swedes') Church had previously been donated by Sven Gunnarsson in 1677.

Early life Pember was born in 1835 into a wealthy family, the third child and second son of a stockbroker.U.K. Census of 1851; record H.O. 107/1576 He grew up in the Brixton Hill and Clapham Park suburbs of London. Educated at home, he did not attend university.Pember's obituary in the local newspaper, which must have relied in great part on his own recounting of his life story, claimed that he was a graduate of the University of Oxford; yet records of Oxford alumni note only the attendance of Arthur's elder brother Edward at Christ Church College between 1850 and 1854: see In 1857, he joined his father working as a stockbroker in the City of London. In March 1860, he married Elizabeth Hoghton. The newly-married couple moved to their own house in Carlton Road, Maida Vale, but Elizabeth died of complications of a miscarriage in December of that same year. Pember remarried in October 1862 to Alice Mary Grieve. Sportsman Football It was around this time that Pember became associated with N.N. Football Club, which played on fields opposite his house. Both Arthur and his younger brother George are recorded playing for N.N. in a victory over Barnes F.C. in April 1863. Pember represented N.N. as club captain at the first meeting of the Football Association (FA) on 26 October 1863. This meeting began with Pember being \\"requested to take the chair\\", and ended with him being formally elected the Association's first president.According to C. W. Alcock, Pember was \\"the moving formation\\" in the formation of the FA: Creation of the FA's 1863 Laws At this time, some football clubs followed the example of Rugby School by allowing the ball to be carried in the hands, with players allowed to \\"hack\\" (kick in the shins) opponents who were carrying the ball. Other clubs forbade both practices. During the meetings to draw up the FA laws, there was an acrimonious division between the \\"hacking\\" and \\"non-hacking\\" clubs, with Pember being \\"dead against\\" hacking. An FA meeting of 17 November 1863 discussed this question, with the \\"hacking\\" clubs predominating.Harvey (2005), pp. 135‚Äì139 A further meeting was scheduled in order to finalize (\\"settle\\") the laws. At this crucial 24 November meeting, the \\"hackers\\" were again in a narrow majority. During the meeting, however, FA secretary Ebenezer Morley brought the delegates' attention to a recently published set of football laws from Cambridge University which banned carrying and hacking. Discussion of the Cambridge rules, and suggestions for possible communication with Cambridge on the subject, served to delay the final \\"settlement\\" of the laws to a further meeting, on 1 December. A number of representatives who supported rugby-style football did not attend this additional meeting,Harvey (2005), pp. 144-145 resulting in hacking and carrying being banned. Francis Campbell of Blackheath, the most prominent \\"hacking\\" club, accused Pember of improperly managing the 24 November meeting, with the purpose of preventing the \\"pro- hacking\\" laws from being adopted. Pember strongly denied such an \\"accusation of ungentlemanly conduct\\". The verdicts of later historians have been mixed: Young accuses Campbell of \\"arrogance\\", while Harvey supports Campbell's allegations, accusing Pember (along with Morley and their allies) of a \\"coup\\" against the pro-hacking clubs.Harvey (2005), p. 144 The final version of the FA's laws was formally adopted and published in December 1863. On 2 January 1864, Pember led his \\"President's Side\\" to victory over the \\"Secretary's Side\\" in a friendly match at Battersea Park to test out the new laws. Subsequent activity as FA President In February 1866, Pember chaired the FA meeting that created the second edition of the Laws of the Game. The original 1863 laws had permitted a goal to be scored at any height between two posts eight yards apart. Pember urged that a tape be strung between the posts, with a goal counting only if the ball went below the tape. The meeting agreed to make this change, setting the height of the tape at 8 feet. The dimensions of the goal have remained the same ever since, with the tape subsequently replaced by a crossbar. Pember also \\"strongly objected\\" to the practice of striking the ball with the hands, at that time allowed by the FA laws, saying that it was \\"not football, as the game had to be played with the feet, and not with the hands\\": \\"knocking on\\" was subsequently outlawed in 1867. At the same meeting, Pember accepted an invitation from Sheffield FC to a match under Association rules, and captained the victorious London team in the ensuing London v Sheffield match, played in March 1866. Pember also played for Wanderers F.C. in November 1866. Pember was twice re-elected FA President, in October 1864 and February 1866. At its next annual meeting in February 1867, which Pember did not attend, the FA elected Morley to replace him as president. Pember's name is absent from records of subsequent FA annual meetings.e.g. Mountaineering In addition to being a footballer, Pember was a keen outdoorsman. He successfully climbed Mont Blanc in August 1863, and would go on to describe his experience on the mountain in public lectures.e.g. Journalist As part of his journalism work, Pember would adopt disguises, here as a beggar In 1868, Pember emigrated with his wife and two sons to New York, where he started a new career as a journalist. Working initially for the New York Tribune, Pember investigated crime and corruption in New York City. In 1871, along with colleague Edward Breck, he published an expos√© of so- called \\"panel-houses\\" (\\"places for robbery, most ingeniously prepared and carried on under the guise of prostitution\\"), in which he named both the owners of the establishments and the police officers who were bribed to permit their crimes to continue.\\"Gambling and Panel Houses\\" (1871) Pember's aggressive journalistic style was described as \\"attack[ing] the specialty of abuses like a terrier after rats, hesitating at no sort of a hole or vileness of vermin\\". In 1871 and 1872, Pember contributed to a lengthy series of articles in The New York Times on \\"Our State Institutions\\".For example, He followed this up in 1872 and 1873 with a series of The New York Times articles exploring \\"how the other half lives\\", for which the author assumed several disguises including beggar and circus performer. These articles were collected and edited, with substantial additional material, into Pember's 1874 book The Mysteries and Miseries of the Great Metropolis. In 1875, Pember appeared before a New York state legislative crime committee in order to testify about the police collusion he had discovered in 1871. Later life After having given birth to ten children in 14 years, Pember's wife Alice died of typhoid in 1881 at the age of 36. In May 1884, Pember moved with his five sons from New York to LaMoure, Dakota Territory, in order to become a stock farmer. According to one account, he \\"was told by his doctor one day that if he did not cease pumping his brains into a daily paper, his heart would soon stop pumping blood into his brains\\". According to his obituary, on the other hand, the motivation for the move was to \\"transfer his boys from the temptations of the city to the country\\". An 1885 newspaper article reported that Pember was writing a book entitled \\"Twenty Years In New York Journalism\\". Death On the morning of 3 April 1886, Pember died in his residence at LaMoure. The cause of death was a kidney disorder. A substantial obituary appeared in the local newspaper. Its anonymous author remembered Pember as a \\"welcome addition to the little gatherings ... which serve to relieve the tedium of village life\\", praising his \\"superior intelligence\\", \\"racy reminiscences of journalistic life\\" and \\"pungent comments on current events\\". The article explored Pember's education in England and journalistic career in New York in some detail, but said nothing about football. Descendants Pember had ten children with his wife Alice, of whom six survived infancy. His English-born daughter Lillian (b. London 1866; d. London 1925) was adopted by his brother Edward and remained in that country; his two English-born sons Cyril Fugion (b. London 1865; d. New York 1936) and St. John Bentley (b. London 1867; d. St. Paul, MN 1888) emigrated with their parents to New York in 1868. His three American-born sons who survived infancy were Roosa Herbert (b. Connecticut 1869; 3 children), Gilbert Edward (b. New York 1876; d. Pennsylvania 1934) and Godfrey Churchill (b. New York 1879; d. Poughkeepsie, NY 1970; 4 children). His four children who died in infancy were twin daughters Mabel (d. 27 July 1875) and Alice Richardson (d. 30 July 1875), and sons Valentine (d. 18 July 1874) and Geoffrey Francis (d. 21 July 1872).

In 1940 his family moved to Budapest where his father received health treatments.

After the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, he fled to Italy. There, in Milan, he was commissioned for a series of advertisement illustrations and posters until, in 1960, he entered the Mondadori publisher with which he collaborated for 32 years. Pinter realized numerous covers for Mondadori books and magazines, such as Segretissimo (a spy stories series, 14 covers), as well as Maigret and Agatha Christie translations and for Oscar Mondadori (the most sold Italian pocket series).

Based at Tel Nof, Manat comprises a flight section, including test pilots and flight testing engineers, a technical section charged with aircraft maintenance, an avionics section, and a UAV section operating from Palmachim. The squadron operates a fully instrumented example of every Israeli Air Force frontline combat aircraft type on strength at any time. It also operates a number of UAVs and will utilize helicopter and transport types from other squadrons when necessary. Among the aircraft currently operated by Manat are three F-16 Fighting Falcons, representing the different variants of the aircraft in service: F-16D Block 30 #020, F-16D Block 40 #601 and F-16I Block 52+ #401. F-16D #601, designated CK-1, was designed by Lockheed to meet specific flight test requirements. Another aircraft operated by the squadron is F-15I #201 (94-0286), the very first F-15I built.

In 1653, he was one of 22 signers of a petition of grievances against Gov. Johan Printz, which ultimately led to his removal. He volunteered to defend Fort Christina against the Dutch invasion, but after the colony was surrendered, removed with his family north. They settled on at a place called Wicaco, a former Indian settlement, which would become what is modern-day Queen Village in Philadelphia.

The band were linked with Pop Star Jason Orange during 1996 who mentored and assisted them after the split of Take That. Often King Kong gigs in the city would be followed by the local media who had a keen interest in Orange's next career move. The Manchester Evening News would report the fact that Orange was attending a King Kong gig rather than focusing on the band themselves, much to the annoyance of the musicians. King Kong were musically different from their Manchester indie peers of the time, opting for a more rocky, funky sound driven by fluid basslines and heavy guitar hooks. The band's songs were written by Jackson and Chan, some formulating from extended jam sessions. The two had played together with Allen in numerous bands preceding King Kong. They attracted a firm loyal support at local gigs, hosted a monthly gig at the Attic Club on Oxford Road, as well as playing Manchester's many other venues. They headlined \\"Rock on the Quays\\" - the opening celebrations of the building of the now famous Lowry centre and development. The band recorded two self-financed EP's both containing four songs. But they were more notable for their energetic live shows, where the combination of the two singers styles and Rock fueled riffs would stand out from the \\"shoe-gazing\\" indie bands of the day. The members split in 1997 with some of the musicians joining together again in various acts, however nothing has been heard since musically from Rushton or Gibson. Jackson has been linked with Liam Frost & The Slowdown Family as a session guitarist, and even had a stint playing drums with HeadFunk who now go under the name of The Yellhounds. It is believed that Allen and Chan still play together, although details are scarce. Stand out tracks from the band were the anthemic \\"Bored and Crazy\\" which illuminated live shows with its Radiohead- esque chorus, \\"Invisible Tears\\", a beautiful guitar part with a haunting vocal provided and written by Rushton, and \\"Rollin'\\" a blues rock jam perfectly suited to Gibson's raw rocky vocals.

He was a contemporary of Maharaja Jaswant Singh Rathor of Marwar. Early in his professional career, Nainsi was appointed successively as the hakim (administrative head) of various parganas in Marwar. The extensive, first-hand knowledge he collected of the region informed his later writings. In 1658, he was appointed dewan of Marwar, in which position he served until 1666. The literary works he is most known for are Marwar Ra Pargana Ri Vigat and Nainsi Ri Khyat. Khyat written by it is famous as 'Khyat of Nainasi'. Apart from Colonel Tad, all the historians here have used it in some form or the other. The usefulness of the fame and its importance is evident from the fact that Gaurishankar Ojha wrote praising it that if this fame had become available to Colonel Tad, his 'Rajasthan' would have been of some other way. This book was edited in two parts (Hindi translation) by Ramnarayan Dugad and published in 1982 by Kashi Nagari Pracharini Sabha. In the original Rajasthani, this book was edited by Badri Prasad Sakaria and published in four parts from Rajasthan Oriental Vidya Pratishthan Jodhpur till 967. In this repute, Nainasi has written the history of the dynasties of almost all the princely states of Rajasthan. In it, the history of Sisodio, Rathores and Bhatis is written in greater detail. By giving the lineage of the first dynasty, later achievements of each ruler have been taken under the title 'Baat' like 'Baat Rao Jodha Ri' etc. Muhnot was alive till Nainasi Samvat 1727, so only mention of events up to the early 18th century in Khyat. In this, the genealogy and culture up to the 13th century cannot be said to be so authentic, but the events and events after that are considered reliable. Nainasi has also given the names of the people with whose help he compiled the famous material. Khyat's language is Taksali Rajasthani, in which some Arabic-Persian words are also used. These texts are also full of information related to the Rajput caste of Rajasthan, its social structure, conflict with invaders, caste-system religious beliefs, geographical location and cultural environment. Another notable text by Nainasi is 'Marwar ra Pargana ri Vigat' (An Account of the Districts of Marwar), which describes in detail the seven parganas under Maharaja Jaswant Singh (I), a gazetteer of Marwar. In which the history of each pargana is given at the beginning and then by summarizing the different income etc. of the villages of Khalsa and Jagir, its line with the geographical location of each village under the pargana, income of five years and yield of the village Specific things etc. are also mentioned. It also mentions the population of villages and the means of drinking water according to caste. This book is a very authentic source of social, economic, political, cultural and administrative material of Marwar.

ROCs usually involve collaborative partnerships between neighbouring councils in a particular region or area. ROCs vary considerably in size and structure but they have two things in common: their member councils have agreed to work together on one or more common issues and they nominate councillors (and in a small number of cases, council staff) to represent them on the ROC‚Äôs board. Smaller ROCs operate entirely through the staff of their member councils and may not have any formal structure. Others are incorporated associations or companies and have a small staffed secretariat funded mainly through membership fees. ROCs also derive income from fees for managing joint activities for their member councils or from grants from state and federal governments. The activities of ROCs vary from organisation to organisation and include: * Research and advocacy on key regional issues to state and federal governments * Management of regional tendering and purchase agreements which achieve economies of scale and/or cost savings for member councils * Facilitation of cooperative activities between councils such as regional planning, environmental management or economic development * Management of regional projects funded by other levels of government * Information exchange and best practice initiatives * Regional promotion Some of these activities may involve only member councils but many ROCs also develop strategic partnerships with other organisations, regional or state associations or state and federal government agencies. However, ROCs usually have no formal statutory authority and their advocacy can bring them into conflict with state government. Not all councils belong to a ROC, whilst a small number of councils on the borders between two ROCs belong to more than one organisation. The number of ROCs and proportion of participating councils varies from state to state, with NSW and Queensland having the highest number of active ROCs.

She is frequently referred to by her married name Natalie James. She was born Evelyn Natalie Caine in Hoylake in Cheshire and was educated at St Felix School, in Southwold, Suffolk. She enrolled in the Royal College of Music in 1928, initially to study piano and composition, but was captivated by the oboe playing of Sylvia Spencer, a student of Leon Goossens, who promptly took her on as a student. In 1931 she won a scholarship and was soon playing solo part in Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante, conducted by Adrian Boult. Another soloist on that stage was her future husband, the bassoonist Cecil James. Other fellow students who were to make a name for themselves were Benjamin Britten, Joy Boughton, Sidney Sutcliffe, Marjorie Trevelyan, Margaret Eliot and Evelyn Rothwell. It was to avoid confusion of names with Evelyn Rothwell (who was to become Lady Barbirolli) that she dropped her own first name. In 1934 she and Evelyn Rothwell were engaged to play for Fritz Busch at the Glyndebourne Festival. Engagements for the two with the London Symphony Orchestra followed soon after. In 1936 Benjamin Britten dedicated his newly composed Temporal Suite to Natalie. It received mixed reviews however, and Britten withdrew the composition. When it was eventually published (as Temporal Variations) after his death, its dedication was no longer to Natalie, a cut that hurt her deeply. She married Cecil James in 1938.

The battalion was redesignated as the 4th Battalion (Prince of Wales's Own) 8th Punjab Regiment. During the Second World War, 4/8th Punjab (PWO) served in Iran and Iraq. In 1947, the 8th Punjab Regiment was allocated to Pakistan Army. In 1956, it was merged with the Baluch Regiment and 4/8th Punjab was redesignated as 4 Baluch (now 4 Baloch).

The regiment was raised in 1800 as a battalion of Madras Native Infantry. It was designated as the 93rd Burma Infantry in 1903 and became the 5th (Burma) Battalion 8th Punjab Regiment in 1922. In 1947, it was allocated to the Pakistan Army, where it continues to exist as 5th Battalion of The Baloch Regiment.Ahmad, Lt Col RN. (2010). Battle Honours of the Baloch Regiment. Abbottabad: The Baloch Regimental Centre. Early history The regiment was raised on 1 January 1800 at Guntur, in South India as the 1st Battalion 17th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry by Colonel George Wahab, and was known as Wahab ki Paltan (Wahab's Battalion). It was composed mostly of Muslims, Tamils and Telugus. In 1803, it took part in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, while in 1809, at Cochin, it repulsed a force of 3000 rebels during the Travancore War. In 1817, the battalion operated against the Pindaris during the Third Anglo- Maratha War. In 1824, it was redesignated as the 33rd Regiment of Madras Native Infantry. During the Great Indian Rebellion of 1857, it again operated against the Marathas in Central India.Ahmad, Maj RN, and Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin. (2006).

Madras: The Government Press.Wilson, Lt Col WJ. (1882-88). History of the Madras Army. Madras: The Government Press. In 1890, the 33rd Madras Infantry was reconstituted with Punjabi Muslims, Pathans and Sikhs, and permanently based in Burma. Its designation was changed to the 3rd Regiment of Burma Infantry, and in 1891, to the 33rd Regiment (3rd Burma Battalion) of Madras Infantry. In 1901, its title was changed to the 33rd Burma Infantry. The Burma Battalions were units raised to police the new territories acquired in the Third Anglo-Burmese War and pacify the rebellious hill tribes inhabiting the frontier regions of Burma. From 1891 to 1893, the regiment operated in the Kachin State in northern Burma, quelling various outbreaks of rebellion. 93rd Burma Infantry As part of the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, all former Madras units had 60 added to their numbers. Consequently, the regiment's designation was changed to 93rd Burma Infantry. In 1910, the Burma Battalions were delocalised from Burma and in 1913, the 93rd Burma Infantry moved to Barrackpore in India. On the outbreak of the First World War, the regiment sailed for Egypt in November 1914, where it was deployed to defend the Suez Canal against the Turks. In September 1915, they left for France and over the next three months, served in the trenches of the Western Front. Early in 1916, the regiment arrived in Mesopotamia, where they were engaged in fierce fighting on the Tigris Front during British efforts to relieve the besieged garrison of Kut al Amara. The regiment took part in the Battles of Dujaila Redoubt, Beit Aissa, Khudaira Bend & Jebel Hamrin. It fought with great gallantry and suffered heavy losses in this long and bloody campaign. In 1918, the 93rd Burma Infantry proceeded to Palestine and took part in the Battle of Megiddo, which led to the annihilation of Turkish Army in Palestine.407px During the war, the 93rd Burma Infantry suffered 1157 casualties including 235 killed. They received a large number of gallantry awards for their outstanding performance in the war.Haycraft, Maj WS. (1921). Regimental History, 1914-1920, 93rd Burma Infantry. Cardiff: William Lewis.

During the Second World War, 5/8th Punjab (Burma) fought in the Burma Campaign and served in the Dutch East Indies. In 1947, the 8th Punjab Regiment was allocated to the Pakistan Army.

A third of the community is built on stilts along the lagoon and the rest is on the land. The waterfront part of the community is largely harboured by the Egun people who migrated from Badagary and Republic of Benin and whose main occupation is fishing. In July 2012, the Lagos State government ordered that some of the stilts beyond the power-lines be brought down without proper notice. This led to the destruction of several stilts on the Iwaya/Makoko waterfront and many families were rendered homeless. History right Boys paddling a canoe is a common view at Makoko Established in the 19th century, much of Makoko rests in structures constructed on stilts above Lagos Lagoon. Makoko is a neighbouring community to Iwaya on the waterfront and Oko Baba. In July 2012, Lagos State government under the governorship of Babatunde Fashola ordered that the stilts on the Iwaya/Makoko waterfront be demolished and dozens of stilts were demolished within 72 hours of notice to the residents. Nearly 3,000 people lost their homes to the demolition exercise.Tolu Ogunlesi, \\"Inside Makoko: danger and ingenuity in the world's biggest floating slum\\", The Guardian, 23 February 2016. Two months after the partial demolition, a Serac housing affiliate known as the Urban Spaces Innovation developed a regeneration plan for Makoko that would bring the community together with academics, non- profits, and international consultants. The plan was submitted to the Lagos State Ministry of Urban and Physical Planning in January 2014. Makoko is sometimes referred to as the \\"Venice of Africa\\". Its population is considered to be 85,840; however, the area was not officially counted as part of the 2007 census and the population has been estimated to be much higher.

As basketball, volleyball and soccer are the most popular events and most teams consist of students who participate in more than one of these sports, this system helps decrease the chances of scheduling conflicts within the schools themselves and between AASCA member schools. Usually, basketball kicks off the AASCA schedule in the month of October, followed by Volleyball and Soccer both being played in the Spring. AASCA tournaments and events vary in participation based on school size. \\"Big schools\\" are those that have a total of students, grades K-12, totaling over one-thousand. \\"Small schools\\" are those with a total enrollment under one-thousand (although these rules may be under review). Basketball, volleyball and soccer have separate tournaments based on school size. However, some host schools of \\"big school\\" tournaments have invited \\"small schools\\" to participate in their tournaments, sometimes resulting in upsets like Country Day School's basketball championship triumph over the Escuela Americana in 2005.

Its hybrid Baguio City satellite studio is located at #16. Kisad Road, 2nd Floor, Midland Currier Building, Baguio City while its transmitter's location is at Mt. Sto. Tomas, Tuba, Benguet, sharing transmitter facilities with GMA Dagupan. History As Citynet Television and EMC / Channel [V] Philippines In 1995, GMA Network, the Philippines' Largest Network, launched its UHF TV station in Benguet under the branding Citynet Television 24 (or just Citynet 24). As started its operations, the station was programmed like an independent stationGMA intended Citynet 27 to be its main outlet for imported programming (particularly from the United States), freeing up slots in GMA Network's schedule for more domestic productions. By 1999, the costs of operating the station in this format were becoming too high for GMA. The station was turned into a music channel under the interim branding EMC, the Entertainment Music Channelwhich was also the country's first locally operated music channel. A few months later by December 19, 1999, GMA reached a deal with Asian broadcaster STAR TV to allow this channel to be a carrier of Channel V Philippines and it had already aired selected Channel V programming from its international version. This arrangement did not last longa stake in GMA was recently purchased by the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, who already owned MTV Philippines through the Nation Broadcasting Corporation and its parent company MediaQuest Holdings. This conflict of interest, along with the increasing competition from the MTV affiliated network, led to the channel signing-off on July 25, 2001. As QTV/Q, GMA News TV and moved to Channel 22 After four years of silence in Benguet, on November 11, 2005, the station returned its operations. DWDG-TV, together with other GMA's sister UHF stations nationwide, were launched as an all-female lifestyle channel QTV (standing for Quality Television; later renamed as simply Q in March 2007). With the return of its TV operations, its flagship station in Metro Manila was DZOE-TVwhich GMA lease as part of a partnership with the religious broadcaster ZOE Broadcasting Network (gaining control of the station in exchange for providing equipment for ZOE, and allowing airtime for ZOE-produced programming on QTV), with the GMA-owned flagship station in Manila serving as a UHF translator (GMA had previously operated as the independent station Citynet 27, before it went silent in the middle of 2001). The new network would feature a lineup predominantly aimed towards women, with a mixture of domestic and imported lifestyle programs and dramatic series. On February 7, 2011, GMA Network announced that it would replace Q with the news channel GMA News TV. As Q's programming ended on February 20; the network, broadcasting under transitional branding Channel 11 (along with other stations nationwide), continued to air teasers for the impending re-launch from February 21‚Äì25, and signed off completely on the 26th and 27th of the same month in preparation for its re-launch of a secondary network a day later. On February 28, 2011, DWDG-TV and other GMA's sister UHF stations nationwide were reformatted and formal re-launch as news and public affairs channel GMA News TV, and as part of GMA News and Public Affairs's plans to expand its presence on free-to-air television. And in 2015, GMA News TV Benguet was transferred its channel assignment to Channel 22.

Hired by Richard D'Oyly Carte in 1900 to replace C√©sar Ritz as manager of the Savoy Hotel, he remained in the post until his death four decades later. In addition to running the Savoy, he was general manager of the other hotels and restaurants in the Savoy group and was a director of the Savoy Theatre. He was also instrumental in establishing charitable medical institutions in England and Switzerland. Early years Reeves-Smith was born in Scarborough, Yorkshire, the son of George Reeves-Smith, whose jobs included running the Brighton aquarium.Jaine, Tom. \\"Smith, Sir George Reeves- (1863‚Äì1941)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 18 Sept 2009 He was educated at Brighton College and then apprenticed to J. Calvet et cie, Bordeaux wine n√©gociants, after which he trained in the hotel industry. By 1893 he was manager of the Berkeley Hotel, Piccadilly, and four years later he led a management buy-out, with himself as principal shareholder and managing director. At the same time, Richard D'Oyly Carte, founder of the Savoy Hotel, dismissed his manager, C√©sar Ritz, for financial irregularities, and was looking for a suitable replacement. Carte was impressed by both Reeves-Smith and the Berkeley, and he effectively secured both by purchasing the Berkeley and making Reeves-Smith managing director of the Savoy hotel group. Reeves-Smith held this office from 1900 for the rest of his life, and from 1916 took on the post of vice-chairman of the company, which he also held for life.\\"Reeves-Smith, Sir George\\", Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 19 September 2009 In 1904, in addition to managing the growing Savoy hotel group, which included, among other interests, the Savoy, the Berkeley, Claridge's and Simpson's-in-the-Strand, he became a director of the Savoy Theatre. Savoy group The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography said of Reeves-Smith that \\"he was aware of the slightest derogation from high standards of housekeeping or service; yet he was innovative and capable of masterly delegation ... punctilious and conservative in manner and dress, he had a shrewd business appreciation of practical detail and people's tastes in leisure activities.\\" In 1930, the novelist Arnold Bennett, who knew the Savoy well, dedicated his Imperial Palace to Reeves-Smith. The principal character of the novel, Evelyn Orcham, is the resourceful and urbane general manager of a large h√¥tel de luxe in London.Bennett, Arnold. Imperial Palace Reeves-Smith founded the Hotels and Restaurants Association (1910) and was its dominant figure for the rest of his life.The Times obituary, 30 May 1941, p. 7 He was connected with other catering industry organisations, including the International Hotel Alliance, of which he was president. His interests extended beyond the world of grand hotels: he was instrumental in founding in the Preston Hall centre for tuberculous ex-servicemen in Kent, and the British Sanatorium in Montana- Vermala, Switzerland. He was knighted in 1938 for service to the hotel industry, and was honoured by France (L√©gion d'honneur, 1938) and Italy (Knight Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy, 1939). In 1938 Reeves- Smith engaged as his assistant Hugh Wontner, who took over when Reeves-Smith died.The Times, obituary of Hugh Wontner, 27 November 1992 Personal life In 1888 Reeves-Smith married Maud Hindle, daughter of a Brighton hotelier. They had one son, who was killed in World War I, and one daughter. Their home was always a suite in one of Reeves-Smith's hotels, first in the Berkeley, then at Claridge's, where Reeves-Smith died of pneumonia, aged 77, survived by his wife.The Times obituary gives his age as 86, but does not cite date of birth, and the dates and age given in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography have been used above.

She is also a non-executive member of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board. From 2013 to 2015, Dominiczak was President of the European Society of Hypertension. Her research interests include hypertension, cardiovascular genomics and precision medicine. She has led major research programmes, has over 400 publications in peer-reviewed journals, and is recognised as being among the world's foremost cardiovascular scientists and clinical academics Early life and education Professor Dominiczak was born in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland, and went on to study medicine at the Gda≈Ñsk Medical University, Poland, where she gained an MD Honours in 1978. Career and research She moved to the UK in 1982 and worked as a Junior House Officer at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, and a Senior House Officer and Registrar at the Royal Alexandra Hospital, Paisley. In 1986, she gained Membership of the Royal College of Physicians UK. In 1986, Dominiczak was appointed Medical Research Council (MRC) Clinician Scientist and Senior Registrar at the Western Infirmary, Glasgow, and between 1990 and 1991 was Research Fellow and Associate Professor at the University of Michigan on a British Heart Foundation Fellowship. She returned to Glasgow in 1992 as Clinical Lecturer and Honorary Senior Registrar at the Medical School of the University of Glasgow, and in 1993 became BHF Senior Research Fellow and Senior Lecturer. In 1998, she was appointed to a British Heart Foundation Professorship of Cardiovascular Medicine, and in 2006, the British Heart Foundation and University of Glasgow jointly opened the BHF Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre. Prof. Dominiczak was appointed as the first Director of the centre, a position she held until 2010. Between 2004 and 2008, she was Editor-in-Chief of Clinical Science and in 2012 was appointed Editor-in-Chief of Hypertension The Centre aims to create a multidisciplinary research environment of internationally recognised cardiovascular research groups, and is connected to the University's Medical School and Glasgow Biomedical Research Centre. In 2010, she was appointed Regius Professor of Medicine at the University, the first woman to hold this post. Dominiczak has been described as \\"a bona fide trailblazer in cardiovascular science and medicine\\", and one of \\"the country's most eminent scientists\\". Since 2010, she has held the position of Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Glasgow ‚Äì the first woman to hold this post. In the same year, the University of Glasgow underwent a major restructure with four colleges replacing nine faculties. The largest of the four is the College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences (MVLS). Prof Dominiczak was appointed as the first Head of MVLS and as a University Vice Principal in 2010, positions she holds to this day. Under her continued directorship, by the end of 2018, MVLS had 2300 staff, 6,000 students, ¬£230 million turnover and ¬£120 million research income annually. Dominiczak was instrumental in fundraising in excess of ¬£90m in order to bring University research facilities to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus in Glasgow. She oversaw the development of key buildings, the Teaching and Learning Centre and the ¬£32m Imaging Centre of Excellence (ICE), which is a hub for Precision Medicine innovation and the site of the UK's first 7Tesla MRI scanner in a clinical setting. The University site at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital is also home to a Clinical Research Facility and the 22,000sq feet Clinical Innovation Zone, which houses a range of Precision Medicine-focused companies and research initiatives. Dominiczak's vision to see Scotland leading the way in Precision Medicine innovation and delivery, has been key to the make-up and structure of these buildings and centres. Her vision, to follow a Triple Helix approach to collaboration, sees NHS, industry and academia brought together under one roof in order to work closely together to bring more efficient solutions to health problems for both patients and the NHS. From 2013 to 2015, Dominiczak was President of the European Society of Hypertension and was instrumental in bringing the joint meeting of the International Society of Hypertension and the European Society of Hypertension to Glasgow in 2020, where it will be held at the Scottish Exhibition Centre. In 2018, Dominiczak co-hosted the first Precision Medicine Summit in Scotland, which was attended by the First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon. The summit brought together the country's foremost experts on Precision Medicine, from industry, NHS, politics and academia, in order to find a One Scotland approach to innovation in this emerging field. Later in 2018 she was named as one of the experts appointed to advise the Scottish Government through the Scottish Science Advisory Council (SSAC). Dominiczak took up her position on the expert panel, which supports the Chief Scientific Adviser for Scotland in her work with Scottish Ministers, in January 2019. In 2019, Dominiczak was appointed as the Medical Research Council Heath Innovation Champion, a new senior role within the MRC that is intended to enable the organisation to work more effectively with commercial partners. She has also served extensively on national and international research committees and advisory boards, including those of the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Wellcome Trust. She has been a member of the British Heart Foundation (BHF) Board of Trustees since 2014. Dominiczak's major research interests continue to be hypertension, cardiovascular genomics and Precision Medicine, where she not only publishes extensively in top peer-reviewed journals, but also attracts large scale research funding for programmes and infrastructure, with a total funding value in excess of ¬£100M since 2011. She also led a collaboration of four universities, four academic NHS Health Boards across Scotland, and two major industry partners to develop a public/private partnership focused on precision medicine, with a value in excess of ¬£20M. She has been invited to give over 100 international plenary lectures, including the Arthur Corcoran Award and Lecture of the American Heart Association [xi], the R.D.

Early life Duraso was born in 1538 to Mahoji at Jaitaran, in the present-day Pali district of Rajasthan, India. His father came from the village of Adha, located in the Jalore district near Sanchore, and from this connection came Duraso's first name. As a poet Duraso was subjected to a childhood of acute poverty but demonstrated a talent for poetry that brought him great wealth. He had two wives and four children and he was a part in many Rajput royal courts, including those of Bikaner Jodhpur and Sirohi. He also enjoyed a good relationship with Akbar, the Mughal emperor. He spent his last days in his son Kisnoji's house at Panchetiya village, where he died in 1651. Works The poems written by Duraso mostly relate the heroism and manliness of the rulers of that time but also chronicle many mundane matters. He treated the achievements of his subjects as individuals even when they were constantly at odds with each other, as in the case of his writings about Akbar and Maharana Pratap. He expressed his deep faith in the Hindu religion, appreciated the bravery of Hindu heroes and wrote of the injustice of the Mughals. However, literary analysis of the Virud Chihattari poem associated with him, including the extremely harsh words used to describe Akbar, suggests that work and also the smaller Gajagata were at least not all of his own writing.

For these reasons, silox anion forms highly unsaturated complexes. Complexes with high coordinative unsaturation display high reactivity so long as they do not undergo intramolecular reactions. Silox offers this possibility. Examples of high reactivity exhibited by metal-silox compounds include the C-O bond in carbon monoxide and the C-N bond in pyridine.Peter T.

It propounded the idea that the North Pole was the original home of Aryans during the pre-glacial period which they had to leave due to the ice deluge around 8000 B.C. and had to migrate to the Northern parts of Europe and Asia in search of lands for new settlements. In support to his theory, Tilak presented certain Vedic hymns, Avestic passages, Vedic chronology and Vedic calendars with interpretations of the contents in detail. The book was written at the end of 1898, but was first published in March 1903 in Pune. Background Man was believed to be post-glacial, and the theory of an Asiatic origin of the Aryan peoples prevailed. The age of the oldest Vedic period, however, was carried back to 4500 BC by scholars including the author himself after scientific astronomical research in correlation with purported evidence found in the Vedic hymns. Tilak cites a book by William F. Warren, the first President of Boston University, Paradise Found or the Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole, as having anticipated his ideas to some extent. Warren dedicated his book to Max M√ºller, with whom Tilak had shared ideas before the book was completed. Tilak held the view that further study of Vedic hymns and Avestan passages might reveal the long vista of primitive Aryan antiquity. Summary of Tilak‚Äôs polar theory *Neolithic Aryan race in Europe cannot be regarded as autochthonous, nor European Aryans descended from the Paleolithic man. Hence, question of the original Aryan home is still unsettled. *In the early geological ages, the Alps were low, the Himalayas not yet upheaved, Asia and Africa were represented only by a group of islands and an equable and uniform climate prevailed over the whole surface of the globe. In those days, however, a warm climate prevailed in the Arctic region. *The close of the Pliocene and the whole of the Pleistocene period were marked by violent changes of climate bringing on what is called the Glacial and Inter- Glacial epochs. A succession of cold and warm climates must have characterized these Glacial and Inter-Glacial periods which were also accompanied by extensive movements of depression and elevation of land, the depression taking place after the land was weighed down with the enormous mass of ice. *Thus a period of glaciations was marked by elevation, extreme cold and the invasion of the ice-caps over regions of the present Temperate zone; while an inter- glacial period was accompanied by depression of land and milder and congenial climate which made even the Arctic regions habitable. *According to the latest geological evidence, the last Glacial period must have closed and Post-Glacial must have commenced at about 10,000 years ago or 8,000 BC. There were at least two Glacial and one Inter-Glacial period, and the geographical distribution of land and water on the earth during the Inter-Glacial period was quite different from what it is at present. It was the coming on of the Glacial age that destroyed this genial climate and rendered the regions unsuited for the habitation of tropical plants and animals. *At the North Pole, one sees the heavenly dome above seems to revolve around one like a potter's wheel. The stars will not rise and set but move round and round in horizontal planes during the long night of six months. The Sun, when it is above the horizon for six months; would also appear to revolve in the same way but with some difference. The Northern celestial hemisphere will alone be visible spinning round and round and the Southern half remain invisible. The Sun going into the Northern hemisphere in his annual course will appear as coming up from the South. Living in the temperate and tropical zones, however, one sees all heavenly objects rise in the East and set in the West, some passing over the head, others traveling obliquely. *The long dawn of two months is a special and important characteristic of the North Pole. As we descend southward, the splendor and the duration of the dawn will be witnessed on a less and less magnificent scale. But the dawn occurring at the end of the long night of two, three or more months will still be unusually long, often of several days duration. *All these characteristics of an Arctic home are clearly recorded in several Vedic hymns and Avestic passages and they come to us sometimes as the description of the prevailing conditions or the day-to-day experience or stories told by the earlier generation and sometimes as myths. Chronology of the post-glacial period Tilak in his Study *10,000 to 8000 BC ‚Äì The destruction of the original Arctic home by the last Ice Age and the commencement of the post-Glacial period. *8000 to 5000 BC ‚Äì The age of migration from the original home. The survivors of the Aryan race roamed over the northern parts of Europe and Asia in search of lands suitable for new settlements. Tilak calls it the Pre-Orion Period. *5000 to 3000 BC. ‚Äì The Orion period, when the vernal equinox was in Orion. Many Vedic hymns can be traced to the early part of this period and the bards of the race seem to have not yet forgotten the real importance of the traditions of the Arctic home inherited by them. It was at this time that first attempts to reform the calendar and the sacrificial system appear to have been systematically made. *3000 to 1400 BC ‚Äì The Krittika period, when the vernal equinox was in Pleiades. The traditions about the original Arctic home had grown dim by this time and were often misunderstood, making the Vedic hymns less and less intelligible. *1400 to 500 BC ‚Äì The Pre-Buddhistic period, when the Sutras and the Philosophical systems made their appearance. Influence M.S. Golwalkar, in his 1939 publication We or Our Nationhood Defined, famously stated that \\"Undoubtedly [...] we ‚Äî Hindus ‚Äî have been in undisputed and undisturbed possession of this land for over eight or even ten thousand years before the land was invaded by any foreign race.\\"Gyanendra Pandey (2006), Routine Violence: Nations, Fragments, Histories, Stanford University Press, p.103 Golwalkar was inspired by Tilak's The Arctic Home in the Vedas. Gowalkar took over the idea of 10,000 years, arguing that the North Pole at that time was located in India.Carol Schaeffer (2018), Alt-Reich.
