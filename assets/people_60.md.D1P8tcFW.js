Wretman is perhaps best known for introducing cooking to men in Sweden, and his work as a restaurateur founding several of Stockholm's most popular restaurants. He is also known for creating Toast Skagen. Biography =Early years= Wretman was born in Stockholm to writer Harald Wretman and Helga Nordstr√∂m.Dokument√§rfilm: Tore Wretman k√∂kspojken svt.se Retrieved 20 December 2019 He was the nephew of writer Tora Nordstr√∂m-Bonnier. His parents divorced when Wretman was very young, and he spent part of his childhood at a children's home. This was revealed in the documentary Tore Wretman ‚Äì k√∂kspojken broadcast on Sweden's national public television broadcaster SVT in 2015. =Apprenticeships and Second World War= Wretman did not succeed in school, and at the age of sixteen he began apprenticing in the kitchen at the Hotel Continental in Stockholm. A year later he started working as a waiter at Operabaren in Operak√§llaren. There he met wine importer Fredrik K√∂nig, who subsequently got him a job at Maxim's in Paris, in 1933. At Maxim's he learned the basics in the kitchen and was an apprentice under chef Louis Barth and restaurant owner Albert Baser. He worked as commis saucier and poissonnier. In 1937, Wretman worked as head of the bar at the restaurant Soleil de Minuit in the Swedish pavilion at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne. There he became acquainted with Sara Reuterski√∂ld, who was about to open the restaurant Regnb√•gen; she hired Wretman as head chef. He got the opportunity to introduce French cuisine on the menu. His position at Regnb√•gen was short-lived as in 1937 he was drafted into the Svea Life Guards infantry regiment. After his army duty, Wretman spent a few years in the United States. In 1941, he started working on the Finnish cargo ship SS Winha, so he could return to Sweden via Finland. The ship was boarded north of Iceland by the British navy and was brought to Kirkwall on the Orkney islands. Afterwards Wretman was brought to a camp in London and was ultimately released. Because of the ongoing war in Europe, he was unable to return to Sweden. He obtained a job as a receptionist at a London hotel, where he stayed until 1943 when he finally had the chance to return to Sweden. =Later life= In 1943 and 1944, Wretman worked as head waiter at Operak√§llaren in Stockholm. In 1945, at the age of 29, he bought the restaurant Riche on Birger Jarlsgatan. The restaurant was in bad shape after the war years, so Wretman set about to make several big changes. The pillar sections were halved, and its entrance was built on Nybrogatan, where Wretman opened his second restaurant Teatergrillen, which soon became one of Stockholm's most popular restaurants. Five years later, Wretman took over the Stallm√§stareg√•rden restaurant, which became one of the most renowned restaurants in the country after only a short time. In 1955, Wretman took over Operak√§llaren. After renovations and a complete overhaul, the restaurant was reopened in 1961, with Werner V√∂geli as head chef. In 1971, Wretman did the same with Restaurant Victoria in Kungstr√§dg√•rden. Wretman later sold his restaurants and moved to Mougins on the French Riviera. Personal life Wretman's first marriage, from 1945 and 1953, was to actress Lillebil Kjell√©n. The couple had two daughters‚ÄîAnn-Sofie (born 1946) and Charlotta (born 1949). His daughter Ann- Sofie is a food writer. His second marriage was from 1953 and 1971 to actress Meg Westergren. They had a son named Fredrik (born 1953) and a daughter named Malin (1956‚Äì1997).Sveriges D√∂dbok 1901‚Äì2009, DVD-ROM, Version 5.00, Sveriges Sl√§ktforskarf√∂rbund (2010). He married flight attendant Ewa Wikmar in 1971. The couple had two children‚ÄîJohan (born 1973) and Filip (born 1975). Together they ran a real estate business called Wretman Estate on the French Riviera. Legacy Wretman played a big role in educating Swedes about the world of cuisine with his radio show Novisen vid spisen on Sveriges Radio. The radio show began broadcasting in 1950 and was hosted by journalist Folke Olhagen. The duo also presented segments on television meant to educate men about cooking and cuisine, a task that had previously been considered a woman's duty. He is known to have introduced avocado and green pepper to the Swedish public, as well as prawns on toast, a dish which is better known as Toast Skagen. He received an honorary PhD from Ume√• University, as well as an honorary doctorate in gastronomy from the same university.Om den √§rbara v√§llusten:mera mat & minnen, Tore Wretman, Page 253.

The film features three songs from Del Rey's Norman Fucking Rockwell!. It was released on YouTube on December 20, 2019. Production and development In 2018, Del Rey released videos for two songs, \\"Mariners Apartment Complex\\" and \\"Venice Bitch\\". Believed to be from her upcoming album, the clips were both directed by Del Rey's sister Chuck Grant and filmed solely on an iPhone in a vintage style, achieved through post-production filters. On January 10, 2019, Del Rey previewed a clip of a then-unreleased song titled \\"Happiness is a Butterfly\\" and a visual for the video. Del Rey later teased a music video for the title track from Norman Fucking Rockwell! by posting a snippet of it following the release of the album in August. Going without a proper release for several months, Del Rey announced in October that she would be releasing a triple-feature for three songs from her album. After teasing the release for several days on social media, Del Rey released the 14-minute-long video on December 20, 2019. The music follows Del Rey's summer releases of \\"Doin' Time\\", \\"Don't Call Me Angel\\", and \\"Fuck It, I Love You\\"/\\"The Greatest\\". Synopsis Set in Los Angeles, Del Rey sings along to her album's title song, \\"Norman Fucking Rockwell\\" while playing along at her piano. Del Rey then proceeds to walk outside, wearing black sunglasses that feature cinematic imagery and home movies. Intercut with shots of Del Rey shining on a hammock and singing in front of roses, the song ends with Del Rey singing in front of a pool of CGI jellyfish. Del Rey's friend, Emma Elizabeth Tillman, makes a brief cameo in a scene in which Del Rey and her dancers are meditating in a national park with Disney wildlife wandering around them. In the next segment, set to the song \\"Bartender\\", Del Rey and her friends are roaming around in a truck through an abandoned parking lot, harassing two comedic cops. The only section in the film to feature non-music audio, the group laugh as they throw slurpees and donuts at the cops as they chase them around, all while fighter jets fly overhead and explosions are set off in the background. The usage of the war imagery is believed be indicative of the political tensions occurring internationally, with the clueless cops being representative of governments and their officials turning a blind eye to what's going on in the world. Following a brief 30-second-long black and white time lapse of moving traffic, the final song, \\"Happiness is a Butterfly\\" begins. The video takes place on the side of a busy street in Los Angeles, with Del Rey and her same two friends from \\"Bartender\\" walking around the pavement, singing the lyrics while laying on a doc, and playing with butterflies in front of a chain mill fence. This section features CGI lightning and cartoon butterflies, as well as real ones. =References= Alongside her social commentary and political references in the \\"Bartender\\" section, Del Rey also references other videos from her NFR! era. \\"Bartender\\" features the video portion of the photo session during which the alternative album cover for Urban Outfitters was shot. The section also features an extended version of the footage originally used in \\"Venice Bitch\\". \\"Happiness is a Butterfly\\" was filmed the same day as \\"Mariners Apartment Complex\\" and features Del Rey and friends dressed in the same attire in the video, reusing several shots from the video as well. Angie Martoccio of Rolling Stone compared the singer's role as being that of a \\"woman of the canyon\\". The video also features Jack Nicholson's son, Duke, who also appears with Del Rey on the cover of the album artwork. Cast and crew The film stars Del Rey alongside her backup singers/dancers Alexandria Kaye and Ashley Rodriguez. Several of Del Rey's friends make cameo appearances, including Emma Tillman, Duke Nicholson, Craig Stark, and her sister and the film's director, Chuck Grant. Del Rey edited the video herself on iMovie, with CGI effects and graphics being added in later. Critical reception The film received positive views upon release. Being a follow-up to previous music films of hers such as Ride (2012) and Tropico (2013), critics noted how the video was more tame overall compared to her other pieces. Music The film is set to three of Del Rey's songs from Norman Fucking Rockwell! (2019): \\"Norman Fucking Rockwell\\", \\"Bartender\\", and \\"Happiness is a Butterfly\\".

She provided logistical support to the Union Army on the Atlantic coast during the American Civil War. After the war she was sent to San Francisco where she provided freight and passenger services between that city and other ports on the Pacific coast. She provided the first scheduled steamship service between the United States and Hawaii.  Construction and launch  It is not clear if Ajax was built for government service, or if the ship was intended as a commercial venture. Cornelius and Richard Poillon operated a shipyard in Brooklyn, New York at the foot of Bridge Street on the East River. They built a variety of yachts, commercial vessels, and warships for the United States and other nations. Their ships USS Grand Gulf, USS Winona', and USS New Berne were all purchased by the U.S. Navy for service in the Civil War. Given the shipyard's relationship with the US government, the Poillon's may have had a charter contract in hand before beginning construction on Ajax. In any case, shortly after her launch on October 6, 1864 she was chartered for use by the Quartermaster Corps of the Union Army to provide logistical support along the Atlantic coast for Civil War operations. Ajax was the largest ship ever built by the C. & R. Poillon shipyard. She was long, with a beam of , and a draft of . Ajax had a wooden hull built from white oak, hackmatack, and locust. She was rigged as a brigantine, and could sail, but her primary propulsion was provided by a steam engine driving a single propeller. The engine had a single cylinder in diameter with a piston stroke of . It produced a nominal 400 horsepower. The engine was built by the DeLamater Iron Works of New York City. The propeller was 13' 6\\" in diameter. An indication that her designers considered her possible service in war, all her machinery was placed below her waterline, and thus less likely to be damaged by a cannonball. Under steam power alone, Ajax could achieve a maximum speed of 11.5 knots, but with a favorable wind and all sails set she could average 12.5 knots over the course of a day. She typically burned 18 tons of coal per day. Her coal bunkers held at least 10 days of fuel even with 2,000 tons of freight aboard. In 1866, when she was purchased by the California Steam Navigation Company, she had over 60 first class cabins each with two berths. Several of these were converted to three-berth \\"family\\" staterooms. There were accommodations for several hundred steerage passengers as well. A salon long enclosed on the main deck forward provided space for passenger meals, walking, and entertainments. There were two smoking rooms. Shared bathrooms provided hot and cold running water. The galley was on the open top deck of the ship so that cooking odors would not enter the main cabin. Cooking for steerage passengers was apparently less elegant but quite efficient; food was cooked with steam from the ship's boilers. Separate dining facilities were provided for the ship's crew. There were four lifeboats and two other ship's boats.  Civil war service  Ajax began her Civil War service with a trip from New York, leaving on January 15, 1865, carrying 80 bags of mail and papers, arriving in Savannah, Georgia on January 25. She was one of the first vessels to reach the city after the Savannah River was cleared of obstacles left by the retreating Confederates. She left Hilton Head, South Carolina on March 7, 1865 and encountered heavy weather off Cape Hatteras. She arrived back in New York on March 10. Reports of her arrival noted she was \\"in ballast\\" indicating that there was no substantial cargo aboard. She embarked 1,000 troops and sailed for Beaufort, South Carolina on March 14, 1865. She sailed from Moorehead City, North Carolina and arrived at Fortress Monroe on March 20, 1865. On March 23, 1865 Ajax sailed up the Potomac River and anchored off Alexandria, Virginia. She had come from Wilmington, North Carolina with 60 passengers aboard. These were mostly armorers from the Fayetteville, North Carolina arsenal, who had relocated from Harpers Ferry, Virginia when the Confederate States moved the equipment they had captured. That night the ship was driven ashore on the mud banks opposite Alexandria in a gale. On April 6, 1865 she arrived at Fortress Monroe from Moorehead City carrying a \\"large number\\" of Confederate prisoners and refugees from General Sherman's campaign. On April 11, 1865 she arrived at Fortress Monroe from Wilmington. She sailed on to New York on April 12. With General Lee's surrender at Appomattox on April 9, 1865, Ajax's Civil War service was over. With her government charter at an end, her owners sent her to California to seek a return on their investment. She sailed from New York for the last time on May 12, 1865. She stopped in Rio de Janeiro on June 22 and reached San Francisco on August 31, 1865. She was commanded by Captain Cornelius Godfrey in her late war service, her repositioning to the Pacific, and in her early commercial voyages from San Francisco.  California Steam Navigation Company  leftAt some point prior to her arrival in San Francisco, Ajax was sold to the firm of Wakeman, Gookin & Dickinson, a New York City- based steamship company. She was advertised for sale on September 18, 1865, not three weeks since her arrival in San Francisco. On November 2, 1865, her owners held a sea trial for other steamship companies to examine her capabilities. Most vessels on the California coast at the time were paddlewheel steamers. There were few propeller driven ships and some skepticism about this new technology. Evidently the trial was a success. Later that month, the California Steam Navigation Company agreed to buy Ajax and California, another Wakeman, Gookin & Dickinson ship, for $250,000. Ajax was moved to Crowell's Wharf to begin a short refitting, for her new owners intended to use her to establish the first scheduled steamship service between San Francisco and Honolulu. The fare for the inaugural trip from San Francisco to Honolulu trip was $75 for a cabin or $40 for steerage. She left San Francisco on January 13, 1866 with 68 passengers, including Samuel Clemens, who reported on the trip using his pen name, Mark Twain. Clemens was aboard Ajax as a special correspondent for the Sacramento Daily Union newspaper. He filed 25 letters with the paper that were collected in Letters From Hawaii, first published in book form in 1947. The first three letters dealt with his trip on Ajax. He reported that the trip to Hawaii was rough, and claimed that he saw 22 of the 68 passengers vomiting over the bulwarks from seasickness at one point. Ajax arrived at Honolulu on January 27. She sailed back to San Francisco on February 10, 1866 arriving on February 23. She carried 34 passengers on this return voyage and a wide variety of agricultural imports including 2,579 kegs of sugar, 807 packages of molasses, 242 sacks of coffee, and 3,621 coconuts. On March 7, 1866, Ajax sailed for Honolulu a second time. She cleared San Francisco with 1,786 sacks of flour, 87 sacks of barley, 57 sacks of oats, 498 sacks of potatoes, paint, guns, kegs of nails, a piano, 6 dozen shovels, and other merchandise valued at $28,192.75. She arrived back in San Francisco on April 15, 1866 with 617 tons of freight, a record for the time for a single ship from Hawaii. The ship's two trips were unprofitable, losing between $7,000 and $8,000. Shortly after her return to San Francisco, the California Steam Navigation Company withdrew he from her Hawaii route, ending scheduled steamship service to the islands. With the break in her scheduled sailings, she underwent a brief visit to the shipyard for repairs. After several months of idleness, the ship was reassigned to the San Francisco - Portland route and made her first trip on February 12, 1867, arriving in Portland on February 16. She made several additional roundtrips between San Francisco and Portland in 1867, but with competition from the Ben Holladay's California, Oregon & Mexico Steamship Company and the newly launched Anchor Line, the route had too many ships on it and a full scale fare war broke out. Fares dropped from $45 for a cabin and $25 for steerage to $10 and $3 respectively between 1866 and 1867. Unable to make money on its ocean-going shipping business, the California Steam Navigation Company sold its entire fleet of seagoing vessels, including Ajax, to the California, Oregon & Mexico Steamship company in mid-1867.  North Pacific Transportation Company  Ajax continued her trips to Portland in 1868,1869, and early 1870 with occasional trips to Victoria and Mazatlan. In March 1869 the California, Oregon, and Mexico Steamship Company was reincorporated under the laws of California as the North Pacific Transportation Company. On May 10, 1870 Ajax sailed again for Honolulu, this time to meet the steamer City of Melbourne sailing from Australia and New Zealand. Passengers booked through tickets going in both directions. She sailed with $36,202 of freight. This was the first of four roundtrips to Hawaii in 1870. The company suspended this transpacific service during the stormy winter months, reassigning the ship to the San Francisco - Portland route. She resumed her trips to Honolulu on March 18, 1871, carrying 33 passengers, more than half of whom were transferring there to a steamer that would take them to Australia or New Zealand. She was reassigned to her Portland route again for the winter of 1871 and remained on this route for the remainder of her career.  Oregon Steamship Company  Sometime in early 1872, Ben Holladay placed the steamers Ajax, J. L. Stephens, and Oriflamme in a new corporation, the Oregon Steamship Company. This new company served only the San Francisco to Portland route and thus buttressed Holladay's riverboat and railroad business in Oregon. He subsequently sold the rest of the North Pacific Transportation Company fleet to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. January 1872 found Ajax fulfilling her original role in supporting Army logistics. She transported three companies of infantry from Portland south on their way to support fighting with Native Americans in Arizona. She returned three companies of the 21st US Infantry to Portland in September, 1872. The difficulties of the San Francisco - Portland route combined with the Ajax's advancing age brought a cascade of mechanical problems. She grounded in the Willamette River in October 1871, and on the Columbia River bar in March 1875. She lost her rudder and had to have her rudder shoe repaired in a shipyard. The rod on her massive piston broke in April, 1874. She had difficulty with her propeller shaft in January 1876 and lost a blade on her massive propeller in November 1876. With this breakdown, she had sailed her last.  Obsolescence  After months of idleness, Ajax was sold to John Roach in March 1878. Roach owned a Chester, Pennsylvania shipyard with business ties to the Oregon Steamship Company. He does not appear to have done much with Ajax; she was \\"laid up\\" and idle in May 1878. She was towed up Oakland Creek where she was laid up permanently in October 1880. In November 1880 she was purchased by Charles Goodall, a partner in the Pacific Coast Steamship Company, one of the significant shipping firms based in San Francisco. His plan was to remove her machinery and convert her into a sailing ship for the transport of coal. There is no evidence that this ever occurred. Ajax drops out of newspaper accounts and US Government ship records after 1880, suggesting that she was either broken up, or pursued her new trade as a collier in another country.

It is an Italian-Spanish co-production directed by Michele Soavi. Plot During the day Miss Paola works as a schoolteacher in an Italian town, but at night she transforms into the over 500-year-old Befana, a witch who delivers presents to well-behaved children and unusual surprises to bad ones each year at midnight when it turns January 6. One year a dog chews on her Rolodex and she fails to deliver a gift in time to Giovanni Rovasio, who then blames her for all of his subsequent misfortunes, including his parents' divorce. 25 years later, Giovanni has transformed himself into Mr. Johnny, a villain who kidnaps Paola in order to take over delivery of the toys. Riccardo, a student from her class, witnesses the kidnapping. He and five fellow students investigate Paola's storage cellar for clues and discover her secret identity. The children are found by Mr. Johnny's men and put into a trash compactor but Riccardo drops a Swiss Army knife in the gears and stops the machine, allowing the children to escape. Knowing that fire is the only way to harm the Befana, Mr. Johnny ties Paola to a Christmas tree and sets it on fire, using Christmas presents as kindling. Just then the clock strikes midnight and she transforms into the Befana, giving her the power to break free from her bonds and fly away on her broom. Mr. Johnny chases after her on a jet-propelled hoverboard and causes her to crash before trapping her in a bubble in his toy factory. The children hike to the toy factory but are captured by Mr. Johnny's men. Paola agrees to give Mr. Johnny the letters she has received from children containing their gift wishes and they leave for the mountain where the letters are hidden. Meanwhile, Paola's boyfriend Giacomo arrives at her home to find her missing and discovers her secret identity in her storage cellar. Paola's pet owl guides Giacomo to Mr. Johnny's toy factory, where he rescues the children. Giacomo and the children reach the mountain where the letters are hidden and fight Mr. Johnny but ultimately Mr. Johnny and Paola both topple from a cliff during a struggle. The next year on January 6, Riccardo finds a Swiss Army knife in his stocking, then notices Paola walking through the town with Giacomo. Mr. Johnny swears vengeance.

She is professor of ecology at the University of Bristol. Her research focuses on community ecology and she is an expert on the interactions between insect pollinators and plants.  Education and career  Memmott attended the University of Leeds where she studied zoology in the early 1980s. She continued her studies at Leeds, where she eventually obtained her PhD. She also worked on the community ecology of phlebotomine sandflies, doing fieldwork in Costa Rica. As a postdoctoral researcher she constructed the first food webs in tropical ecosystems, looking at plants, leaf-miners, and parasitoids, working with Charles Godfray. She furthermore did research of invasive plants in New Zealand. In 1996 Memmott transferred to the University of Bristol as a lecturer. In 2012 she was appointed Head of the School of Biological Sciences where she oversaw the school's transition to a new Life Sciences building.  Research  Memmott's studies a wide range of areas in ecology including pollination ecology, invasion ecology, agro-ecology, biological control, urban ecology, and restoration ecology. Her work in urban habitats includes the urban pollinators project (part of the Insect Pollinators Initiative). In this project, Memmot and her team sample insect pollinators in 1 km long transects in urban areas. They found that private residential gardens, allotments, and community gardens had a higher abundance of insect pollinators than public amenity gardens, such as parks and road verges. Memmott is an advocate of providing resources in urban habitats to sustain pollinators. In particular she advocates for growing areas of wildflowers, which have plants with more nectar and pollen than many cultivated plant varieties. Memmott found that these areas of wildflowers can provide more foraging resources for pollinators. She has also studied the way in which resources available to insect pollinators have changed over the past century as well as the changes that occur over a one year period. In her research of long-term vegetation surveys she found that nectar resources in the UK declined up to the 1970s, during agricultural intensification, but since then resources have increased. On a smaller timescale, Memmott found a potential for mismatch in the timing between flowering plants and the flight times of pollinators that visit them through the year. Memmott also researches agroecosystems. Her research has shown that there are significant gaps seasonally in resources for pollinators from plants, such as pollen and nectar, in early spring and late summer; this knowledge could be used to alter the species mix of wildflower strips as part of agri-environment schemes.  Honours and awards  Memmott is a reviewing editor on Science Magazine. She was awarded the Marsh Ecology Award by the Marsh Christian Trust and the British Ecological Society in 2015. In 2018 she gave the Sir John Burnett Memorial Lecture at the National Biodiversity Network annual conference. Memmott was made President Elect of the British Ecological Society in 2019, and became President at the beginning of 2020.

The island is protected as part of the Hanford Reach National Monument, which was created out of lands surrounding the Hanford Site. The island is an important archeological site and is on the National Register of Historic Places. These cultural resources are being threatened by erosion resulting from a landslide changing the river's course. History Human habitation and use of Locke Island has varied significantly throughout time. Before the arrival of European settlers, Native Americans used the island and areas around it for fishing and other river-based activities. Use of the island largely ceased as Americans moved into the region and began to farm on both sides of the Columbia River, establishing the town of White Bluffs on the Benton County side of the river. This town, which was only a few miles south of Locke Island, was abandoned when the Hanford Site was constructed under the Manhattan Project. =Indigenous Use= Locke Island is located near the former sites of several Native American fishing sites that were primarily used by the Yakama, Nez Perce, and ancestors of the Wanapum. Two of these were called Tah-Koot and Wy-Yow-Na. Many of the people who fished in the area would camp on the island itself, with others traveling to the area from as far as Idaho to trade. Typically visitors who were not members of the tribes that frequented Tah-Koot and Wy-Yow-Na did not fish. According to a Native American who spoke with researchers in the early-20th century, most families who came to the area to fish would catch an average of 300 fish during their time there. Celebrations would occur in the campsites as late as 1904. Artifacts found on the island indicate a long and consistent period of human activity on the island. Erosion during the wet season of 1996‚Äì1997 unearthed material that had previously lain below the island's surface, indicating the presence of people as early as 2,000 years ago. Other material has been dated to being as recent as the 19th century. Obsidian cutting tools and arrowheads are abundant on the island. The lands were ceded to the United States in the treaty signed by the Umatilla and Yakama Tribes at the Walla Walla Council in 1855. =Abandonment= As white settlers moved into the Columbia Basin, Native Americans found less use for Locke Island and the surrounding fish encampments. The increasing settlers had a significant impact on the ecology of the river through over fishing and constructing dams. No roads or structures were built on the island, though ranching and farming did occur nearby. This was especially true on the Benton County side of the river, with the town of White Bluffs only being a few miles to the south. The island became part of an involuntary park when the Hanford Site was created under the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. Residents were forced from the area so the federal government could construct the site, which was used to make nuclear weapons. The site was surrounded by a wide security buffer to prevent information about the secret project from being leaked. As part of this buffer, Locke Island remained undeveloped. Much of the security buffer, including Locke Island, was placed in Hanford Reach National Monument in 2000 and continues to be closed to the public. Geology The island consists of alluvium that has been deposited by the Columbia River since the Pleistocene and overlies the Columbia River Basalt Group. Much of this is eroded remains of the Ringold Formation, which was placed by the Columbia River between 9 and 3 million years ago. The White Bluffs, which are a series of cliffs created by this erosion, are immediately east of the island. The White Bluffs became destabilized by water from the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project entering the groundwater system and flowing toward the Columbia River. This destabilization has caused portions of the cliff to slump into the river, including a large one at Locke Island. This slump has narrowed the eastern passage of the Columbia as it flows around the island, increasing erosion of the middle section of the island. In some locations, up to of the island's material on its eastern side has been removed by the river since 1996. The slump began sliding into the river in the 1970s, but has not moved appreciably since 1998. This erosion threatens the cultural artifacts left by millennia of human habitation before European settlement as well as salmon spawning sites downstream. Ecology Salmon in the Columbia River adjacent to Locke IslandLocke Island is located in the shrub-steppe region in the rain shadow of the Cascade Range. As such, its climate is characterized by low precipitation and extreme temperatures. While this was once an important salmon habitat, no salmon were observed to be spawning around the island as recently as 1999. Up to 81% of the area around the island seems conducive to spawning salmon. Canadian geese were also once abundant on Locke Island, with 129 nests having been counted on the island in 1957. Coyotes have limited the goose population in recent years so that numbers of successful nests have been kept to less than ten per year for several decades. The coyote population on Locke Island is unique among other islands in the Hanford Reach in that coyotes reside on the island rather than just being visitors. The island also supports deer and eagles. Flora on the island are similar to other regions of Eastern Washington and consist primarily of native grasses and short shrubs like sagebrush. This vegetation provides habitat for animals living on the island and is threatened by invasive species.

The upper part of this river begins in the northwest part of the zec Mars-Moulin and the intermediate part (Lac aux Rats Musqu√©s area, Lac des √élets and Simoncouche Lake) crosses the northeast part of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. This small valley is served by the route 175 (boulevard Talbot) and some secondary roads for the needs of forestry, recreational tourism and residents of this area. Forestry is the main economic activity in this valley; recreational tourism, second. The surface of the Simoncouche River is usually frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March, however the safe circulation on the ice is generally made from mid- December to mid-March.  Geography  The main neighboring watersheds of Simoncouche River are: * north side: Kenogami Lake, Chicoutimi River, rivi√®re aux Sables, Saguenay River; * east side: Lac William brook, Henriette brook, Chiens brook, Bras Henriette, Bras de Jacob Ouest, rivi√®re du Moulin; * south side: Cyriac River, Valiquette lake, Cyriac lake, Bras Sec. * west side: Cyriac River, Normand River, Hector brook, Chicoutimi River. The Simoncouche River originates from a forest stream (altitude: ). This source is located at: * north-east of the forest road R0215; * north-east of a curve of the Cyriac River; * north-east of route 175; * south-east of the confluence of the Simoncouche river and Kenogami Lake; * south of the confluence of the Chicoutimi River and the Saguenay River. From its source, the Simoncouche River flows over with a drop of especially in the forest zone, according to the following segments: * first towards the north-east, then branching towards the north-west notably by crossing the Muscat Rats Lake (length: ; altitude: ) to its mouth; * towards the northwest in particular by crossing Lac des √élets (length: ; altitude: ) at its full length to its mouth. Note: this lake has a T-shaped island; * towards the northwest in particular by crossing Simoncouche Lake (length: ; altitude: ); * to the west by crossing route 175, then following it on the west side, forming a hook towards the west, until a bridge on this last road; * north-east, up to the Chiens stream (coming from the south-east) draining Grand lac des Mouches and Petit lac des Mouches; * to the northwest by crossing route 175, up to Chaud stream; * north-west, to its mouth. The Simoncouche River flows into the bottom of Moncouche Bay (length: ) on the south shore of Kenogami Lake, at the entrance to Villa Marie Bay, in the sector of K√©nogami, in the city of Saguenay. The name Moncouche is often used to designate the neighboring bay, Villa Marie bay, at the bottom of which rises the Moncouche dike, a regulating structure for the waters of the lake. Behind the dyke is Petit Lac Moncouche. The confluence of the Simoncouche River is located at: * north-west of route 175; * south of the barrage de Portage-des-Roches; * south-west of Lac-K√©nogami village; * south-west of the confluence of the Chicoutimi River and the Saguenay River. From the confluence of the Simoncouche river with the Kenogami Lake, the current crosses this lake for towards the northeast until the barrage de Portage-des-Roches, then follows the course of the Chicoutimi River on to the east, then the northeast and the course of the Saguenay River on eastwards to Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.  Simoncouche Teaching and Research Forest (FERS)  20 minutes from downtown Chicoutimi, at kilometer 217 of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve, the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi (UQAC) operates the Simoncouche Teaching and Research Forest (FERS) over an area of 27 square kilometers. The FERS was created by the Minister of Forests to promote practical education and applied research in forestry. This mission was entrusted to the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi which already used in 1981 the facilities of the Ministry of Recreation, Hunting and Fishing. The FERS has several trails connecting the eight lakes in its territory, the most important of which are Lac des √élets (170 ha), Simoncouche (87 ha) and du D√©p√¥t (21 ha). The main tree species are poplar, birch, fir and spruce forests. The main species of fish are brook trout and white sucker. The FERS administers various forest management works and research activities take place throughout the territory: development of degraded forests, monitoring of the biodiversity of the territory, evaluation of the degradation of natural camping sites, impact of climate change on tree growth. The main buildings on the site include: the main chalet (six bedrooms upstairs, two meeting rooms and kitchen on the ground floor); research pavilion, boathouse, chalet at Lac du D√©p√¥t, Simoncouche beach, tent platforms in Simoncouche, Lac du D√©p√¥t and Lac des √élets, as well as several wilderness areas.Site - Forest of Education and de Recherche Simoncouche (FERS).

The aim of the armistice was the negotiations by which it was decided that the English would leave their last stronghold in the north of the country, M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas, on August 31, 1798. Five months later, to the day, as planned, on August 31, 1798, the British abandoned Saint-Domingue to the victory of Toussaint Louverture, who must however turn to another front, to the south, where the former French general Andr√© Rigaud gathered an army of mulattoes with the help of French planters to fight it. The armistice put an end to a war of liberation which left more than 10,000 dead and lasted four years: since the February 19, 1793, and the Treaty of Whitehall, the English took advantage of the lucrative taxation on the sugar plantations of Santo Domingo, while since the May 5, 1794 Toussaint Louverture had launched an offensive. The armistice was signed with the English general Thomas Maitland, only three days after arrival, on March 27, 1798, of H√©douville, sent from the directory, which must leave on October 23 of the same year, which mission was to discreetly incite Toussaint Louverture to engage his army in the attack on Jamaica and the United States, which the latter will be careful not to perform, to avoid losing all credit and part of his army. On the contrary, the black general would approach Maitland to encourage him too to trade. The armistice of March 30, 1798 was signed shortly after the arrival in early March 1798 of young general Thomas Maitland at the head of the British army, who was instructed to limit English losses, especially as the month of March 1798 saw a wave of desertions among black enlisted by the British troops, who lose more strong. By mid 1798, the U.S. Secretary of State Timothy Pickering confirmed that the United States would accept the resumption of commercial relations in case of victory of Toussaint Louverture, became then very likely scenario, and in November 1798 Toussaint Louverture sent Joseph Bunuel meet the main merchants of Philadelphia to negotiate the resumption of business, while the American State has given itself the means to rebuild a navy of war, in order to remove the French installed in Cuba, among which Pierre and Jean Lafitte, who would feed the piracy of the 1800s in the Caribbean. On June 13, 1799, Dr. Andrew Stevens, officially appointed consul general of the United States in April 1799, signed the tripartite commercial convention of 1799, establishing commercial relations between English, Americans and Haitians. The arrival in Cuba of refugees from Saint Domingue after the armistice of March 30, 1798 saw many become privateers during the quasi-war, which gives a first boost to commercial traffic in Cuba as shown by the values produced by the port of Santiago de Cuba between 1797 and 1801, a part coming from the catches of the French corsairs attacking the American ships trading with Saint Domingue. However, the armistice did not end the conflict within Saint Domingue, as Andr√© Rigaud would split with Louverture and initiate the War of Knives against him for control of the colony in June 1799 to July 1800, after which Rigaud fled to France and Louverture took command of the colony. Louverture would further consolidate control of the entire island by conquering the Spanish-ruled Captaincy General of Santo Domingo in December 1800 and abolishing chattel slavery throughout the island.

It has smooth bark, broadly lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and ribbed or wrinkled, shortened spherical or hemispherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus semiglobosa is a shrub tall or mallee that typically grows to a height of , and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth grey or light brown bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are square in cross-section and leaves that are the same shade of green on both sides, elliptic to egg-shaped, and wide. Adult leaves are broadly lance-shaped, the same shade of dull to slightly glossy green on both sides, and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, ribbed, and wide with a hemispherical operculum about the same length as the floral cup. The fruit is a woody, shortened spherical or hemispherical, ribbed or wrinkled capsule and wide with the valves protruding above the rim. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1976 by Ian Brooker in the journal Nuytsia and given the name Eucalyptus goniantha subsp. semiglobosa. In 1992, Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill raised the subspecies to species status as E. semiglobosa in the journal Telopea and the change has been accepted at the Australian Plant Census. The specific epithet (semiglobosa) is from the Latin semi- meaning \\"half\\" and globosa meaning \\"globose\\", referring to the operculum. Distribution and habitat This eucalypt is found in scattered populated growing on shallow sand over granite between the Cape Le Grand and Cape Arid National Parks in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. Conservation status Eucalyptus semiglobosa is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1972. Osceola is the 10th highest peak of the Okanogan Range, which is a sub-range of the North Cascades. Osceola Peak ranks 50th on Washington's highest 100 peaks, and 48th on the \\"Bulger List\\". The mountain is situated in the Pasayten Wilderness, on land managed by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Mount Carru, to the east. The mountain has a steep north face, but the south slope is covered in scree which allows a nontechnical climbing ascent. Precipitation runoff from Osceola Peak drains north into tributaries of the Similkameen River, or south into Eureka Creek, which is part of the Methow River drainage basin. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

By far the longest-lasting, however, was the Iowa Bystander, which spanned more than a century. During the peak period of African-American newspaper founding in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the African American population in Iowa was less than 20,000. As a result, the number of such papers established in Iowa is much lower than in some neighboring states such as Illinois.

He was the first student and the third director of the Canterbury Agricultural College. Knight was born in 1860; his parents were Richard and Lucy Knight. He received his secondary education at Christ's College in Christchurch. When the School of Agriculture of Canterbury University College opened at Lincoln on 19 July 1880, Knight was the first student to enrol. He graduated in 1882 with a Diploma of Agriculture. In 1887, he married Beatrice Dicken, the daughter of Thomas Dicken. They were to have three daughters. One of his daughters was the mother of the painter Austen Deans. In 1899, Knight was elected to the Board of Governors of his alma mater, by then called the Canterbury Agricultural College, and he remained a member until his death. He was chairman of the board from 1915 until 1926. He lost the chairmanship when the Canterbury members of the House of Representatives had a tie when they elected their representative in December 1926. The returning officer gave his casting vote to Knight's opponent, George Murray, and Knight temporarily lost his position on the board. In 1930, Knight was the inaugural Bledisloe Medal recipient. Knight had the Racecourse Hill property near Darfield from 1885. It was a large property and Knight grew the most wheat north of the Rakaia River; up to of his land were in wheat. When his property was cut up in the late 1890, Knight started breeding race horses. He started having success after 15 years and from 1915 until his death, it is estimated that his horses have won him NZ¬£76,000. His horse Malaga won the Auckland Cup in 1921, netting him NZ¬£3500. His mare Medley produced Ballymena and Limerick, both very successful horses. Knight was chairman of the Malvern County Council from 1911. He was chairman of the New Zealand Refrigeration Company from 1912. He was a member of the Canterbury Jockey Club. Knight died at Racecourse Hill on 3 October 1935.

He has been active in the anti-abortion movement, critical of the international community's focus on climate change, and has campaigned against same-sex marriage in Austria and Germany. Tschugguel is a founding member of The Reform Conservatives, a now-inactive Austrian conservative political party focused on abolishing the European Parliament. In November 2019 Tschugguel received international attention for stealing statues, reportedly of Pachamama, that were on display inside the Church of Santa Maria in Traspontina as part of the Amazon Synod, and throwing them off of the Ponte Sant'Angelo into the river Tiber. In March 2020 Tschugguel contracted SARS- CoV-2 during the coronavirus pandemic in Austria. He recovered a few weeks later after having been hospitalized in Vienna.  Personal life  Tschugguel was born in 1993 in Vienna and is a member of the von Tschugguel family, an old Tyrolean family that are part of the Austrian nobility. The family, originally of knightly status, was elevated to baronial status in 1705. His father, Walter Tschugguel, is a doctor in Vienna. Tschugguel was baptized and raised in the Lutheran faith. The Tschugguel family was historically Roman Catholic, until Tschugguel's great-grandfather converted to Lutheranism from Catholicism. When he was fifteen years old, Tschugguel converted to Roman Catholicism. He is a Traditionalist Catholic and attends the Tridentine Mass with the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter. Coat of Arms of the Tschugguel family Tschugguel was married in 2019 in a wedding celebrated by Athanasius Schneider, the auxiliary bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mary Most Holy in Astana. In March 2020, amidst the coronavirus pandemic, Taylor Marshall reported that Tschugguel had contracted SARS-CoV-2, was \\"in a bad way,\\" and had been hospitalized. He was hospitalized at Kaiser-Franz-Josef Hospital in Vienna and recovered a few weeks later.  Activism and views  Tschugguel began working for the conservative political organization Tradition, Family and Property when he was sixteen years old. He has worked with conservative politicians Ewald Stadler and Beatrix von Storch, as well as political activist Hedwig von Beverfoerde, to protest and campaign against abortion rights, same-sex marriage, and the inclusion of gender studies and sex education in schools in Germany and Austria. Tschugguel opposes immigration reform and allowing Muslim refugees into Austria and Germany. He claims to be a patriot and a monarchist. He is a spokesperson for the Young European Student Initiative, a non-partisan independent initiative of Christian and conservative university students. In 2013 he helped Ewald Stadler found The Reform Conservatives, an Austrian conservative political party focused on reversing the Maastricht Treaty and abolishing the European Parliament. In 2014 Tschugguel co-organized a bus tour in Germany with von Beverfoerde to support traditional marriage. In 2018 and 2019, he was the co- organizer of the Vienna March for Life. In May 2019 he organized Rosary for Austria, a Latin Mass and prayer event at the Karlskirche. On 21 October 2019 Tschugguel and an accomplice stole five statues, reportedly of the Inca fertility goddess Pachamama, from the Church of Santa Maria in Traspontina and threw them from the Ponte Sant'Angelo into the Tiber. The statues were on display as part of the Amazon Synod taking place in the Vatican. He came forward on 4 November 2019 in a YouTube video. Tschugguel, who had removed the statues believing them to be a violation of the First Commandment, received support from various high ranking Church officials after the incident, including Bishop Anthanasius Schneider, Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, and Cardinal Walter Brandm√ºller. Tschugguel's actions were criticized by Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂nborn, the Archbishop of Vienna, who called the act \\"scandalous and outrageous.\\" Since coming forward, Tschugguel went on a speaking tour in the United States organized by LifeSite News, the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property, and Taylor Marshall. In an interview published on 27 March 2020, it was revealed that Tschugguel and Marshall conspired originally to remove a tree planted in the Vatican Gardens during the Amazon Synod. When the fertility statues were displayed in the churches of Rome, Marshall, in Texas, instead paid the airfare for Tschugguel to come from Vienna to jettison the statues. Marshall would go on to edit and publish video footage of the removal and throwing of the statues on an anonymous YouTube channel. Tschugguel founded the St. Boniface Institute in 2019, with the goal of fighting paganism and globalism within the Catholic Church and to \\"rally those who do not want to bow down to 'Mother Earth'.\\" The institute is named for Saint Boniface who, according to tradition, cut down Donar's Oak and used the wood to build a church. Through the institute, Tschugguel connects different Traditionalist Catholic communities throughout Europe with each other. In a public address in 2019, Tschugguel criticized the United Nations and the European Union for their focus on climate change, calling it an agenda pushed by \\"leftist politicians, communist NGOs, and skillfully radicalized young teenagers from Scandinavia.\\" He went on to praise United States president Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, calling the action \\"true statesmanship\\", and called into question the Church and other international institutions' focus on the Amazon. In December 2019 Tschugguel organized a prayer protest outside of St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna. The protest was in response to the cathedral hosting the Life Ball, an LGBTQ-friendly annual charity event to raise money for HIV and AIDS awareness. Tschugguel was thanked by retired Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan√≤ for organizing the protest.\\"Vatican Envoy Who Invited Kim Davis to Papal Meeting Retires\\". The New York Times. Associated Press. 12 April 2016. Retrieved 12 April 2016. On 18 January 2020 Tschugguel protested alongside von Beverfoerde, retired Archbishop Vigan√≤, Roberto de Mattei, and Gabriele Kuby in Munich, asking Pope Francis and the German Bishops' Conference for \\"clarity and coherence\\" and to end \\"dissimulation and deception\\" in the Catholic Church in Germany. The group organizing the silent prayer protest, acting under the name Acies Ordinata, included 130 members of Catholic laity from Germany, Austria, Italy, Brazil, Chile, Canada, and the United States.

The team has an alliance with Richard Petty Motorsports. They have also competed in the NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series in the past. History =NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series= The team fielded the No. 82 Ford F-150 part-time in the Truck Series starting in 2012. They made their debut at Pocono with Sean Corr driving, finishing 25th. The team attempted one more race at Homestead, but they failed to qualify. Sean Corr made his first Truck starts at Daytona (which was a DNQ) and Talladega in 2013 as well as Pocono for the second straight year. The team had other drivers in addition to Corr in 2014, with Jake Crum racing at Charlotte and dirt driver Cody Erickson attempting to qualify for Eldora. After he failed to qualify to the race after just coming short in the last-chance qualifier, the team invited him back for a pavement start at Martinsville that October, which he did qualify for. Empire fielded K&N; Series driver Austin Hill for four races in 2015 at Daytona, Dover, Talladega, and Martinsville. Corr made his first start at Eldora that year in the No. 82, with Erickson driving a second truck for the team, the No. 35, where the team leased owner points from Win- Tron Racing instead of fielding a separate truck of their own so Erickson could have a better chance of qualifying (which he successfully did). They did the same thing at Martinsville with Jim Weiler since Austin Hill was already in the No. 82, but Weiler did not qualify for what would have been his debut race in the Truck Series. With the team forming an alliance with Richard Petty Motorsports starting in 2016, they switched to run the famous Petty No. 43 for their primary truck. Austin Hill returned to Empire at Daytona, where he did not qualify for the race, which had a large entry list of 43 trucks for just 32 spots. Hill was set to leave after that to form his own team, the No. 20, so he did not run any more races for the team after that. The team picked up Korbin Forrister to drive the No. 43 at Eldora, who was making his first Truck attempt after his team, the No. 59 for Lira Motorsports, closed down after just two races. The team entered a second truck for that race again this year, with the team bringing back their old number, the No. 82, for Sean Corr. Both Empire trucks failed to qualify for that race. The team has not attempted any more Truck Series races since then, as they have focused on expanding their ARCA team back up to three cars. =ARCA Menards Series= 2009‚Äì2016 The first series the team raced in was the ARCA Racing Series. Beginning in 2009, the team fielded the No. 82 Ford for Sean Corr part-time. In 2009, Corr attempted Kentucky, both races at Pocono (his home track) and Chicago. For 2010, the team switched numbers for unknown reasons to the No. 83 at Daytona, but they used the No. 82 again for the rest of their attempts, which were at Texas, Talladega, Michigan, and both Pocono races again with Corr and New Jersey Motorsports Park with road course ringer Robert Mitten. In 2011, Corr ran for rookie of the year in ARCA and the No. 82 team ran full-time for the first time. Corr finished ninth in points and scored two top-tens at Iowa and Madison. Former driver Richard Johns was announced to serve as the team's crew chief that year. Corr started the 2012 season with a bang by winning the pole for the season opener at Daytona after Bobby Gerhart's time was disqualified. However, they finished last because of engine issues. Due to sponsorship, the team announced they had to cut back to part-time after four races, and they only ran the first race at Pocono for the remainder of that year. After just that race, they decided to focus their attention to the Truck Series. The team returned to ARCA at Daytona, Talladega, and Pocono in 2013. Corr got the team's first top-5 finish at Daytona. Empire did not attempt any more races until the second Pocono race, where rookie Mason Mitchell drove the No. 82 after he was released from Roulo Brothers Racing. The team would run the rest of the races with Mitchell in his quest for rookie of the year. In 2014, the team fielded two cars at Daytona with Canadian Cole Powell driving the No. 8 (switching numbers from the No. 82) and Sean Corr in the No. 48 for the team in a partnership with James Hylton Motorsports. The only other ARCA race Empire ran in 2014 was at Salem in September with Cody Erickson, who drove for the team at the Truck race at Eldora earlier in the year. They brought three cars to Daytona in 2015. Austin Hill and Patrick Staropoli each made their ARCA debuts in the No. 8 and 82 cars, respectfully, and Corr returned to the No. 48 with the alliance with Hylton's team. For the third year in a row, Corr drove at Daytona in the No. 48. Empire Racing entered one other car, the No. 82, for Dylan Lupton, who was without a ride at the start of the season after driving in the Xfinity Series part-time the year before. For the rest of the year, the team teamed with James Hylton Motorsports for additional races at Nashville, IRP, and Chicago with Dylan Martin as well as Sean Corr running Talladega and the first Pocono race for the first time in three years. 2017‚Äìpresent Thad Moffitt driving his No. 46 at Pocono in 2018. The team's main car in 2017 was the No. 46, which Corr drove at Daytona. Thad Moffitt, Richard Petty's great-grandson, made his ARCA debut in the car for three races at Nashville, Toledo, and IRP. John Ferrier, who is from Middletown, New York (not far from Goshen, where the Corr family is from), joined the team and merged it with his own. He drove the No. 46 at both Pocono races. Ferrier returned to the No. 46 for Daytona in 2018. Kaden Honeycutt made his first two series starts for Empire at Salem and IRP driving the No. 43, a second car to the No. 46. Corr also drove the No. 43 at his usual starts at Daytona and Pocono. He ran Talladega in the No. 46. Towards the end of the 2018 season, the team purchased Chevrolet's from the closed Mason Mitchell Motorsports team. They had been trying to switch over their fleet of cars to Chevrolets since Richard Petty Motorsports had already switched from Ford to Chevrolet for their Cup team. In some races, such as Pocono in June, the team had to run their Fords unbadged (in other words, with the Ford logo covered up) due to RPM's manufacturer change. The team expanded back to three cars for Daytona for the first time since 2015, with the team entering the No. 43 for Corr, the No. 44 (another Petty number) for Ferrier, and the No. 46 for Moffitt, who turned 18 and was now eligible to run Daytona. The team's late model driver, Lexi Gay, attempted Nashville in the No. 44. Moffitt and the No. 46 team attempted six more races that year (plus withdrawing from three others). ThePitLane.com reported in November 2019 that there were rumors Empire may be leaving ARCA for the NASCAR Xfinity Series starting in 2020. An image of Gay's No. 44 car from the Nashville race in 2019 is for sale on RacingJunk.com, which ThePitLane claims has been on there for months. Thad Moffitt was announced to be driving a car for DGR-Crosley at Daytona in February instead of with Empire. The team filed an entry for Daytona with Corr driving a No. 8 car (one of the team's old numbers before they partnered with Petty). Also, as per the Daytona entry list, John Ferrier appears to have restarted his own team this season instead of driving with Empire.

The pyramid-shaped south summit is in elevation, and the lower north butte is in elevation. Spectacle Buttes are situated 77 miles northeast of Seattle in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, on land managed by the Wenatchee National Forest. Spectacle Buttes ranks 78th on Washington's highest 100 peaks, 81st on the \\"Bulger List\\", and seventh-highest in the Entiat Mountains. The nearest higher peak is Marmot Pyramid on Mount Maude, to the west- northwest. Precipitation runoff from the peaks drains into headwaters of the Entiat River. The first ascent of the south peak was made by Rowland Tabor and Dwight Crowder on August 20, 1953. Climate Lying east of the Cascade crest, the area around Spectacle Buttes is a bit drier than areas to the west. Summers can bring warm temperatures and occasional thunderstorms. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. With its impressive height, Spectacle Buttes can have snow in late-spring and early-fall, and can be very cold in the winter. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Operational history The first trip from LZ 23 took place on May 11, 1914. As an airship of the army, LZ 23 had the identification, Z VIII. Z VIII was launched in Metz at the end of July 1914 as it spent many months in its hangar without gas and not being used. Due to the critical global political situation at that time, the commander of Z VIII, Captain Andr√©e, finally was able to obtain the gas to fill the ship for operational readiness. At the beginning of the war in early August 1914, the Zeppelin was able to fly reconnaissance and disruptive flights against the marching French troops. On August 21, 1914, Z VIII received the same order as Z VII, reconnaissance and bombing of French troops that had entered the empire in Alsace. On the way to the reconnaissance area, the Zeppelin was bombarded and damaged in a friendly fire incident. Over the enemy lines, Z VIII dropped its bomb load of . The French managed to damage the airship's controls, causing it to float around uncontrollably, and the holes in the shell caused by the shelling led to the loss of the gas providing lift. The gas loss finally forced an emergency landing in the French part of Lorraine in the Forest of Badonviller. The ship's commander destroyed the secret papers and the crew disembarked. An attempt was made to burn the zeppelin, but the small amount of gas remaining in the cells could not be ignited. A squadron of French cavalry attacked the ship's crew, who managed to get through to the German lines and report their reconnaissance results. The wreck of LZ 23 was looted by French troops but this material fell back into German hands due to the advance of the German army.

HarperCollins released the book in March 2018.  Crimes and trial  The deadly crime spree the book covers began in January 2013 when attorney and Justice of the Peace Eric Williams shot and killed Kaufman County, Texas Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse as he exited his car in the courthouse parking lot while his Kim Williams waited in the car for him. Then, two months later, Williams, with his wife again in the car with him, drove to the home of District Attorney Mike McLelland, 63, and his wife Cynthia, 65, and shot them inside their house. They were found dead from gunshot wounds on March 30, 2013. The motive for Williams, as testified to in court by his wife Kim, was his anger over a burglary, in which Williams had been arrested and convicted after being caught taking $600 worth of computer monitors from the county's IT storage room, causing him to lose both his position as justice of the peace and his license to practice law. His wife later testified that Williams told her he felt McLelland, Hasse and others had set him up. The book describes Kaufman, a small, quiet Texas town where everyone knows each other, as being thrown into chaos when a county assistant district attorney is killed in broad daylight, then shortly after the district attorney and his wife are murdered as well. In December 2014, a jury convicted Eric Williams of capital murder in the 2013 death of Cynthia McLelland. A judge then sentenced him to death. Kim Williams pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. Author Casey attended Eric Williams's trial as part of her research for the book. After the convictions, Casey visited Williams on death row for an in-prison interview. She interviewed Kim Williams in prison as well. Those prison interviews, which were the first by a journalist with the Kaufman killers, are included in the book.  In the news  In Plain Sight drew attention in February 2019 when 19-year-old Kevin Alvarez, a suspect in the machete killing of a 15-year-old boy, was pictured entering the Bronx Supreme Court clutching Casey's book about the real-life murders of Texas prosecutors McLelland and Hasse. The prosecution did not comment about Alvarez taking the book to court or whether they believed it was meant as a threat. News accounts described the suspect, a purported gang member, as holding the copy of the book behind his back and appearing as if he were flashing the title toward prosecutors.

By the 14th century, it was almost completely demolished.  Location  The mausoleum was located in today's Borgo district of Rome, between old Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican and the Mausoleum of Hadrian. Its foundations have been discovered under the first north block of via della Conciliazione, which now includes the Auditorium Conciliazione and the Palazzo Pio. This would place it north of the Meta Romuli. History The Terebinthus Neronis was a monumental burial erected in the Roman age on the right bank of the Tiber, near the intersection of two Roman roads, the Via Cornelia and the Via Triumphalis, in an area outside the pomerium (the religious boundary around Rome); this area, named Ager Vaticanus, hosted at that time numerous cemetery areas such as the nearby Vatican Necropolis and, due to its proximity to the Campus Martius represented an ideal area to build the monumental tombs of the members of the Roman upper class.Petacco (2016), p. 33 It lay next to another large mausoleum, the so- called Meta Romuli, a pyramid which was demolished in 1499 by Pope Alexander VI (r. 1492‚Äì1503). The Terebinthus Neronis is supposed to have had a circular plan and the shape of a giant tumulus tomb. While both monuments survived the great changes due to the construction of the old St. Peter's Basilica, the former was destroyed already during the Middle Ages, while the latter survived until the Renaissance age becoming an important element of Rome's topography. The first mention of the Terebinth is by Benedictus Canonicus Sancti Petri (c. 1144), which names it \\"obeliscus Neronis\\",Gigli (1990) p. 84 and by the Mirabilia Urbis Romae (a 12th-century guide of the city), where it is described like a circular monument composed with two superimposed cylinders (like Castel Sant'Angelo) lined with marble slabs and it is called Tiburtinum Neronis;Mirabilia, 20, 3, 5-10 the name Tiburtinum derives from the material of its revetment, the travertine (lapis tiburtinus, that is from the city of Tivoli in Latin),Castagnoli, (1958), p. 241 while the name Neronis (\\"of Nero\\" in Latin) is typical of many toponyms and names of monuments of the Vatican area (like prata Neronis, pons Neronis, etc.). The Name Terebinthus originates from a passage in the Naturalis Historia of Pliny the ElderNat. Hist., 17,44 which writes that in a place in the Ager Vaticanus grew a large terebinth tree (a tree belonging to the family of the Anacardiaceae). According to the religious traditionPseudo-Marcellus, Acta Petri et Pauli Saint Peter was buried under a terebinth, and due to the assonance between the two words terebinthus and tiburtinum Pietro Mallio, canon of Saint Peter, around 1180 named the monument Terebinthus, moving the place of the crucifixion of Saint Peter at the top of today's via della Conciliazione. The identification between tree and monument implied that the site of the martyrdom of Saint Peter was placed either between the Terebinthus and the Meta Romuli, or between the latter and the obelisk of the Circus of Nero (and in some medieval description the monument itself is named \\"obelisk of Nero\\"), or in the mid- point between the two pyramids (ad Terebinthus inter duas metas...in Vaticano) and consequently the Terebinthus (either as monument or as tree) was for a long time a popular subject in the depictions of Saint Peter's martyrdom and in the representations of the city in the Middle Ages.Petacco (2016), p. 34 Some examples are the Stefaneschi Polyptych by Giotto;Gigli (1990) p. 85 a polyptych by Jacopo di Cione; one tile of Filarete's Bronze Doors in Old St. Peter's Basilica; the frescoes on the vaults of the Basilica of San Francesco in Assisi by Cimabue;Petacco (2016), p. 35 and possibly the fresco of The Vision of the Cross in Raphael's Rooms in the Vatican. According to the Mirabilia the terebinth too, like the nearby meta Romuli, lost very soon its stone revetment, used to pave the quadriporticus and the stairs of Saint Peter's church; in its description of the monument the anonymous writer uses the past tense, implying that at his time (12th century) the monument had been already partially destroyed. The terebinth survived until the 14th century.Coarelli (1974) p. 322  Description  The terebinth tree (in the lower right) between Castel Sant'Angelo and the Meta Romuli (with the Pyramid of Cestius in the lower left) in a tile of Filarete's Bronze doors in Saint Peter The medieval guides describe the terebinthus as a very tall structure (comparable with the Castrum Crescentii, that is Hadrian's Mausoleum), with a circular plan and two elements (like a castrum). Unfortunately, due to the vagueness of their descriptions, all the depictions of the monument (by Giotto, Cimabue, etc.) have very little in common with its real appearancePetacco (2016) p. 37 Based on the middle age descriptions, it has been hypothesized that the terebinthus was a tomb of tumulus type, like the so-called tomb of the Curiatii at the beginning of the 6th mile of the Appian Way;Petacco (2016) p. 38 In this case, the circular monument was composed of a large plinth tiled with travertine; above it, there was a tumulus of earth surmounted with a cylinder in masonry. On the top of it, towered the statue of the defunct or a memorial stone. In 1948‚Äì49, during the works for the construction of the first block of the north side of Via della Conciliazione, several semicircular stone blocks carved by a 8 cm deep groove accompanied by symmetrical double dovetail recesses came to light. They belonged either to the drain at the base of the monument, or to the plinth covering; in the latter case, the groove with dovetail recesses has to be interpreted as the interlocking of a balustrade. Depending on the hypothesis, the terebinth had a diameter of 20 m (in the former case) or of 22 m (in the latter case). The location of the terebinth resulting from the excavations of 1948‚Äì49, northwest of the Meta Romuli, is in contradiction with that given by all the middle age descriptions, which say that the monument lay northeast of the pyramid.Petacco (2016) p. 39  References   Sources     External links  Category:Ancient Roman buildings and structures in Rome Category:Buildings and structures demolished in the 14th century Category:Rome R.

It is a Grade I listed building. History New Place was commissioned by Mrs A. S. Franklyn in 1904. Resident in nearby Shedfield, Mrs Franklyn had inherited a large early 17th Century mansion, 12, Welsh Back, Bristol, which was scheduled for demolition. Wanting a new home in which to incorporate elements salvaged from the Bristol house, and to commemorate her ancestral connections with William Shakespeare, in 1904 she commissioned Edwin Lutyens to design a new house, named after New Place in Stratford-upon-Avon. The house was complete by 1906, with the contract for completion signed in a week in May of that year when Lutyens finalised four contracts on the same day. He described his triumph in a letter to his wife, written while on a train to Devon: \\"Hemingway has signed contract for ¬£17,500, Dolgorouki accepts ¬£15,000, Birds ¬£7800, Mrs Franklin (sic) ¬£9300. So this week, signed and sealed, ¬£34,600\\". In 1908, Mrs Franklyn gave the house to her son, Henry Arden Franklyn, whose middle name recalled the family's Shakespearean connections through their descent from Shakespeare's mother, Mary Arden. In the 1950s, the house was sold and housed a prep school. Since the 1980s, it has operated as a hotel, under a number of managing companies. Architecture and description The house is built entirely of dark-red brick, from the brickworks at Danehill, Hampshire. The central block is of two storeys, with three-story matching wings. The style is Jacobethan and Lutyens originally intended that the E-plan house would have stepped gables, styled after Montacute House in Somerset, but these were not constructed. The interior contains substantial fittings from Mrs Franklyn's Bristol mansion, including fireplaces, over mantels, doorcases and panelling. Lutyens admitted subsequently that he \\"did not much like the house\\", which is now a Grade I listed building.

It was intended that there should be at least three minutes of natural history footage for every half-hour episode, and twenty scorpions, ten praying mantises, three giant toads, a number of snakes, tortoises, terrapins, barn owls and pigeons trained to dance had been brought to Corfu, together with six hundred frozen mice, as food for the snakes. At the end of July 1987, Gerald Durrell flew out to Corfu to be present for the last few days of the filming. He gave invaluable advice to the production team at the scripting stage, demanding the power of veto over only one thing ‚Äì the casting of his mother. He felt Hannah Gordon fitted the bill perfectly: > She's absolutely superb. She picks up beautifully my mother's slightly > flustered, not-quite-with-it-half-the-time air, and not knowing, if the > family were squabbling, whose side to take. None of the family's three villas proved to be suitable locations fifty years on, and substitutes had to be found (for the record, the Villa Fundana near Skripero stood in for the Strawberry-Pink Villa, the Curcumeli Villa at Afra was used for the interiors of the Daffodil-Yellow Villa and the Bogdanos Villa near Pyrghi for the exteriors, while the Snow-White Villa was impersonated by Kyriakis' House at Poulades). To celebrate the end of the filming, Gerald Durrell sent out a home-made invitation, decorated with his cartoon animals, for all concerned to come to a party and barbecue at the grand old Curcumeli mansion at Afra: > The Real Durrells invite the Other Durrells, Spiro, Theo and all who worked > on the production (even the Producer). For the sake of the reputation of the > BBC, please endeavour to remain sober for at least fifteen minutes.

A 230-minute selection of excerpts from the concert was first released in 1985 on a pair of Pioneer Artists Laserdiscs, subsequently appearing on a pair of Bel Canto Paramount Home Video VHS videocassettes in 1989 and on a Pioneer Classics DVD in 1998. A remastered double DVD of the film was issued by Deutsche Grammophon in 2009. Background The Metropolitan Opera's first performance was given on 22 October 1883 at its former home on the junction of Broadway and 39th Street in New York City: a staging of Charles Gounod's Faust starring Italo Campanini in the title role and Christine Nilsson as Marguerite. With the one hundredth anniversary of that occasion chancing to fall on a Saturday, the Met chose to commemorate its centenary with a two-part gala comprising a matin√©e at 2 p.m. and an evening session at 8 p.m. More than seventy singers were invited to participate, chosen either for their eminence or their long association with the house. Performing on a series of sets created by the most distinguished designers in the Met's history, they sang arias, duets and ensembles from an eclectic range of operas as well as a few items drawn from other genres. There were also contributions from the Met's chorus and resident ballet company as well as some purely orchestral selections. The entire event was broadcast live on both radio and television in the United States and in some other countries. The US television broadcast was supported by a grant from the Texaco Philanthropic Foundation, Inc., with supplementary help from the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation, Inc., and the National Endowment For the Arts. The production of Deutsche Grammophon's DVD of the gala was supported by the Charles A. Dana Foundation.

Financial considerations, he wrote, had led the Metropolitan Opera to stage a concert which, including intermissions, ran for some eleven hours. The result was that \\"there were many stretches of unremarkable singing by minor or obscure artists\\". Indeed, \\"there were so many obscure names or unfamiliar faces that the listener had to keep diving into the program to learn their identities, and even then was seldom the wiser\\". Every opera company needed singers who, although well schooled and competent, were more or less anonymous, but it was questionable whether such artists should figure prominently in what was a once-in-a-lifetime jamboree. The Met's brisk stage management had not helped matters by hustling singers through their contributions without allowing the customary encores or floral tributes, or even more than a few ovations. It was disappointing to spend a long time at an event such as this without finding oneself shedding a nostalgic tear. This was not to say that the Met had not done \\"a magnificent job of hugging itself\\". Dotted amongst the gala were many moments that were \\"thrilling\\" and even \\"euphoric\\". √âva Marton was \\"galvanizing\\" in Turandot's \\"In questa reggia\\". Ruggero Raimondi was \\"wickedly funny\\" in Basilio's \\"La calunnia\\". Joan Sutherland's \\"glittering\\" \\"Bel raggio lusinghier\\" was the most ecstatic item of the entire event, and the most enthusiastically applauded. The Met's chorus played only a small part in the proceedings, but acquitted themselves well in the Prelude and \\"Hymn to the sun\\" from Mascagni's Iris. Catherine Malfitano and Alfredo Kraus were \\"touching\\" in a duet from Gounod's Rom√©o et Juliette. Nicolai Gedda was \\"excitingly ardent\\" in \\"Una furtive lagrima\\". In the trio from the concluding pages of Der Rosenkavalier, Kathleen Battle and Frederica von Stade sang \\"delectably\\", and Elisabeth S√∂derstr√∂m was able to present a three-dimensional portrait of the Feldmarschallin despite having only a few minutes in which to do so. Mirella Freni and Pl√°cido Domingo were \\"affecting\\" in a love duet fron Otello. Preceded by a \\"somewhat ludicrous caricature of opera ballet\\" in which the Met's dancers enacted the Bacchanale from Samson et Dalila, Renato Bruson and Grace Bumbry performed a duet from Nabucco that was particularly enjoyable. Bruson was the epitome of cool serenity, but Bumbry sang electrifyingly in a voice that sounded \\"richer and more rested\\" than it had for a considerable while. It was after the final intermission, with midnight approaching, that the gala truly melted hearts. The curtain rose to reveal twenty-five of the Met's most distinguished former luminaries seated at the back of the stage like jurors in a vocal competition. Among them were Helen Jepson, Dorothy Kirsten, Zinka Milanov, Jarmila Novotn√°, Bidu Say√£o, Eleanor Steber, Ris√´ Stevens, Ferruccio Tagliavini, Cesare Valletti and Ram√≥n Vinay. Their presence endowed the concert with a feeling of historical significance that it had thitherto lacked. It was worth the price of one's ticket just to watch the expressions on their faces as they listened to their successors singing in front of them. Leona Mitchell and Giuliano Ciannella sang the nuptial duet from Madama Butterfly, and the last of three laudable selections from Rossini came in the form of a \\"delectable exhibition of ... ensemble precision\\" in the finale to Act 1 of L'italiana in Algeri. Marilyn Horne then lifted the occasion onto a new level of feeling and drama in a \\"sumptuous\\" rendition of \\"Mon c≈ìur s'ouvre √† ta voix\\", after which, to the manifest delight of the audience, she offered a wordless but eloquent embrace to Ris√´ Stevens, the pre-eminent Dalila of her era. Birgit Nilsson, in a voice that betrayed her sixty-five years yet was still something to marvel at, performed Isolde's Narrative and Curse. One of her admirers was so overcome that an usher had to restrain him from invading the stage with a bouquet. In the evening's only encore, Nilsson then offered a Swedish folk song which, she explained, had been a favourite of her compatriot namesake, Christine Nilsson, who had been Faust's Marguerite on the opening night of the old Met in 1883. Leontyne Price and Luciano Pavarotti delivered a culminating, \\"soaring\\" love duet from Un ballo in maschera, the tenor \\"in clarion voice\\", the soprano more slender of form than of late but \\"never in recent years ... more voluptuous or freer\\" in her singing. But neither of them was likely to linger in the memory as vividly as Horne putting her arms around Stevens, or Nilsson's simple melody from her homeland. It was episodes such as these that were \\"the real stuff that opera galas are made of\\". Joseph McLellan reviewed the gala on Laserdisc in The Washington Post on 31 May 1985. It was, he wrote, \\"the most spectacular event in the history of opera\\". From the very first note of the Bartered bride overture in the middle of the afternoon to Luciano Pavarotti and Leontyne Price duetting in Verdian ecstasy in the small hours of the morning, \\"it was operatic caviar\\". No previous concert had brought together such a dazzling constellation of opera stars for a single event. The quality of the performances was uneven, but the best of them were \\"stratospheric\\". Nothing like this gala had ever been presented before Pioneer's pair of Laserdiscs omitted the gala's weaker items and abbreviated singers' comings and goings. The audio quality that they offered far outclassed that of PBS's broadcast. Collectors who enjoyed concerts of operatic excerpts sung by first class artists were sure to find Pioneer's release the most important issue of the year, and maybe even of the decade.

The first reports of the incident were controversial. During the shooting, the attacker was shot dead by a sniper. One FSB officer died on the spot, another died the next day and a few more were injured. One bystander was slightly injured. After the incident, security officials displayed aggression to the reporters covering the event. The attack took place on the eve of the , when President Putin was at a festive concert dedicated to this day, and the shooting also came hours after Putin's annual press conference. According to preliminary data, the attacker was alone, and his name was Yevgeny Manyurov, 39, who was from a small town near Moscow. Due to the inconsistency of the special services, the shooting continued after Manyurov was killed; this may have led to additional casualties.We analyzed videos from Moscow‚Äôs FSB headquarters shooting. One of the injuries was likely caused by security agents after the shooter was dead. Soon after the shooting, there was report that the attacker \\"was shouting slogans typical of Islamic State\\", but in his apartment, insignia of the NOD movement, known for its provocations against the opposition, was found. The Investigative Committee of Russia opened a criminal investigation into an attempt on the life of a law enforcement officer.

The stories are: * The Angel in the Window to the Orient * Under the Flag of Gold * Concerto in O Minor for Harp and Nitroglycerin * A Midwinter Morning‚Äôs Dream * C√¥tes de Nuit and Picardy Roses * Burlesque Between Zuydcoote and Bray-Dunes Six stories =The Angel in the Window to the Orient= Abstract San Francesco del Deserto, Venice In the Venetian Lagoon, San Francesco del Deserto is an island that home to a Franciscans monastery. In 1917, Corto went here and asked the monks for a copy of a map, drawn on a missionary's skin. This coulds indicate him the location of the Sapa Inca Atahualpa's seven mines, around the Mara√±√≥n River, at Peru. These mines are also the legendaries Seven Cities of Cibola and the mythic El Dorado. But, on this document, only six are represented on the document and the seventh is missing. Thus, a monk advises Corto to go to Venice, in the Venetian Ghetto, to meet Melchisedech the rabbi, who owns a diary describing all cities. On site, he discovers that a page showing the location of the seventh city is missing from the book. Would the responsible be a strange paralytic woman living in a Venetian palace, nicknamed \\"The Angel in the Window to the Orient\\" ? Recently, an Austrian plane often flies over her house. This little game intrigues Antonio Sorrentino, the Carabinieri captain. With few of his men and Corto, he goes to the palace to unravel the mystery. Inside, the sailor discover that the \\"paralytic woman\\" is in fact Venexiana Stevenson, his ennemy whom he has already faced in Honduras (cf. the story \\"Banana Conga\\", in the volume Beyond the Windy Isles), who now wants to find the El Dorado. If the Carabinieries liquidated her Austrian complices, she manages to escape their. \\"Atahuallpa, Inca XIIII\\". Portrait located in Berlin Ethnologisches Museum, Staatliche Museen, Berlin, Germany (Ethnological Museum of Berlin, Germany) Analysis This story is a transition between Corto's adventures in the America (in the volume Under the Sign of Capricorn and Beyond the Windy Isles) and in Europe (in this volume). In the previous story, in Peru, the sailor met a monk who told him about this mysterious map kept at Venice. So he went to this city to find it. To document this story, Hugo Pratt explains that he drew information from the books of a missionary institute in Verona (Veneto, Italy), the Comboni. This place is overflowing with of books nibbled by rats, which were written by missionaries stationed in South America. The latter were in close contact with the natives. So, according to Pratt, this information are so important that people from Peru or Brazil come there to study it and learn Indian dialects. Hugo Pratt enjoyed to shows his childhood city, Venice, as he will do in other future stories, like Fable of Venice. Thus, he guides the reader between venetians isles and buildings. Scarso, the man who serves the sole (the \\"sfogio\\") really existed, who worked in Malamocco (village of the Lido where the comics creator has a house). In addition, various places are superbly drawn: the Piazza San Marco (with the St Mark's Basilica, the winged lion ‚Äî the Lion of Venice ‚Äî and the Doge's Palace), Santa Maria della Salute, etc. Then, through Corto's sentences, Pratt explains this city is so beautiful that it drives lazy, it is difficult to leave it. =Under the Flag of Gold= Abstract Map of the Italian Front, Battle of Caporetto At the north of the Adriatic Sea, war is raging during the Battle of Caporetto (1917), notably setting against Italians and Austro-Hungarian. The fallen monarchy of Montenegro hid royal gold at Sette Casoni (), in the middle of the Italian front. Thus, the Montenegran Republican Army instructed Corto Maltese to recover it. This \\"pirate\\" has a complexe plan to achieve this goal, involving partners of different nationalities. Lieutnant Radesky, an Austrian, secretly wathes operation on board an observation balloon and diverts the attention of his compatriots from the city. Meanwhile, scottishes and frenches soldiers obtain golden bars in a church right under the noses of the Austrians Uhlans. Then, Radesky is recovered by Americans (including a paramedic named Hernestway, who reminds Ernest Hemingway). Also, the fortune is load in a Greek gunboat piloted by Onatis (evoking Aristotle Onassis), where Corto is waiting the end of the operation. Analysis This story takes place during a war overturns European borders and regimes. Since 1910, Montenegro constituted an independent kingdom, before being incorporated in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Fighting with the Allies, the Montenegro was occupied by Austro-Hungarians troops. Corto Maltese evokes constants moving borders during the conflict. For example, a village can be Italian or Austrian depending on the days. This was the case of Lozzo di Cadore, on the Piave, in Veneto. So he stayed put while the fonts changed. Through this process, he manages to meet people who cans help him. Even if his accomplices are from various nationalities, they all come together under a same flag, gold. =Concerto in O Minor for Harp and Nitroglycerin= Abstract The Dubhlinn Gardens, are located adjacent to Dublin Castle. In octobre 1917, enriched by Montenegrin gold, Corto Maltese helps Sinn F√©in to resist against British Army. He learns that one of their members, O‚ÄôSullivan, has betrayed them and is responsible for the execution of Pat Finnucan by Britishes. The latter was the leader of the movement and the symbol of the Irish Revolution. In Dublin, the Maltese meets the deceased's wife, Moira \\"Banshee\\" O‚ÄôDanann, who wants to avenge her husband. With her help, Corto enters the British general headquarters (into Dublin Castle) and detonates it. But inside, he discover an overwhelming secret, which his friend Sean Finnucan confirms. This one explains that his brother Pat was the real traitor. But Sean refused to reveal the truth about him; he had to pass for a hero, a martyr, to galvanize the revolutionaries. And the real hero was O‚ÄôSullivan, who was a spy against Britishes; so he made it look like he was a traitor. No one should know, even Moira. When Corto finds her on a beach, he suggests her to leave with him. Only, she consider herself a banshee, who brings misfortune to others. Also, she musts stay to help the revolution. Modern illustration of a banshee. Analysis This insolite title speaks of Ireland and its struggle for freedom: * \\"√ì\\" is a patronymic term in Irish names; * The Celtic harp is a square harp particularly traditional in Ireland (cl√°irseach); * Nitroglycerin evokes this violent conflict. To build this story, Pratt based him on documents and testimonies. Thus, he meets a Pat Finnucan's niece, whose the story inspired him to his episode. He also exchanged with his friend Patricia Frawley, an Irish American, from Wheeling (West Virginia). She physically inspired him the character of Moira O‚ÄôDanann. Pat Finnucan's headstone features the quote \\"Fianna\\". In the Irish mythology, these were groups of semi-independent warriors. In more recent history, this word has been used for the name Fianna √âireann, an Irish nationalist youth organisation founded in 1909. Other elements are mentioned in this story, such as the Easter Rising, led by Patrick Pearse. This bloody event led to the recognition of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, then to the Irish Free State, in 1922. =A Midwinter Morning's Dream= Abstract Stonehenge in July 2007. Stonehenge, a legendary place in England, Wiltshire... 21 December 1917, for the winter solstice, many creatures from Celtic mythology are meeting to discuss a dramatic event. Germans will soon attack England. And with them will come characters from Germanic mythology, who coulds threaten them! Exactly as during the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain (contemporary to the Arthurian cycle). So it takes a mortal to help them. Corto, who sleeps nearby, is awakened Puck, changed from raven and instructed to support him. The sailor discovers a dying man, Major Vortigern Welsh, of the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry and member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The latter, who committed suicide, warns him against his wife Rowena, a German spy, because of his misfortunes. With her brothers Hengist and Horsa, she plans to attack Tintagel Castle (Cornwall), where Allies are meeting. On site, spies command a German U-boat to attack the castle, while the personnel of the British corvette is at anchor. Corto therefore pilots a tugboat to sink the submarine. Shortly after, a trial condemns Rowena. But, fair play, she gives her Iron Cross to the sailor. In addition, this one is decorated by a Conspicuous Gallantry Medal. Later, back to Stonehenge, Corto sleeps nearby again. Oberon congratulate Puck, who admits having snatched his medals from the Maltese. So Corto won't know if his adventure was true... or a Midwinter Morning's Dream. The outer and upper wards of the ruined Tintagel Castle. Analysis As the title shows, this story clearly alludes to A Midsummer Night's Dream, a famous comedy written by William Shakespeare in 1595/96. Here we find characters from the play, Oberon and Puck. While the play takes place during St. John's Day, the summer solstice, the comic is set during the winter solstice. In this story, Oberon evokes the Huon of Bordeaux, a chanson de geste where he is also present and he is showing like the child of Morgan le Fay and Julius Caesar. As in the Trojan War, a conflict between two existing countries is combined with a conflict between their respective mythologies. Also, various elements from the Arthurian legend are transposed here. Merlin and Morgan participate in the meeting at Stonehenge, a monument erected by the enchanter, as he recalls. Then, Tintagel Castle is closely related to King Arthur. Also, some semi-legendary characters are transposed in this story. In fact, in legend, Vortigern was a king of the Britons and married Rowena, an Anglo-Saxon. He also made a pact with her brothers Hengist and Horsa, who betrayed him to invade Great Britain. Thus, the British Major Vortigern Welsh is manipulate by his German wife Rowena, who projects to attack England with her brothers Hengist and Horsa. The idea of this story was inspired by chance to Hugo Pratt. While visiting a cemetery in the northern France, he discovered a curious tomb. A Canadian was buried there, died in 1918 in a battle against Germany, named... Julius C√©sar. Like the famous Roman conqueror, Oberon's father in some stories. It was for the cartoonist a message asking him this story. =C√¥tes de Nuit and Picardy Roses= Abstract Australian airmen with Richthofen's triplane 425/17 after it was dismembered by souvenir hunters In northern France, on the banks of the Somme, on 20 April 1918, soldiers are fighting. The Red Baron (Manfred von Richthofen), a German, successfully carried out an air raid on numerous enemy planes in his Fokker Dr.I. Two Australians talk to Corto about a way to kill him. Officer Sandy explain that his friend Clem is a crack shot, but only when he is drunk. So he tries to convince the sailor to open his bottles of Burgundy wine, to make drunk this soldier. But Corto categorically refuses. The latter hopes to see his old friend the British Cain Groovesnore. He is a volunteer in the Royal Air Force and located in an English aviation camp near Bertangles. The following day, Sandy discretely steals the much-vaunted bottles to inebriate Clem. The latter shot at the Red Baron flying over the area; but he seemed to lack target. Yet, a short time later, Manfred von Richthofen crashed; soldiers strip him and claim responsibility for the exploit. But not doubt for Sandy: it's Clem who had shot him. Unfortunately, an airplane then bombed the truck in which he was brewing and killed him. Sandy feels responsible for the death of his friend; but according to Corto, it's the fault of the war... Analysis Gevrey-Chambertin region of the Cote de Nuits. \\"Roses of Picardy\\": Sheet music from c. 1920 This strange title alludes to various things. \\"C√¥te de Nuits\\" is a French wine region located into the Burgundy wine region, renowned for its crus. \\"Picardy Roses\\" evokes Roses of Picardy, a popular British song composed in 1916; it was one of the most famous songs of the First World War. It is also a reference to the roses that the Red Baron deposits on the wreckage of planes he shoots down. Finally, this story takes place in the historical territory of Picardy. In this story, contrasting with his sinister reputation, Manfred von Richthofen appears to be very attached to his mother. Pratt wanted to use some truthful elements about this historical figure. For example, it is a question of glorious track record of this flying ace, officially credited with 80 air combat victories. Other elements are authentic, such as his custom of cutting empennage of the planes he shot down, to make trophies. It is also true that his aunt Frieda von Richthofen married the British novelist D. H. Lawrence. At the end of this story, an airplane flies, piloted by Hermann G√∂ring, another air ace. He will later be infamous for working with Adolf Hitler. =Burlesque Between Zuydcoote and Bray- Dunes= Abstract Again in France, between the cities of Zuydcoote and Bray-Dunes (Nord department), a show is performed in a Royal Air Force base by the puppeteer Rico-Rico and the singer M√©lodie Ga√´l. Shortly after, Corto Maltese is talking with is friend Cain Groovesnore, who announces him that his American cousine Pandora is going to marry. Corto, who loved her (cf. the story The Ballad of the Salty Sea), remains on a beach, thoughtful. But suddenly, he learns that Cain has been arrested, accused of having shot the Lieutnant De Tr√©cesson. Wanting to defend him, the sailor speaks with Commissaire Rothschild, in charge of the investigation. Together, they question witnesses: Rico-Rico and M√©lodie Ga√´l. Gradually, they discover that, in reality, the lieutenant had understood that she was a spy, in the service of the Germans. So he came to see her to accuse her. But she hypnotized Cain, also present, so that he would kill him. During the investigation, a fight ensued while the artists killed each other. Ultimately, Cain is exonerated and Trecesson will survive. Analysis Carlo Gozzi At the end of this story, Corto cynically declares to Rothschild that he came to France to drink French wines (allude to Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild wines). This, while he is in the midst of the war massacres and witnessed murders. This sentence earned Pratt two cases of wine from the Rothschild family. In this regard, there was also talk of wine in the previous story. Various cultural references punctuate this story. Thus, Lieutnant De Tr√©cesson has the same name as the Ch√¢teau de Tr√©cesson, near the Paimpont forest. This place is often associated with the forest of Broc√©liande, an important location from the Arthurian legend. Many places of this forest are mentioned: Val sans retour and fountain of Barenton. Rico-Rico comes from the Venetian Gozzi family. His name is the Carlo Gozzi's nickname, who lived only for his roles and legends which he interpreted went to his head  Artistic elements  = Drawns = Hugo Pratt has produced numerous additional drawings on the characters and places relating to the stories in this album. As is also the case for the other episodes of the series. Here, for example, he drew different places in Ireland and historical or legendary characters. = Poem on the cover = Among the many covers existing for Celtic Tales, one of them shows a poem in which Corto Maltese thanks different characters, mostly from Celtic legends: * Merlin, the enchanter or wizard featured in Arthurian legend (like the followings three characters); * Morgan le Fay and Viviane the Lady of the Lake; * King Arthur; * Oberon (king of the fairies) and Puck; * The Irish leprechauns; * The Cornish Pixies; * The Scottish boggles; * The Breton Korrigans; * The Welsh miners, Wales being renowned for its coal industry; * The French elves; * The Druids of \\"Folle Pens√©e\\" (name of a locality in the Paimpont forest); * The little folk of the forest of Broc√©liande; * The royal ravens of Stonehenge; * W. B. Yeats, an Irish poet; * And the harp of the wind somewhere to the north.

He worked in and around Central Australia.  Early life  Mahomet was born in a small village Smilekenerra near Kabul and he worked in Colombo, in Sri Lanka, to help pay for his passage to Australia. The date that Mahomet immigrated to Australia is unsure, being recorded as both 1887 and 1897 and he initially arrived in Fremantle, Western Australia before moving, almost immediately, to Port Augusta and then Parachilna in South Australia.  Work as a Cameleer  Once in South Australia Mahomet worked on the railhead and carted copper by camel from Blinman back to the railhead. Following this Mahomet worked in a number of jobs where dates are unsure, including time at Hergott Springs, Mt Morgan, (1905-1906), Wilgena Station and then, in 1907, to the Kalgoorlie Goldfields where he carted wood. In these early years Mahomet was a regular opium user as was common at the time, many Afghan's believed that opium was good for the stomach, however, after coming across a group of compatriots, in a \\"dishonourable state\\" he never took it again. In Kalgoorlie Mahomet met and married French prostitute Desiree Ernestine Adrienne Lesire 5 weeks after meeting. They were married in the Kalgoorlie Mosque by Secundah Khan on 18 March 1907 and his wife converted to Islam and changed her name to Miriam Bebe): this wedding was followed with a civil ceremony in Port Augusta on 17 August 1907. This marriage attracted a lot of interest and onlookers were apparently confounded and dumbfounded by the match with many surmising that it was a 'business flirtation'. It is said that, as a well known camel contractor, Mahomet was \\"in the possession of more than the average man's share of this world's goods\\" and that he held the bill of sale over at least 60 head of camels. It is unsure where the couple lived in the years immediately following their marriage but their son, Sallay Mahomet, was born in Coolgardie, Western Australia on 16 September 1911 and the couple would go on to have 5 more children, two more sons and three daughters. In 1913 the family settled at Bummers Creek where they established a market garden at the Afghan settlement where they grew melons, vegetables and dates as well as providing water and wood to the gold miners. The family continued to move around the country, travelling across the country by camel on a regular basis, including one trip from Perth to Broken Hill, a distance of almost 3000 kms, to visit a sick friend or relative. From 1919 to 1934 Mahomet worked for Thomas Elder carrying supplies for his numerous properties until he leased Mulgaria Station, a 363 square mile property, in 1935 where, with motor vehicles taking over, he let his camels free to roam. Eventually, in 1939, he bought the station, with Elder's help, and he began training racehorses. Miriam Bebe, Mahomet's wife, never lived at Mulgaria, preferring to stay in Farina and she died of a heart attack on 16 January 1939; she was only 58 years old. In 1940 Mahomet became Mulla, alongside his son Sallay, at the Adelaide Mosque and began travelling regularly to Adelaide. The mosque was impoverished at this time and Mahomet paid the rates and taxes on the property.  Death  In 1950 Mahomet decided to return to home to Afghanistan and, on his way there, make a visit to Mecca and, having booked his passage, he died, aged 85, on 21 May 1950. He was referred to as one of the \\"best known members of the Australian Afghan community.\\"  See also  * Afghan cameleers in Australia * Islam in Australia  References  Category:1865 births Category:1950 deaths Category:Camel drivers Category:Australian Muslims Category:Australian people of Pashtun descent Category:Afghan expatriates in Sri Lanka Category:Afghan emigrants to Australia ","title":"Gool Mahomet"},{"id":"62634047","text":"Graeme Ormiston is a professional rugby union referee who represents the Scottish Rugby Union.

Designed by Jekyll's friend and collaborator, Edwin Lutyens and constructed in 1932, it is a Grade II listed structure. History and architecture Gertrude Jekyll (1843‚Äì1932) was a gardener whose work had considerable influence on subsequent garden design theory and practice. A close friend of Edwin Lutyens, she collaborated with him on designs for over 100 gardens. In 1896, Lutyens designed Jekyll's house, Munstead Wood, at Munstead Heath near Busbridge. The death of \\"Aunt Bumps\\", as Lutyens called Jekyll, in December 1932, shortly after that of her brother Herbert in September the same year, led Lutyens to design a family memorial. Tributes to Lady Agnes, Herbert's widow, who died in 1937,and to Francis, their only son who died in 1965, were subsequently added. The memorial is located at the south-east corner of the Church of St John the Baptist in Busbridge. It comprises three stone tomb slabs, placed in front of a stone exedra which is topped by a semi-circular urn. Pevsner describes the whole as \\"an intricate composition, oddly like Soane translated into the blunt obtuse forms of the 1930s\\". The original inscription read 'In remembrance of Herbert and Gertrude Jekyll long time dwellers in their homes in Munstead who passed to their rest in the Autumn of 1932. / Their joy was in the work of their hands: their memorial is the beauty which lives after them'. This was later updated to include reference to Herbert's widow; 'Also of Agnes Jekyll whose spirit ever dwelt in loving kindness'. The memorial is a Grade II listed structure. Memorial to Francis McLaren To the right of the Jekyll Memorial stands a carved wooden headboard commemorating Francis McLaren (1886‚Äì1917). McLaren married Barbara Jekyll, daughter of Sir Herbert and Lady Agnes, and was killed in a flying accident in 1917. The headboard was also designed by Lutyens and consists of five, pegged, panels, showing the arms of the Royal Flying Corps and carrying details of McLaren's career as a member of parliament and as a 2nd lieutenant in the Corps. It has its own Grade II listing.

Education and career  Hill did an undergraduate degree and masters at the University of Manchester and a PhD in insect ecology at Bangor University graduating in 1991. As a postdoctoral researcher she researched the effects of climate on insects and metapopulation dynamics in butterflies at Liverpool John Moores University, the University of Leeds and Durham University. In 2001 she moved to the University of York to be a lecturer, she became senior lecturer in 2006 and 2010 was made professor of ecology and is Deputy Head of the Department of Biology. Hill has been Athena Swan champion in the School of Biology at York, her department was one of the first in the UK to receive the Athena Swan Gold Award in recognition of commitment to advancing the careers of women in higher education and research.  Research  Hill carried out one of the first insect relocations, moving populations of Marbled white and Small skipper butterflies further north and east in the UK in 2000. The project was successful and is providing information for conservation biologists to carry out future assisted insect migrations. Her studies on insect migration, finding that butterflies and moths can fly hundred of meters in the air to take advantage of wind to speed them up, they can also make adjustments to their direction to travel more quickly to their destination. Hill has done fieldwork in tropical ecosystems and found that oil palm plantations can act as a barrier to the movement of butterfies into and between rainforest areas, in particular the larger butterflies, shows the importance of having a network of connected habitat patches. Her work on the effects of climate change on biodiversity has shown that moths on Mount Kinabalu in Borneo had got smaller and moved up the mountain between 1960s and 2000s, a range shift of over 60m. British moths and butterflies respond in different ways to climate change, those species with a varied diet and higher rates of mating (such as the Green carpet and the Small dusty wave) can thrive in increasing temperatures, those such as the Pearl bordered fritilliary and the Silver-studded blue do less well as they a specialist on a few food food plants and only have one generation of offspring a year. Hill has highlighted that protected habitat areas to help maintain populations of rare species must be connected to aid migration and dispersal and should have the right climate envelopes for the species to survive future climate conditions.  Awards and honours  Hill was awarded the Marsh Award for Conservation Biology in 2011 by the Marsh Christian Trust and the Zoological Society of London. In 2015 she gave the Sir Julian Huxley Lecture at University College London and she gave the Stamford Raffles Lecture in 2016 at the Zoological Society of London.

His grandfather was Zadoc Kahn, the chief rabbi of France. He had a sister, Jacqueline Zadoc-Kahn Eisenmann and a brother, Jean Zadoc-Kahn. He became an intern at Paris hospitals in 1926. Around this time, he and his family had professional, educational and social connexions with well-known and to-be-famous people, such as physicists Paul Langevin and Satyendra Nath Bose, the latter who was on a two-year visit to Europe see photo https://www.livehistoryindia.com/cover-story/2018/06/10/the-man-behind-the- boson-particle (and whose knowledge of Hebrew impressed his family), socialite Philippe de Rothschild, racing driver :fr:Guy Bouriat, industrialist and racing driver Andr√© Dubonnet and film maker :fr:Pierre Schwab. Zadoc-Kahn completed his doctoral thesis in 1931. When World War II began, he was an established cardiologist and the chief doctor of the American Hospital of Paris, the focus of which had changed because of the war. His sister volunteered to work in an air ministry laboratory. When the French forces were defeated by Nazi Germany in 1940, Zadoc-Kahn was in such despair that he took his own life by shooting himself. It was reported that he was being lined up to take over his father's role at the :fr:H√¥pital Rothschild in Paris. In a note to his father, he said that he was unable to accept the disastrous situation for France which he'd experienced as an army physician. Eugene Meyer, the U.S. financier and a second-cousin to him, had offered sanctuary to his father; however, the Zadoc-Kahns were so devastated by their son's death that they declined: they went into hiding in France, as did their daughter and her family. His parents were discovered three years later by gendarmes and sent to their deaths at Auschwitz concentration camp in 1943. His sister survived the war.

Later in life she developed novel methods to teach mathematics to blind students.  Life and career  Pairman was born the youngest of four in Broomieknowe, Lasswade in Scotland to Helen and John Pairman who was solicitor of the Supreme Courts of Scotland. Her father died when she was very young. She attended the Lasswade Higher Grade School (1903-1908) before going to George Watson's Ladies' College (1908-1914). After finishing her Scottish Leaving Certificate examinations in 1914, she started studying mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. She graduated with an MA in 1917 with first class honors in mathematics and natural philosophy, after which she was awarded a three-year Vans Dunlop scholarship, which permitted her to continue her studies at any university. She became a graduate student at the University of Edinburgh before moving to Karl Pearson's lab at University College London in 1918. Pairman read two papers at meetings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society early in 1918. One of her instructors, Cargill G. Knott, wrote a letter of recommendation saying: \\"With fitting opportunity she has every promise of a distinguished and useful career.\\" Pairman arrived in New York on 12 October 1919 and went on to Cambridge, Massachusetts to study at Radcliffe College, an all-women's college closely associated with the all-male Harvard College. There she studied under George David Birkhoff. Her thesis was titled 'Expansion Theorems for Solution of a Fredholm's Linear Homogeneous Integral Equation of the Second Kind with Kernel of Special Non-Symmetric Type' and was awarded a PhD in 1922. When she received her doctorate she was only the third woman to be awarded a PhD in mathematics from Radcliffe College. In that same year she married a fellow grad student, Bancroft Brown. The couple moved to Hanover, N.H. in 1922 so Bancroft could assume a teaching position at Dartmouth College, which, at the time, was a men‚Äôs school with an all-male faculty but occasionally admitting women as graduate students. Later, Pairman published a joint paper with Rudolph E. Langer in 1927. Much later, Pairman taught math part-time at Dartmouth, from September 1955 until June 1959.  Teaching math in Braille  About 1950, Pairman started focusing on teaching mathematics to blind students, learning Braille and learning how to make diagrams using her sewing machine and other household items. Her daughter Margaret later wrote, ‚ÄúGeometry was a particular problem, because you really need diagrams. Braille is done on paper like thin cardstock. So she rounded up all kinds of household implements like pinking shears and pastry wheels and such and created diagrams that could be felt with the fingers, like the Braille symbols. Apparently nobody had ever done this before.\\" Pairman's son- in-law Thomas Streeter wrote about a visit to Hanover, when he was shown some of her work. ‚ÄúA graduate student at Harvard was blind and needed a particular book put into Braille, and it was full of mathematical symbols. What to do? The sewing machine, of course. She had written down the math and had it beside the machine. She put a piece of Braille paper under the foot and proceeded to reproduce the symbols by guiding the paper under the needle. It had to be the mirror image of what she had written.\\" In about 1959, the Hanover Gazette published an article about her saying that Pairman was in the process of transcribing two mathematical texts, one was for a freshman student at Boston College, and another, a reference book on group theory, destined for a post- graduate course at Columbia University in New York. The article went on to say that she was in regular discussions with Dartmouth math freshmen three hours each week and that apparently, by the end of the spring term, she had taken over the course instruction. Pairman's daughter Margaret wrote later: ‚ÄúFor all the satisfaction that she got from these [Braille] projects, the only time I saw her truly happy was when she was teaching. And she had precious little opportunity to do that, being obviously ahead of her time and also stuck in a males-only college community and in a world where it was well-nigh impossible for married ladies to function professionally.‚Äù  Personal life  On 10 August 1922, Pairman married Bancroft Huntington Brown (1894-1974) at Roselea, the Pairman home in Broomieknowe, Scotland and afterwards assumed the name Eleanor P. Brown, becoming widely known as Nora Brown. Her husband was a Harvard graduate student who had also received his PhD in 1922. Together, they had four children, John Pairman (b. 1923), Barbara (1925-1979), Joanna (1935-1935), and Margaret Wylde (b. 1937). Her two surviving children (Joanna died as a baby) went on to earn doctorates of their own. Pairman passed away after a long battle with breast cancer on 14 September 1973, at the age of 77, in White River Junction, Vermont. She was survived by her husband, two sisters, three children, seven grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter. Her husband passed away the following year.

Family Abu'l-Fath al-Fadl ibn Ja'far ibn al-Furat was the scion of a bureaucratic dynasty, the Banu'l-Furat, that had occupied senior posts in the fiscal bureaucracy of the Abbasid Caliphate at Baghdad since the reign of Caliph al- Mu'tadid () and had gone on to become one of the two major factions within the Abbasid administrative elite in the first decades of the 10th century. Fadl's father, Abu'l-Khattab Ja'far, was head of the land department for the East and West from 908 until his death in 909/10, while his uncle was the famous Abu'l-Hasan Ali, who served three times as vizier to Caliph al-Muqtadir. Fadl was often called \\"Ibn Hinzaba\\" after his mother. From this the branch of the family he founded is usually called \\"Banu Hinzaba\\". Early career Fadl replaced his father as head of the land department for the East (dƒ´wƒÅn al- mashriq), holding the post until 911/2. He was appointed as deputy head of the same department during the first vizierate of Ali ibn Isa ibn al-Jarrah, who would emerge as his uncle's greatest opponent and the leader of the rival Banu'l-Jarrah faction. In 917‚Äì918, when his uncle was vizier for a second time, Fadl was again head of the department. Abu'l-Hasan Ali ibn al-Furat and his son al-Muhassin were executed in 924 as a result of the unrestrained persecution of their political rivals, after which Fadl became the most senior member of his family. For a few years, he had to hide, as the reputation of the Banu'l-Furat had been tainted by bloodshed. It was Ibn al-Jarrah who brought Fadl back into government as head of the land department for the East in 927. When Ibn al-Jarrah was disgraced following the Qarmatian invasion of 927, Fadl was one of the chief candidates to succeed him, along with Ibn Muqla and al-Nayramani. However, as he was too identified with the Banu'l-Furat faction, Ibn Muqla became vizier. Fadl kept his previous post during Ibn Muqla's vizierate. In 931, the support of the commander-in-chief Mu'nis al- Muzaffar‚Äîanother formerly staunch opponent of his uncle‚Äîsecured for him the land department of the Sawad, before returning to the land department of the East in 931‚Äì932 under the vizier al-Husayn ibn al-Qasim, who employed several ministers from the faction of Abu'l-Khattab Ja'far. First vizierate Eventually Fadl himself was appointed vizier in May 932, after the previous incumbent al-Husayn ibn al-Qasim, had been deposed due to his inability to manage the dismal finances. Fadl himself had been instrumental in disclosing that Ibn al-Qasim had only managed to balance the budget with revenue that was no longer available, thus precipitating his downfall. With the support of al- Muqtadir's influential cousin, Harun ibn Gharib, he now became vizier. His tenure lasted only for a few months, being plagued by multiple problems. The Byzantine attacks on the frontier districts continued, as did the attacks of Mardavij in Persia. The refugees fleeing both often rioted in Baghdad, and even attacked the vizier in his own residence; Fadl only escaped death by leaping into his barge and rowing away. At the same time, Upper Mesopotamia was in the hands of Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, now hostile to the Caliph, while much of southern Iraq was being controlled or raided by the Qarmatians. Food became scarce in Baghdad, and the resulting famine led to an outbreak of plague in the city. Harun ibn Gharib and Fadl encouraged al-Muqtadir to reconcile with Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, and invite the latter back to Baghdad, against the counsel of Muhammad ibn Yaqut and the sons of Ra'iq, who remained utterly opposed to Mu'nis. The Caliph hesitate between the two opinions, but finally listened to the latter. When Mu'nis marched on Baghdad, the Caliph rode out to confront him and was killed in the ensuing battle. Mu'nis thus emerged as the undisputed king-maker and dictator of the Caliphate. A new caliph, al-Qahir, was installed, and Ibn Muqla became vizier. Second vizierate, retirement and death It was not until the caliphate of al-Radi () that Fadl again occupied high office, being appointed inspector of Egypt and Syria. In that capacity, he confirmed Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid's rule over Egypt. In 937 (AH 325), the amir al-umara Ibn Ra'iq appointed him again to the vizierate, and married his daughter to Fadl's son Ja'far. He retired later in the same year (AH 326), and retired to Egypt. He died in 938, and was buried at Ramla. His son Ja'far became vizier of the Ikhshidid dynasty of Egypt, remaining in office from 946 until the Fatimid conquest of Egypt in 969. He was also a prominent traditionalist and transmitter of hadith.

The company serves a number of cities on the island of Java by crossing the northern coast of Java.  History  PO EZRI founded in the middle of 1967 with an initial capital of 2 units of the Ford Metcek fleet (designation at that time, with the type of body such as Adi Putro or Morodadi Prima bodybuilder). Beginning to open a transportation business, the company from Pekalongan serves its first route, Tegal - Pekalongan - Semarang. In the hands of Lo Sien Tong (better known as Mr. Tong) and Kereen Indrawati, which were originally with 2nd Ford fleet, the fleet continues to grow to 8 units, all of which are still Ford. Expansion was carried out, the Jakarta - Jogjakarta route became a mainstay. Over time, the PO, which stands for Elingo Zaman Revolusi Indonesia / Remember of the Indonesian Revolutionary Period (Javanese: Elingo = Remember), has expanded its routes outside the province. The developing routes are Cirebon - Surabaya - Malang, Tegal - Kepanjen, Jakarta - Pekalongan, Jakarta - Semarang, Jakarta - Solo, Jakarta - Jogja, and Bogor - Klaten. The name EZRI can also be interpreted as one of the names of the heavenly birds according to the bible. As for the philosophical Elingo Zaman Revolusi Indonesia it all cannot be separated from the struggle of the EZRI founding parents who maintained Indonesian citizenship. Not only the Otobus Company, EZRI also has another business, namely batik printing characteristic of Pekalongan such as long cloth (jarit), sarong, baby scarf with various motifs, bright colors and excellent quality. = Acquiring the Colby Persada = In 1997, PO. EZRI acquired PO. Colby Persada at that time went bankruptcy. Then formalize the PO. Colby Persada became the \\"biological younger brother\\" of PO. EZRI. Since then, both of them began to add distant routes namely Bandung - Malang and Bandung - Denpasar. Entering 2001, the development was very rapid, it was proven by the arrival of 4th Scania K124ib. The 4 Scania consist of 1 automatic unit, 3 manual units (already covered with a disc). The matic in the Morodadi Prima Carroseries bodybuilding has been sold to Tunggal Daya (tourism coach), the rest which have Adiputro's body are sold to Shantika bus company. Was present serving the route Bandung - Denpasar in 2009, before finally 4th Scania fleets were sold at once. It's been half a century PO. EZRI deals in the world of Indonesian transportation. It is a matter of pride for the citizens of the City of Batik Pekalongan that made the number 1 choice bus at that time.  EZRI now  News was heard that now the cooperative relationship between PO EZRI and PO Colby Persada had broken up. Disbanded in the sense that PO Colby Persada only focuses on tourism coaches in Bandung while PO EZRI is still faithfully serving the Intercity buses until now. And changed its name to EZRI Damai Sejahtera. The Cirebon - Surabaya - Malang route still operates with a total fleet of approximately 13 bus fleets from the oldest coller and the new one, Hino RK-8. There are two elective classes, namely executive and super executive. Executive class seat configuration 2 - 2, AC, reclining seat and toilet. Whereas the super executive class has AC facilities, reclining seat configurations 1-2, TV and Toilet. Ticket purchases can be made at the EZRI Bus Agent in the Cirebon, Pekalongan, Tegal, Semarang, Yogyakarta, Klaten, Malang, Surabaya, Pulo Gadung, Rawa Buaya.

Other secondary forest roads have been developed in the area for forestry and recreational tourism activities.Open Street Map - Accessed January 27, 2019. The Pikauba River and Pikauba Lake have enjoyed a considerable reputation among hunters and fishermen since the end of the 19th century. Throughout the region, trout abounded and caribou hunting was once very popular. The surface of the Pikauba River is usually frozen from late November to early April, however safe circulation on the ice is generally from mid-December to late March.  Geography  The Pikauba River is one of the most important rivers between Quebec (city) and Saguenay (city). Bordered by steep mountains, its narrow course is dotted with rapids and has several falls; it widens downstream, rich in the waters of its drainage basin which includes the Apica, √âcorces, Pika and Petite Pikauba rivers. Increasingly tumultuous, it flows into the western part of Kenogami Lake. The Pikauba River originates at the dike at the southeast mouth of Pikauba Lake which has another outlet, the Cyriac River; this other mouth is located at the bottom of a bay on the north shore. This lake is located in the central part of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. This lake has a length of , a maximum width of , an altitude is and an area of . This lake has a narrowing generating a strait of a hundred meters in width demarcating the northern part of the lake. The mouth of the south-east of the lake flowing into the Pikauba river is located at: * north-east of route 175 connecting the towns of Quebec (city) and Saguenay (city); * south-east of the junction of roads route 175 and route 169; * south-west of the dam at the mouth of Lake Ha!

Toponymy  The specific \\"Pikauba\\" designates two rivers and a lake in the \\"Laurentian wildlife reserve\\". Father Laure's 1731 map identifies this watercourse \\"Ouapikoupau river\\". According to Father Joseph-√âtienne Guinard, in the Innu and Cree languages in particular, there is the \\"pikobaw\\" form that Father Laure translates from the Innu language as \\"tightened or masked by rushes\\". Another source claims rather that \\"pikobaw\\" breaks down into \\"pik\\", meaning \\"menu\\", \\"kobaw\\" meaning \\"scrub\\" and \\"wabi\\" meaning \\"white\\"; thus, this translation generates ‚Äúwhite brush‚Äù or ‚Äúsmall brush‚Äù. In 1981, the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec adopted a change in the designation of this watercourse. Maps from 1900 to 1930 refer to the hydronyms \\"Grande Rivi√®re Pikauba\\" and Petite Rivi√®re Pikauba. The place names \\"Chicoutimi\\" and \\"Pikauba\\" officially replaced them in 1940. More recently, usage has confirmed that the part of the river south of Kenogami Lake is called \\"Pikauba river\\" and its tributary, that of ‚ÄúPetite rivi√®re Pikauba‚ÄùBook: Names and places of Quebec, work of the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of a printed illustrated dictionary, and in that of a CD-ROM produced by the company Micro-Intel, in 1997, from this dictionary..

It was originally constructed to commemorate the men of the town killed during the First World War, particularly those serving with the local regiments, the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons and the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. It was later altered to also commemorate those killed in the Second World War. The memorial was the site of an IRA bombing on 8 November 1987, during a Remembrance Sunday ceremony. Photographs of the war memorial in the aftermath became emblematic of this stage of The Troubles and the site was visited shortly afterwards by British prime minister Margaret Thatcher for a rescheduled remembrance ceremony. The memorial was renovated in 1990-91 and a new section added to commemorate those killed in the bombing. The memorial has been visited by the Irish Taoiseach on Remembrance Sunday each year since 2012.  Original memorial  The County Fermanagh War Memorial Committee was formed after the First World War and in 1920 sought designs for a war memorial by a notification posted in the Architect and Building News. The estimated cost was stated to be ¬£1,500 and the deadline for entries was 20 November. A winning design had been chosen by early 1921. The memorial was built by Gaffin & Co., whose showroom, the Carrara Marble and Granite Works, was at 63 Regent Street in London.https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/organization.php?id=msib1_1271840803https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/place.php?id=msib1_1232380419 The main figure is of a British First World War soldier, in peaked cap with a rifle, resting on arms reversed. This was cast in bronze from a sculpture by a Northern Irish artist. The artist could not find a suitable photograph to work from so based the soldier on a painting by William Gibbes Mackenzie displayed at Belfast City Hall, which shows Thomas McNeilly of the Royal Irish Rifles standing at the temporary cenotaph erected in Belfast for the city's Peace Day commemoration on 9 August 1919.https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/cenotaph- in-memory-of-ulsters-glorious-dead-168157 The sculpture stood on a limestone plinth is engraved with the phrase \\"OUR GLORIOUS DEAD\\" and the years \\"1914-1918\\". The plinth also showed the names, ranks, decorations and regiments of 612 local men killed in the war and a coat of arms featuring Enniskillen Castle, which is associated with the local 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons and Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers regiments. The stepped base has a bronze depiction of a crossed sword and rifle, reflecting the roles of the two regiments (cavalry and infantry). The monument was unveiled by the last Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Edmund FitzAlan-Howard, 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent on 24 October 1922. At the unveiling wreaths were laid by Catholic and Protestant war orphans and an honour guard was provided by the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, the Lincolnshire Regiment and the Royal Horse Artillery. Four senior non-commissioned officers from the Fusiliers stood guard at each corner of the memorial during the unveiling ceremony. Following the Second World War the dates \\"1939-1945\\" and the names of the dead from that war (including those who served with the Merchant Navy) added to the plinth.  1987 bombing  British war memorials in Ireland had been targeted by Republicans during The Troubles, being seen as symbols of the British Army. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) carried out a bombing at the County Fermanagh War Memorial during a Remembrance Sunday ceremony on 8 November 1987. This killed 11 civilians attending the ceremony and injured 63 others, one of those injured never regained consciousness and died of his injuries on December 2000. The war memorial was damaged by flying debris, which pockmarked the plinth. The war memorial immediately became a symbol of this period of The Troubles. A photograph of the memorial and the bomb-damaged St Michael's Hall community centre was featured on the front page of the Irish Times the day after the bombing. Similar photographs featured in the newspaper over the following two days. The death toll from this bombing, and news of a second, larger bomb planned to explode the same day at a ceremony in Tullyhommon, shocked many people and led to a loss of support for the IRA in the Republic of Ireland. In response to the bombing the British prime minister Margaret Thatcher attended a rescheduled remembrance ceremony at the war memorial on 22 November. The bombing had the effect of increasing attendance at remembrance ceremonies across Ireland and led to the Royal British Legion resuming sales of remembrance poppies in the Republic of Ireland. The British- Irish singer Chris de Burgh's song \\"At the War Memorial\\" was written in response to the attack.  1990-91 renovation and recent history  Detail of the additional section of plinth added to commemorate victims of the 1987 IRA bombing The County Fermanagh War Memorial was renovated in 1990-91 by Phillip Flanagan and Richard Pierce. The world war engravings were recut and a new section, high, added to the plinth. The additional section contains depictions of 11 doves (each a unique sculpt) to commemorate those killed in the 1987 bombing and their names were also added to the memorial. The central section of the plinth was also painted dark red around this time (photographs from 1987 show it as natural stone). After the renovation, the memorial stands high and approximately square in plan. In 2012 the Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny visited the memorial on Remembrance Sunday to lay a green laurel wreath on behalf of the Irish government. This marked the start of an annual tradition that was continued by his successor, Leo Varadkar. A separate memorial to the 12 people whose deaths were caused by the 1987 bombing was unveiled on 8 November 2017 (the 30th anniversary of the event). it was initially sited on land owned by the Catholic Church's St Michael's Diocesan Trust but was removed within hours as the church had not granted its permission. In 2019 it was announced that the memorial would be installed at The Clinton Centre, which stands on the site of a building destroyed by the bombing. There are plans to carry out works to visually connect the new memorial with the existing war memorial.

Biography  Schad was born in Stuttgart and studied ballet there from 1981 to 1990. She then danced for six years in various ballet companies before becoming a member of Ultima Vez (Wim Vandekeybus) in Brussels and working with choreographers such as Olga Mesa, Angela Guerreiro, Felix Ruckert and Eszter Salamon. Since 1999 she has choreographed her own work. Schad has initiated several projects/artist groups/work structures such as Good Work, Praticable and Wiesen55 e.V. In 2003 she initiated the series Good Work with Bruno Pocheron and Ben Anderson, and developed various pieces with Manuel Pelmus, Fr√©d√©ric Gies, Hanna Hedman and others. In 2005, with Alice Chauchat, Fr√©d√©ric Gies, Fr√©d√©ric de Carlo and Odile Seitz, she originated an open collective called Praticable, within which a specific model of dance and choreographic collaboration is practiced. Schad is co-founder of the Verein Wiesen 55, a group of artists active in the areas of choreography, dance, lighting design, sculpture and multimedia. Together they operate the production site Wiesenburg-Halle. Schad was a member of the jury at the International Choreographic Competition in Sofia and a mentor at DanceWeb 2011 and PAP 2016‚Äì19, and has been an artist in residence at the Podewil/TanzWerkstatt Berlin, Espace Pier Paolo Pasolini, Monty Antwerp and Rimbun Dahan Malaysia. Schad teaches at Berlin‚Äôs inter-university dance centre HZT, in Cologne, Helsinki and Stockholm, and around the world in workshops or short projects organised by the Goethe-Institut and followed by performances, for example in Kigali (RW), San Francisco (USA), Bogota (CO), Lagos (NG), Kuala Lumpur (MY). She understands learning and teaching as a circulating unity that she has shared for years with a ‚Äòcore‚Äô of dancers, who thus participate in her own learning process. Physical praxis, training and choreographic work are related to one another and made communicable in a format developed by her known as Open Practice Sessions (OPS). Schad has received awards such as Hope of the Year, Choreographer of the Year, and a tribute to her outstanding artistic development in contemporary dance at the 2019 German Dance Prize.  Artistic practice and style  Schad works at the interface of dance, performance and visual art, with a central fascination for group formation and the ensemble. Interests such as community in dance or collective bodies are deeply rooted in her movement research. Bodies and movements are examined in terms of their materiality, processuality and experienceability. Physical praxis is seen as a place of learning, community and political participation. Schad orients her work to somatic bodywork such as Body-Mind Centering. She was decisively influenced by an embryology workshop with Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen. She is a shiatsu practitioner, and has practiced aikido zen since 2014. These form the basis of her qi training together with Asian kinetic teachings such as meridian work and qigong. Western and Eastern practices and ways of thinking are also reflected in her solo and group works. She is concerned with the formation of communities in dance and formulates the body as a place of resistance so as to investigate norms, competition, discipline, conformity and the status of collective processes. Schad has collaborated for many years with the visual artist Laurent Goldring. Together they developed the concept of the ‚Äòamplifier‚Äô, which functions as a transition between the inner and the outer worlds.

A sequel and soft reboot of the television series Gossip Girl (2007), it was created by Josh Schwartz, Stephanie Savage, and Joshua Safran, the same people involved with the original, with Safran also serving as showrunner. The upcoming series will be released on HBO Max in 2021. Premise Eight years after the conclusion of the original series, a new cast of Manhattan private schoolers take the lead under the watchful eye of Gossip Girl, while demonstrating how much social media ‚Äì and the landscape of New York City itself ‚Äì has changed in the intervening years. Gossip Girl is slated to feature more adult content than the original on The CW, owing to the relaxed standards of the HBO Max streaming service. The series is also slated to be more diverse, with nonwhite leads and LGBT characters. In regard to continuity, executive producer and showrunner Joshua Safran stated that it is officially in the same continuity of the original Gossip Girl series. However, rather than a direct continuation of the story, it is instead set in the same world where previous characters existed and can be freely referenced and potentially reappear, but stars a different set of characters from a different point of view. Safran likened this to a shared universe, akin to that of the Marvel Universe.

A student of Julius Eichberg in Boston, in the late 1880s she established a string quartet consisting only of women, the first of its kind in the United States. The other members of the quartet were Lillian Chandler, violin, Leslie Launder, cello and Abbie Shepardson, viola. They performed together in chamber concerts in New York, Massachusetts and Philadelphia. One was held in November 1877 in Boston's Union Hall. It included Eichberg's Concertante for Four Violins as well as other pieces by Haydn and Mendelssohn. Shattuck was among those who travelled with Eichberg and members of the quartet to study in Berlin. Joseph Joachim was so surprised to see a quartet consisting only of women that he allowed all four to attend the Conservatory and study under him for a whole year. In the 1890s, the quartet performed in the southern states and Canada. Shattuck later returned to Boston where she established a music school. A scrapbook belonging to Shattuck with over 200 photographs of her violin students is to be found in the Schlesinger Library.

It was first performed at the Hoftheater in Vienna on 1 October 1718. It is possibly the same opera that was performed on 30 May 1756 at the Teatre de la Santa Creu, Barcelona. There is another version, also by Porpora, to a libretto by Metastasio, first performed in 1743, as well as another opera on the same subject by Francesco Manelli (1595‚Äì1670).Enciclop√®dia Espasa, vol. 32, p. 787 () Apostolic Zeno's libretto was also set to music by Marc'Antonio Ziani in 1701 and by Fortunato Chelleri in 1721. Roles and action The action is set in the 5th century BC and concerns the Athenian general Themistocles who is in exile at the court of Artaxerxes I of Persia. It is based on book 1 of Thucydides' Historiae. Artaserse, Temistocle, Palmide (lover of Temistocle), Eraclea (daughter of Temistocle), Cambise (favourite of Artaserse, in love with Palmide), Clearco (Athenian ambassador, in love with Eraclea), Arsace (captain of the guard). The plot revolves around conflicts of loyalty, central to which is Temistocle's refusal to assist Artaserse in conquering Athens. This prompts the king to condemn him to death although at the end of the opera, impressed with Temistocle's sense of honour, he relents. Temistocle loves Palmide but since Artaserse wishes them to marry he cannot love her without the burden of feeling that royal approval requires him to betray his country. See also *Temistocle (J.C.

Around 1738‚Äì1741, Johann Sebastian Bach made a copy of a Sanctus, BWV 239, which was based on the first section of the Gloria of Caldara's Kyrie‚ÄìGloria Mass.Bach Digital Work The Mass is composed for soprano, alto, tenor and bass soloist singers, and a choir consisting of the four same voice types (SATB). The orchestra consists of strings (two violin parts and one viola part) and basso continuo, to which in some movements two oboes are added. The oboes are silent throughout Zelenka's Credo, and the BWV 239 Sanctus only requires a four-part choir, strings and continuo. Caldara's Kyrie and Gloria The Kyrie of Caldara's Missa Providentiae, in D minor, consists of the usual three movements (\\"Kyrie\\", \\"Christe\\" and \\"Kyrie II\\"), in which the singers are only accompanied by strings and continuo.

Zelenka composed and acquired several Kyrie‚ÄìGloria Masses for the court at Dresden, where he was employed from the early 1710s. Dresden was the capital of the Electorate of Saxony: Saxony was dominantly Protestant, but the elector, Augustus the Strong, had converted to Catholicism in order to become eligible as king of Poland. Initially, Augustus's Catholicism was a private matter when in Saxony, with a court chapel within the palace building. In 1708, however, the former Opernhaus am Taschenberg, adjacent to the palace, opened as (court church), open to the general public. Kyrie‚ÄìGloria Masses were seen as a Protestant practice, and thus the musicians of the Dresden court started to transform these mass compositions into . Between 1725 and 1733 Caldara's Missa Providentiae was converted in such a : Zelenka derived the music for the Sanctus and Agnus Dei of the Missa Providentiae from the Kyrie and Gloria composed by Caldara. Sanctus and Agnus Dei each have three sections. Further, around 1728, he added a Credo in four sections, ZWV 31, for SATB soloists and choir, strings and continuo.ZWV 31 at Sanctus in D minor, BWV 239 Around 1738‚Äì1741 Bach made a fair copy of a Sanctus for SATB choir, strings and continuo.

In the second half of the 20th century, its authenticity was doubted in several publications, e.g. in an article by Hans T. David, published in 1961. The 1998 edition of the listed the composition as a doubtful work. In the 2010s the Bach Digital website described BWV 239 as a work derived from the first section of the Gloria of Caldara's Missa Providentiae. =Recordings= A recording of BWV 239 is for instance included in Apocryphal Bach Masses II, cpo 777561-2, by Wolfgang Helbich conducting the Alsfelder Vokalensemble (recorded 2009, released 2012).Apokryphal Bach ; apocryphal bach masses ; vol.2 at Apocryphal Bach Masses, Vol. 2 at ArkivMusic website.

The project is headquartered in California.  Mission  ProtectedSeas‚Äô mission is to raise awareness and protection of critical marine areas. The organization assists MPA managers in protecting vulnerable ecosystems and works to improve information and transparency around ocean conservation measures. The project's team comprises expertise within the fields of law, geography, and hardware/software design with various backgrounds. ProtectedSeas partners with many NGOs to leverage specific talents and experience. ProtectedSeas has two sub-projects: the Marine Managed Area Map, and the Marine Monitor (M2) system.  Marine Managed Area Map  ProtectedSeas developed the Marine Managed Area Map as an evolving online tool that boaters can use to track their location on the water with respect to nearby protected areas and other legally restricted zones. The map is free and designed for easy, one-click use by the public as well as those in the marine industry. Its database is also free to download. Information on each area includes which specific activities are allowed and restricted (such as diving or fishing by use of bottom trawl), as well as the protected area's boundaries. The project began in 2015 and, as of December 2019, ProtectedSeas has mapped 50% of global MPAs and over 2/3 of the ocean by area. Completed regions include the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, the Baltic and the high seas, with Central and South America coming soon. They have also included many areas across the globe that are species- or gear-restricted but not technically MPAs. For U.S. waters, NOAA and Anthropocene Institute collaborate in a private-public partnership. ProtectedSeas is one of the first organizations to map marine managed areas in international waters known as the high seas, and release the data at the United Nations Ocean Conference in 2017. Their data is currently included in Navionics charting software.  Marine Monitor System (M2)  ProtectedSeas developed a radar surveillance system designed to track vessel movement in sensitive marine areas and successfully demonstrated their first deployment at Moss Landing Marine Labs in 2015. Rangers and other authorities can use this systemcalled Marine Monitor (M2)to watch for poachers 24/7, enforce local laws against illegal fishing and potential damage to reefs. The system involves radar, a support structure, power source and internet, making it relatively low cost and a potential solution for hard-to-manage remote areas. There are currently six M2 stations operating in California. They have also been deployed in Micronesia, the Caribbean, Mexico, and Southeast Asia. Global Conservation is planning an M2 system to monitor the waters off the coast of Isla de la Plata, Ecuador, following the implementation of a two-mile no-fishing zone in Machalilla National Park.

He also produced a lithographed edition of John James Audubon's The Birds of America. Biography Bien was born in Naumburg, Hesse, a small town near Kassel, as the child of artist and teacher. He was schooled at the Kunsthochschule Kassel, and then at the St√§del Institute in Frankfurt as a student of Moritz Daniel Oppenheim. Like many other Jews he fought on the side of the liberals in the 1848 Revolution, and fled to New York in 1848 or 1849. He began a lithography studio, first with a single press, and turned that into a large and successful company by century's end. Bien's studio produced work in different qualities, indicating he was willing to take on any job‚Äîcity views and maps, mechanical and architectural drawings and advertisements‚Äîbut on the whole his work was \\"distinguished by its technical superiority and flexible manipulation of print media\\". He worked for the federal government as well after the American Civil War, and was noted as a skilled printer of maps with \\"a new level of scientific accuracy\\" (a 1902 map of Connecticut was praised as \\"all that could be desired\\"), winning many awards, and becoming a \\"prominent citizen of New York\\" as well as the first president of the National Lithographers Association. From 1854 to 1857, and again from 1868 to 1900, he was president of B'nai B'rith, contributing substantially to its internationalization. =Audubon, Bien edition= In the late 1850s, Bien was sought out by John James Audubon's youngest son, John Woodhouse Audubon, to produce a new full-size edition of The Birds of America, an edition to be sold via subscription. Bien was a specialist in chromolithography, a specialty he had learned in Germany. The first edition had been printed in black and white, and then finished with watercolor paint; the new edition promised a greater level of color accuracy. Lithography, as opposed to copper-plate engraving, also produced more \\"softness\\" in the printed image. Bien used the original copper plates to transfer the images onto stone. He used only six colors, and achieved variety by printing colors over another, sometimes in dotted patterns. In the end, the project was not finished: of the original 435 plates, only 150 were made and in 1860 publication was halted. John Woodhouse Audubon died in 1862, indebted, ending all prospects of finishing it, and there was significant financial insecurity at a time of war. At the same time, ornithological tastes changed with the work of Spencer Fullerton Baird, who introduced greater scientific accuracy. Still, the Bien edition remains an important publication: his illustrations \\"represent the highest standard chromolithography had achieved, and even now they stand as a landmark to the medium. Bien pushed against the limits of available technology with intuitive artistry in an effort to provide information and aesthetic pleasure to the mass audience of a democratic society\\".

On October 7, 2020 he was found guilty of running Golden Dawn, and a number of other serious offences, including orchestrating the fatal stabbing of Pavlos Fyssas and many violent attacks on migrants and left-wing political opponents. Subsequently, he was sentenced to 13 years in jail.  Political Career  He has served for a number of years as a member of the Hellenic Parliament for the criminal gang and neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn between 2012 and 2019, and was elected to the European Parliament on the party's ticket before announcing that he would sit as an independent a few days after being sworn in as an MEP on 2 July 2019. He and other former Golden Dawn MPs and members founded a splinter party on 9 November 2019. = Anti-Turkish notions = In January 2020, Lagos tore down the flag of Turkey during a speech at the European Parliament on illegal migration, accusing Turkey of sending illegal immigrants to Greece. The action received criticism from Turkish and Greek officials, including Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu and the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was later penalised by the European Parliament for his actions.  Criminal activities  His actions with Golden Dawn have twice led to his arrest and detention on charges of forming a criminal organization, while he is also allegedly involved in the murder of Pavlos Fyssas, which led to his conviction, along with many other members, on October 7, 2020 as one of the leaders of the criminal gang. He has also been charged in the past with extortion, pandering, protection racket practices, illegal possession of weapons and others. On September 13, 2019, he was sentenced to another eight months in jail with suspension for the attack on the social space \\"Œ£œÖŒΩŒµœÅŒ≥ŒµŒØŒø\\" in 2013 and an extra 13 years in October 2020 for leading a criminal organisation, resulting in a prison sentence of 13 years. On October 19, 2020 Greek authorities submitted a request to the European Parliament to have Giannis Lagos' parliamentary immunity lifted in order to prosecute him.

Her research makes use of the ability of nucleic acids to self-assemble and recognise other molecules. Alongside her research, Heemstra is a science communicator and writes a regular column for Chemical & Engineering News.  Early life and education  Heemstra decided that she wanted to be a scientist whilst she was at high school and she took part in the Science Olympiad. Heemstra studied chemistry at the University of California, Irvine and graduated in 2000. She was an undergraduate researcher with James Nowick, where she studied the folding of beta sheets and became interested in supramolecular chemistry. She was a doctoral student at University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign where she worked with Jeffrey S. Moore on phenylene ethynylene cavitands. On the day of her doctoral defense, Heemstra received a phone call from her proposed postdoctoral advisor who was concerned that she would become pregnant during her research position, which would result in her taking time out of the laboratory. Heemstra lost the postdoctoral position as a result, and instead spent two years working on medicinal chemistry in industry before starting a different postdoctoral position at Harvard University. Here she developed new approaches to template nucleic acids, working under the supervision of David Liu.  Research and career  Heemstra joined the University of Utah in 2010 and was appointed Associate Professor with tenure in 2016. She moved to Emory University in 2017. She is interested in the use of biomolecular platforms for self- assembly, molecular recognition and in vitro catalysis. Her research considers the detection and sequestration of small molecules. She has demonstrated that nucleic acid aptamers can be used in biosensing. In particular, split aptamers can self-assemble when particular small molecules are present, resulting in chemical ligation within DNA. This can be used to detect specific pharmaceutical molecules. Heemstra has shown that these DNA sensors can be used to detect the enantiopurity of the small molecule targets via fluorescence. Heemstra is working on new approaches to monitor RNA editing, through the use of fluorescence labelling, as well as ways to manipulate these modifications for genetic engineering. She has worked on threose nucleic acids (TNAs) which can be used to confer genetic information and in the detection of small molecule toxins. = Teaching and science communication = Alongside her scientific research, Heemstra leads a research program in chemistry education and how students' perceive failure. She has spoken about the need for scientists to embrace failure to succeed in their research. Heemstra is a science communicator who writes a regular column Office Hours for Chemical & Engineering News. She has discussed her scientific career on their podcast, Stereo Chemistry. She has written for Nature Careers, Wiley and Editage, as well as on her own blog, Things That Change the Way I Think.

In Scotland, Ruthven on 4 July 1573 received the permission of the Privy Council of Scotland, to recruit 1,600 soldiers for Swedish service; provided that he did not entice any men from the King's service, nor use any constraint or deceit. He was also forbidden to serve against any Protestant power.Burton, John Hill (ed.) (1878). The Register of the Privy Council of Scotland. Edinburgh: H.M. Register House, vol. 2, pp. 235-236. In the meantime, Ruthven had participated in the Lang Siege and capture of Edinburgh Castle that fell on 28 May. Ruthven had raised substantially more men than the 1,600 men allowed by the Privy Council; 3,000 foot and 760 horse arrived at √Ñlvsborg, on the Swedish west coast, in June and July 1573. The force were split up into small units and marched to Sweden's eastern coast. Overdue pay caused some of the soldiery to delay their march, pillage the countryside and revolt against Ruthven. Upon their arrival in Stockholm and ports in √ñsterg√∂tland, they were joined by another 300 Scottish cavalry and shipped to Reval, where they arrived in September and joined with Swedish and Finnish regulars as well as German mercenaries, primarily consisting of cavalry and artillery. In November, the army left for Wesenberg under the overall command of Clas √Ökesson Tott and field command of Pontus de la Gardie. The march was again delayed by the Scottish troops, who demanded to be paid a month in advance, causing de la Gardie to sell part of his jewelry to satisfy their claims.Fischer, Thomas Alfred (1907). The Scots in Sweden. Edinburg: Otto Schulze & Co., p. 63.Peterson, Gary Dean (2007). Warrior kings of Sweden. The rise of an empire in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. McFarland, p. 91-93. Disaster at Wesenberg In January 1574, Wesenberg Castle, which was held by the Russians, was stormed twice but without success. In the third assault of 2 March 1574, the Swedish forces lost at least 1,000 men. Subsequent Swedish attempts to dig mines and set the town on fire likewise failed. De la Gardie withdrew part of the besieging army for expeditions to nearby Tolsberg and Dorpat both of which were unsuccessful. The besieging forces were demoralized, supplies ran out and tensions grew; the German troops blamed the failures on a lack of Scottish support.S√∂derqvist, Olof (1898). Johan III och hertig Karl 1568-1575. Uppsala, p. 113.Fischer op.cit., p. 64. On 17 March, a brawl between German and Scottish soldiers occurred. A German officer tried to intervene, but when he was unsuccessful and the brawl turned into an open fight, de la Gardie, Tott and Ruthven arrived to the scene in person. They were however likewise attacked and fled, with Ruthven suffering severe injuries. When the commanders had fled the scene, Scottish troops attacked the German artillery, seized the guns and took aim at the German cavalry. The German horse charged, however, and cut down the Scots. The result was 30 dead Germans and several hundred dead Scots. The German and Swedish foot stood by without taking action, neither did the Scottish horse intervene. Several Scottish officers were among the dead, including David Murray, Jacob Murray and George Michell. About 70 Scots escaped to the Russian forces in Wesenberg, the last record of them is that they were subsequently brought to Moscow. The Swedish army had to abort the siege, and the Swedish campaign ended in a dismal failure. Fischer op.cit., pp. 64-65. Conspiracy trial A court of inquiry found the Scots troops responsible for the disaster at Wesenberg, and the wounded Ruthven and his second-in-command, Gilbert Balfour, were taken as prisoners to Stockholm. In the Swedish capital, they found themselves implicated in the Mornay plot to assassinate King John III. De Mornay, Ruthven and Balfour were tried before a court of eight members of the Privy Council of Sweden and 15 noblemen. De Mornay was sentenced to death and executed on the Great Market in Stockholm on 4 September 1574. Balfour was also sentenced to lose his life, his honour and his goods, but the judgment was not immediately implemented; he being kept in prison during the trial of Ruthven. Fischer op.cit., pp. 53-54. V√§ster√•s Castle in the 17th century. In prison, Ruthven repeatedly petitioned the King, the Queen, and De la Gardie, declaring his innocence, claiming that he had first heard of it in Reval. The Scottish government pled for the prisoners; the Regent of Scotland, the Earl of Morton wrote to the Swedish king, and sent an envoy to Stockholm. King John III, who feared international complications, or even war with Scotland, stayed the execution until it after many delays took place in August of 1576. Ruthven was kept a prisoner at V√§ster√•s Castle, but was allowed a couple of servants, and could walk freely in town and to church. Yet, when Balfour in the spring of 1576 tried to escape, he was kept imprisoned under a stricter regimen. The last five months of his life, he did, however, stay with a citizen of the town, where he died in February 1578. Fischer op.cit., pp. 58-62.

After the breakthrough over the Aisne, it advanced towards the Loire and occupied Orl√©ans. In July 1940, the Corps was transferred to the General Government (Poland) and placed under the command of the 4th Army. After the start of Operation Barbarossa (June 1941), again under the command of the 6th Army, the XXXXIV Army Corps , composed of the 9th, 262nd, 297th and 57th Infantry Divisions, operated on the Southern Bug, and took Sokal and Krystynopol. During the Battle of Brody (1941), the XXXXIV Corps was subjected to strong counter-attacks by the Soviet 15th Mechanized Corps. After withstanding the attack, the advance towards Koziatyn continued. In August 1941, during the Battle of Uman, the corps was subordinated to the 1st Panzer Army and advanced to the Dnieper after the battle. In September 1941, assigned to the 17th Army, the Corps, as part of Gruppe Schwedler, secured the Dnieper Section in the Cherkassy area during the Battle of Kiev with the 68th and 297th Infantry Divisions.

He designed a number of works which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) for their architecture. Early life Nave was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1864. With Nave came from Iola, Kansas to Lewiston in 1903. Career Nave and his firm competed with other architectural firms in Lewiston and in Spokane, Washington to get commissions to design public buildings, commercial blocks, and large homes. Nave's firm won a number of these commissions and is credited with 94 works between 1903 and 1923. With Nave designed just two churches, St. Stanislaus. It and Lewiston's Baptist Church are the only two churches attributed to this architect, who made his reputation primarily through designing schools. According to Egleston, \\"By 1909 Nave was obtaining commissions for commercial and institutional buildings as his residential business declined. His institutional work was Georgian Revival, while his commercial commissions were completed in the Romanesque and Renaissance Revival styles. In her book, Building Idaho, Jennifer Eastman Attebery writes that Nave's work shows a preference for stone and a 'fragmented use of classical motifs.' This affinity for stonework is not surprising, given the fact that he owned a stone quarry in nearby Clarkston [Washington], to which he devoted his energy after he left architectural work in 1933.\\" With Works include: *Bollinger Hotel (1903) *James Asposas House, 1610 Fifteenth Ave., Lewiston, ID, NRHP-listed *William and Elizabeth McLaren House (1904), 1602 15th Ave., Lewiston, ID, NRHP-listed *Nave Apartments (1904), 600 block of 8th St., Lewiston, ID, built of sandstone from Nave's quarry, \\"Swallow's Nest\\".

Brain iron accumulation  The most relevant risk associated with a H63D mutation is for brain damage due to iron accumulation which causes oxidation processes within the affected cells (chronic oxidative stress) and, as a consequence, leading to cell death (scarring of brain tissue) with severely disturbed neurotransmitter activity. These incurable processes include increased cellular iron, oxidative stress (free radical activity), brain glutamate dysbalance, and abnormal levels of tau proteins and alpha-synuclein which both may result in dementias and parkinson‚Äôs disease, or similar conditions. Scientists found that patients homozygous for H63D show a higher risk of earlier signs of cognitive impairment and earlier onset of dementias compared to individuals with normal HFE genes or H63D heterozygous mutation. Cardiac iron accumulation  Some individuals with a homozygous H63D mutation may show signs of heart disease, cardiomyopathies and disturbances in the calcium channels in particular.  Liver disorders  A homozygous mutation of HFE gene H63D is an indication of an Iron Metabolism Disorder known as Hemochromatosis (Iron Overload) and may increase the risk to develop a fatty liver, cryptic (nonspecific) liver dysfunctions, metabolic syndrome and, in patients with a cirrhotic or a liver damaged due to alcohol also the rates of liver cancer.

She is an associate professor at Aalborg University Copenhagen with climate politics as her research area. She is a member of the green political party The Alternative, and was a candidate at the 2019 Danish general election, but did not get reelected. She was a candidate to succeed Uffe Elb√¶k as political leader of the party, when he resigned in February 2020, but lost to Josephine Fock.  Background  Theresa Scavenius is the great grandchild of Fergus Roger Scavenius, who was a younger brother of Erik Scavenius, former prime minister of Denmark. Scavenius was a student at Christianshavn Gymnasium. In 2005 she started to study German at the University of Copenhagen, and wrote her bachelor's thesis about Thomas Mann in 2007. She studied political science, also at the University of Copenhagen, and graduated in 2011. In 2014, she completed a Ph.D, with her dissertation named Moral Responsibility for Climate Change: A Fact-Sensitive Political Theory.  Academic career  Theresa Scavenius has been an associate professor at Aalborg University since 2017, and have climate politics as her research area. She is working in the Department of Planning at the university's Copenhagen campus. In December 2017, she was named one of 10 \\"junior research talents\\" and awarded a three- year research grant of 3 million DKK in total. Her research project is titled Institutional mediation, emergent technologies and green transition paths. In 2017 she co-edited the book Compromise and Disagreement in Contemporary Political Theory alongside Christian Rostb√∏ll, and in 2018 the book Institutional Capacity for Climate Response: A New Approach to Climate politics alongside Steve Rayner. In 2019 she authored the book Political Responsibility for Climate Change: Ethical Institutions and Fact-Sensitive Theory. Scavenius was one of 301 Danish researchers who in May 2018 published an open letter, calling politicians to prioritise a more ambitious climate policy above economic growth. She has appeared in Danish media as a climate expert and has been active in the public debate on climate change.  Political career  Theresa Scavenius was a member of the Danish Social Liberal Party from 2016 to 2017. In September 2017, she was a candidate to become vice chairman of the party, but lost to Bitten Schj√∏dts Kj√¶r. She subsequently left the party. Scavenius joined The Alternative in December 2017, and was a candidate in the 2019 general election, running in the North Zealand constituency. She said she decided to run because she was \\"deeply frustrated\\" by Danish climate politics, which she perceived to be unambitious. She received donations of 300.000 DKK for her campaign. The donations were controversial because The Alternative has a political goal to remove money from politics. Scavenius did not get elected, as The Alternative did not win any seats in the constituency. She received 1,267 votes; the most among the party's candidates in the constituency. Incumbent member of the Folketing, Christian Poll, followed with 1,162 votes. In December 2019, she announced that she was a candidate to become political leader of The Alternative, after founder Uffe Elb√¶k announced that he would resign in February 2020. Before her announcement, she had been seen as a likely candidate by the media. After two elimination rounds, she lost to Josephine Fock who got 936 votes against Scavenius's 668 votes.

Condensed milk and heavy cream can also be added. Some versions use oranges as well. However, the whipped topping and crust are essential ingredients, although the type of crust (e.g. graham cracker, shortbread) can vary.

He is mainly known for his publication of the oral tradition of Gascony. He is particularly known for publishing an account of the Mass of Saint-S√©caire, used as a source by James Frazer in The Golden Bough. His best-known work in France is his three-volume Contes populaires de la Gascogne (1886), a collection of folk tales supposedly taken down verbatim from illiterate narrators in the Gascon language, though Blad√© provides only a 'translation' into French. A German monograph (M.A. Steinbauer, Das M√§rchen vom Volksm√§rchen: Jean-Fran√ßois Blad√©..., Frankfurt am M., 1988) has shown, however, that many of these stories are Blad√©'s own invention. His information about his oral sources is confused and unconvincing (the chief of them, le vieux Cazaux, appears to be a fictional creation) and much of his collection betrays a nineteenth-century writer much indebted to the European tradition of high literature; 'La Reine ch√¢ti√©e', for example, one of his finest stories, is based on Shakespeare's Hamlet. To this one may add that Blad√©'s most perfect stories (most notably his wonderful 'Chatiments et vengeances' section in vol. 1) have a highly distinctive style and also a bleak atmosphere that is wholly alien to the spirit of genuine folk tales. Blad√© emerges as a forger, but one who deserves recognition as, admittedly within a narrow range, a writer of near genius. But the failure of the stories he published in his own name in his youth, which were too old-fashioned to win favour, led him to present his later fictions as oral folk tales of which he was the mere transcriber.

The film is about a woman named Clara who takes a job as a housekeeper and nanny for a wealthy woman only to realize that the job and pregnancy are more complicated than she originally believed. The film premiered at the 70th Locarno International Film Festival where it won the Special Jury Prize. Plot Clara (Isab√©l Zuaa) interviews for a nanny job despite having no experience or references. Just as she is about to be turned down for the job, the woman interviewing her, Ana, experiences cramping. A sympathetic Clara guides her through the pain and Ana decides to hire her as a live in housekeeper and future nanny. On her 29th birthday Ana gets drunk and reveals to Clara that she is estranged from her family. Originally engaged to one man she cheated on him and conceived a child from her affair. Her parents sent her to the city to have an abortion but after she refused to go through with it they cut off contact with her. Ana is ordered by her doctors not to consume meat. One night Clara finds her rifling through the fridge. When Clara tries to guide her to bed Ana kisses her before scratching her hard enough to draw blood. The following morning Ana does not appear to remember the incident. Clara realizes that the incident might be connected to the full moon. The following full moon Ana passionately kisses Clara and the two have sex. Later that night Ana sleepwalks again. Clara witnesses her murdering and eating a cat. The following day Clara tells Ana about her sleepwalking. She also puts some of her blood into Ana's meal in order to alleviate her desire for blood and her sleepwalking. On the following full moon, Ana experiences terrible cramping. Before Clara can call for help Ana's stomach ruptures, killing her, but leaving her baby, a werewolf pup, alive. Clara initially decides to run away and abandon the baby to die, but changes her mind and decides to raise it herself, giving it the name Joel. 7 years later Clara works as a nurse and is raising Joel as her own. To protect him she has raised him as a vegetarian and chains him up during full moons. After Clara's landlady gives Joel meat he becomes aggressive with her and searches through her things where he uncovers a photo of Ana. Clara reluctantly admits Ana is his birth mother but insists she does not know who his birth father is. Joel decides to look for his father, the only clue being a receipt from a shopping mall Ana bought shoes at. He and a friend go to the mall but are locked in when they decide to stay inside past closing. As it is still a full moon, Joel transforms into a werewolf and attacks his friend, killing him. He returns home alone but is seen by Clara's landlady who wants to perform an exorcism on him (as Joel's traits are affected by his transformation). Clara attacks her and then decides to run away with Joel but he instead locks her in the room she uses to hide him during full moons. Joel tries to attend a dance with a classmate named Jackie, but once again transforms, not before realizing what he really is and asking her to leave. Clara, who has managed to escape, shoots him before he can kill again, but keeps him alive. Clara takes Joel home and removes the bullet, bandaging him up. Meanwhile, an extremely frightened Jackie tells the locals what happened and they prepare to kill him, tracking down their apartment. With a lullaby Ana sang earlier in the film, Clara manages to tame Joel so that he does not attack her. She finally decides that she can't keep him locked up and hungry. As the locals bang on the door, Clara and Joel prepare to face them together as Joel lets out one final howl. Reception The film received a score of 95% on review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes and a 73 from Metacritic indicating positive reviews.

The HAA batteries were also given the secondary role of providing ground fire in support of XXX Corps. At Port-en-Bessin, the 3.7-inch guns of 146th HAA and Bofors 40 mm guns of 139th LAA Rgt were in action for 33 consecutive nights against high- and low-level bombing, employing visual, radar and barrage methods. The HAA guns fired 5563 rounds, scoring 11 'kills'. A subsidiary task was to establish radar stations on the cliffs above Arromanches and Port-en-Bessin using their Gun-laying radar to track Luftwaffe minelaying aircraft and plot the fall of the Parachute mines so that they could be cleared by the Royal Navy.Routledge, pp. 311, 313, Table XLIX, p. 319. Ostend AEC Matador gun tractor tows a 3.7-inch HAA gun through the ruins of Caen, August 1944. Once the Allies had achieved a breakout from the Normandy beachhead in mid-August, 76 AA Bde prepared to move up in support, handing over its responsibilities, including Port-en-Bessin, and moving to Dieppe on 3 September. 146th HAA Regiment deployed at Dieppe, with Lt-Col Key acting as AADC once more. 76 AA Brigade HQ then moved on to Antwerp while 80 AA Bde HQ came up from the Seine to take over at Dieppe on 11 September, including command of 146th HAA Rgt. However, First Canadian Army's advance along the Belgian coast was proceeding rapidly, and on 14 September 146th HAA Rgt was ordered to move up to Ostend, which had just been liberated.Routledge, Table L, p. 327.Routledge, Table LI, p. 329.80 AA Bde War Diary, 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085. At Ostend the regiment came under the command of 75 AA Bde, which had been moved up from Normandy to take over both AA and coast defence for the port. The re-opened harbour became an important supply point for stores and bulk petrol for 21st Army Group, the first tankers berthing on 30 September.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 15, 73, 132‚Äì4. Five HAA and two, later three, LAA regiments were devoted to its defence. 146th HAA Regiment also contributed a troop (4 guns) of its 3.7-inch guns to the coast defence role. There was no enemy air activity in the area at this stage of the campaign, but enemy torpedo boats attacked shipping in the anchorage.Routledge, p. 326. By November the LAA allocation to Ostend had been scaled back, but the HAA guns remained in place. Then the Germans launched their Ardennes offensive against the First US Army on 16 December, accompanied by major air strikes right across the Allies' front. These strikes extended as far as Ostend on 26 December when some 60 German aircraft made random attacks in mist and cloud. The early warning and reporting arrangements failed, and only two aircraft were shot down. The climax came on 1 January 1945 (Operation Bodenplatte) when over 900 fighters and fighter-bombers made surprise attacks on Allied airfields, including those close to Ostend. Despite the damage inflicted on the airfields, a high proportion of the attackers were shot down by fighters and AA guns.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 189‚Äì90.Routledge, pp. 345‚Äì7. In January 1945, 5 Royal Marines AA Bde took charge of Ostend while 75 AA Bde moved to defend the Breskens‚ÄìZeebrugge channel leading to the Scheldt estuary and the port of Antwerp. 75 AA Brigade borrowed some troops of HAA guns from the regiments at Ostend to thicken up its defences against mine-laying aircraft, which were active up until 23 January.Ellis, Vol II, p. 2321.Routledge p. 335‚Äì6, 348; Table LIII, p. 342;. Disbandment With the war in Europe rapidly coming to an end after the crossing of the Rhine in March, 21st Army Group began to reorganise its surplus AA troops as infantry, garrison or transport troops. On 16 April 146th HAA Rgt was moved up to the Scheldt to rejoin 76 AA Bde, taking over gunsites from one of the HAA regiments that was converting. Next day the regiment received warning orders to be ready to move to 80 AA Bde and itself convert to garrison troops on the River Maas. It ceased fire on 19 April, but the warning order was cancelled the next day. As 76 AA Bde's war diary commented, 'It is most exasperating for the Regt to be left high and dry with no orders for its future employment'. On 27 Apr 1945, 146th HAA Rgt regiment was listed as one of several AA units still awaiting re-employment or disbandment, but the next day it left for its new duties.76 AA Bde War Diary, January‚ÄìJuly 1945, TNA file WO 171/4889.Routledge, p. 348; Table LVII, p. 366.

His poems have appeared in most contemporary Catalan poetry anthologies. He was recognized as a talented poet from a young age with Una bella hist√≤ria (1962). Bau√ß√† wrote poetry and narrative work, contained in the publication of El Canvi (1998), the highlight of his work and the beginning of a poetic-encyclopedic project that deepened his later works. He died in late 2004, in solitude; his body was discovered in early 2005.  Early life  Bau√ß√† came from a farming family in Felanitx. He was predominantly raised by a cruel father after his mother died when he was 12; the lost relationship with his mother is detailed in a poem included in Una bella hist√≤ria. Shortly after his mother died, Bau√ß√† was sent to a seminary in Palma. Bau√ß√†'s grandfather was well-loved on the island. In childhood, he was described as \\"quiet and a little shy\\". In the late 1950s, Bau√ß√† and friends Joan Juli√† Maim√≥, Josep Grimalt and Joan Manresa started a young writers group in Felanitx. During this time, Bau√ß√† may have taken influence from Blai Bonet, a poet writing in Mallorcan style, using carnal and philosophical language. The Catalan language was particularly oppressed during the Franco regime, and using it for his writing was a political statement. Bau√ß√† himself wrote that there is little to note about his life after he turned 18.  Career and influence  Bau√ß√† lived the life of a hermit, but was also said to have an \\"unapologetically obsessive vitriol\\". He secluded himself in his apartment in Barcelona and did not own any books himself; he wrote at a long desk that \\"lined an entire room\\". In his seclusion, he refused his award for Carrer Marsala, and was an advocate for more equity in professional writing. Bau√ß√† wrote experimental prose that has been compared to Robert Walser, Dino Buzzati, and Franz Kafka. Both aspects of his life and work have resulted in Bau√ß√† being regarded more for his eccentricity than his work outside of Catalan-speaking countries. His poetry was notably diverse, when his character could suggest he would be univocal. In his biography of the author, Xavier Gual wrote that Bau√ß√† was \\"renowned for his verbal and social radicalism\\". His first published poetry collection was Una bella hist√≤ria, which has been said to have \\"a strange, completely literal realism, galvanized by a melancholy, scathing and strangely fresh view of things\\"; Pere Antoni Pons wrote in 2017 that \\"the book represented an earthquake in the Catalan poetic scene\\". Before this, he had written two other known collections: La carn i el goig and Cants jubilosos. After his first publication, Bau√ß√† moved to the Catalan mainland to study literature and philosophy at the university in Barcelona, taking with him the recommendation of Josep M. Llompart, considered \\"the highest critical authority on island poetry\\". During his university years, Bau√ß√†'s eccentricity became accentuated. He had a developmental disability that made communication with people difficult, and also fell into alcoholism. He won several awards, though critics turned colder after his first prose work, Carrer Marsala. Gual explains that he became the reference point as a writer whose work was \\"committed to an integral idea\\", being outside the literary system of the time. However, he continued to win awards for his later works. Death At an unknown time in late 2004, Bau√ß√† died in his apartment in Eixample, Barcelona. His body was found by the Mossos d'Esquadra on 3 January 2005; the news was not released until over a month later when he was officially identified. In 2006, a documentary called Miquel Bau√ß√†, poeta invisible was made about his life. Years after his death, a book of early poems was discovered and published posthumously. It had been in the collection of Pere Oliver Domenge, a mayor of Felanitx who had briefly had to live in exile from Franco in the Philippines. Gual wrote that he \\"[left] behind an unclassifiable literary corpus, which has unquestionably expanded the bounds of contemporary Catalan literature.\\"  Works  = Poetry = * Una bella hist√≤ria (1962) Won the Premio Joan Salvat-Papasseit de poes√≠a * El noble joc (1972) * Poemes (1973) * Notes i comentaris (1975) Won the Premio Vicent Andr√©s Estell√©s de poes√≠a * Cants jubilosos (1977) Won the Premio en el Certamen de honor de la Mare de D√©u de Sant Salvador de Felanitx * Les Mirsines: col√≤nia de vacances (1983) * Obra po√®tica 1959-1983 (1987) * El crepuscle enc√©n estels (1992) * En el feu de l'ermitage Won the Premio Miquel de Palol de poes√≠a * El Canvi (1998) Won the Premio Cr√≠tica Serra d'Or * Els estats de conniv√®ncia (2001) * Els somnis (2003) * Rudiments de saviesa (2005) * Certituds immediates (2007) *La carn i el goig (2017; written in the 1950s) = Narrative works = * Carrer Marsala (1985) Won the Premio Ciudad de Barcelona * L'estuari (1990) Won the Premio Sant Joan de narrativa * El vellard.

The bill empowers the Disciplinary Chamber at the Supreme Court of Poland to punish judges who engage in \\"political activity\\", including questioning the political independence of the panel. Punishment of judges may be a fine, reduction of salary, or termination from their position. The bill also changes the manner in which the head of the Supreme Court of Poland is appointed. The Law and Justice party had previously attempted to oust the current head, Ma≈Çgorzata Gersdorf, and her term expires in 2020. Giving the government, in effect, the ability to control and sack judges the legislation violates EU judicial system legislation. The bill was born as a continuation of the legislation following the 2015 Polish Constitutional Court crisis, further exerting political control on the courts. Critics of the law have called it draconian, and demonstrations against it took place throughout Poland. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said that the bill \\"risks further undermining the already heavily challenged independence of the judiciary in Poland\\". The EU urged Poland not to pass the bill, and to consult the Venice Commission, yet it passed. The Association of Judges of Ireland condemned the Polish legislation. Koen Lenaerts, President of the Court of Justice of the European Union, warned that \\"You can‚Äôt be a member of the European Union if you don‚Äôt have independent, impartial courts operating in accordance with fair trial rule, upholding union law\\".

According to the court: \\"Everything is there: a ban on the freedom of speech by judges, the establishment of a surveillance mechanism and a drastic reduction of their right to have profiles on social networks\\". The Polish Supreme Court, prior to the bill passing, said that Poland overruling the primacy of EU law may force it out of the bloc.

Anderson‚Äôs work with crime survivors eventually led to the launch of Crime Survivors for Safety and Justice, a network of survivors calling for new safety priorities that focus on prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. Ballot Measures and Initiatives Anderson was the Campaign Chair and co-author of 2014 California Proposition 47, a ballot initiative to reduce incarceration and reallocate prison spending to treatment, prevention, and victim services. Anderson served on the Steering Committee for 2016 California Proposition 57, a ballot initiative that incentivizes inmate rehabilitation through earned time credit and risk-based parole reviews. It also prohibits prosecutors from filing cases against juvenile defendants in adult criminal court. Awards In 2016 Anderson received the James Irvine Foundation Leadership Award for her efforts in California. In 2015 she was awarded the Frank Carrington Crime Victim Attorney Award by the American Bar Association. Education Anderson holds a J.D. from NYU School of Law and a B.A. from UC Berkeley.

He was the son of James Wood who was a road surveyor for Warrington but had started his career as a stonemason. His birth name was John Wood, and he added Warrington in circa 1865 to avoid confusion with a fellow artist of the same name. From 1858 Wood attended the new Warrington School of Art (Warrington Collegiate Institute) in the evenings and he quickly achieved local recognition and patronage. In 1865 Wood moved to Rome and established a highly successful practice, mainly focusing on portrait busts and sacred themes. In 1877 he was elected to the Guild of St Luke in Rome.

The songs are the first two tracks on the album, with the former being a 31-second phone recording that serves as an intro to the latter. Both songs were produced by Justin Vernon, Brad Cook, and Chris Messina, with additional production by BJ Burton. \\"Yi\\" and \\"iMi\\" feature additional production by Trevor Hagen and Andrew Sarlo, respectively. \\"Yi\\" and \\"iMi\\" are built off an audio snippet of cardboard sliding over a radio that is switched on-and-off. Vernon is credited as the sole lyricist on both songs, with him singing about the themes of comfort and familiarity. Recording of \\"iMi\\" took five years and nearly 30 collaborators to complete. \\"Yi\\" was recorded in the winter of 2014 at the April Base in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, which began the recording process of \\"iMi\\" that was completed in 2019 at the Sonic Ranch in Tornillo, Texas. Credited composers and musicians include James Blake, Velvet Negroni, Camilla Staveley-Taylor, Aaron Dessner, CJ Camerieri, and Wheezy, amongst others. Background and recording Justin Vernon began recording the song in 2014, yet didn't finish writing its lyrics until 2019, at the Sonic Ranch in Texas. \\"Yi\\" is a phone recording from the winter of 2014 in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Bon Iver frontman Justin Vernon and his close friend Trever Hagen were experimenting with turning a radio on-and-off while sliding cardboard over it at the time, resembling a hip hop chop. Vernon immediately told producer Brad Cook that he wanted this fragmented recording to be the basis of the first track on their then-upcoming album, which later became \\"iMi\\". Mike Noyce recorded his vocals for the track in 2015. That same year, Vernon met with British musician James Blake while the former was in London, where the latter played synthesizers for the track. The two had previously collaborated on the tracks \\"Fall Creek Boys Choir\\" from 2011 and \\"I Need a Forest Fire\\" from 2016. American singer Frank Ocean was present for Blake's contributions. In 2017, Vernon previewed \\"iMi\\" to American record producer Wheezy, where he offered to provide drum programming for the track. Prior to the collaboration, Wheezy did not know of Vernon or Bon Iver. In 2018, Rob Moose's Worms Crew recorded the horns on the track. Moose had made three different trips to Wisconsin for working on the song. Vernon struggled to write his first verse for the song due to the pressure that \\"iMi\\" would be the album's first full track. In January 2019, recording continued at the Sonic Ranch in Tornillo, Texas. Andrew Sarlo, who was a long-time fan of Bon Iver, provided additional production for the track while he was at the Sonic Ranch. Cook called Sarlo's work a \\"turning point\\" for the song, praising his chopping of the chorus and the bassline. The former then pressured Vernon to complete writing the lyrics to the song. Composition and lyrics The basis of \\"Yi\\" and \\"iMi\\" came from a snippet of Vernon and Hagen turning a radio on-and-off while sliding cardboard over it. Spencer Kornhaber, writing for The Atlantic, described \\"Yi\\" as an intro into \\"iMi\\" and stated that car wash-like noises \\"keep a lazy rhythm\\". Kornhaber elaborated, saying that the songs' busyness eventually \\"gives way to cozy strumming\\". The songs' elements cumulate, with Will Hermes, for Rolling Stone, stating that \\"all of it somehow gel[s] into a fantastic whole.\\" Hermes described the beginning of the songs as \\"doubling- down on the future-pop abstractions\\" before making way for Vernon's raw vocals. Matthew Strauss of Pitchfork described Vernon's delivery as simple and his lyrics as him \\"locating peace within the ordinary and everyday\\".\\" Zack Ruskin of Variety described Vernon's lyrics as \\"celebrating the comfort of familiarity\\". Mike Noyce, Velvet Negroni, Camilla Staveley-Taylor, and James Blake collaborate to sing across different frequencies within the song. Kornhaber stated that he believes the chorus \\"I am / I am / I am\\" ironically gives a sense of we. Release and promotion On July 11, 2019, Bon Iver announced their fourth studio album I, I, and revealed a track list that included both \\"Yi\\" and \\"iMi\\". On August 8, 2019, without prior announcement, eight of the album's nine remaining songs, including \\"iMi\\", were released digitally. The releases were hourly, while \\"Yi\\" was then shared exclusively on Reddit. On September 1, 2019, Bon Iver started their I, I tour in Bonner, Montana. \\"iMi\\" was performed at the show and was included on the set list for the tour. On October 1 of that year, Bon Iver performed in Brooklyn as the special guests for American morning television program CBS This Morning. The show highlighted the band's performance of \\"iMi\\", and the songs \\"Blood Bank\\" and \\"Salem\\". Commercial performance \\"iMi\\" charted in both the United States and New Zealand on non-primary charts. On the US Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart, the song peaked at number 36, making it the fourth highest- peaking track from I, I, behind the singles \\"Hey, Ma\\" and \\"Faith\\", and the non-single track \\"Naeem\\". However, \\"iMi\\" peaked higher than two of the album's singles, \\"U (Man Like)\\" and \\"Jelmore\\". In New Zealand, the song peaked at 36 on the NZ Hot Singles chart.

The causes of LOCAH are the same as of classic CAH, and in majority the of the cases are the mutations in the CYP21A2 gene resulting in corresponding activity changes in the associated P450c21 (21-hydroxylase) protein enzyme which ultimately leads to excess androgen production. Other causes, albeit less frequent, are mutations in genes affecting other enzymes involved in steroid metabolism, like 11Œ≤-hydroxylase or 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. It is an autosomal disease and common (0.1%‚Äì2% prevalence depending on population). The pathophysiology is complex and not all individuals are symptomatic. Presentation Patients with LOCAH usually present with signs of hyperandrogenism rather than of glucocorticoid deficiency. Females may present with symptoms like hirsutism, oligomenorrhea, acne, infertility, and male-pattern baldness. Males are generally asymptomatic, but may present with acne, early balding and testicular adrenal rest tumors. While symptoms are usually diagnosed after puberty, children may present with premature adrenarche. The degree of hormonal disorder in patients with LOCAH is relatively mild. Such patients have not been extensively studied. However, alterations in the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis are present even in this mild form of the disease and might contribute to psychiatric vulnerability. LOCAH was originally characterized in 1957 by French biochemist Jacques Decourt. LOCAH-affected individuals account for 88% of Anne Fausto-Sterling's 1.7% prevalence estimate of intersex conditions, which is cited by a number of prominent intersex advocacy organizations. From the clinical perspective, LOCAH is not an intersex condition. Molecular genetics LOCAH is most commonly attributed to mutations in the CYP21A2 gene, which encodes 21-hydroxylase. Cases of LOCAH due to deficiencies in other enzymes that are known causes of CAH (3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, steroid 11Œ≤-hydroxylase, etc.) are rare and have no established prevalence estimates. The following three mutations to the CYP21A2 gene are mostly associated with LOCAH: * p.V281L (rs6471, CYP21A2*15); * p.P453S (rs6445, CYP21A2*19); * p.P30L (rs9378251, CYP21A2*8). A point mutation in exon 7 of CYP21A2 (p.V281L) accounts for the majority of LOCAH alleles worldwide. Carriers for this mild, p.V281L mutation, resulting in retaining of 20%‚Äì50% of 21-hydroxylase activity, are at higher risk of symptoms of androgen excess than carriers of the severe mutations, and had higher adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulated 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone. The particularly mild clinical symptoms of LOCAH such as hyperandrogenism, hirsutism and acne or infertility overlap with other diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome. Biochemical parameters like 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone may not be elevated in very mild cases of LOCAH, and may vary between labs that makes interpretation difficult; and is may not not possible to perform ACTH stimulation tests in all institutions, depending on the availability of the injectable ACTH medication. This is why a comprehensive CYP21A2 genotyping (rather than variant-specific assays alone) is a good way to exclude/confirm 21-hydroxylase deficiency and heterozygosity (carrier) status. Diagnosis LOCAH differs from classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia in that it does not cause atypical neonatal genital morphology, is not life threatening and presents after birth. Unlike classic CAH, LOCAH generally cannot be reliably detected with neonatal screening. Many individuals (both male and female) present no symptoms during childhood and adolescence and only become aware of the possibility of LOCAH due to the diagnosis of another family member. In young females, premature pubarche is generally the first symptom to present. The earliest known diagnosis was in a 6 month old female who developed pubic hair. Additional symptoms include acne, menstrual irregularities and hirsutism in females as well as alopecia in males. LOCAH is often misdiagnosed as polycystic ovarian disease (PCOS). LOCAH is sometimes diagnosed during an evaluation for oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea and infertility. However, an estimated 90% of women with LOCAH never receive a diagnosis. Once they start trying to conceive, roughly 83% of women with known LOCAH become pregnant within 1 year, with or without glucocorticoid therapy. Such women have consistently been found to be at increased risk for miscarriage. The diagnostic procedure varies according to the specific enzyme deficiency causing LOCAH and the precise serum androgen levels required for diagnosis are the subject to variance from different measurement methods, refinement in specific cases and are under active research. The ACTH stimulation protocols are described in Kurtoƒülu and Hatipoƒülu. =21-Hydroxylase deficiency=  Screening  The condition is screened by measuring serum levels of 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) in the morning and between day 3 and 5 of the menstrual cycle (for females) to reduce the possibility of false positive results. 17-OHP is one of the markers of the 21-hydroxylase enzyme activity. 17-OHP between 1.7 and 3.0 ng/mL is sufficient for diagnosis while higher levels suggest further investigation. Randomly timed measurements of 17-OHP have not been shown to be useful for screening since they are often normal and are known to be very high in the luteal phase of the female menstrual cycle. After basal levels have been measured, confirmation is done by administering ACTH, and comparing 17-OHP pre and post test. 17-OHP levels over 10 ng/mL at the 60th minute post stimulation is considered diagnostic for LOCAH. Androgen backdoor pathway In 21-hydroxylase deficiency, especially in mild cases (LOCAH), the androgen \\"backdoor\\" pathway may be the reason of androgen excess. This backdoor pathway is not always considered in the clinical evaluation of patients with hyperandrogenism conditions such as LOCAH and may be a source of diagnostic pitfalls and confusion. One case study demonstrated the importance of considering serum 5Œ±-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels and the androgen backdoor pathway in a LOCAH diagnosis that would have not been apparent from testosterone levels alone. =11-Hydroxylase deficiency= The activity of 11Œ≤-hydroxylase can be determined by observing the basal 11-deoxycortisol level. A level over 10 ng/mL, indicates followup with ACTH stimulation test. The 60th minute post-stimulation 11-deoxycortisol levels higher than 18 ng/mL are diagnostic of LOCAH. = 3Œ≤-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency = The activity of 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase can be determined by observing the basal 17Œ±-hydroxypregnenolone level. A level above 30 ng/mL and 17Œ±-hydroxypregnenolone/cortisol ratio above 10 SD are diagnostic of LOCAH.  Management  Management and treatment of LOCAH is case specific and the application of glucocorticoid treatment is not standard as it is in classic CAH. Recent reviews emphasize treatment that is specific to each case rather than merely abnormal hormone levels. LOCAH is not a life-threatening medical condition and the risks of treatment given prenatally or to asymptomatic children outweigh potential benefits. In appropriate cases, glucocorticoids (usually hydrocortisone in children) are administered to suppress secretion of hypothalmic corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and pituitary ACTH which will reduce serum concentrations of adrenal sex steroids. Some of the main considerations in treatment include the watchful waiting of symptom severity as well as adverse responses to exogenous glucocorticoids seen in patient bone density, height and weight. For women, an oral contraceptive pill and spironolactone or cyproterone acetate, are alternatives to glucocorticoids for managing symptoms of androgen excess. Incidence According to haplotype association studies, the prevalence of LOCAH in the general white population is estimated to be 1:500 to 1:1000, but in people with a high rate of marriage between relatives, the prevalence rate is as high as 1:50 to 1:100. A 2017 CYP21A2 genotype analysis predicts that the total frequency of LOCAH in the US caucasian population is about 1:200 (95% confidence level, from 1:100 to 1:280).

Marangoni's art criticism aimed at identifying pure figurative values, in which an artwork's poetic values are identified. His books are positively influenced by the school of Benedetto Croce and Heinrich W√∂lfflin, clarifying their concepts on the basis of observation and following logic as a science of pure concept. Life Born in Florence to Maria Augusta Malvisi and her physics-teacher husband Carlo Marangoni, he took his secondary school diploma in 1896 but did not continue with his studies straight away, instead moving to London to indulge his passion for music. There he performed as a pianist and composed short pieces for voice and piano ‚Äì Barcarola in 1897, Serenata in 1900, Le pastorelle montanine di Franco Sacchetti in 1901, Tre canti di Giacomo Leopardi in 1902 and Gavotta, also in 1902. He later returned to Florence and attended the Facolt√† di scienze, graduating in 1905 in anthropology. He then moved to Paris and back to London as well as travelling in Germany, becoming interested in the figurative arts. On his second return to Italy in 1909 he took an art history course in Bologna and in 1910 married Drusilla Tanzi, with whom he had a son, Andrea. In the same year as his marriage he became a volunteer at the Superintendency of Arts in Florence, later becoming its inspector (1913) and director. He also taught art history at the Collegio della SS. Annunziata on Poggio Imperiale from 1916 to 1925 and was briefly director of the Pinacoteca di Brera (1920) and the Galleria nazionale di Parma (1924) Luca Barreca, Matteo Marangoni, vol. 69, \\" Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani \\", Roma, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia italiana, 2007. During this period he became particularly interested in 17th century art, publishing several articles on that era in the \\"L'Arte\\", \\"Bollettino d'arte\\", \\"Dedalo\\", \\"Rassegna d'arte\\", \\"Rivista d'arte\\" and \\"Vita d'Arte\\" arts reviews. In 1925 the University of Palermo commissioned an art history course from him and the following year became a visiting lecturer at the University of Pisa. In 1927 he published Arte barocca (Baroque Art) and Come si guarda un quadro (How to look at a picture), followed in 1933 by Saper vedere (Knowing how to look). From 1938 he taught art history at the University of Milan, returning to Pisa from 1946 until his retirement in 1951. In 1953 he published Capire la musica (How to understand music), spending his final years in Pisa, where he also died and where a street is named after him. His last work, a monograph on Guercino, was published in the year after his death AA.

Selima Oasis is an oasis in the Sudan located west of the Third Cataract of the Nile and the ancient site of Amara West. It lies along the Darb al-Arba øƒ´n (Forty Days' Road), a desert track linking Kordofan with Egypt. Just to the north of Selima, the track splits into a northern route going to Kharga Oasis and a northwestern route going to Dunqul Oasis.Richard Lobban, Historical Dictionary of Ancient and Medieval Nubia (Scarecrow Press, 2004), p. 347. Geography Selima lies at the base of an escarpment of Jurassic and Cretaceous rock. Around 8300 BC, a freshwater lake formed over the site with depths of . The surrounding vegetation was savannah at the time. The remains of lacustrine fauna and of Palaeolithic artefacts have been recovered from the site. Around 4300, it transitioned to a saltwater sabkha and by 2700 it had dried up. Today it lies over the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System.Friederike Jesse, Coralie Gradel and Franck Derrien, \\"Archaeology at Selima Oasis, Northern Sudan: Recent Research\\", Sudan & Nubia, No. 19 (2015), pp. 161‚Äì169 The flora of Selima is not particularly varied and includes grasses (Desmostachya bipinnata and Imperata cylindrica), reeds (Phragmites australis), camelthorn (Alhagi maurorum), date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), dom palm (Hyphaene thebaica) and several species of tamarisk (Tamarix). Although upwards of 2500 date palms were counted in the oasis in 1902, just over 1000 were found in 2011. Dates have never been an important part of the economy of the oasis. History The Beit es-Selima, the ruins of a medieval structure. Selima has been in use for millennia as a waypoint for travellers to bypass the Second Cataract. Pottery of the Mesolithic Early Khartoum culture has been found at Selima. The Egyptian official Harkhuf almost certainly used it on his trading missions to Kerma. Traveller's descriptions of the oasis date back to the 16th century and all describe the place as having easy access to water. Potable water is found below the surface. In the early 19th century, Fr√©d√©ric Cailliaud found three wells in use at Selima and three wells are still in use today. The archaeologist William Boyd Kennedy Shaw, who visited Selima during his circuit of the Libyan Desert in 1935, called it the \\"loveliest of all the Libyan oases\\". Only minor archaeological work was done at Selima in the 1970s and 1980s. The first major excavations were undertaken by the Selima Oasis Project in 2011, 2013 and 2014. Atop a mound about southeast of the oasis vegetation lies the Beit es- Selima, the ruins of an ancient multi-roomed stone structure. Carbon dating and potsherds put the building in use during the Nubian early (AD 600‚Äì850) and classical (AD 850‚Äì1100) Christian periods. Most pottery recovered was wheel- made and a few decorated pieces were from Aswan. Although not originally fortified, the building dominates the surrounding countryside and in the early 20th century was used a police watchtower or fort (tabia) by the Anglo- Egyptian administration. Theories about its purpose abound. It has been described as a tavern on the Darb al-Arba øƒ´n managed by a warrior-princess named Selima and as a Christian convent.Friederike Jesse, \\"Fending off the Desert Dwellers ‚Äì The Gala Abu Ahmed Fortress and other fortified Places in the South Libyan Desert\\", in Dietrich Raue (ed.), Handbook of Ancient Nubia (De Gruyter, 2019), pp. 1069‚Äì1092. The Catholic missionary Theodor Krump described it as the ruins of an eight-celled monastery when he passed through in 1700. Support for this theory may come from the ·∏§ud≈´d al- øƒÄlam, a 10th- century Persian geography, which describes two monasteries as lying \\"in the desert between the Nuba and the Sudan\\".Derek Welsby, The Medieval Kingdoms of Nubia. Pagans, Christians and Muslims Along the Middle Nile (British Museum, 2002), p. 86. On and around the Beit es-Selima are numerous inscriptions and engravings. These include writing in Arabic and Libyco-Berber, but not Greek or Coptic. Some signs might be camel brands or tribal markings. There are also a few figural engravings. They show that Selima was in contact with the Kharga Oasis, the Dakhla Oasis and the Darfur. In 1928, the archaeologist Thomas Leach reported that salt was mined at Selima by groups who came by donkey and camel from Sukkot, Argo Island and the Mahas. The salt caravans followed a track from Sagiat el-Abd in the Nile valley. According to oral tradition recorded in the vicinity of the Dal Cataract in 2014, the last salt caravan took place in 1980. Today there is a military post, a police office and a customs station at Selima. Most traffic passing through is going to or coming from Libya.

Life Born in Trieste, he studied medicine at the University of Padua then at the University of Graz. His Italian nationalism prevented him working in medicine in Trieste and so he instead began his psychiatric training in Reggio Emilia under the guidance of the Bolognese neurologist and psychiatrist Augusto Tamburini, whose school united organisational and scientific skills. Tanzi conformed to this school, taking a biological approach to psychiatry. In 1893 he became professor of psychiatry at the University of Cagliari and two years later professor of psychiatry at the University of Florence, where he remained for the rest of his career and where he conducted a series of experiments on neurology and neuropsychology. Whilst in Florence he also became one of the first in Europe to support Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal's neuron theory, destined to play a fundamental role in the development of neuroscience.Cfr.Berlucchi, G. (2002), and became superintendent of the San Salvi asylum. In 1896 Tanzi, Tamburini and Enrico Morselli founded the Rivista di Patologia Nervosa e Mentale (RPNM), one of the first Italian reviews on neuropsychiatry. Tanzi's own best-known works include a co-study with Riva on paranoia (1884), whilst he co-published the two-volume Trattato delle malattie mentali (Treatise on Mental Maladies) with his former student Ernesto Lugaro in 1904, with the latter remaining a central text for Italian psychiatry until the late 1920s and a long-term influence on psychopathology and psychiatric clinics Cfr. Peccarisi, C., Boeri, R., Salmaggi, A. (1994). In 1907 he became secretary-general of the Societ√† Italiana di Neurologia Cfr. Salomone, G., Arnone, R., Zanchin, G. (1996) and was initiated into the 'Universo' Masonic Lodge in Rome V. Gnocchini, L'Italia dei Liberi Muratori, Mimesis-Erasmo, Milano-Roma, 2005, p.263.. In 1929 Tanzi, Charles Scott Sherrington and Ivan Pavlov were made honorary members of the British Royal College of Psychiatry. He died in Sal√≤ days before his seventieth birthday.

It is a collapsed star that resembles a black hole, but is formed without a point-like central singularity and without an event horizon. The model of the shell collapsar was first proposed by Trevor W. Marshall and allows the formation of neutron stars beyond the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit of 0.7 M‚òâ. A shell collapsar is void inside and embodies the de-Sitter model there. According to Newton's shell theorem, the acceleration of gravity in the center of each celestial body is zero and rises to its surface (cf. gravitational field in the interior of the earth (PREM)). Without acceleration of gravity, the curvature of spacetime in the center of each celestial body is zero. With neutron stars beyond the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, the time dilation due to gravity is extreme on its surface, so that the neutron star freezes on its outer shell. Another possible explanation is that when Newton's 1 / r¬≤ law is left, the Newtonian shell theorem no longer applies at the location of the strongest curvature, outward gravitational forces arise and pull the inner matter into the shell. The shell collapsar is a special case of a gravastar. With the gravastar, an exotic form of matter stabilizes the object with the equation of state of dark energy inside. The shell collapsar comes to a similar result with ordinary neutron star matter and simply Einstein's field equations.

Design and development As early as 1933, Alksandr Moskalyev was designing a rocket-powered, tailless aircraft with an ogival or gothic delta wing with wingtip fins and rudders, able to fly faster than sound. Because no sufficiently powerful engines were available at the time, the Moskalyev SAM-4 Sigma never left the drawing board but it did lead to two interim types, the SAM-7 Sigma and SAM-9 Strela. The tailless Strela was built to test the behaviour of the SAM-4's radically new wing plan which, had the leading edges been straight, would have been a highly swept delta. Instead they were moderately convex. Set at shoulder height, the wing reached from the nose ahead of the engine back to mid-fin; including its broad-chord, tab- assisted elevons it reached the extreme tail. It had the unusually low aspect ratio of 0.925. Like the rest of the Strela, the wing structure was wooden. Control surfaces were fabric covered but the rest of the Strela's skin was ply. Moskalyev had intended to fit a Hispano-Suiza 12Y engine in the Strela but only a Renault 6P was provided. The Strela's enclosed cockpit was at about mid-chord with a fairing behind it reaching to the large, blunted triangular fin. Its narrower rudder, like the elevons, was tab-assisted. The Strela had a tall, fixed, conventional undercarriage, with cantilever faired legs based on those of the Moskalyev SAM-5 and a sprung tailskid. It was first flown, at Voronezh, in early 1937 by A.N.Rybo. A.N.Gusarov and A.P.Chernavskii explored its characteristics over the next few months, finding it controllable but demanding. The high landing angle of attack (20¬∫) of delta-like wing aircraft was not then familiar but worrying. In mid-1937 development of the SAM-9 was terminated.

The company was bought in 2010 for 1.2 billion DKK by British BAE Systems (which, in 2019, was ranked the fourth-most profitable weapons company by USA Today in the world (expect in China, due to lacking data) with an annual profit of 1.1 billion USD.). In 2012, SKAT accused the company of tax evasion, claiming it had failed to pay 104.6 million DKK. An investigation by BBC and Dagbladet Information in June 2017 revealed that BAE Systems has sold a surveillance system called Evident, produced by ETI Telecom, to the governments of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Oman, Morocco and Algeria. ETI also produced equipment for former Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. An anonymous former employee at ETI told Information: \\"With the system we built, one will be able to listen in on all forms of internet traffic. Do you wish to surveil an entire country? Is easily doable. One can see the precis locations of individuals based on phone activity. One can follow their route. Also, the company was far in the development of voice recognition. They could also decrypt things.\\" As the buyer countries have a poor record of securing human rights, the sale was criticized by groups such as Amnesty International and Privacy International. During the Danish Business Authority's processing of the company's application to be allowed to export to Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar, it asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to assess whether there was a risk of the product being used for human rights violations, as required by EU law, to which the full response was, each time, \\"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs finds no reason to object to the attached application\\". A few months after these revelations, BAE Systems shut down their Danish branch, firing 160 employees.

The children behind the donors wearing white shrouds are assumed to have had died before the painting was finished. Due to a lack of secure documentation, attribution was only established in the 20th century to Oostsanen based on underdrawings and comparison to his other works. The portrayed donors have been variously named due to a combination of genealogical research and identification of the coats of arms. Part of the documentation problem is not knowing whether the shrouded children were recorded as baptized or not. Currently RKDimages states that the left wing shows Claes Bouwensz.

It gained notoriety in Pakistani media and press due to its unusual content. Content Paragraph authored by Waqar Ahmed Seth directed Pakistan's law enforcement agencies to arrest and execute Musharraf and if they are unable to do that and Musharraf dies due to some other cause then they should drag his body to D-Chowk in Islamabad and hang it for three days in front of Parliament building. The other judge Shahid Karim who agreed with overall verdict disagreed with the content of paragraph 66. Due to the fact that no other judge agreed with this paragraph, it is considered an opinionated note of Seth and thus not enforceable. Reaction The content and the author of para 66 was widely criticized by all sections of Pakistani society. *Pakistan Army: Asif Ghafoor: Ghafoor issued veiled threats against judges stating that this is a plot against the country and Armed Forces and Armed Forces know how to defend their dignity and honour. We know where our enemies are externally and internally and who is working on behalf of the enemy. We have a plan to encounter and eradicate our enemies. *Government of Pakistan: Shehzad Akbar: Akbar, a minister in Government of Imran Khan said that the author of this paragraph or whoever directed it to be included in judgement cannot be a friend of the nation or a patriotic Pakistani. He said that the government will file a reference against Seth is Supreme Judicial Council for his removal. Farogh Naseem: Naseem called the language of the paragraph \\"despicable\\", \\"inhumane\\", and \\"unethical\\". He announced that the government will file a reference in Supreme Judicial Council requesting removal of Seth from judiciary. He also said that the judge is \\"mentally unfit\\" and does not have the mental capacity to serve in superior judiciary. Firdous Ashiq Awan: She stated that the judgement of which this paragraph is part, is a plot against the country and Pakistani military. *Opposition: Bilawal Bhutto Zardari: Bhutto Zardari described the para as personal opinion of the judge.

Biography Zaddiq was a Portuguese-Jewish banker and merchant whose community moved to Amsterdam following the 1579 Union of Utrecht. He was married to Gracia da Costa (in Hebrew, Rita Zaddiq) both had come from Hamburg to Amsterdam. Zaddiq is known also for being reported to the Amsterdam authorities as a wife- beater: testimony given in court by a number of witnesses showed he had beaten his wife (apparently he had a history of being violent toward her) with a stick and thrown her down the stairs. He was sentenced to a year in prison. Map of Canaan Christian van Adrichem's 1590 map which was copied by Zaddiq Zaddiq is responsible, with engraver Abraham Goos, for the first printed map of the Holy Land in Hebrew, printed in 1620/21. In the framed colophon, in the first line it reads: The map was based on the work of Christian Kruik van Adrichem. Zaddiq explains, in the colophon he prepared for the map, how he copied van Adrichem's map and translated its captions into Hebrew, and that he \\"carefully checked that every detail would be appropriate for his Jewish audience\\". Zaddiq made some significant changes to the original map. It contained a number of illustrations of Jesus's life at the appropriate places in Canaan, which Zaddiq removed‚Äîdetails such as a miniature illustrating the Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac and one for the Transfiguration of Jesus on Mount Tabor. On the other hand, he added details appropriate to a Jewish audience, including a number of ships that fly historically important flags: a ship near the Nile delta flies a Muslim flag, signifying the Muslim rule over Egypt, and another off the coast of north Sinai flies the Star of David. According to Rehav Rubin, \\"This Jewish element perhaps gives voice to the author's desire to visit Eretz Yisrael or his deep yearning for the reestablishment of the Judean kingdom\\". In a departure from van Adrichem's map, the upper Hebrew caption on Zaddiq's map recites several Hebrew verses, the first one being a partial quote from ; the second verse being a partial quote from ; the third verse being a partial quote taken from ; the fourth verse, where it mentions the \\"land of the gazelle,\\" is an allusion to ; the fifth verse is a partial quote taken from ; the sixth verse is taken from ; the seventh verse from ; the eighth verse being from ; which verse, in turn, is followed by . The colophon also contains a portrait of Zaddiq, and the text explains the portrait as well as the map. It states that it was engraved by Abraham Goos from Amsterdam. The map was to help Jews become acquainted with the Holy Land that God had given them, and he added the portrait \\"so that my people will preserve a good keepsake of me\\". He had himself depicted as a baroque gentleman, a reputable, dignified, and important Spanish courtier‚Äîa representation far removed from reality.

She also served as member of the Chamber of Deputies from 2009 to 2015. Previously, she was Executive Director of Poder Ciudadano, the Argentine chapter of Transparency International. Early life and education Laura Alonso was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and graduated with a degree in political science from the University of Buenos Aires. She also holds a master's degree in public administration and public policy from the London School of Economics and Political Science. She is a Chevening Scholar, an Eisenhower Fellow and a Draper Hills Fellow. Political career =Poder Ciudadano= After graduating, Alonso joined the staff of Poder Ciudadano (Citizen Power), a government watchdog organization and the Argentine chapter of Transparency International. She was later promoted to Executive Director. During her tenure at Poder Ciudadano, she helped promote open government policies as well as monitoring of judicial corruption and government influence over the media. =Legislative= Alonso was elected in the 2009 elections as National Deputy for the City of Buenos Aires under the Republican Proposal ticket, alongside Gabriela Michetti, among others. As a legislator, Alonso introduced the Ley de Transparencia, Gobierno Abierto y Acceso a La Informaci√≥n P√∫blica (Transparency, Open Government and Access to Public Information Law) with the goal of increasing government transparency by giving citizens access to public information. She also drafted legislation on judicial and criminal reforms, electoral issues and gender parity, including a bill to ensure salary parity for Argentine workers. In 2008, she was awarded the Vital Voices Global Leadership Award for her work in combating corruption and promoting good governance. In 2012, she was selected Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum. By then a known name in Argentine media for her crusade against corruption and confrontations with Kirchnerite officials, Alonso became notorious in 2015 for her friendship with Alberto Nisman, a federal prosecutor who was found dead days before publishing a 288-page report with incriminating evidence on then-president Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner's involvement in the 1994 AMIA bombing cover-up. Alonso later testified in Nisman's murder trial where she showed her message exchanges with the late prosecutor, in which he expressed being in fear for his life. =Anti- Corruption Office= In December 2015, president Mauricio Macri appointed Alonso as head of the Anti-Corruption Office (AO). The appointment was criticized by the opposition for not meeting the requirement of being a lawyer as required for the office. Macri signed a presidential decree that modified this obligation and established as a requirement \\"to have a university degree, solid academic background, qualified professional background in law, social sciences or economics and a recognized democratic and republican career.\\" During her time at the AO, the agency published more than 90 thousand affidavits regarding assets from officials of the Executive Branch and legislators in the National Public Data Portal within the Ministry of Modernization. In 2018, Alonso was chair of the G-20 Anti-Corruption Working Group. Laws enacted During her tenure at the AO, the following bills and decrees were enacted, among others: * Whistleblower Act: Adds the possibility of reducing or exempting penalties from those who provide \\"accurate, verifiable and useful information to avoid the consummation or continuation of a crime; help clarify the fact under investigation or other related; reveal the identity of co-authors, participants or coverts of the investigated or other related facts, or the intervention of other persons.\\" It was made into a law in October 2016 by the National Congress. * Corporate Liability Law: Its main purpose is to prevent corruption through the implementation of integrity programs that encourage the collaboration of the private sector in the investigation of corruption; it seeks to follow the standards in transparency promoted by the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD). During the debate on the law, Alonso requested that the so-called \\"Odebrecht clause\\" be re-included in the bill, which allowed companies to reach an agreement with the Attorney General in order to reduce a penalty in exchange for information on previous crimes. * Integrity Decrees in Trials against the State and Public Procurement: These are two additional transparency tools in which the President of the Nation and other government authorities are self-limited in cases of lawsuits against the State and public procurement related to them. For the elaboration of these decrees, the Anti-Corruption Office carried out a participatory consultation process that included contributions from non-governmental organizations and the general public through the Internet. Judicial causes intervened The Anti-Corruption Office intervened as a complainant in more than 35 cases for corruption offenses within the scope of the Federal Government, including the 2012 Buenos Aires rail disaster, the Hotesur, Ciccone and Qunita scandals; the trials against L√°zaro B√°ez, Carlos Liuzzi, Jos√© L√≥pez, Amado Boudou and C√©sar Milani, as well as a case of bribes and kickbacks in the Ministry of Health. Controversies During 2016, Alonso's first year in charge of the Office, more than 22,000 public officials did not submit their sworn statement forms. The Anti-Corruption Office was criticized for emitting complaints in this regard only against opponents of the government of which it is a part of, for which it was charged with \\"manifest bias\\" and accused of using its function \\"to prosecute adversaries.\\" She was also accused of non- compliance with her duties and functions as head of the AO for alleged infractions committed by former Energy Minister Juan Jos√© Aranguren, accused of conflict of interest for signing deals that benefited the Royal Dutch Shell oil company, of which he was shareholder and former CEO of its Argentine division. Alonso replied by saying that \\"having shares in a company is not necessarily a conflict of interest. This is why we ask all officials in those cases to delegate decisions.\\" In September 2016, the AO decided to recommend that Aranguren must detach himself from his Shell shares as well as let him know that in matters related to the company he must refrain from intervening and designate an official in his replacement.

She learnt flute, clarinet and saxophone, listening to a lot of big band music on the family's radio. She noted \\"my father was the first feminist I knew‚Äù. She played in school bands and fellow students included Hal McKusick and Serge Chaloff. With Chaloff's backing, she was offered a spot with Eddie Durham's All-Star Girl Orchestra.Oxford Encyclopedia of Popular Music (2006, 4th ed.), Ed. Colin Larkin, Oxford University Press After graduating Cron joined Ada Leonard‚Äôs All-American Girl Orchestra and then, at 19 (1943) was invited into the all female International Sweethearts of Rhythm in New Britain, Connecticut. She was brought in as a professional to replace alto- sax player Marge Pettiford. The International Sweethearts of Rhythm (1998) D. Antoinette Handy, Scarecrow Press, pp158-159 Being from the American north, Cron had not encountered segregation before or the racial laws enforced in the south. Many of the International Sweethearts were African American or of mixed backgrounds, and in touring the segregated southern states, Cron was often charged with illegal mixing. Dark, Jewish, Cron was introduced by the diverse band as \\"part Russian\\" to give her an aura of ethnic mystery. She darkened her looks and permed her hair to increase the air of the exotic and to fit in with the other women. The band bus often kept its shades down when travelling through the deep south and the women slept in berths on the bus, to avoid mixed accommodation laws. Cron was made head of the sax section and she noted that the experience deeply helped her improve her musical phrasing and allowed her to make contacts. Both elements supported her through her future years. With the band she met a wide cross-section of musicians in the US and Europe, from assorted backgrounds, which gave her a compassion, respect and empathy that she says underpinned the rest of her life. Cron made her name and international reputation in the field as lead alto and featured soloist with the Sweethearts. =Post war= In July 1945 Cron and the band recorded Jubilee Broadcasts for GIs with radio NBC, shows that were relayed through Armed Forces Radio. Under pressure from listeners, the band were invited to perform for the Third and Seventh Armies abroad. They were issued USO uniforms and landed at Le Havre, driving through bombed out towns across Europe. They played troupes in Germany and France, including three weeks in Paris and shows at Nuremberg Opera House. In 1945 Cron attended a service in Stuttgart for Jewish soldiers and survivors of the liberated concentration camps, a deeply moving event that was a milestone in her life. \\"Women of note\\", CBS, January 12, 2001 Cron left the Sweethearts in 1946 and lived in Spanish Harlem with bassist Helen Saine, her best friend from the group. With all the soldiers returning home after the war, Cron found it hard to get musical work; the men went back to their old jobs. She later worked in insurance, in a bank, and volunteered as a patient escort at abortion clinics, continuing to play in many groups.She taught clarinet and flute extensively and for a period worked at the American Institute of Foreign Trade. Cron joined studio bands in Los Angeles and in 1979 formed an all female, west coast, 17-piece big band with drummer Bonnie Janofsky. Cron went on to perform with the group Maiden Voyage and joined the Kansas City Salute in 1980. However working full time in corporate jobs, whilst running projects, proved to create too much pressure to continue with group leadership. Cron married and raised two sons.The International Sweethearts of Rhythm (1998) D.

Urgenda Foundation (Dutch: De Staat Der Nederlanden v. Stichting Urgenda) was a court case heard by the Supreme Court of the Netherlands in 2019 related to government efforts to curtail carbon dioxide emissions. The case was brought against the Dutch government in 2013, arguing the government, by not meeting a minimum carbon dioxide emission- reduction goal established by scientists to avert harmful climate change, was endangering the human rights of Dutch citizens as set by national and European Union laws. The initial ruling in 2015, requiring the government to meet an emissions goal of 25% reduction from 1990 levels by 2020, was upheld through the Supreme Court on appeals, affirming that reduction in emissions was necessary for the Dutch government to protect human rights. It is the first such tort case taken against a government challenging climate change aspects based on a human rights foundation, and the first such successful climate justice case.  Background  The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its fourth and fifth assessment reports on climate change in 2007 and 2014, respectively. Among other findings, the reports emphasized the need for significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions in the short-term, by 2030. The European Union (EU) established a goal for all member states to achieve a 40% reduction from 1990 levels by 2030, ahead of the 2016 Paris Agreement which established a similar goal worldwide. Each member state, including the Netherlands, was bound to establish its own national-level policies ahead of the Paris agreement to reach this goal. The Netherlands had generally been seen as a leading country in trying to limit climate change as much of the country sits at or below sea level and would be significantly impacted by rising ocean levels. During the 2010s, activists asserted that the government started to favor more traditional fossil fuel industries over renewables, and the country began lagging in its commitment to reducing climate change. The is a climate activist group founded in 2008 representing the interests of 886 Dutch citizens. They had been following the IPCC assessment reports and other climate change reports, as well as the discussion by their attorney, Roger Cox, in his 2010 book Revolution Justified describing potential routes to seek climate change action by governments through climate justice, the idea that human rights are violated by governments' failure to reduce emissions and prevent climate change. Urgenda wrote to the Dutch government urging them to commit to a 40% reduction in carbon dioxide levels by 2020. The letter not only referred to recent reports like the IPCC assessment, but also implored that the Dutch government had a duty to reduce emissions to protect human rights under EU policy. This is the first-known instance of using the EU's human rights laws in seeking government action towards climate change. The government, in reply, stated that this target was too aggressive compared to the planned 30% by 2020 target the EU was striving for at the time, and that the country would only commit to a 40% if all other EU member countries had the same objective.  District Court  Urgenda sued the state in September 2013, arguing the state must commit to a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions of 40% by 2030 or a minimum of 25% by 2020, bound by Dutch and EU law. Urgenda's complaint asserted that the government was responsible for managing all carbon dioxide emissions from the country and it was duty-bound by their laws to reduce the nation's contribution to climate change. The first hearing for the case was held in April 2015 at the District Court at The Hague. The District Court ruled in June 2015 in favor of Urgenda, and required the Netherlands government must achieve 25% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from 1990 levels by 2020. The Court found that prior to 2010, the state had planned to have 30% reductions by 2020, but since 2010, had changed their policy and reduced the goal to 14-17%. While the state had argued that the Netherlands' net contribution of carbon dioxide emissions was not as significant as other major countries, the Court said in its ruling \\"The state should not hide behind the argument that the solution to the global climate problem does not depend solely on Dutch efforts. Any reduction of emissions contributes to the prevention of dangerous climate change and as a developed country the Netherlands should take the lead in this.\\" The ruling asserted that the Dutch government was legally bound to reduce emissions to protect human life, and that the costs associated with a 25% reduction were not unreasonably high. The court did express concern about respecting the legislative process, and set the requirement to 25%, the minimum that IPCC and other reports estimated was possible for developed countries that was necessary to prevent dangerous climate change.  Court of Appeals  The Dutch government appealed the ruling over multiple actions through 2018 to the Court of Appeals at the Hague. The state argued that the District Court's orders exceeded the trias politica, the Dutch's separation of powers, by creating environmental policy through its rulings. In these appeals, Urgenda further stressed the human rights issue, and introduced assertions that the Dutch government was bound by Articles 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to address emissions, which the state refuted. The Court of Appeals ruled in October 2018 upholding the 25% emissions reduction order. The Court of Appeals rejected the state arguments that the order exceeded the separation of powers: the ruling was non-specific and did not specify the legislation of how to achieve the target, and because the matter was related to human rights, including those from the ECHR, the courts had the authority to issue such rulings.  Supreme Court  The state then lodged an appeal to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands. The Supreme Court issued its rejection of the appeal on 20 December 2019 and upholding the 25% reduction requirement. In its ruling, the Supreme Court affirmed that the Dutch government was responsible for management of carbon dioxide emissions for the country and was bound to protect human rights. The ruling reiterated from the Court of Appeals that \\"every country is responsible for its share\\" of emissions.  Impact  = In the Netherlands = As the case was sent to the Supreme Court, the Dutch government began enacting measures to meet the emissions target. Already planning on banning coal power plants by 2030, the government ordered the shutdown of the Hemweg plant in 2020, four years earlier than planned. Starting from discussions in December 2018, the Dutch government passed a new climate plan in June 2019, targeting 49% carbon dioxide emissions reduction by 2030. This plan includes taxes on industries on carbon dioxide emissions, transiting from gas to electric power through incentives, and pay-per-use driving taxes as early as 2025. Even with enacted changes, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency reported in January 2019 that they projected that carbon dioxide emissions reductions would reach between 19 and 26% from 1990 by the end of 2020, leaving the state in need of more steps to assure the target is met. The rulings in the case, while binding the government to meet the 25% reduction, did not specify what actions exist should the government miss that target. A spokesperson for Urgenda stated they did not inquire about penalties for the government failing to make the target, as they \\"consider that there is no reason that the government does not respect the decision of the highest court of justice in the Netherlands\\". = Global = The case, while not the first climate change litigation, was heralded worldwide as the original 2015 ruling against the Netherlands was the first successful tort action against a government to address climate change to protect human rights, an area otherwise known as climate justice. The ruling on the Netherlands case led to similar climate justice lawsuits in other countries, including Belgium, France, Ireland, Germany, New Zealand, Britain, Switzerland and Norway.

It builds upon her essay for O, The Oprah Magazine, \\"The New Midlife Crisis for Women\\". Calhoun interviewed more than 200 women and studied social trends to identify new roadblocks for Generation X women. The book was published on January 7, 2020 by Grove Press. Overview Why We Can't Sleep is a book by Calhoun about Generation X women and their struggles, sometimes leading to a midlife crisis, including divorce, debt, unstable housing, and career development. It builds upon her essay for O, The Oprah Magazine, \\"The New Midlife Crisis for Women\\". Calhoun interviewed more than 200 women across America about their experiences as the generation raised to \\"have it all.\\" She found that many felt exhausted and overwhelmed from financial and housing stress, under or over-working in their careers, caregiving, and parenting. She learned how Generation X women responded and coped with these struggles physically and mentally, incorporating research from the Center for Economic and Policy Research and Harvard University's Equality of Opportunity Project. After the book's release, she expanded on some foundational arguments of the book in online editorials, including caregiving and menopause. Reviews Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New Midlife Crisis has received generally favorable pre-publication reviews. Library Journal said, \\"Her research offers women ways to look at but not devalue their own experiences; she addresses the fact that women often minimize their own struggles instead of recognizing how their lack of sleep, along with other physical and mental pressures, constitute legitimate crises in their own right...\\" Publishers Weekly said, \\"Calhoun persuasively reassures Gen X women that they can find a way out of their midlife crises by 'facing up to our lives as they really are'. Women of every generation will find much to relate to in this humorous yet pragmatic account...\\" Vogue, Real Simple, Parade, New York Times, and O, The Oprah Magazine highlighted Why We Can't Sleep as one of the most anticipated books to read in 2020. Post-publication reviews were mixed. The New York Times Book Review‚Äôs Curtis Sittenfeld called Calhoun \\"a funny, smart, compassionate narrator‚Ä¶taking women‚Äôs concerns seriously\\" but also \\"wished Calhoun had included fewer women‚Äôs stories but gone into those stories in greater detail.\\" The Wall Street Journal's Emily Bobrow gave the book mixed reviews, finding \\"many of its grumbles reassuringly familiar\\" but calling the book \\"a little whiny\\" and stating that Calhoun is \\"not above cherry-picking statistics.\\" The book had a 3.86/5 rating on Goodreads .

Wood (1878 - May 8, 1943) was an American educator and school administrator. Born and educated in Kentucky, Wood achieved his greatest prominence as the Director of Negro Schools for Baltimore City Public Schools, a role that he held for 18 years, from 1925 until his death. Beyond his role with Baltimore schools, Wood was an active leader in several state and nationwide educational and civil rights organizations. At the time of his death, Wood was recognized as a \\"nationally-known Negro educator.\\" Education and Early Career Wood was born in Glasgow, Kentucky. He was a graduate of Glasgow High School and the State Normal School (now Kentucky State University) in Frankfort, Kentucky. He received diplomas from both the agricultural and academic departments. He received his Master of Arts degree at Eckstein Norton University in Cane Spring, Kentucky in 1906. Wood began his career with a variety of different positions in Kentucky education. Wood first worked as a teacher in a one-room log schoolhouse, and continued teaching in rural Kentucky schools from 1896 to 1899. Wood next taught at Kentucky's State Normal School from 1901 to 1907. He then served as a principal of black elementary and high schools in Kentucky for the next three years. This was followed by a promotion to serve as the State Supervisor of black high schools and rural schools in the state in 1922 and 1923. Wood then served as the President of the Colored State Normal School at Frankfort in 1924. During his tenure, Wood was also the president of Kentucky Negro Teachers' Association, and a member of the Kentucky Commission on Interracial Cooperation. Later in 1924, Wood was also the Rockefeller Foundation student at the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute (now Hampton University) in Hampton, Virginia. Work for Baltimore City Schools Arguing that he was \\"untrammeled by local prejudice,\\" Baltimore City Schools hired Wood from outside the state to serve as their Supervisor of Colored Schools beginning August 1st 1925, with a salary of $4,200 (). In 1927, Wood was reclassified as \\"Director of Negro Schools,\\" with a commensurate salary increase. At this time, he moved his offices into the new location of the black teacher training school, Coppin Normal School, (now Coppin State University) when it relocated to Lafayette Avenue and McCulloh Streets. In 1928, Wood was briefly investigated by the School Board due to allegations he was being financially influenced by a local black leader, Tom Smith, but the two men were exonerated. According to newspaper reports however, this investigation did reveal that Dr. Wood was \\"regarded as an outsider\\" by some city residents, who sought his removal in favor of a black educator born in the city. During his tenure, black enrollment in Baltimore City schools nearly doubled. Wood advocated for additional school facilities to support that greater enrollment. Wood oversaw the dedications of major black schools in Baltimore including Samuel Coleridge Taylor Elementary and an expanded campus for Frederick Douglas High School. Wood was also responsible for selecting names for many of the city's black schools, which had heretofore been identified only by their school number. He selected namesakes (both white and black) who had positively impacted the black community, including Harriet Tubman, Wendell Phillips, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Harvey Johnson and Frances Harper. Despite his prestige and length of service in the city, a 1941 article in the Baltimore Sun described how, when the school board met, Wood, who was considered of lower rank, was required to be seated in the rear of the room, separate from the other school executives. The next year, citing both \\"the justice of the request\\" and Wood's \\"excellent service\\" to the city's schools, the executive secretary of the city's Public School Association, Marie Bauernschmidt put forward the proposal that Wood be promoted to the equal status of assistant superintendent. These requests for Wood's promotion were however \\"consistently refused\\" by the city's all-white school board. Other Activities In 1929, Wood assisted in the organization of the \\"first Negro symphony in the United States,\\" which was formed and put on its first concert in Baltimore. Wood received an honorary doctorate in pedagogy from Morgan State College in 1931. In 1933, Wood was elected president of the National Association of Teachers in Colored Schools. In response to a 1934 lynching in Somerset County, Maryland, Wood worked with the Urban League and other black leaders in Baltimore to draft a resolution calling on Governor Albert Ritchie to pass an anti-lynching statute. Later in the same year, Wood was selected by the new Republican Governor-elect Harry Nice to serve on the Maryland Commission of Higher Education of Negroes, which was tasked to determine whether the HBCU Morgan College should be taken over by the State of Maryland. The commission released its report five years later, in 1939, recommending that the state purchase Morgan. Wood was also a member of the commission's subcommittee on awards, which was charged with awarding scholarships to colleges and universities for black students. Governor Nice would also later appoint to Wood on the State Highway Safety Group. In 1939, Wood served as one faculty member for the Baltimore Police Training School, a free program which sought to prepare black candidates for the Baltimore City Police entrance examinations. During World War II, Wood supported the American war effort against Japan and Germany, and advised his fellow black Americans not to \\"unduly press for advantages\\" during wartime. Death and Legacy In May 1943, Wood was hospitalized for a heart condition, aggravated by a recent flu. He died several weeks later at Johns Hopkins Hospital, on the night of May 8th. His funeral services were held at Union Baptist Church in Baltimore. The funeral service was attended by about 650 people, and was accompanied by a five-minute period of silence at all city schools, with flags flown at half- mast. Following his death, Wood was succeeded as Director of Colored Schools by Elmer A. Henderson, then the principal of Booker T. Washington Junior High School. While Wood had been unable to achieve an equal title of assistant superintendent during his life, his successor Henderson finally was granted that position in 1945. \\"Camp Francis M. Wood\\" was a summer camp for Baltimore City youth from low income families which existed along Bunker Hill Road in Baltimore County into the 1950s. Initially, the site was a camp operated by a private group headed by Wood himself, but it was purchased by Baltimore City Department of Public Welfare after his death and reopened in his honor. Several different schools in Baltimore have borne Wood's name. Immediately following his death, the \\"Francis M. Wood School for colored handicapped children\\" was founded. The present-day Excel Academy at Francis M. Wood High School, an Alternative High School is the most recent iteration.

It was carried out by Nazi Germany, which was occupying the country, with some collaboration by the Czech collaborationist government. Background  Interior of the Olomouc Synagogue, burned on 16 March 1939 Before 1918, Bohemia and Moravia were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In the nineteenth century, the Czech National Revival agitated for autonomy for the Czech-speaking majority. Following World War I, the Czech lands (including the border Sudetenland, which had a German majority) became part of the new country of Czechoslovakia. During the 1890s, most Jews were German-speaking and considered themselves Germans. By the 1930s, German-speaking Jews had been numerically overtaken by assimilated Jews speaking Czech; Zionism also made inroads among the Jews of the periphery (Moravia and the Sudetenland). In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, thousands of Jews came to Prague from small villages and towns in Bohemia, leading to the urbanization of Bohemian Jewish society. Of the 10 million inhabitants of pre-1938 Bohemia and Moravia, Jews composed only about 1% (117,551). Most Jews lived in large cities such as Prague (35,403 Jews, who made up 4.2% of the population), Brno (11,103, 4.2%), and Moravsk√° Ostrava (6,865, 5.5%). Antisemitism in the Czech lands was lower than elsewhere and strongly opposed by the national founder and first president, Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk (1850‚Äì1937), while secularism among both Jews and non-Jews facilitated integration. Nevertheless, there had been isolated cases of anti-Jewish rioting during the birth of the Czechslovak republic in 1918 and 1920. Following a steep decline in religious observance in the nineteenth century, most Bohemian Jews were indifferent to religion, although this was less true in Moravia. The Jews of Bohemia had the highest rate of intermarriage in Europe; 43.8% married out of the faith compared to 30% in Moravia. The high rate of integation‚ÄîCzech Jews were the most integrated community in Europe‚Äîled to difficulties identifying Czech Jews for their later deportation and murder. During the mid-1930s, Czechoslovakia accepted thousands of German (and Austrian, after the Anschluss) Jews fleeing persecution, although right-wing politics eventually led to immigration restrictions and an end to racial persecution as a reason for seeking asylum. Some ten thousand Austrian refugees were refused entry in 1938, and Polish Jews deported from Austria were shuttled to the Polish border. Since the mid-1930s, antisemitism was on the rise in Czechoslovakia. Some newspapers began to praise Der St√ºrmer. The right-wing government of the Second Czechoslovak Republic was increasingly under pressure from Germans‚Äîboth its own German citizens and the external Nazi regime‚Äîand coped through accommodation. Most of the 28,000 Jews living in the Sudeten areas annexed to Germany were expelled or fled into Czechoslovakia following Munich and . The authorities tried to prevent them from crossing the border even though the Munich Agreement gave Sudeten Jews the option to retain their Czechoslovak citizenship. Some of the refugees had to wait for days in no-man's land. In January 1939, Jews who had immigrated to Czechoslovakia after 1914 (including naturalized citizens) were ordered to be deported from the country. Fourteen thousand eventually left, saving their lives. Meanwhile, Jews were excluded from Czech professional associations, state hospitals dismissed Jewish doctors, and Jewish army officers were put on leave. German professional and educational institutions dismissed Jewish teachers and lecturers, while German newspapers laid off their Jewish reporters. According to historian Wolf Gruner, the Second Republic's persecution of Jews \\"were independent developments influenced by radical Czech circles, and had little to do with any direct pressure imposed by Hitler\\". German occupation German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938 and 1939 In September 1938, the Munich Agreement resulted in the annexation of the Sudetenland to Nazi Germany. Germany expelled Jews from the newly annexed territory, causing a surge in Jewish refugees and contributing to a rise in antisemitism. By December 1938, 15,186 Jewish refugees (including those expelled from the Sudetenland) were living in the remaining Czech territory. On 14 March 1939, the Slovak State declared independence with German support. Carrying out plans made since October 1938, Germany invaded the Czech rump state, establishing the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. This nominally autonomous protectorate was partially annexed into Nazi Germany. In the Protectorate, ethnic Germans were granted Reich citizenship and were accountable only to German authorities. Czechs and Jews were counted as Protectorate subjects, a second-class status, and were governed by the Czech puppet administration (in practice, under the control of the Reich Protector). The Czech administration operated under Prime Minister Alois Eli√°≈° (from April) and President Emil H√°cha, both of whom were conservative Catholics who approved anti-Jewish measures while retaining contact with the Czechoslovak government-in-exile. However, its justice minister, Jaroslav Krejƒç√≠, was known for his pro-Nazi sentiments. In March, H√°cha formed the National Partnership, a political organization to which 98.5% of the adult male Protectorate citizens would belong (women and Jews were forbidden from joining). The German administration was controlled by Konstantin von Neurath, former foreign minister of Germany, and Karl Hermann Frank, formerly the Deputy Chairman of the Sudeten German Party. At the time of the annexation, there were at least 118,310 Jews living in 136 recognized communities in the Protectorate. Persecution of Jews The gradual persecution of Jews created a \\"ghetto without walls\\", in the words of Czech historian Miroslav K√°rn√Ω, and created the conditions which enabled their deportation and murder later on. =Initial measures= During the annexation, anti-Jewish riots occurred in a number of locations. In Olomouc, Vset√≠n, and Ostrava, synagogues were burned by German and Czech rioters. In Iglau (Jihlava) Jews were prohibited from riding streetcars and forced to clear snow from the streets. Prague Jewish organizations were shut down or taken over by the Gestapo, which also arrested thousands of left-wing activists and German refugees. More than a thousand were deported to concentration camps in the Reich; most of these were Jews. The Czech government largely remained in place and had considerable autonomy. In the Protectorate, anti-Jewish persecutions were carried out by several agencies, including the Office of the Reich Protector, the Gestapo, and the Czech government. The Eli√°≈° government drafted the first ordinance on anti-Jewish legislation, which would have defined a \\"Jew\\" as someone with four Jewish grandparents who had belonged to a Jewish community after 1918. Jews would be barred from working in public agencies, corporations, schools, administrations, courts, stock exchanges, the arts, and medicine. However, the Reich Protector's office dismissed the proposal as too mild in its definition of \\"Jew\\", and therefore issued its own resolution on 21 June. Part of the Czech government's calculation in arguing for a stricter definition of \\"Jew\\" was to reduce the amont of Jewish property that would be transferred to Germans as a result of Aryanization. A second wave of synagogues‚Äîin Brno, Olomouc, Uhersk√Ω Brod, Chlumec, N√°chod, Pardubice, and Ostrava‚Äîwere burned in May and June. =Emigration= A passport used by a Jew to escape Prague on the last train before the German invasion The growing poverty among Jews caused by the measures against them prevented their emigration, which was banned by the Security Service in May 1939. Therefore, the initial plan was not to create a Central Office for Jewish Emigration in Prague, as there was for Austria. The office was set up later on 15 July for the purpose of leveraging the property of Czech Jews to help the emigration of German Jews, and initially only controlled Prague and its surroundings. Another office was considered for Brno. German historian Wolf Gruner estimates that before October 1941, 25,000 Jews managed to emigrate from Bohemia and Moravia. Benjamin Frommer's estimate is that 14,000 Jews left before the Nazi invasion in 1939, and 30,000 legally left the country afterwards. Some of these were killed in countries that were later occupied by Germany. An unknown number (considered much smaller) fled illegally to Poland in 1939 or to Axis- aligned Slovakia and Hungary. Jewish emigration was banned throughout the Reich on 16 October 1941. =Nisko Plan= Stolperstein for Zikmund Slatner, deported from Ostrava to Nisko. The outbreak of World War II with the September 1939 invasion of Poland dramatically changed the situation of Czech Jews. The Nisko Plan was a scheme developed shortly after the September Campaign to concentrate Jews in the Lublin District, at the time the most remote area of German-occupied Europe and adjacent to the partition line with the Soviet Union. SS leaders were planning to deport destitute 300,000 Jews from the Reich, including 70,000 to 80,000 from the Kattowitz area (annexed from Poland) and the Moravsk√° Ostrava region in the Protectorate. For this purpose, a census was carried out which found that there were 90,147 Jews residing in the Protectorate as of 1 October 1939, 28,000 fewer than in March. On 18 October 1939, 901 men were deported from Ostrava to Nisko, in Poland. Border police and SS personnel accompanied the transport, and Adolf Eichmann personally met it in Nisko. The second transport carried 400 Jewish men from Ostrava and was accompanied by protests by local Czechs. The third took 300 men from Prague on 1 November, and was also protested by Czechs. It was turned around in Sosnowiec when the Nisko Plan was cancelled by SS chief Heinrich Himmler, because it conflicted with the higher-priority goal of resettling in the Warthegau and West Prussia. Transports were expected to resume in early 1940, but Reinhard Heydrich postponed them on 19 February in favor of deporting Polish Jews from the annexed areas. In April 1940, the camp was dissolved and the 501 remaining prisoners, from Austria and the Protectorate, allowed to return home. =Aryanization= Hermann G√∂ring ordered that all Aryanization in the Protectorate take place with the approval of the Reich Ministry of the Economy, to avoid chaotic property transfers as had taken place in Vienna after the Anschluss. As a result, Jews were forbidden to sell companies and real estate. About 30,000 Jewish-owned businesses existed in the Protectorate, and Czechs and Germans fought over who would have the right to take them over. The Germans were favored and Aryanization was even extended to businesses owned by Czechs, leading H√°cha to complain of \\"Germanization under the cloak of Aryanization\\". On 25 March, the Reich Interior Ministry decided to delegate \\"whether and what measures it undertakes against the Jews\\" to the Protectorate government. In the following weeks, professional associations of merchants, lawyers, and physicians took advantage of the antisemitic mood to expel their Jewish members. By June, the umbrella Jewish organization reported that many middle-class Jews had lost their jobs. The Jewish Social Institute, a social welfare organization, was allowed to reopen on 6 April and provided relief to many unemployed Jews as well as refugees. By the summer of 1939 Jews were banned from any job except manual labor. At the time, 25,458 men and 24,028 women were of working age (18‚Äì45 years). On 10 August, they were banned by order of the Reich Protector from all voting rights and public office, all positions involving the media and public opinion, and all Czech associations. On 23 October, another order from the Reich Protector barred Jews from salaried employment. Further employment regulations were announced on 26 January 1940, with the result that Jews were banned from all management positions among other provisions. Increasing numbers of Jews were without employment or income. Jews were required to register their business assets on 7 February and personal property on 16 March. The next two measures came from the Czech government: on 19 March Jews were excluded from the unemployment system and had to register at labor offices to receive unemployment assistance. Instead, they were recruited into locally organized forced labor, such as burning trash. On 24 April they were barred from working in law, education, pharmacies, medicine, or publishing. =Restrictions on civil rights= Jews wearing yellow badges in Prague, c. 1942 In January 1940, the remit of the Prague Central Office was extended to the entire Protectorate, and in March it obtained control of all Jewish communities, to which everyone classified as Jews according to the Nuremberg Laws were ordered to report even if they were not members of the Jewish community. Jews' freedom of movement was restricted with a curfew imposed after 20:00, and they were barred from visiting cinemas and theaters by the H√°cha government. Protectorate identification cards for Jews were stamped with the red letter \\"J\\". Jews were also restricted from shopping except a few hours of the day in mid-1940, and barred from schools on 7 August‚Äîboth actions taken by the Czech government. Throughout 1940, the Reich Protector received many petitions to require Jews to wear special markings such as a yellow star or armband, including from the National Aryan Cultural Association, a Czech antisemitic association. However, even though Jews were marked in the former Polish regions annexed into Nazi Germany, this was not approved for Bohemia and Moravia. In late 1940, Jewish-owned housing was registered in Prague and Brno, by the Central Office. By early the next year, Jews were being concentrated into \\"\\" (). =Forced labor= Jewish forced laborers in Krak√≥w, 1939 Plans for the employment of the Protectorate's Jews in forced labor in the event of war were drawn up before the occupation of the territory, in February 1939. It was expected to employ Jews in road-building and quarries, although what agency would be responsible was not decided. However, in mid-1940, despite the increasing unemployment among Jews, the central authorities did not introduce any generalized forced labor program. Instead, municipalities took the initiative and developed a forced labor program similar to that in Germany and Austria, but organized locally. In early July 1940, the town of Hole≈°ov requested premission to conscript its Jews into forced labor. A report in Neuer Tag magazine encouraged other localities to follow this practice. By July, 60% of Jewish men in the Protectorate were employed in forced labor projects and the remainder in independent employment that had not yet been barred to them. Unlike in Germany and Austria, Jews were not segregated from Czechs in forced labor because both were considered equally inferior. Forced labor deployments peaked in May 1942, at which point 15,000 men and 1,000 women were deployed. The numbers declined thereafter due to deportations to Theresienstadt Ghetto. At least 39 subcamps were located in the Protectorate. Tens of thousands of Jews and non-Jews were employed there, including many Polish and Hungarian Jews who had been deported there. =Czech population= Many Czechs did not comply with the National Partnership's order that forbade Czechs from associating with Jews. These acts of defiance, as well as the public protests against deportation of the Jews in fall 1939, was closely related to their opposition to the German occupation. The Security Service reported that during 1941, \\"the Czech attitude towards the Jews became a serious problem for the occupation authorities\\". A minority of Czechs took part in the persecution of Jews. The Czech fascist newspapers Vlajka and Arijsk√Ω boj (\\"Aryan Struggle\\") were noted for their antisemitic invective and publishing denunciations of Jews and \\"Jew-lovers\\". Frommer has argued that these newspapers made it easier for ordinary Czechs to denounce their neighbors, by providing an alternative to the Nazi authorities. However, historian Jan L√°n√≠ƒçek argues that \\"the crude Czech anti-Semitic circles who actively collaborated with the Nazi authorities did not receive significant overt support among ordinary Czechs\\". Final Solution =Direct transports= In the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto, Jews from Austria, Germany, and Prague are rounded up for deportation to Kulmhof extermination camp, May 1942 On 16 or 17 September 1941, Hitler approved a proposal to deport 60,000 Jews from the Reich and the Protectorate to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto, in the Warthegau. Due to overcrowding in the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto, and partly to make space for the new arrivals, Kulmhof extermination camp was opened in fall 1941. Twenty thousand Jews were eventually deported. Five transports with five thousand Jews departed from Prague on 16, 21, 26 and 30 October and 3 November, arriving in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ the next day. One transport, on 16 November, took Jews from Brno to Minsk. Unlike later transports, the passenger list had been drawn up by the Gestapo. Most of the deportees to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ were elderly, and by April 1942 sixteen percent had already died. That month, Heinrich Himmler ordered the murder of 10,000 of the remaining Austrian, German, and Czech deportees: between 4 and 15 May, 10,993 Jews were deported in Kulmhof. Only 277 of the Czech deportees survived the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto and subsequent deportations to extermination camps. =Theresienstadt Ghetto= Caricature of Theresienstadt living quarters by Bed≈ôich Fritta Deportation to Theresienstadt Ghetto, near the border between the Protectorate and Sudetenland, began in November 1941 with a transport of 350 men from Prague. The next month, more than 7000 people were deported to Theresienstadt, from Prague, Pilsen, Brno, and other places. From the outset, Theresienstadt was designated as a transit ghetto. The first transport left for Riga on 9 January 1942. =Remaining Jews= Identity card of a Jew who has gone into hiding By the end of 1942, only 15,530 Jews remained in the Protectorate, 13% of the 1939 population. In June 1943, 4,000 Jewish Council employees and their families were sent to Theresienstadt in the last large deportation. By the end of 1944, only 6,795 Jews lived in the Protectorate, most of them in mixed marriages. Some of them were deported in early 1945 after the mixed marriage exception was cancelled. The number of Jews who survived in hiding is unknown. H. G. Adler estimated it at 424, but Livia Rothkirchen and Miroslav K√°rn√Ω argued that incidents of hiding and rescue was significantly higher. According to Frommer, the limited evidence that exists suggests that hiding was relatively rare in the Protectorate. Aftermath Two to three thousand Jews who had identified themselves as Germans on prewar censuses could not regain their Czechoslovak citizenship and were to be expelled along with ethnic Germans. This group included some veterans of the Czechoslovak forces in exile. In addition, ordinary Czechs often did not distinguish between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" Germans and subjected them to the same extrajudicial measures, including physical attacks. Due to discrimination, thousands of Jews applied to leave the country voluntarily. The deportation of Jews was abruptly halted in September 1946 due to media outrage and objections from the military governor of the American occupation zone of Germany. However, the situation was so bad that by 1947 many of the Jews wished that they had been deported. In the 1952 Sl√°nsk√Ω trial, fourteen Communists (eleven Jewish‚Äîincluding Holocaust survivors) were accused of belonging to a Zionist conspiracy. Eleven of them were executed. , about 3,900 Jews live in the Czech Republic. Legacy  , a memorial at Praha‚ÄìBubny railway station commemorating the deportation of Jews After the 1989 Velvet Revolution which resulted in the fall of the Communist regime, scholarly interest in the Holocaust greatly increased, which many academic theses relating to the Holocaust being published. The interest peaked around 2000 and has declined since. The Czech Republic is one of the only countries to have a government office dedicated to post-Holocaust issues. Ji≈ô√≠ Weil and Arno≈°t Lustig, both Holocaust survivors, became known for their literature on the event.
